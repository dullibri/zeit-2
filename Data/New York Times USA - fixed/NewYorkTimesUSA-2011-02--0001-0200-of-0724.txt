HEADLINE: The Quest For Dignity

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
I wonder if sometime around 50 years ago a great mental tide began to sweep across the world. Before the tide, people saw themselves in certain fixed places in the social order. They accepted opinions from trusted authorities.
As the tide swept through, they began to see themselves differently. They felt they should express their own views, and these views deserved respect. They mentally bumped themselves up to first class and had a different set of expectations of how they should be treated. Treatment that had once seemed normal now felt like an insult. They began to march for responsive government and democracy.
I've covered some of these marches over the years in places like Russia, Ukraine and South Africa. While there are vast differences between nations, the marchers tend to echo certain themes -- themes we are hearing once again in the interviews that reporters are doing in Cairo. 
Protesters invariably say that their government has insulted their dignity by ignoring their views. They have a certain template of what a ''normal'' country looks like -- with democracy and openness -- and they feel humiliated that their nation doesn't measure up.
Moreover, the protesters tend to feel enormous pride that they are finally speaking up, even in the face of danger. They feel a surge of patriotism as the people of their country make themselves heard.
This quest for dignity has produced a remarkable democratic wave. More than 100 nations have seen democratic uprisings over the past few decades. More than 85 authoritarian governments have fallen. Somewhere around 62 countries have become democracies, loosely defined.
The experiences of these years teach us a few lessons. First, the foreign policy realists who say they tolerate authoritarian government for the sake of stability are ill informed. Autocracies are more fragile than any other form of government, by far.
Second, those who say that speeches by outsiders have no influence on places like Egypt have it backward. The climate of opinion is the very basis of the revolt.
Third, for all the pessimism and nervousness that accompanies change, most countries that have experienced uprisings end up better off. We can all think of exceptions, like Iran, but we should greet these events with eagerness and hope.
Fourth, while the public hunger for dignity is unabated, the road from authoritarianism to democracy is rocky and perilous. Over the past few years, the world has experienced a ''freedom recession'' with more governments retreating from democracy than advancing toward it. For outside powers, the real work comes after the revolution -- in helping democrats build governments that work.
The other thing we've learned is that the United States usually gets everything wrong. There have been dozens of democratic uprisings over the years, but the government always reacts like it's the first one. There seem to be no protocols for these situations, no preset questions to be asked.
Policy makers always underestimate the power of the bottom-up quest for dignity, so they are slow to understand what is happening. Last week, for example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the Egyptian regime was stable, just as it was falling apart.
Then their instinct is to comfort the fellow members of the club of those in power. The Obama administration was very solicitous of President Hosni Mubarak during the first days of the protests and of other dictators who fear their regime may be next.
Then, desperately recalibrating in an effort to keep up with events, they inevitably make a series of subtle distinctions no one else heeds. The Obama administration ended up absurdly calling on Mubarak to initiate a reform agenda. Surely there's not a single person in the government who thinks he is actually capable of doing this. Meanwhile, the marchers heard this fudge as Obama supporting Mubarak and were outraged.
The Obama administration's reaction was tardy, but no worse than, say, the first Bush administration's reaction to the uprisings in the Baltics and Ukraine. The point is, there's no need to be continually wrong-footed. If you start with a healthy respect for the quest for dignity, if you see autocracies as fragile and democratic revolts as opportunities, then you'll find it much easier to anticipate events.
The Working Group on Egypt, co-led by Michele Dunne and Robert Kagan, has outperformed the U.S. government by miles. For months, they've been warning of Mubarak's fragility. As the protests started, they issued a smart and concrete set of policy recommendations.
Over the past decades, there has been a tide in the affairs of men and women. People in many places have risked their lives for recognition and respect. Governments may lag, and complications will arise, but still they will march. And, in the long run, we should be glad they do.

HEADLINE: Attracting Global Talent

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Today's great challenges are global ones. The countries that can successfully leverage the world's talent in meeting them will enjoy economic growth and competitiveness, and will also be leaders in making our world a better place. 
The United States should, as David Brooks puts it (''The Talent Magnet,'' column, Jan. 25), seek to be one of the ''creative hot spots'' where great minds can engage in solving big problems together.
Mr. Brooks rightly notes that government's most important role is to articulate a vision and to create a climate in which ''brilliance can happen.'' This means that sooner or later, we will have to face and finally address the reform of our immigration system.
For a long time smart, talented people would come here no matter how many roadblocks we placed in their way. That era is long over.

HEADLINE: Out of Camelot, Knights in White Coats Lose Way

BYLINE: By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.. 
Dr. Sandeep Jauhar is a cardiologist and the author of ''Intern: A Doctor's Initiation.''

 BODY:
When I look at my career at midlife, I realize that in many ways I've become the kind of doctor I never thought I'd be: often impatient, at times indifferent or paternalistic.
Of course, the loss of one's ideals is a crucial component of the midlife phase, often leading to depression, nostalgia and regret: the proverbial midlife crisis. And it occurs to me that my profession is in a sort of midlife crisis of its own.
The modern era of medicine began a little less than 40 years ago, with the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, which ushered in the age of managed care. Managed care was supposed to save American medicine by stemming the rise in spending initiated by Medicare. It failed to do that. Instead, it did away with the kind of medicine that made people want to be doctors in the first place. 
In the last four decades, doctors have lost the special status they used to enjoy.
Physicians used to be the pillars of any community. If you were smart and sincere and ambitious, the top of your class, there was nothing nobler you could aspire to become. Doctors possessed special knowledge. They were caring and smart, the best kind of people you could know.
Today, medicine is just another profession, and doctors have become like everybody else: insecure, discontented and anxious about the future.
But while doctors often blame managed care for their situation, managed care didn't create this crisis. It originated from the abandonment of ideals that made managed care necessary in the first place.
In a recent essay in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Sachin H. Jain and Dr. Christine K. Cassel discuss the conception of physicians as ''knights'' or ''knaves'' (an idea developed by the economist Julian Le Grand in his study of British civil servants).
Knights, they wrote, practice medicine to save and improve lives. The best thing government can do is to get out of their way and let them do their jobs. Knaves, on the other hand, put their financial well-being before their patients, often ordering tests and studies for personal gain. Government needs to guard against their malfeasance.
The history of American medicine over the past half-century can be interpreted through this framework of changing perceptions. In the mid-20th century, physicians were among the most highly admired professionals, comparable with Supreme Court justices. It was a period when life expectancy increased sharply (to 71 years in 1970 from 65 in 1940), aided by such triumphs of medical science as polio vaccination, penicillin and heart-lung bypass. Depictions of physicians on television were overwhelmingly positive. Doctors were able to trade on this cultural perception for an unusual degree of privilege and influence.
Organized medicine used this influence to try to defeat nationalized health insurance plans like Medicare, seeing them as an attempt to undermine income and autonomy. Doctors were content with the status quo. They could regulate fees based on a patient's ability to pay and look like benefactors. They viewed Medicare as the end to medicine as they knew it. It turned out that they were right, but not in the way they imagined.
After Medicare was created in 1965, doctors' salaries actually increased, as demand for physicians' services skyrocketed. In 1940, in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars, the mean income for American physicians was about $50,000. By 1970, it was nearly $250,000, nearly nine times the per-capita gross national product. (It has dropped since then, to about six times per-capita G.N.P.)
But as doctors profited, they were increasingly perceived as knaves, bilking the system. ''It was a free-for-all,'' a senior physician at my hospital who worked through that era told me recently. Doctors, he said, were helping each other game the system; the operative phrase was ''I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.''
''Before Medicare,'' he went on, ''doctors were not so focused on making money. Professional attainment still meant something. But if you call attention to this you are considered a ... .'' He struggled for the right word.
''Troublemaker?'' I offered.
''Yes, a bad apple. There are so many unnecessary procedures. But all these doctors are board-certified. Who am I to tell them what to do?''
The transition from knighthood to knavery had major consequences. In 1973, fewer than 15 percent of several thousand practicing physicians reported any doubts that they had made the right career choice. In 1981, 48 percent of office-based doctors said they would not recommend the practice of medicine as highly as they would have 10 years earlier.
In 2001, 58 percent of about 2,600 physicians questioned said their enthusiasm for medicine had gone down in the previous five years, and 87 percent said the overall morale of physicians had declined during that time. And nearly half of 12,000 physicians questioned recently said they planned to reduce the number of patients they would see in the next three years or stop practicing altogether. Three-quarters said medicine is either no longer rewarding or less rewarding.
This growing discontent has serious consequences. One is a looming shortage of doctors, especially in primary care. Try getting a timely appointment with your family doctor. In some parts of the country, it is next to impossible. A report published in November 2009 by the Association of American Medical Colleges projected a shortage of as many as 150,000 physicians by 2025.
But perhaps the most serious downside is that unhappy doctors make for unhappy patients. Patients today are increasingly disenchanted with a medical system that is often indifferent to their needs. There has always been a divide between patients and doctors, given the disparities inherent in the relationship, but this chasm is widening because of time constraints, malpractice fears, decreasing income and other stresses that have sapped the motivation of doctors to connect with their patients.
Of course, doctors are not the only professionals who are unhappy today. But as the sociologist Paul Starr writes, for most of the 20th century medicine was ''the heroic exception that sustained the waning tradition of independent professionalism.'' It is an exception whose time has expired.
Abandoning core professional ideals, and the resultant change in perception and policy, has taken a bigger toll on the profession than doctors could have imagined in that midcentury golden age. Sadly, those once heroic knights have only themselves to blame.

HEADLINE: State Prisons and Medicaid to Face Cuts in Cuomo Budget

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will seek to cut more than 3,000 prison beds, roll back scheduled spending increases on Medicaid and education by billions of dollars and make steep reductions to state operations, a move likely to lead to the loss of thousands of state jobs, according to people briefed on the budget he will unveil on Tuesday.
On Monday, Mr. Cuomo also said there would need to be fundamental changes to automatic spending increases that have long been programmed into future budgets, making it more difficult for governors to reduce spending in recent years despite shrinking revenues. 
Mr. Cuomo went so far as to call the state's budget process ''a sham'' in a draft opinion article circulated on Monday, comparing it to ''deceptive practices I fought to change in the private sector'' as New York's attorney general.
Many legislative staff members, advocates and budget experts in Albany, speaking publicly and privately, accused the governor of either lacking a basic understanding of how states across the country put budgets together, or, more likely from their perspective, deliberately muddying the water ahead of the formal presentation of his first budget.
But part of his political calculation seemed clear. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, wants the public to know that much of what he is likely to cut are actually planned spending increases aimed at maintaining current services as defined by law, not cuts to existing spending levels. And he appeared to be setting the stage for a prolonged struggle with the Legislature and health and education advocates and other interest groups over a reorganization of state government that he believed to be overdue.
''The annual budgets are basically bandages,'' Mr. Cuomo said Monday at an appearance in the Capitol. ''And the wound remains. The wound is a state government that spends too much money, and has for too long with too little performance for the taxpayer; that is causing businesses to leave the state.''
''What we have to do,'' he added, ''is stop those programs from running on automatic pilot, year after year after year.''
Legislative leaders appeared to take a modest degree of umbrage. The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican of Long Island, said, ''There are certain formulas that can be changed, and they are every year,'' adding, ''I wouldn't exactly call it a scam.''
Speaking to a group of reporters, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan, said, ''I do want to remind you there are new schoolchildren in our schools, there are new people enrolling in Medicaid in an economic downturn,'' adding, ''all of which has driven projections of what spending should be that are real and defined and not made up.''
This year's budget will be a grim one. Mr. Cuomo is planning a consolidation of the state's sprawling correctional system, with plans to cut more than 3,000 of the roughly 64,000 adult prison beds, the largest proposed single reduction in over a decade.
But instead of designating specific prisons for closing in his budget -- a move that would harden opposition to his budget, perhaps implacably, among lawmakers whose districts are home to the facilities -- Mr. Cuomo will appoint a task force of lawmakers and prison officials to come up with a consolidation plan after the budget is passed, people briefed on the plan said.
Donn Rowe, the president of the state correction officers' union, expressed dismay over the proposal, saying, ''The closure of any additional facilities could pose a clear and present danger to the public.''
Mr. Cuomo's plans for the state's troubled juvenile prison system are also ambitious. He will seek to cut 300 to 400 beds, representing more than one-third of the roughly 1,000 beds at the youth prisons. Many of those beds have been left vacant as officials have shifted youthful offenders from upstate facilities to community-based programs closer to their homes.
Cuts to Medicaid are expected to be from $2 billion to $3 billion, large enough not only to wipe out the planned growth in spending but also to bring spending below levels in the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31.
''I'm as concerned as I've been in the 25 years that I've been here,'' said Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which advocates on behalf of hospitals and health systems.
Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an education advocacy group, said, ''We're very nervous,'' adding, ''every indication the governor has given would lead us to believe we'll see huge cuts to teachers and guidance counselors and librarians as a result of his budget proposal.''
Mr. Cuomo will also seek a cut in state operations of roughly 10 percent, a move that would require reductions of as many as 15,000 jobs, through layoffs, attrition or early retirement incentives, unless other savings can be found. In his draft opinion article, the governor criticized the fact that spending increases for specific programs, particularly for Medicaid and education, had been passed into law by previous governors and lawmakers. Such formulas include so-called trend factors that increase reimbursements to hospitals over time, which are politically difficult for governors to negotiate out of law after they are approved.
''When a governor takes office, in many ways the die has already been cast,'' he wrote.
James Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research and advocacy organization, said: ''The governor should try to find people who can read the reports of the Division of the Budget. This is the sort of bewilderment one would have expected from his November opponent.''
Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group, likened the governor's comments to the French policeman in the film ''Casablanca'' expressing shock that gambling was going on. But he was also supportive of the governor's ultimate message.
''It's smart for Cuomo to preframe the budget package this way,'' he wrote on his blog. ''It also logically implies he might be open to a really fundamental reform: zero-based budgeting, in which every dollar of spending is justified anew every year.''

HEADLINE: Bumbling in the Morgue: Blind, Drunk or Merely Incompetent Coroners

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Let's imagine that an intruder entered your home one night and fatally poisoned you. Let's say that during the previous weeks or months you had evinced signs of emotional volatility. Perhaps you were even depressed. Let's go further and presume that you lived in one of the many places in America experiencing state and municipal budget crises. The police suspect suicide, but because the coroner's office is underfinanced and understaffed -- maybe there isn't even a place to refrigerate your body until someone can get around to dissecting your corpse -- no autopsy is performed to confirm or invalidate those suspicions. A murderer is free and on to the next house and victim.
''Post Mortem,'' a documentary on PBS on Tuesday, compellingly demonstrates just how often a situation like this one actually occurs. A joint production of ''Frontline,'' ProPublica and NPR, the film illuminates the egregious lapses in the American system of death investigation by highlighting the widespread incompetence of poorly trained coroners and the failure of local governments to pay sufficient attention to the need for sound forensic pathology. 
If its own DNA had any less gravitas, ''Post Mortem'' might have been called ''CSI: Miami -- What a Big Bunch of Hooey.'' Apparently autopsies are performed with far more precision and rigor on fictionalized television than they are in the real world, where some medical examiners aren't even doctors. The film introduces us to the bizarre obfuscations of Frank Minyard, who has served for more than 30 years as coroner in New Orleans, where he has been elected to the position 10 times. Before becoming the medical examiner he had been an obstetrician, and during his tenure he has overseen a team whose work has repeatedly come under question for gross inaccuracy.
Coroners elsewhere have been blind or drunk, limited to a single refrigerator held together by a belt, or forced to perform their duties without X-ray machines. As Vincent Di Maio, the retired chief medical examiner of Virginia and the inspiration for Patricia Cornwell's character Kay Scarpetta puts it, the work done by forensic pathologists in this country ''varies from excellent to really, really lousy.'' One issue is that there is no central registry for the profession, so it is easy, as the film explores, for a forensic pathologist doing lousy work in Northern California, say, to go and find work in Kansas City.
''Post Mortem'' is thoroughly convincing in its accusations but less so in its sense of urgency: the belief that the federal government should get involved in death investigations now in a fairly serious way. While it is true that the rates of autopsies have gone down in recent decades, so have rates of violent crime in many cities. And it is unclear how or why death investigation should become a major political priority during a period of high unemployment, general economic distress and struggles in health care and education.
The film also ignores recent research out of California State University, Los Angeles, suggesting that forensic evidence is generally overrated. Reviewing 400 murder cases in five jurisdictions, the study concluded that forensic evidence had little effect on whether an arrest would be made, charges would be filed or a conviction would result.
''Post Mortem,'' though, is still worth the hour. No one can live on a diet of CBS police procedurals alone.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A television review on Tuesday about ''Post Mortem,'' a documentary on PBS about lapses in the American system for investigating causes of death, misattributed a quotation from the film and rendered part of it incorrectly. The forensic pathologist Vincent Di Maio -- not Marcella Fierro, the retired chief medical examiner of Virginia -- said that the work done ''varies from excellent to absolutely lousy.'' He did not say ''really, really lousy.''

HEADLINE: Rabid Fans Put Dallas on Their Itinerary

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Just moments after the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears for the N.F.C. championship, Tony Hoes ran for the phone to call Titletown Tickets, a tour operator. After waiting nervously on hold, Hoes plunked down $10,000 for two trip packages to suburban Dallas so he and his wife can see the Packers play in the Super Bowl for the first time in 13 years.
A few hours later, after the Jets lost in Pittsburgh, Phil Esno and a good friend shook hands on a deal that would send them to Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Tex., to see the Steelers take on the Packers. The airfare, hotels and tickets will cost $3,000 each. But to a lifelong Steelers fan like Esno, it was a chance to cross one big item off his to-do list.
To N.F.L. executives, networks, sponsors and others who make millions of dollars off the Super Bowl, Packers-Steelers may be one of the game's most compelling matchups: two of the league's oldest and most storied franchises with star quarterbacks, hard-hitting defenses and flashy offenses. 
Both teams have rabid followings in their home states, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and beyond. With Cheeseheads and Terrible Towel wavers in all 50 states, and many of them spending heavily to get to the game, this Super Bowl will most likely be the most watched sporting event ever, and perhaps the most lucrative one as well.
''Gold is going to be the common denominator,'' said John Clark, a Wisconsin native who teaches sports management at Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, alluding to the teams' colors and the potential windfall from the game. ''Both teams have strong national followings. Green Bay and Pittsburgh really define their cities, so there's a level of euphoria during the Super Bowl that is unmatched.''
Even given the devotion of the teams' fans, ticket brokers, travel agencies and other businesses have been surprised by the demand for their services. The average price of game tickets offered for sale online is $4,375, almost 70 percent higher than tickets to last year's game between the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints in Miami Gardens, Fla., according to FanSnap, which scans more than 50 ticket resale sites.
The number of fans searching for flights and hotels has also increased significantly. After the Packers won the N.F.C. championship, there were 43 times more online searches for flights to Dallas from Milwaukee compared with the first two weekends of January, when the first two playoff rounds were played, according to Kayak.com, a travel search site. In Pittsburgh, the number of searches for flights to Dallas soared 38-fold after the Steelers beat the Jets in the A.F.C. title game.
''I was surprised because I assumed it would be small because of the scarcity and cost of tickets,'' said Robert Birge, the chief marketing officer at Kayak.com. ''But I lived in Milwaukee and I can tell you that Packermania is impervious to World War IV.''
Neither increase in demand rivaled the jump after the Saints qualified for their first Super Bowl appearance last year. But interest by Packers and Steelers fans far surpassed that in Indianapolis and other cities that had teams on the cusp of the Super Bowl.
The numbers tell only part of the story, though, because many Packers and Steelers fans do not live in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania and are thus harder to track.
The Dallas Cowboys are the most popular football team in America, but the Steelers are second and the Packers are sixth, according to Luker on Trends, Powered by the ESPN Sports Poll.
In all, as many as 200,000 fans from out of town are expected to descend on the Dallas-Fort Worth area for Super Bowl week. About 60 percent of those people will be there ostensibly for business reasons. But that still leaves tens of thousands of fans who are there to enjoy the circuslike atmosphere.
Many of them will undoubtedly be wearing black and gold or green and gold. About 65 percent of fans who say the Steelers are their favorite team do not live in Pennsylvania. More than 53 percent of Packers fans do not live in Wisconsin, said Rich Luker, who conducted the fan poll.
Steelers and Packers fans are solidly middle class, Luker said. According to his poll, 32 percent of Packers fans and 31 percent of Steelers fans say they earn from $50,000 to $100,000, compared with 29 percent of fans of all teams. They are also underrepresented in lower- and higher-income categories.
''Upper-middle-income people have the means to go to the big events, but it has to be a very high priority to do it,'' Luker said.
Still, with some tickets costing as much as boats and small cars, attending the Super Bowl is a stretch for most Americans, particularly in this economy.
Bill Wenzel, who runs Titletown Tickets, said he expected to sell hundreds of tour packages this year, compared with the 3,000 or so that he sold in 1997 and 1998, when the Packers last went to the Super Bowl.
''Last time, four nights, nonstop air, tickets ran $3,000 a person, and now it's $5,000 apiece,'' he said. ''We can't control this. The only way for us to get tickets is on the secondary market.''
That has not deterred Packers fans like Hoes, 54, who has had season tickets for 30 years and has seen the team play about 40 road games as well. (He once sat near Brett Favre's parents when the Packers played in Jacksonville, Fla.)
''This economy has really been an issue for so many folks, so some of our friends unfortunately aren't able to go because of the extreme cost,'' said Hoes, a commercial real estate developer who lives in De Pere, just south of Green Bay. ''But it comes around every 14 years, so you have to take advantage of it.''
Esno, the Steelers fan, echoed that sentiment. After seeing Franco Harris's Immaculate Reception in 1972, he went straight to the box office to get season tickets, which he held for the next 16 years. He has gone to plenty of games since then, and even flew to Tampa, Fla., two years ago in hopes of seeing the Steelers play the Arizona Cardinals in the Super Bowl. At $5,000, tickets were too expensive.
''There comes a point when cooler heads have to prevail,'' said Esno, 63, a retired educator.
By comparison, $3,000 for a chance to finally see the Steelers in the Super Bowl is a relative bargain and one that was too hard to pass up, Esno said.
''This is definitely a bucket list item,'' he said. ''When the opportunity came up, I jumped at it.''

HEADLINE: Allying Ourselves With the Next Egypt

BYLINE: By JOHN KERRY. 
John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

 BODY:
Washington
EVEN if the protests shaking Egypt subside in the coming days, the chaos of the last week has forever changed the relationship between the Egyptian people and their government. The anger and aspirations propelling a diverse range of citizens into the streets will not disappear without sweeping changes in the social compact between the people and the government -- and these events also call for changes in the relationship between the United States and a stalwart Arab ally.
President Hosni Mubarak must accept that the stability of his country hinges on his willingness to step aside gracefully to make way for a new political structure. One of the toughest jobs that a leader under siege can perform is to engineer a peaceful transition. But Egyptians have made clear they will settle for nothing less than greater democracy and more economic opportunities. 
Ushering in such a transformation offers President Mubarak -- a great nationalist ever since his generation of young officers helped their country escape the last vestiges of British colonialism -- the chance to end the violence and lawlessness, to begin improving the dire economic and social conditions in his country and to change his place in history.
It is not enough for President Mubarak to pledge ''fair'' elections, as he did on Saturday. The most important step that he can take is to address his nation and declare that neither he nor the son he has been positioning as his successor will run in the presidential election this year. Egyptians have moved beyond his regime, and the best way to avoid unrest turning into upheaval is for President Mubarak to take himself and his family out of the equation.
Further, he must guarantee that the election will be honest and open to all legitimate candidates and conducted without interference from the military or security apparatus and under the oversight of international monitors. The Egyptian people are demanding wholesale transformation, not window dressing. As part of the transition, President Mubarak needs to work with the army and civil society to establish an interim caretaker government as soon as possible to oversee an orderly transition in the coming months.
President Mubarak has contributed significantly to Middle East peace. Now it is imperative that he contribute to peace in his own country by convincing Egyptians that their concerns and aspirations are being addressed. If he demonstrates leadership and accomplishes those goals, he can turn the Arab world's most populous country into a model for how to meet the demands for reform engulfing the region.
Given the events of the past week, some are criticizing America's past tolerance of the Egyptian regime. It is true that our public rhetoric did not always match our private concerns. But there also was a pragmatic understanding that our relationship benefited American foreign policy and promoted peace in the region. And make no mistake, a productive relationship with Egypt remains crucial for both us and the Middle East.
To that end, the United States must accompany our rhetoric with real assistance to the Egyptian people. For too long, financing Egypt's military has dominated our alliance. The proof was seen over the weekend: tear gas canisters marked ''Made in America'' fired at protesters, United States-supplied F-16 jet fighters streaking over central Cairo. Congress and the Obama administration need to consider providing civilian assistance that would generate jobs and improve social conditions in Egypt, as well as guarantee that American military assistance is accomplishing its goals -- just as we are trying to do with Pakistan through a five-year nonmilitary assistance package.
The awakening across the Arab world must bring new light to Washington, too. Our interests are not served by watching friendly governments collapse under the weight of the anger and frustrations of their own people, nor by transferring power to radical groups that would spread extremism. Instead, the best way for our stable allies to survive is to respond to the genuine political, legal and economic needs of their people. And the Obama administration is already working to address these needs.
At other historic turning points, we have not always chosen wisely. We built an important alliance with a free Philippines by supporting the people when they showed Ferdinand Marcos the door in 1986. But we continue to pay a horrible price for clinging too long to Iran's shah. How we behave in this moment of challenge in Cairo is critical. It is vital that we stand with the people who share our values and hopes and who seek the universal goals of freedom, prosperity and peace.
For three decades, the United States pursued a Mubarak policy. Now we must look beyond the Mubarak era and devise an Egyptian policy.

HEADLINE: For Fans With Texas-Size Appetites

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
ARLINGTON, Tex. -- The faithful have started to arrive in this drab, featureless city a little closer to Fort Worth than to Dallas. They have come sweat-panted and reverent to stand along Collins Street to photograph Cowboys Stadium, to walk the sidewalk surrounding its $1.2 billion form.
The building rises up out of the immense rolling prairie as if raised by supplicants to the higher power of football, capitalism and Texas, a silver biscuit large enough that were the Statue of Liberty to be erected inside it, the torch would barely blacken the retractable roof. On Sunday it will be the stage for the Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
All over the city and region parking lots are being expanded or resurfaced in anticipation. Landscapers trim bushes and trees, plant flowers. Men repair streetlights and potholes along Interstate 30, the corridor that links Fort Worth to Dallas. The odor of fresh paint fills the hallways of local hotels. Enforcement of a new anti-panhandling law has been stepped up. 
And from White Settlement in the west to Deep Ellum in the east -- an area of north Texas that is 9,000 square miles in all -- local restaurants and bars are getting ready for a rush of business.
I was part of the advance guard, a special-teams rookie sent out to feed. For four days I did so, up and down the economic ladder. I stood in for forthcoming Wisconsinites and Pennsylvanians with a taste for cheese or sausage, for media hounds, sex workers and all those who follow the money that comes with a Super Bowl game.
There was plenty to cheer. I found excellent tacos, ate glazed quail at the Ritz, stood in an all-male line of Fort Worth barbecue hounds. I followed in the footsteps of Roosevelt at the Original Mexican Eats Cafe in Fort Worth, and in those of George W. Bush at Sonny Bryan's Smokehouse in the shadow of the Southwestern Medical Center of the University of Texas.
There were double-breakfast mornings followed by quadruple-lunch afternoons, followed by dinners and more dinners still.
I had a meal at Bolsa, an art house hangout in the city's Oak Cliff neighborhood with a grand hamburger, decent pizzas and an ambitious cocktail list, and another in a grim little barroom in the Sheraton here, just down the road from Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, across from the Six Flags Over Texas amusement park. I took in the sight of Tim Love's Lonesome Dove restaurant near the Fort Worth Stockyards (wild boar ribs!), ate a cheeseburger loaded down with onions and jalapeno at Kincaid's and put more than 300 miles on the odometer of a truck built right here at the G.M. plant, looking for places to eat.
One of the best was Nonna, a trattoria in Dallas that is across the street from a Whole Foods market. The restaurant, with its Italian menu, excellent wine list and cosmopolitan service style, serves as a clubhouse for some of Dallas's most influential citizens. (Jerry Jones, the owner of the Cowboys, was there the other night in black suit and well-polished black cowboy boots, walking the dining room and shaking hands. ''I used to think I could only really get excited about Dallas playing a football game,'' he drawled. ''But this is pretty great.'')
They wave across the spare dining room while eating sweet fried oysters and baby artichokes bathed in fiery Calabrian chili butter, and devour plates of elegant pasta with sea urchin. A cut of firm Petrale sole can follow, a Pacific flounder served crisp from the wood oven and paired with Dungeness crab and a tangle of spinach. It is a balm for anyone just in from the airport with a crick in his neck and the feeling that it is slightly insane to travel great distances just to watch television commercials on the 60-yard high-definition screen Jones installed in the middle of his stadium.
Robb Walsh, a Texas food authority who recently helped found Foodways Texas, a group devoted to the preservation of the state's food culture, suggested another remedy: Babe's Chicken Dinner House, in Roanoke, a short drive from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. (''Gateway to Super Bowl XLV,'' read the signs there.)
Babe's is a family business with restaurants across north Texas. But the Roanoke location is the original and, Walsh says, the best, a restaurant founded in 1993 in a barn of a room that might have served as a stage set for ''Friday Night Lights.''
Only two entrees are served. You can get chicken fried steak or you can get fried chicken. (Get both, and see your doctor when you get home.) The C.F.S., as chicken fried steak is known among the local food maniacs, is a wide plank of pounded, floured and fried beef, served with an immense bowl of peppery cream gravy on the side. The cognoscenti do not pour this over their meat, but instead dip bites into it as they go along. ''You don't want anything congealing,'' Walsh said.
New York has nothing to compare with the excellence of Babe's fried chicken. It has a shatteringly crisp and salty exterior, not at all greasy, that gives way to meat of amazing juiciness in both breast and thigh.
With these come bowls of creamy corn, buttery mashed potatoes, biscuits and as much sweet tea as you can handle. (All meals begin with a regrettable green salad.) For dessert, spread some of the salted Plugra butter that is on each table onto a biscuit, then drizzle sorghum syrup over the top. Whoa.
Discussion of where you can get the best barbecue in the Dallas-Fort Worth area can be pitched. Many will tell you that you cannot get it at all, that you need to drive south toward Austin and Lockhart if you want brisket, beef ribs, beans.
The dry, flavorless brisket at the original Sonny Bryan's in Dallas makes a strong argument that this is true, and the meat at Angelo's in Fort Worth does not mount much of a defense either. (Still, both restaurants are worth a visit simply to see. They were founded in 1958, and appear to have been placed in smoke-fragrant amber.)
Daniel Vaughn, a Dallas architect and self-professed prophet of smoked meat who blogs as the BBQ Snob, believes the city can hold its own. A meal at Smoke, the chef Tim Byres's haute barbecue restaurant, would seem to back him up, at least on the brisket front.
By insistent text message, Vaughn sent me to Mac's, a quiet Dallas lunch spot in a low-slung brick building on Main Street, not far from the interstate. Billy McDonald runs the show there, and has for more than 30 years, after taking over the business from his father, who started it in 1955. Brisket, pork ribs, ham, turkey, jalapeno-spiked sausages and kielbasa are all available, smoked over the green hickory McDonald keeps stacked out back, and which keeps his large oven running 24 hours a day.
The brisket is hugely flavorful, with a rich crust and a melting interior. The ribs -- ''dirty old things,'' McDonald called them -- are sweet. His kielbasa will be manna for some number of Pittsburgh fans used to the flavors of Eastern Europe. But it is the moist and smoky turkey that astonishes.
There are arguments here about tacos, as well. For some, the best come from the stand inside the Fuel City station on Industrial Drive in Dallas, a business perched almost on the banks of the flood plains of the Trinity River. Corn tortillas filled with picadillo or barbacoa are favorites, slathered with hot sauce and covered with onions and cilantro, and eaten in the parking lot as traffic screams by.
Better, though, is Fuel Town 2, a Texaco station on Inwood Road practically under the Stemmons Freeway, a short drive from the airport at Dallas Love Field. The barbacoa is less greasy than at the competitors, full of flavor, and the tortillas warmer, fresher, tasting more emphatically of corn. Served with lemons, cilantro, grilled onion and whole jalapeno, with a chunky red salsa, a taco here may be the perfect Dallas snack food. And at $1.50, a good value, too.
You'll spend more at Fearing's, the chef and restaurateur Dean Fearing's comfortable and excellent flagship establishment in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Uptown region of Dallas. Maple-soaked buffalo tenderloin runs $46, with jalapeno grits, a butternut squash taquito and a tangle of greens. The glazed quail, a rich and buttery appetizer-size bird, is $18.
It is terrific eating all the same (get the deep-fried apple pies for dessert). And Fearing is a constant and ebullient presence in the dining room, the face of a prideful city. Those who have come to the Super Bowl will not mind the prices, he said.
Tickets to Super Bowl XLV have a face value of $600 to $1,200. More than 100,000 people are expected to attend, according to N.F.L. officials. The economic impact on the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan region alone, they say, is expected to be more than $600 million.
''It's great,'' Fearing said, laughing. ''I can double the minimum check and get people to pay in advance. Hey, I'm in the black for February already.''

HEADLINE: Sorting Out the Uprising in Egypt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Egyptians Defiant as Military Does Little to Quash Protests'' (front page, Jan. 30):
Is it any wonder the Middle East is in a state of dangerous chaos?
Consider: unbridled corruption, tyrannical governments, religious extremism and intolerance, one-dimensional economies, ridiculously disproportionate distributions of wealth, radicalized education systems, unreliable and mistrusted police forces, and a terrified middle class.
It's a formula for revolution, not evolution, and a reason chaos will reign supreme in that region for generations to come. 
Peter Alkalay Scarsdale, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
I agree with your Jan. 30 news analysis ''Yearning for Respect, Arabs Find a Voice.''
A new, younger Internet generation has overcome its fear and is yearning for freedom from tyrannical Arab regimes. These post-colonial authoritarian regimes established total control over all institutions -- military, security, political, economic, media, cultural and religious -- all with one purpose: to secure their power and eliminate all opposition.
For decades they've ignored the plight of their impoverished populace, who are courageously holding them accountable.
President Hosni Mubarak's departure is inevitable, and America and Israel's relationship with Egypt is in jeopardy after decades of supporting him. These protests reflect a rejection of American and Israeli policies in the region.
In 2006, during the Israel-Lebanon war, Condoleezza Rice, who was then secretary of state, prophetically proclaimed that the region was undergoing the ''birth pangs of a new Middle East.''
Mohamed Khodr Winchester, Va., Jan. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Washington and Mr. Mubarak'' (editorial, Jan. 29):
The United States is the world's most powerful democracy. But, ironically, our government has a history of supporting autocratic regimes throughout the world, overtly or covertly, especially since the end of World War II.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a stalwart ally of the United States, is not an exception. A partial list of such ruthless dictators in the past: Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, the shah of Iran, Francisco Franco of Spain, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal, Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire (Congo), Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile.
It is not enough if President Obama just cuts aid to Egypt if Mr. Mubarak fails to open up Egypt's political system. He should ask Mr. Mubarak to step down immediately and let the Egyptians freely choose their own government, with no external pressure whatsoever. It is quite possible that Tunisia will then follow the Egyptian model.
V. K. Balakrishnan Cedar Park, Tex., Jan. 29, 2011
To the Editor:
Why do the people of Egypt have to place themselves in danger of being shot and tear-gassed by the riot police before the United States realizes that it has a ''moral responsibility to stand with those who have the courage to oppose authoritarian rulers'' (editorial, Jan. 29)? The United States government has been aware of the nature of President Hosni Mubarak's regime for decades and has sustained it through generous foreign aid, but for whose ''national security concerns''? America's or Israel's?
It's time to come down off the fence and stand up for justice. That's what Americans claim they are good at, and now is the time to prove it, across the Middle East.
Ibrahim Hewitt London, Jan. 29, 2011
The writer is senior editor of Middle East Monitor.
To the Editor:
Re ''The Devil We Know,'' by Ross Douthat (column, Jan. 31):
''History makes fools of us all.''
Indeed. But not because our ''theories always fail,'' or because ''the world is too complicated,'' but because we keep making the same shortsighted and self-interested mistakes over and over again.
Of course Islamism has spread in the Middle East, and of course it has been anti-American. Islamism arose in reaction to oppressive regimes, like the shah's, that have had the support of the United States.
Only we see our invasion of Iraq as a legitimate way to ''promote democracy''; few believe that our misadventure in Somalia was a simple ''humanitarian intervention.''
The United States has spent the last half-century trying to impose its will with its money and its military might, and the outcomes, from Korea to Cuba to Vietnam to Central America to Iraq and Afghanistan, have been uniformly dreadful.
Maybe if we spend the next generation taking the long view and doing the right thing, we'll begin to see some different results.
David Berman New York, Jan. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
It was only a question of time before the ''moderate'' Arab states in Israel's neighborhood, a k a stable dictatorships at peace with Israel, would have their comeuppance (''Israel Shaken as Turbulence Rocks an Ally,'' front page, Jan. 31).
But Israel has stubbornly ignored this ticking bomb, as well as a recent generous offer by the Palestinians and less than energetic prodding by the United States on its settlement policy, and it now faces the possibility that radical elements will take over Egypt, and possibly Jordan, Yemen and others over time.
President Obama did not even mention our intentions about reviving the Israel-Arab peace process during his State of the Union address. If a major Middle East disaster is to be avoided, he needs to exert pressure on Israel now before a two-state solution slides off the table.
Gustav Ranis New Haven, Jan. 31, 2011
The writer is professor emeritus of international economics at Yale and former director of its Center for International and Area Studies.
To the Editor:
The popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt should remind us that it does not take a bloody, illegal invasion to overthrow a dictator.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Cuomo's Property-Tax Cap, Adding Pressure on Assembly to Follow

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's proposal to limit local property taxes won overwhelming approval from the State Senate on Monday, escalating the pressure on Democratic legislators in the Assembly who have expressed reservations about the bill.
The Senate voted 45 to 17 in favor of the cap, which Mr. Cuomo had declared his top campaign priority, after an hour of discussion. Thirteen of the 30 Democrats joined all 32 Republicans in passing the bill. 
''This measure will provide a real reprieve to homeowners who are struggling to make ends meet,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement after the vote. ''I, along with countless New Yorkers, look forward to this cap becoming a reality, as taxpayers across the state cannot afford to wait any longer for relief.''
The Senate's approval was not a surprise, since the chamber had passed legislation to limit property taxes both last year, when Democrats held the majority, and in 2008, when Republicans were in charge.
The Assembly has not taken up similar measures in recent years. But the speedy passage puts Mr. Cuomo in a better position to try to persuade the Assembly to follow the Senate's lead this year. Some senators were explicit about that.
Senator David J. Valesky, a Democrat from Syracuse, said he hoped ''this is the year that I and the 19.5 million New Yorkers can finally thank the Assembly for doing the right thing'' and passing the bill, too.
Mr. Valesky was one of many senators to rise, one after another, from their chairs on the Senate floor to bemoan the fiscal strain that high property taxes had inflicted on New Yorkers. Several of them credited Mr. Cuomo for making the bill -- which limits the increase in property taxes to 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower -- his first legislative priority.
But the discussion on Monday was not entirely positive. Some senators raised concerns about the effectiveness of capping property taxes, questioning the relief it would provide to people with lower incomes.
Others criticized the unusually swift consideration of the bill, which was introduced late Friday night with no public announcement to allow for passage before Mr. Cuomo unveils his executive budget on Tuesday.
''We are here today voting on a lengthy, complex piece of legislation after being given the least amount of time possible to review it and consider its impact,'' said Senator Jose R. Peralta, a Democrat from Queens. ''My question is simple: Why?''
The Assembly received no advance warning that Mr. Cuomo planned to bring the bill to the Legislature on Friday. Some Assembly Democrats took that as an affront -- or at least a sign that Mr. Cuomo's legislative choreography was meant to coerce the Assembly to address the matter sooner rather than later.
That bit of strategy on the governor's part was also more than implied on Monday.
''When he talks about his budget tomorrow, he can say, 'We have achieved the No. 1 priority that I have set for this budget and for this state,' '' said Senator William J. Larkin Jr., a Republican from the Hudson Valley. ''And he'll commend all of us who did stand up and vote for it.''
A few hours before the Senate vote, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, affirmed his support for limiting property taxes, but not necessarily with the exact language used in Mr. Cuomo's bill.
''I believe we will come to a common ground with the governor and the Senate on an appropriate property tax cap,'' Speaker Silver said.
Asked for his opinion on Mr. Cuomo's bill, the speaker said he had not yet read it.

HEADLINE: Debt Limit Follies

 BODY:
At a recent gathering of House Republicans, lawmakers made it clear that they intend to hold an increase in the nation's debt limit hostage to major spending cuts.
Clearly, the Republican aim is to demonstrate their fiscal prudence, as well as their new political power in the Republican-controlled House. Don't be fooled. When it comes to debating the debt limit the facts matter little. It's all about posturing.
The debt limit is a cap set by Congress on the amount the nation can legally borrow. The current limit, $14.3 trillion, will be hit sometime this spring. Unless Congress raises it before then, the government will have to resort to temporary tactics, like freeing up money to pay current bills by delaying payments to federal retirement funds. The longer a standoff endures, the worse the choices are. For instance, the government might defer other payments, like tax refunds, as it husbands resources to avoid a default on the public debt. 
All that would surely be disruptive and could be disastrous if the nation's creditors began to doubt America's reliability.
The debt limit is a political tool, not a fiscal one. First enacted in 1917, it was intended to make lawmakers think twice before voting for tax cuts and spending increases that run up the debt. Unfortunately, it has never worked that way. Federal debt is high despite the limit because lawmakers repeatedly enter into expensive and recurring obligations without a plan to pay for them -- in recent years that includes two wars, the George W. Bush-era tax cuts and the Medicare drug benefit.
As the costs pile up, the debt limit must be increased -- not to make room for new spending, but to raise money to pay for past commitments.
It is, of course, utterly disingenuous to vote for policies that drive up the debt and then rail against raising the debt limit when the bills come due. It is akin to piling up purchases on credit and then threatening to bounce the payment check. But that is what Republicans are saying they will do unless they win deep cuts in future spending in exchange for a debt-limit increase today. So much for fiscal prudence.
A better approach would be to pay for legislation when it is enacted, generally by raising taxes or cutting other spending. The new House leadership has rejected that approach when it comes to their No. 1 priority: cutting taxes.
They have passed new budget rules that allow taxes to be cut without offsets to replace the lost revenue. The new rules also forbid raising taxes to pay for major new spending, like Medicare expansions, requiring instead that any such spending be offset by cutting other programs. That is a recipe for fiscal irresponsibility.
House Republican leaders have not said which spending cuts they will demand for a debt-limit increase. They know that voters don't want to hear about losing college aid, environmental safeguards or investor protections. They may try to call for overall spending caps that would let them take credit for spending reductions without explaining or defending particular cuts.
What is known is that deep immediate spending cuts would be unwise at a time when the economy and so many Americans are still struggling. President Obama and Congressional Democrats need to push back by challenging House Republicans on the hypocrisy of their new budget rules and by making it clear that playing games with the debt limit is irresponsible.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Spending Rose in December

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer spending in the United States rose more than expected in December to post a sixth consecutive month of gains as households drew down on their savings to finance purchases, government data showed on Monday. 
The Commerce Department said spending increased 0.7 percent after rising by 0.3 percent in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity in the United States, to increase 0.5 percent last month.
The spending figures were included in the government's fourth-quarter gross domestic product report released on Friday, which showed the economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace on the back of robust consumer spending.
Spending in the fourth quarter grew at a brisk 4.4 percent annual pace, the fastest in more than four years. While economists see spending remaining strong this year, they expect the pace of growth to be less brisk than in the last three months of 2010.
Spending in December came as incomes increased 0.4 percent and savings dropped to their lowest level since March. Incomes grew 0.4 percent in November and the increase last month was in line with economists' expectations. Savings fell to $614.1 billion from $634.4 billion in November.
The report also showed the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of consumer inflation -- the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy -- was unchanged in December after edging up 0.1 percent in November.
In the 12 months through December, the core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.7 percent, the smallest increase since records began in 1959, after increasing 0.8 percent in November.

HEADLINE: The Paradox Of Corporate Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
The Carnival Corporation wouldn't have much of a business without help from various branches of the government. The United States Coast Guard keeps the seas safe for Carnival's cruise ships. Customs officers make it possible for Carnival cruises to travel to other countries. State and local governments have built roads and bridges leading up to the ports where Carnival's ships dock.
But Carnival's biggest government benefit of all may be the price it pays for many of those services. Over the last five years, the company has paid total corporate taxes -- federal, state, local and foreign -- equal to only 1.1 percent of its cumulative $11.3 billion in profits. Thanks to an obscure loophole in the tax code, Carnival can legally avoid most taxes. 
It is an extreme case, but it's hardly the only company that pays far less than the much-quoted federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Of the 500 big companies in the well-known Standard & Poor's stock index, 115 paid a total corporate tax rate -- both federal and otherwise -- of less than 20 percent over the last five years, according to an analysis of company reports done for The New York Times by Capital IQ, a research firm. Thirty-nine of those companies paid a rate less than 10 percent.
Arguably, the United States now has a corporate tax code that's the worst of all worlds. The official rate is higher than in almost any other country, which forces companies to devote enormous time and effort to finding loopholes. Yet the government raises less money in corporate taxes than it once did, because of all the loopholes that have been added in recent decades.
''A dirty little secret,'' Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, has said, ''is that the corporate income tax used to raise a fair amount of revenue.''
Over the last five years, on the other hand, Boeing paid a total tax rate of just 4.5 percent, according to Capital IQ. Southwest Airlines paid 6.3 percent. And the list goes on: Yahoo paid 7 percent; Prudential Financial, 7.6 percent; General Electric, 14.3 percent.
Economists have long pleaded for an overhaul of the corporate tax code, and both President Obama and Republicans now say they favor one, too. But it won't be easy. Companies that use loopholes to avoid taxes don't mind the current system, of course, and they have more than a few lobbyists at their disposal.
The official position of the Business Roundtable, one of the most important corporate lobbying groups, is telling. The Roundtable says it supports corporate tax reform. But it actually favors only a reduction in the tax rate. The group refuses to say whether it also favors a reduction of loopholes. In effect, the Roundtable wants a tax cut for its members regardless of how much the tax code is simplified -- or whether the budget deficit grows.
The tax filings of companies, like those of individuals, are confidential. In their public reports to investors, however, companies are required to list something called ''cash taxes paid'' -- the total amount of corporate income tax they paid that year, be it to foreign governments, the United States government or state and local governments.
This number varies significantly from year to year, depending on how many loopholes a company qualifies for. So looking at a single year's number is often misleading. But in a 2008 academic paper, three accounting professors -- Scott Dyreng of Duke, Michelle Hanlon of M.I.T. and Edward Maydew of the University of North Carolina -- suggested a new method for analyzing corporate tax avoidance.
It compares cash taxes paid over several years -- like five, as in the analysis for The Times -- to pretax earnings over that same period. The accounting experts I interviewed called it the best available method for looking at corporate taxes.
Some obvious patterns emerge. Companies that lost large amounts of money in previous years can subtract these subsequent losses from their initial profits and avoid taxes until they're turning a consistent profit. Yahoo falls into this category. Of all the reasons to have a low tax rate, this one may be the most defensible, economists say.
Other companies are able to avoid taxes by spending large sums on new equipment or buildings. Such spending can often be deducted. Southwest Airlines, for instance, has bought a lot of planes in the last five years. Several energy companies with tax rates below 2 percent, like NextEra, Xcel and Range Resources, have likewise been expanding.
A third group of companies simply seems to have become expert at avoiding taxes. When the three accounting professors analyzed more than 2,000 companies, they found big variations in tax rates within almost every subset of companies. Companies in the same industry often paid very different rates, even when they were similar in size.
G.E. is so good at avoiding taxes that some people consider its tax department to be the best in the world, even better than any law firm's. One common strategy is maximizing the amount of profit that is officially earned in countries with low tax rates.
Carnival pays so little tax partly because of a provision that lets some shipping companies legally incorporated overseas (Panama, in Carnival's case) avoid taxes. The fact that Carnival's executives sit in Miami and or that many passengers board in Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Seattle doesn't matter. Nor does the fact that Carnival isn't paying much tax in Panama.
Companies that pay relatively high rates tend to be those that are not expanding rapidly and that are not as ingenious as G.E., at least on taxes. The average total tax rate for the 500 companies over the last five years -- again, including federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes -- was 32.8 percent. Among those paying more than the average were Exxon Mobil, FedEx, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, Wal-Mart and Walt Disney.
The problem with the current system is that it distorts incentives. Decisions that would otherwise be inefficient for a company -- and that are indeed inefficient for the larger economy -- can make sense when they bring a big tax break. ''Companies should be making investments based on their commercial potential,'' as Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, says, ''not for tax reasons.''
Instead, airlines sometimes buy more planes than they really need. Energy companies drill more holes. Drug companies conduct research with only marginal prospects of success.
Inefficiencies like these slow economic growth, and they are the reason that both conservatives and liberals criticize the corporate tax code so harshly. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, says it hurts job creation. Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address, said that the system ''makes no sense, and it has to change.''
A lot of economists agree. Then again, any system that creates as many winners as this one won't be changed easily.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pushes, But Reactors Are Lagging

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed giving the nuclear construction business a type of help it has never had, a role in a quota for clean energy. But recent setbacks in a hoped-for ''nuclear renaissance'' raise questions about how much of a role nuclear power can play.
Of four reactor projects identified by the Energy Department in 2009 as the most likely candidates for federal loan guarantees, only two are moving forward. At a third, in Calvert Cliffs, Md., there has been no public sign of progress since the lead partner withdrew in October and the other partner said it would seek a replacement.
And at the fourth, in Texas, a would-be builder has been driven to try something never done before in nuclear construction: finding a buyer for the electricity before the concrete is even poured. Customers are not rushing forward, given that the market is awash in generating capacity and an alternative fuel, natural gas, is currently cheap. 
''The short answer is, there has to be a market for the power,'' said John Reed, an investment banker who specializes in nuclear projects. ''That's the most immediate hurdle these projects have to get over.''
Yet there is a fairly sturdy political consensus in favor of building more reactors. By including nuclear power in a proposed ''clean energy standard'' shifting the electric system away from conventional coal and gas, whose emissions contribute to global warming, the Obama administration is seeking to stoke such support.
Many Democrats and most Republicans in Congress back nuclear construction, as do local officials in most places where reactors have been proposed.
Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and one of the Senate's strongest proponents of nuclear power, suggests that Mr. Obama should make building 100 reactors in the next 20 years a national priority, both for energy security and to limit climate-changing emissions.
But for now, he acknowledges, the economics are not in place. ''Right now, it's stuck,'' he said of the planned nuclear revival.
Some challenges are not peculiar to the nuclear sector. All forms of clean energy, including solar and wind power, are undercut to some extent by the cheap price of natural gas and the surplus in generating capacity, which is linked partly to the recession. And federal caps on carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and gas-burning plants, which would benefit clean energy sources, are not expected until 2012.
But some obstacles are specific to the nuclear industry, like the ballooning cost estimates for construction of reactors, which are massive in scale. Even when projects are identified as prime candidates for federal loan guarantees, some investment partners turn wary.
''All that uncertainty creates an incentive for you to wait,'' said Joseph E. Aldy, who was a special assistant to President Obama until December.
To counter the uncertainties, Senator Alexander and others have arranged substantial help for the industry. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been working for more than 15 years to streamline reactor licensing to cut construction time and to reduce risk. And the 2005 Energy Policy Act provided money for loan guarantees, subsidies for production from the first few reactors and insurance against regulatory delays.
Industry executives say that with those changes and the financial help, they had what they needed to build after a gap of three decades. By 2008, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had 15 applications for new nuclear plants in hand and expected 15 more, and it asked Congress for budget increases for personnel to handle the flood.
Across from commission headquarters, in Rockville, Md., workers are now digging a foundation for a $131 million, 14-story office tower for 1,500 employees to handle an anticipated flood of applications. But many of the proposed reactors are fading.
The four projects identified by the Energy Department after the 2005 act as the strongest candidates to share an $18.5 billion pool of loan guarantee money underline the difficulties.
At the Southern Company's Vogtle 3 & 4 reactors, near Augusta, Ga., two holes that are each as big as five football fields have been dug for the foundations, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to grant a license to build and operate the plants this year.
But negotiations on the Calvert Cliffs 3 project in Maryland broke down over what fee the builders should pay to the federal government to compensate the Treasury for the risk it was underwriting. One partner, Constellation Energy of Baltimore, gave up, and the other, Electricite de France, has not found a new investor.
Preliminary work has begun at another site, the Virgil C. Summer 2 and 3 project of South Carolina Electric and Gas, although one of the municipal partners, Santee Cooper, is looking for another company to take over some of its share.
The fate of the fourth, the South Texas Project 3 and 4, has been uncertain since CPS Energy, the municipal utility that serves San Antonio, was spooked by rising cost estimates and decided to bail out. CPS settled with the other partner, NRG of Princeton, for 7.6 percent ownership in exchange for the money it had already invested; for months, NRG has been shopping for partners to replace CPS.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company has agreed to take on 10 percent if the project gets a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, but before the project can move forward it needs either more investors or utilities that will sign contracts to accept the power for 20 years or more.
David Crane, NRG's chief executive, said in a telephone interview that he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that he would eventually find customers that would agree to take power for 10 or 20 years, beginning in 2017. ''I don't find many people willing to believe that gas is going to be almost free forever,'' he said.
In the 1960s and 1970s, when utilities decided to build the 104 plants now operating, they did not sell the output with power purchase agreements before the plants came online, because in that era, companies simply built to supply their own customers, who did not have a choice of suppliers. But if the South Texas Project expansion is built, it would be the first in a state using a restructured electric system with open bidding, a system that now covers more than half the country.
South Texas 3 and 4 and Calvert Cliffs 3 were supposed to help break a 30-year drought and get the ball rolling for construction of dozens of new reactors.
But prospects for weaker ones are fading.
AmerenUE proposed a reactor adjacent to its existing Callaway plant in Missouri that would have been an identical twin to Constellation Energy's Calvert Cliffs 3 in Maryland, but that fizzled after the Missouri legislature refused to let the company collect money from ratepayers before the plant was finished.
Michael J. Wallace, who led Constellation's five-year effort to build Calvert Cliffs 3, said that more help would have to come for the industry to bounce back. ''We need to take stock again,'' he said. ''If we don't sort this out in some way, there isn't going to be a nuclear revival.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about obstacles to construction of nuclear reactors in the United States misstated the Florida Public Service Commission's rules on allowing utilities to bill ratepayers for construction costs while a reactor is being built. The commission does indeed allow some billing for expenses before and during construction; it does not forbid it. The article also misstated the status of two companies' proposals to build reactors. Progress Energy and Florida Power and Light both have drawn up plans, though they have not made a commitment to build; they have backed off their proposals. And the article misidentified the nuclear plant adjacent to a site where Ameren UE proposes to build a reactor in Missouri. It is the Callaway plant -- not Wolf Creek, a plant in Kansas.

HEADLINE: Reach for the Skies

BYLINE: By GREG LINDSAY. 
Greg Lindsay is a co-author of the forthcoming ''Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next.''

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union speech last week, President Obama talked about why things like high-speed rail and faster Internet connections were critical to American prosperity. But he left out the fastest, safest mode of transportation available: aviation.
It may be hard to imagine flying as anything other than a nightmare of packed planes, crumbling airports, canceled flights and increasingly invasive security. But these are all signs of how far our system has fallen. In fact, of all the transportation options available, aviation is the one with the greatest potential to improve the economy and Americans' well-being -- though it will take major new investments to get there. 
From 1975 to 2005, while global gross domestic product rose 154 percent and world trade grew 355 percent, the value of air cargo climbed 1,395 percent. Today, more than one-third of all goods by value, some $3 trillion, is carried in the bellies of planes. These goods are the high-tech, high-value products that Americans want to make -- clean-energy technology, electronics and biomedical devices -- and they are key to the president's goals of doubling exports and revitalizing our economy.
What's more, air travel remains ever more vital to American workers. The transportation analysts Kenneth Button and Roger Stough found that the presence of an airline hub in a city increased the local high-tech work force by an average of 12,000. Another study concluded that each flight from Los Angeles to Europe or Asia created 3,126 jobs, totaling $156 million in wages.
True, there's always telecommuting. But high-speed Internet hasn't diminished the need for highly skilled workers to fly, because meeting face-to-face matters more than ever when the products are ideas and the employees are spread across international borders.
Of course, some analysts predict that a return to $140-a-barrel oil would put a crimp on the airline industry, if not ground it altogether. But aviation growth doesn't correlate to rising oil prices. Rather, it's about expanding economies: oil prices have tripled in nominal terms since the start of the Iraq war, yet the annual number of passengers worldwide has risen 43 percent since 2003. In the global economy, speed trumps costs.
The problem is that aviation in America is slowing down. For decades, even as demand grew, we failed to expand runways, upgrade technology and build larger terminals. New York's three airports, which suffer some of the worst delays in the country, cost travelers $1.7 billion annually in lost time alone. Similar stories abound across the country.
America may not see the advantage to such investments, but China and India do. Both are experiencing annual aviation growth rates as high as 20 percent as their growing middle classes take to the skies. And they are building hundreds of new airports to connect their once-obscure, now-booming cities to each other and their neighbors, not to us.
Indeed, the rest of the world is interacting via air like never before. The number of visitors to China from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America quintupled from 2000 to 2007; not coincidentally, China's exports to the Arab world soared to $60 billion from $6 billion. America is, in other words, getting cut out.
We need to do three things to improve air travel and forge new links overseas.
The first step is to upgrade our air-traffic-control system, which dates back to the 1930s. The government must finally switch from radar to the G.P.S.-based system known as NextGen, which lets planes fly via satellite signal instead of following radar beacons, saving time and fuel, which in turn increases airport capacity.
According to Alaska Airlines, which demonstrated the technology last year at its Seattle hub, a G.P.S.-enabled system could save 2.1 million gallons of fuel at an airport annually and cut carbon emissions by 35 percent.
We also need to treat our airports as strategic federal investments, rather than local spending efforts. O'Hare International Airport, for decades the largest in the world, is a primary reason that today Chicago has a higher G.D.P. than South Africa. But O'Hare, like many American airports, desperately needs more and longer runways. Unfortunately, there is not enough federal commitment to ensure they are built, leading to time-consuming political and legal battles. Earlier this month United and American Airlines sued Chicago to stop a $3.4 billion expansion at O'Hare, fearful they would be stuck with some of the bill.
So far, though, we've made only tentative steps in the right direction. Last fall President Obama pledged to repair 150 miles of runways around the country. He must follow through on that, but he must also ensure that aviation receives its fair share from the proposed national investment bank.
Finally, to help protect airlines from oil price spikes (and potentially crushing carbon taxes later on), we need to make investments in high-grade biofuels. The technology exists -- a California company called Solazyme has already sold jet fuel refined from algae to the Navy -- but low-cost, high-volume production does not. As in other areas of green technology, federal involvement is critical to get the market moving.
President Obama is absolutely correct when he says that exports are vital to American prosperity. But without significant new investments, the exports of the future -- from innovative ideas to high-end electronics -- will be left sitting at the departure gate.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Arms Pose Challenge To U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- New American intelligence assessments have concluded that Pakistan has steadily expanded its nuclear arsenal since President Obama came to office, and that it is building the capability to surge ahead in the production of nuclear-weapons material, putting it on a path to overtake Britain as the world's fifth largest nuclear weapons power.
For the Obama administration, the assessment poses a direct challenge to a central element of the president's national security strategy, the reduction of nuclear stockpiles around the world. Pakistan's determination to add considerably to its arsenal -- mostly to deter India -- has also become yet another irritant in its often testy relationship with Washington, particularly as Pakistan seeks to block Mr. Obama's renewed efforts to negotiate a global treaty that would ban the production of new nuclear material.
The United States keeps its estimates of foreign nuclear weapons stockpiles secret, and Pakistan goes to great lengths to hide both the number and location of its weapons. It is particularly wary of the United States, which Pakistan's military fears has plans to seize the arsenal if it was judged to be at risk of falling into the hands of extremists. Such secrecy makes accurate estimates difficult. 
But the most recent estimates, according to officials and outsiders familiar with the American assessments, suggest that the number of deployed weapons now ranges from the mid-90s to more than 110. When Mr. Obama came to office, his aides were told that the arsenal ''was in the mid-to-high 70s,'' according to one official who had been briefed at the time, though estimates ranged from 60 to 90.
''We've seen a consistent, constant buildup in their inventory, but it hasn't been a sudden rapid rise,'' a senior American military official said. ''We're very, very well aware of what they're doing.''
White House officials share the assessment that the increase in actual weapons has been what one termed ''slow and steady.''
But the bigger worry is the production of nuclear materials. Based on the latest estimates of the International Panel on Fissile Materials, an outside group that estimates worldwide nuclear production, experts say Pakistan has now produced enough material for 40 to 100 additional weapons, including a new class of plutonium bombs. If those estimates are correct -- and some government officials regard them as high -- it would put Pakistan on a par with long-established nuclear powers.
''If not now, Pakistan will soon have the fifth largest nuclear arsenal in the world, surpassing the United Kingdom,'' said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer and the author of ''Deadly Embrace: Pakistan, America, and the Future of Global Jihad.''
''And judging by the new nuclear reactors that are coming online and the pace of production, Pakistan is on a course to be the fourth largest nuclear weapons state in the world, ahead of France,'' he said. The United States, Russia and China are the three largest nuclear weapons states.
Mr. Riedel conducted the first review of Pakistan and Afghanistan policy for President Obama in early 2009.
Pakistan's arsenal of deployed weapons is considered secure, a point the White House reiterated last week while declining to answer questions about its new estimates. The United States has spent more than $100 million helping the country build fences, install sensor systems and train personnel to handle the weapons. But senior officials remain deeply concerned that weapons-usable fuel, which is kept in laboratories and storage centers, is more vulnerable and could be diverted by insiders in Pakistan's vast nuclear complex.
In State Department cables released by WikiLeaks late last year, Anne Patterson, then the American ambassador to Pakistan, wrote of concerns that nuclear material in Pakistan's laboratories was vulnerable to slow theft from insiders. The cables also revealed an American effort to deny its ally technology that it could use to upgrade its arsenal to plutonium weapons.
''The biggest concern of major production, to my mind, is theft from the places where the material is being handled in bulk -- the plants that produce it, convert it to metal, fabricate it into bomb parts, and so on,'' said Matthew Bunn, a Harvard scholar who compiles an annual report called ''Securing the Bomb'' for the group Nuclear Threat Initiative. ''All but one of the real thefts'' of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, he said, ''were insider thefts from bulk-handling facilities -- that's where you can squirrel a little bit away without the loss being detected.''
On Monday, The Washington Post, citing nongovernment analysts, said Pakistan's nuclear arsenal now numbered more than 100 deployed weapons. In interviews over the past three weeks, government officials from several countries, including India, which has an interest in raising the alarm about Pakistani capability, provided glimpses of their own estimates.
Almost all, however, said their real concern was not the weapons, but the increase in the production of material, especially plutonium. Pakistan is completing work on a large new plutonium production reactor, which will greatly increase its ability to produce a powerful new generation of weapons, but also defies Mr. Obama's initiative to halt the production of weapons-grade material.
Nuclear projects are managed by the Pakistani military, but the country's top civilian leaders are, on paper, part of the nuclear chain of command. Last year, Pakistan's prime minister visited the new plutonium reactor at Kushab, suggesting at least some level of knowledge about the program. ''We think the civilians are fully in the loop,'' one senior Obama administration official said.
Still, it is unclear how Pakistan is financing the new weapons production, at a time of extraordinary financial stress in the country. ''What does Pakistan need with that many nuclear weapons, especially given the state of the country's economy?'' said one foreign official who is familiar with the country's plans, but agreed to discuss the classified program if granted anonymity.
''The country already has more than enough weapons for an effective deterrent against India,'' the official said. ''This is just for the generals to say they have more than India.''
American officials have been careful not to discuss Pakistan's arsenal in public, for fear of further inflaming tensions and fueling Pakistani fears that the United States was figuring how to secure the weapons in an emergency, or a government collapse. But in November Mr. Obama's top nuclear adviser, Gary Samore, criticized Pakistan for seeking to block talks on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, which, if negotiated and adopted, could threaten Pakistan's program.
In interviews last year, senior Pakistani officials said that they were infuriated by the deal Washington struck to provide civilian nuclear fuel to India, charging it had freed up India's homemade fuel to produce new weapons. As a result, they said, they had no choice but to boost their own production and oppose any treaty that would cut into their ability to match India's arsenal.
In a statement in December, the Pakistan's National Command Authority, which overseas the arsenal, said that it ''rejects any effort to undermine its strategic deterrence,'' adding, ''Pakistan will not be a party to any approach that is prejudicial to its legitimate national security interests.''
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Friday that Mr. Obama remained ''confident'' about the security of Pakistani weapons, and said he ''continues to encourage all nations to support the commencement of negotiations on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.'' Other officials say efforts are now under way to find a way to start negotiations in new forums, away from Pakistani influence.
A senior Pakistani military officer declined Monday to confirm the size of his country's nuclear arsenal or the describe rates of production, saying that information was classified.
''People are getting unduly concerned about the size of our stockpile,'' said the officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''What we have is a credible, minimum nuclear deterrent. It's a bare minimum.''

HEADLINE: $10 Million in Pay for Bank of America Chief

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Brian T. Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America8:54 p.m. Updated
It was a tough year for Bank of America, what with the foreclosure mess and a sagging stock price. Its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, nonetheless received $10 million in his first year on the job. 
Mr. Moynihan will get a bonus of $9.05 million in the form of restricted stock, along with a base salary of $950,000, bringing his total pay to $10 million for 2010. In 2009, before Mr. Moynihan took over as chief executive, he received a total of $6.1 million in compensation.
Mr. Moynihan's base salary did not go up, however, and he received no cash bonus, a reflection of Bank of America's slow recovery from the financial crisis, when it received two bailouts from Washington totaling $45 billion. What is more, Mr. Moynihan will have to fulfill performance goals to earn the full $9.05 million.
Other top officers of the company did receive a cash bonus of $900,000, but it will be paid in monthly installments and is tied to the stock price.
''All of the year-end compensation was deferred and tied to some measure of stockholder value,'' said Bob Stickler, a spokesman for the company.
The bailout money has been paid back to the federal government, but mortgage-related losses and write-downs resulted in a loss of $2.2 billion in 2010. Other businesses, like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, performed better, but Bank of America's shares have lagged those of rivals.
Echoing Wall Street's rebound, Tom Montag, the head of the global banking and markets unit, received more than Mr. Moynihan, getting $14.3 million in restricted stock. His base salary will increase by $50,000, to $850,000.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the pay structure reflected ''a unique and critical transition year for the company.''
Bank of America's earnings power is expected to strengthen this year, as losses on loans ease and the nation's economy gradually recovers. But the foreclosure practices of Bank of America and other large mortgage servicers remain under investigation by all 50 state attorneys general, and that controversy is likely to continue to overshadow positive news on the profit front.
As the nation's biggest mortgage servicer, Bank of America handles one in five home loans in the United States. It halted foreclosures nationwide in October after questions arose about its internal practices, including the use of so-called robo-signers to approve thousands of documents a month with only a cursory review.
Since taking over in January 2010, Mr. Moynihan has focused on restoring Bank of America's relationships with regulators while solidifying its balance sheet and selling off peripheral businesses. He also settled billions in claims over soured mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie, the government-controlled entities that dominate the mortgage market.
While bonuses are down sharply from the boom years, other bank executives are also receiving substantial pay packages. Last week, Goldman Sachs disclosed that its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, received a total of $13.2 million in cash and stock.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Concerns About Egypt Push Oil Prices Higher

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
Crude oil prices and stocks rose on Monday as the financial markets continued to keep an eye on the situation in Egypt.
Nervous investors sold stocks on Friday as the protests in Egypt gathered momentum. But on Monday the stock market opened slightly higher, helped by new reports about the American economy as well as corporate earnings and mergers.
Crude oil, which jumped 3.7 percent on Friday, surged again on Monday. The price of crude rose $2.85, or 3.19 percent, to settle at $92.19 a barrel in New York trading. 
In London, one benchmark for oil closed above $100 a barrel on Monday for the first time since 2008. The benchmark, Brent crude, rose $1.59 a barrel, to $101.01 on the ICE Futures exchange.
''When the Egypt situation arose, it seemed like Friday was more of a day of protecting positions ahead of the weekend,'' said Thomas Bentz, an energy analyst with BNP Paribas.
''We had the initial pullback,'' Mr. Bentz said. ''But obviously things are still uncertain in the region even though there has been no loss of output or crude movement in the region. The market is building the fear premium back into prices. We had an early correction but prices have rebounded.''
Companies affected by the Middle East -- like those related to shipping, energy operations and emerging markets -- monitored events closely. But sentiment appeared to be in a holding pattern.
''The situation is going on still in Egypt, and at least right now shipping continues unabated with shipping through the Suez Canal and Sumed pipeline,'' Mr. Bentz said, referring to the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.23 points, or 0.58 percent, to 11,891.93.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 9.78 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,286.12.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 13.19 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,700.08.
Energy stocks climbed more than 2 percent, pulling up the broader market.
Shares of Massey Energy, the coal company, registered the largest gain, soaring 9.84 percent, or $5.63, to $62.86. Alpha Natural Resources announced on Saturday that it would buy Massey for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock. Shares of Alpha declined 7.17 percent, or $4.15, to $53.73.
Exxon Mobilreported a 53 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit, helped by an improving economy that has lifted demand and crude prices.
Profit in the quarter was $9.25 billion, compared with $6.05 billion in the period a year ago. Shares of Exxon rose 2.14 percent, or $1.69, to $80.68.
Chryslersaid Monday that it ended 2010 with a $199 million loss in the fourth quarter, but it said it would to return to profitability this year with the help of new products.
Intel cut its first-quarter revenue forecast by $300 million on Monday because of costs associated with correcting a design flaw that it discovered in a chip. Intel said it did not expect the problem to have a material effect on full-year revenue.
Shares of Intel dipped more than 1 percent after the announcement but ended the day unchanged at $21.46.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.7 percent in December, and nominal personal income rose 0.4 percent, in line with forecasts. Wage and salary income increased by 0.3 percent.
While the data was essentially a sideshow to the global events, investors were still watching for signs of whether tentative improvements in the United States economy could be sustained.
''You have to keep your eye on it,'' said Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy for Glenmede. ''The U.S. economy has officially transitioned from recovery to expansion.''
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 13/32, to 93 26/32. The yield rose to 3.37 percent, from 3.32 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Trade Organization Ruling Is Said to Affirm That Boeing Received Improper Subsidies

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK and CHRISTOPHER DREW; Nicola Clark reported from Paris and Christopher Drew from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- A panel at the World Trade Organization ruled on Monday that Boeing had received up to $5 billion in improper subsidies for its 787 Dreamliner and other jets, giving it an unfair advantage against its European rival, Airbus, European officials said.
The confidential ruling affirmed the W.T.O's interim findings in September in response to a longstanding complaint by Europe over United States government support of Boeing, officials briefed on the decision said. 
The panel's ruling came just weeks ahead of an expected decision by the Pentagon on a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with aerial refueling tankers.
Airbus said it expected the final W.T.O. report to say that Boeing would not have been able to start the Dreamliner project without illegal subsidies. But Boeing responded that it would have built the plane just as it had even without the subsidies.
European Union officials hope that the findings would undercut complaints by American lawmakers that Boeing is facing a subsidized rival in Airbus in the tanker contest.
''This solid report sheds further light on the negative consequences for the E.U. industry of these U.S. subsidies and provides a timely element of balance in this long-running dispute,'' said John Clancy, a spokesman for the European Union's trade commissioner.
The W.T.O's ruling is subject to appeal. But it could bring a protracted battle over aircraft subsidies to a climax and help shift the competitive landscape.
Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, would not discuss the findings. But she said officials in Washington remained ''confident that the W.T.O. will confirm the U.S. view that European subsidies to Airbus dwarf any subsidies that the United States provided to Boeing.''
In a case decided last June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the top jet builder.
That ruling concluded that Airbus had received $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants to produce its six best-selling models, including the A380 superjumbo. It also concluded that it ''would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,'' without the subsidies.
The ruling on Monday was on a countersuit by Europe contending that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in research subsidies from federal space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states.
American officials have said the subsidies found to be improper amounted to less than $5 billion.
An Airbus spokeswoman, Maggie Bergsma, said the company estimated it had lost as much as $45 billion in sales to Boeing from 2001 and 2006 as a result of the subsidies.
Boeing, meanwhile, has asserted that low-interest loans to Airbus have yielded benefits to the European plane maker valued at as much as $200 billion in today's dollars.
Both sides have strained to calculate the largest numbers they can in terms of economic harm. The W.T.O. has not quantified the damages.
European officials have focused on contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Defense Department since the late 1970s to research lightweight carbon composite materials similar to those used in the 787 Dreamliner.
About half of the 787's structure is made of the fuel-efficient materials, more than on any other jetliner.
With 847 orders worth $90 billion to $100 billion, the 787 -- despite a series of manufacturing hiccups -- is the fastest-selling plane ever. Boeing is counting on it to move back ahead of Airbus in total sales.
The Americans have said that only $2.6 billion of the NASA research money was found to have involved subsidies, compared with $10 billion claimed by Europe.
But one person in Europe, who would speak only anonymously since the findings were confidential, said the latest report singled out eight NASA programs and about 130 contracts from 2001-6 as involving some form of illegal subsidies.
The bulk of those contracts could be connected to the 787 development program, the person said, though many were also linked to Boeing's 777 and 737 models.
The trade panel pegged the value of the tax advantages from Washington State, Kansas and Illinois at $400 million, though Boeing was to receive more later. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program canceled in 2006.

HEADLINE: Exxon Profit Increases 53%, Helped by Higher Oil Prices

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 53 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit on Monday, helped by an improving world economy that has increased energy demand and crude prices.
It was the strongest quarterly profit in more than two years, reflecting the strong recovery in oil markets. They soared in 2007 and 2008, collapsed in 2009, and returned to loftier heights by the end of 2010.
''It's a home run,'' said Fadel Gheit, managing director for oil and gas research at Oppenheimer & Company. ''It's a big positive earnings surprise on strong operating results across all business segments underpinned by strong production growth, higher oil and gas prices and improved margins.'' 
Exxon's performance was in line with the strong results of most other large energy companies, which have benefited not only from rising oil prices but also from improved margins in their refinery businesses.
Nevertheless, the results do not equal the record profits set a few years ago, when oil and gas prices were far higher than they were at the end of last year or even today.
Oil prices have been steadily creeping up in recent months to over $90 a barrel, settling on Monday at $92.19. The turbulence in Egypt has made traders skittish about the possibility of shortages of supplies if the Suez Canal is somehow blocked or political tensions spread to nearby Saudi Arabia. But natural gas prices, which are increasingly important to big oil companies, which have been increasing their gas investments in recent years, remain depressed.
Oil and gas prices rose again on Monday, with developments in Egypt serving as a reminder that the energy markets were vulnerable to political events in such vital producing countries as Nigeria, Iraq and Iran, which did not suffer major production interruptions in 2010.
Rising political tensions mixed with continued growth in economic demand usually means higher energy prices. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries still has the capacity to produce more oil in the event of a slowdown in traffic in the Suez Canal or interruptions in production in one or two producing countries.
Exxon Mobil's profit in the quarter was $9.25 billion, or $1.85 a share, compared with $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share in the period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.63 a share. Total revenue in the quarter was $105.2 billion, up from $89.8 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
For the year, Exxon Mobil made $30.46 billion, or $6.22 a share, compared with $19.28 billion, or $3.98 a share, for 2009. Revenue for 2010 rose to $383 billion from $310 billion the previous year.
Exxon Mobil said its production increased 19 percent in the quarter. Gas production in the United States has tripled as a result of the company's acquisition of XTO Energy and other purchases of companies with shale field operations around the country. Gas now accounts for almost half of the company's production, up from 43 percent a year ago.
Earnings from the company's upstream business, which includes oil and gas production, rose to $7.48 billion in the quarter from $5.78 billion in the period a year earlier.
The company's refining and marketing business reported earnings of $1.15 billion after a loss a year ago, driven by higher refining margins.
''Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize shareholder value,'' said David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, during a conference call.
Shares of Exxon Mobil rose $1.69 , or 2.1 percent, to $80.68 on Monday. Most other oil companies also gained.
Chevron, the No. 2 American oil company, reported on Friday that fourth-quarter earnings were 72 percent higher than the preceding year's. The third-largest, ConocoPhillips, reported that its quarterly profit climbed 46 percent. The earnings reports have been overshadowed by the developments in Egypt, which have caused a sharp upturn in oil prices over the last week.
Egypt is not a major oil producer, and rising domestic demand in recent years has converted the country into a net importer.
But 1.8 million barrels pass through the Suez Canal every day, and the Sumed pipeline carries another 1.1 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The canal is also a major transit route for liquefied natural gas to Europe. There has been no disruption of gas or oil flows so far.
Several Western oil companies operate in Egypt, including BP and Apache, contributing to the country's production of more than 650,000 barrels a day. The most vulnerable is Apache, a middle-size Houston-based oil and gas producer that relies on Egypt for as much as a fifth of its oil production. But so far, the unrest has had little impact on exploration and production since the oil fields are far away from major population centers.
''Our people are safe, and we are monitoring the situation,'' William A. Mintz, an Apache spokesman, said.

HEADLINE: China, Concerned About Unrest, Censors the Internet

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and DAVID BARBOZA; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and David Barboza from Shanghai. Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting from Beijing. Chen Xiaoduan contributed research from Shanghai.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In another era, China's leaders might have been content to let discussion of the protests in Egypt float around among private citizens, then fizzle out.
But challenges in recent years to authoritarian governments around the globe and violent uprisings in parts of China itself have made Chinese officials increasingly wary of leaving such talk unchecked, especially on the Internet, the medium some officials see as central to fanning the flames of unrest.
So the arbiters of speech sprang into action over the weekend. Sina.com and Netease.com -- two of the nation's biggest online portals -- blocked keyword searches of the word ''Egypt,'' though the mass protests were being discussed on some Internet chat rooms on Monday. Searching for ''Egypt'' has also been blocked on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 
Censoring the Internet is not the only approach. The Chinese government has also tried to get out ahead of the discussion, framing the Egyptian protests in a few editorials and articles in state-controlled news publications as a chaotic affair that embodies the pitfalls of trying to plant democracy in countries that are not quite ready for it -- a line China's leaders have long held.
The English-language edition of Global Times, a populist newspaper, ran an editorial on Sunday about the Tunisian and Egyptian protests with the headline ''Color revolutions will not bring about real democracy.'' Though Global Times is not the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, the message of the editorial was consistent with official thinking, saying bluntly that whether democracy ''is applicable in other countries is in question, as more and more unsuccessful examples arise.''
''The official Chinese media is reporting the Egypt events -- it's no longer possible for Xinhua and other official media to remain credible if they hide international news that people can learn from the Internet,'' said Susan L. Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who served as assistant deputy secretary of state during the Clinton administration. ''But they reduce the risk that some Chinese might want to emulate them by describing them as 'anti-government riots.'''
Some Chinese news organizations have also seized on the ambivalent American reaction to the Egyptian unrest to underscore the hypocrisy of the United States in sometimes backing dictators over democracy. They argued that those who appear to be the greatest advocates of democracy sometimes have conflicted feelings about its spread, especially in the Middle East, where the United States fears the proliferation of populist radical Islam. China Youth Daily noted in an editorial on Sunday that ''the increasing turmoil in Egypt is causing a 'headache' for the decision makers in Washington.''
Some of the news coverage of Egypt that has appeared in People's Daily, the Communist Party's main newspaper, and Xinhua, the official news agency, has focused on attempts by China to evacuate its citizens, simply leaving out the political discontent at the root of the unrest. Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on Internet censorship in China, said propaganda officials had recently ordered Chinese news organizations and Web sites to strictly follow Xinhua reports on Egypt.
But Mr. Xiao said some Internet forums were closely tracking the events in Egypt. ''I can see the Egypt story being followed and discussed by active netizens everywhere -- blogs, forums, social networking services like Kaixin and Renren,'' he said. ''It's just not on the front page of major Web sites.''
The Chinese authorities' efforts to censor and shape news on the Internet have evolved over the past few years, as they grappled with unrest during the Tibet riots in 2008 and protests against the Olympic torch relay. The authorities initiated a crackdown on pornography and other ''harmful information,'' including shuttering a popular liberal forum, soon after the release of Charter 08, an online manifesto calling for gradual democratic reforms that gathered thousands of signatures through e-mail.
Internet controls ramped up in late 2009, when officials observed how social networking sites and other forums helped inflame unrelated outbursts of protests and rioting in Iran and Xinjiang, the restive region in China's west.
In an August 2009 article on the Iran protests, a monthly journal published by the central propaganda department warned of the challenge posed by sites like Twitter and Facebook, which the authorities had blocked days after riots in Xinjiang. In January 2010, after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a new United States policy to counter online censorship abroad, an editorial published by People's Daily charged that the United States had used the Internet -- YouTube and Twitter in particular -- to stir up ''online warfare'' against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president.
The Internet's influence on the volatile events in Iran and Xinjiang ''impacted the leadership like an earthquake,'' said one media investor with high-level ties to China's regulators who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of damaging that relationship.
The fact that social networking sites have fueled the protests in Egypt will no doubt spur Chinese officials to further scrutinize such sites. And they may be right to pay attention: Zhao Jing, a liberal Chinese blogger who goes by the name of Michael Anti, said that ''it was amazing netizens on Twitter cared about Egypt so much'' that they had begun drawing parallels between China and Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was being called Mu Xiaoping, a reference to Deng Xiaoping, who quashed the 1989 popular protests in Beijing, while Tahrir Square in Cairo was being compared to Tiananmen Square.
Yet, there are intellectuals in Beijing skeptical of any similar protests arising in China, mainly because this nation's dynamic economy has given many Chinese hope for a better life.
''I don't think dissemination of such news would cause unrest in China,'' said Jia Qingguo, associate dean of international relations at Peking University. ''Egypt is a different type of political regime from China. They are also not a socialist country. They have their own particular problems.''

HEADLINE: The Treasury Department's Warrior at the Negotiating Table

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - When David N. Miller joined the Treasury Department during the height of the financial crisis, the government's bailout programs weren't expected to break even, let alone turn a profit.
But last week, the Treasury Department's sale of its warrants in Citigroup, the last of the government's stake in the firm, fetched $312.2 million, highlighting what has been a steady and, so far, profitable unwinding of taxpayers' holdings in financial institutions.
Helping spearhead the unwinding is Mr. Miller, a former investment banker who is the department's chief investment officer of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Mr. Miller and his team of 30 have taken part in many of the biggest deals over the last two years, including huge capital infusions into Citigroup and Bank of America and General Motors' $23.1 billion initial public offering in November. 
''David was always at the table for major decisions,'' said Herbert M. Allison Jr., the former assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability. ''He always had constructed well-thought-out, informed decisions along the way. I give him a lot of credit for the success of the TARP program.''
The billions of dollars in profit - $35 billion as of December - that have come from the sales of warrants and shares, Treasury officials say, validate the approach they have taken with TARP in the months after the financial crisis. That wasn't clear a year ago, when critics scoffed at the idea that the government could recoup much of the $700 billion spent propping up the financial system.
More work needs to be done, including further sales of G.M. stock and big share offerings for the American International Group, Ally Financial and Chrysler.
The Treasury Department estimates that TARP will cost $29 billion, compared with Congressional Budget Office estimates of $25 billion. (Excluding the housing programs, the Treasury Department expects to turn a profit.)
Some accused the government of making too many concessions to the banks. The banks, on the other hand, thought the department was not being realistic and was asking too much.
''There were a number of situations where banks accused us of being crazy,'' Mr. Miller said.
Tim Massad, the acting assistant secretary for financial stability and Mr. Miller's boss, said of him: ''He's very cool under pressure, and he's on top of the details.''
Sitting in his office, however, the soft-spoken Mr. Miller doesn't come across as a grizzled warrior of the negotiating table. At 34, he is still boyish looking, albeit with a touch of gray at his temples.
A graduate of Dartmouth and Harvard Business School, Mr. Miller worked for Goldman Sachs in the firm's special situations group, focusing on precisely the kinds of distressed investments that the government would later make in troubled banks.
The financial crisis, however, persuaded him to try to contribute to a solution in 2008.
''I had felt a need to a calling - what can I do to help?'' Mr. Miller said. ''I always wanted to go into public service.''
A letter he sent to the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., led to an appointment with Neel T. Kashkari, a top lieutenant. Almost immediately, Mr. Miller was asked to work with what began as a bare-bones team of a dozen individuals to flesh out specific programs underneath the TARP umbrella.
Under Mr. Miller's predecessor, Jim Lambright, the Treasury investment office put together a series of significant programs. Chief among these was the Capital Purchase Program, in which the government was given up to $250 billion to buy preferred shares in more than 500 banks to bolster their financial health.
Mr. Miller and his colleagues pulled many all-nighters in working out details of the program, living on Twinkies and Diet Coke from vending machines at 2 a.m.
Even by mid-January 2009, the team was still staying up for 36 hours at a time, working on asset guarantee programs for Citigroup and Bank of America ahead of their earnings announcements. One such agreement was completed at 1 a.m. - before the investment office had to shift to another deal.
The Public-Private Investment Program, in which the government invested alongside private asset managers, was devised in a matter of weeks. (So far, the government's investment has grown 27 percent since its creation in 2009.)
But one of the biggest tests for the Treasury team has been negotiating with banks over the repurchase of warrants issued as part of their TARP bailouts. After internal calculations how much the warrants were worth, Mr. Miller helped spearhead a strategy for dealing with banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
These firms could name their price - but without guidance from the government, which would simply reject the bids if they fell short. Some banks rebid several times before reaching a deal with Treasury officials, according to Mr. Allison. Some banks' starting offers were as little as one-third of the department's own valuations, he added.
''We had developed quite a sophisticated approach to negotiating with the banks,'' Mr. Allison said. ''In a number of cases, banks paid us more than we calculated what the warrants were worth.''
An analysis by the special inspector general for TARP published last May found that, on average, the department had done well by taxpayers. ''To its credit, Treasury has generally succeeded in negotiating prices from recipients for the warrants at or above its estimated composite value,'' the report said.
JPMorgan decided to let the government auction its warrants, returning $936 million to the Treasury. Goldman paid $1.1 billion for its warrants, generating what experts have said was a healthy return for taxpayers. But Morgan Stanley paid $950 million, which critics said was too little.
(In his report, the overseer cited interviews as saying that Mr. Allison had actually tipped his hand in the talks with Morgan Stanley, specifically about a price point that the government would accept. Both Treasury officials and the special inspector general said that Morgan Stanley still paid more than the government's value of the warrants.)
Mr. Miller lives north of New York, and leaves his wife and three children every Monday to drive to Washington, often taking conference calls early on Monday morning or late on Friday afternoon during his commute. (When not on speakerphone, he listens to audiobooks on history or economics.)
He hasn't decided when he will leave the department, though he says his next job will undoubtedly be quieter.
''I'm sure that what I do next won't be quite as consequential,'' he said.
While the TARP office is not as busy as it was during the crisis months, Mr. Miller says more work needs to be done. And he says he is keen to work himself out of a job: ''I don't want us to need another TARP again.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tuesday's Forecast: Horrific

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Government budgets around the nation, already busted by the bad economy, now have a new nemesis: Mother Nature.
Yet another winter storm is going to heap more ice and snow across a huge section of the country this week, meaning yet another big bill, on top of a lot of other big bills, for all the towns and cities that have to dig out again.
''On a weather map, some people see snowflakes, I see dollar signs,'' said R. T. Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis, as a light snowfall brightened the white mounds lining the city streets. 
Not that officials have any choice. The streets have to be cleared, of course, but often with fewer plows and less salt than in years past.
Many cities -- New York among them -- have already overspent their snow budgets and many more expect this storm to push them into the red. In Minneapolis, a record-setting series of snowstorms in December pushed the city over the snow-removal budget for 2010 by $3.3 million -- more than the city spends on pothole repairs for the entire year.
Virg Bernero, mayor of Lansing, Mich., said that the snowstorm came at a ''desperate time'' for the city and that paying for snow removal would force him to make cuts elsewhere.
But, echoing the warnings of a number of mayors, he said that experience (and an uprising that forced him to make a public apology) has taught him not to skimp when it comes to plowing.
''The snow must be dealt with,'' Mr. Bernero said. ''The streets must be made safe.''
The expected damage from the storm is likely to take days to determine, but it was poised to deliver to the center of the country an unusually treacherous mix of snow, sleet, ice and high winds, inspiring forecasters to escalate the disaster rhetoric to an audience famously inured to extreme weather.
The cities bracing for the biggest impact include Milwaukee, St. Louis and Chicago, where the National Weather Service predicted more than 18 inches of snow, which would be the most for one storm in at least a decade. It also warned of potentially deadly conditions.
There were warnings for much of the Midwest, too, that high winds could lower visibility so much that plows could not operate, forcing roads to be closed.
''When you hear the word historic come up, you're a little more concerned,'' said R. Mark DeVries, maintenance superintendent with McHenry County Department of Transportation, northwest of Chicago.
''Certainly we haven't had a storm with this potential in many, many years,'' Mr. DeVries said. ''But regardless of whether it reaches historic proportions or not, we expect it will be very difficult to work through.''
The Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for 19 states, from New Mexico to Vermont, and blizzard warnings for six Midwestern states, including Missouri where there were predictions of as much as an inch of ice accumulation around St. Louis.
The governors of several states declared emergencies related to the storm. And schools, businesses and government offices throughout the region were closed in advance.
The snow was not expected to start falling across much of the Midwest until Monday night, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist for the Weather Service in Missouri. The storm was expected to strengthen through Tuesday and begin moving east on Wednesday, possibly lasting until Friday, she said.
''It is a really significant storm,'' Ms. Fortin said. ''It's going to be something that a lot of people remember.''
Crews started working in earnest on Monday to get ahead of the mess, and in many cases they were hampered by fewer resources at their disposal. The city of Milwaukee, for example, has significantly cut back on the amount of salt bought.
Public works departments around the nation have been among the hardest hit by budget cuts, with 60 percent of cities and 68 percent of counties reporting reductions -- far more than those that reported cutting social services, parks or libraries, according to a survey taken last summer by the National League of Cities.
But a number of city leaders said that they would have to find financing for snow removal -- which in Kansas City costs about $150,000 an inch -- even if it meant moving money from other worthwhile projects.
''It doesn't make too much difference what's in the budget,'' said Richard L. Hanneman, former president of the Salt Institute, a trade association.
''If the citizens want the roads cleared, politicians will find a way to clear the roads,'' Mr. Hanneman said. ''And if they go over budget, they will figure out how to let the grass grow longer or the potholes grow deeper to find the money somehow.''

HEADLINE: Patience Pays In the Oil Patch

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Major oil firms have become big spenders. Together, the top three American giants say they plan capital spending this year of about $60 billion, well above the year of peak crude prices in 2008, despite showing only tepid cash flow growth. At first blush, this looks like desperation, as Western oil companies increasingly struggle to replace crude reserves. But patient investors will find higher returns are on the way.
Investments in a host of megaprojects, along with higher prices for services and parts, have compelled Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips to open their wallets ever wider. Exxon, led by its chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, disclosed on Monday that full-year spending was up by a fifth in 2010. Collectively, spending at the triumvirate will be roughly 20 percent higher than in 2008. 
In return for these investments, oil companies expect production growth of less than 2 percent a year between 2010 and 2013. And free cash flow for the three companies -- after capital outlays -- has declined by nearly a quarter, to $34 billion, from 2005. With spending gobbling so much of the spoils, the closely watched measure of return on capital deployed is under pressure. As a result, the three oil majors trade at just 11.5 times 2011 earnings, a discount to the broader equity market.
This may be the dark before the dawn, though. In the coming years, cash flow should ramp up faster than production. Huge liquefied natural gas projects, like Chevron's Gorgon in Australia, will be prolific cash generators. A shift toward fiscally friendly rich nations will also help. And cash margins on crude from the Gulf of Mexico and Canadian oil sands are fatter than energy firms have become used to.
Of course, it will take time for these to kick in. As they do, however, cash flow at oil companies could rise 6 percent a year to 2017, according to Credit Suisse estimates. In the meantime, oil chiefs would be unwise to simply wait. To get better multiples now, bolder steps are needed -- dumping less desirable assets or, better still, spinning off refineries.
The Default Bet
Betting on Treasury yields rising is one thing; trading the chance of default is another. United States credit-default swap volumes have spiked in recent weeks. The swap activity around American debt is still hardly mainstream. But unsustainable federal borrowing is tarnishing the debt market's once pristine, risk-free benchmark.
Plenty of investors are concerned about the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and inflationary pressures on Treasury bond yields. Unlike less liquid corporate bonds, though, there are already many very efficient ways to hedge against a rise in interest rates. Aside from possible arbitrage opportunities, what the swap market adds is the ability to bet on an actual default by the government.
Treasury-related default swap contracts worth nearly $1.4 billion changed hands in the two weeks ended Jan. 21, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation -- two-and-a-half times the average activity over the previous six months. Trading is still relatively thin. But the surge in activity points to an intensifying investor perception that the possibility of a government default can no longer be completely dismissed.
The price to protect against a Treasury default has been rising, too. It has reached $51,000 a year for five years for every $10 million of debt, about the highest price in nearly a year.
That's still less even than protection against default by Germany, reflecting that it's still highly unlikely America will walk away from its debt, even temporarily. But a projected deficit of a whopping $1.5 trillion this year, a debt load held by the public that could double to $18 trillion in 10 years and talk in Congress about a possible default if lawmakers can't agree on an increase in the permitted maximum amount of debt have all made a default seem imaginable. That's part of the eventual threat to America's top credit rating recently highlighted by the rating agency Moody's Investors Service.
Debt market investors don't, as yet, have an alternative yardstick for risk-free credit. And America's obligations may yet recapture that unquestioned status. But credit-default swap activity is one sign the fallout of the financial crisis is gradually changing perceptions about America's creditworthiness -- perhaps irreparably.

HEADLINE: Obama's Proposal to End Oil Subsidies Revives a Long Debate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When he releases his new budget in two weeks, President Obamawill propose doing away with roughly $4 billion a year in subsidies and tax breaks for oil companies, in his third effort to eliminate federal support for an industry that remains hugely profitable.
Previous efforts have run up against bipartisan opposition in Congress and heavy lobbying from producers of oil, natural gas and coal. The head of the oil and gas lobby in Washington contends that the president has it backward -- that the industry subsidizes the government, through billions of dollars in taxes and royalties, not the other way around.
But even as the president says he wants to do away with incentives for fossil fuels, his policies continue to provide for substantial aid to oil and gas companies as well as billions of dollars in subsidies for coal, nuclear and other energy sources with large and long-lasting environmental impacts. 
Mr. Obama's proposal rekindles a long-running debate over federal subsidies for energy of all kinds, including petroleum, coal, hydropower, wind, solar and biofuels. Opposition to such subsidies -- often euphemistically referred to as incentives, tax credits, preferences or loan guarantees -- spans the ideological spectrum, from conservative economists who believe such breaks distort the marketplace to environmentalists who believe that renewable energy sources will always lose out in subsidy fights because of the power of the entrenched fossil fuel industries.
David W. Kreutzer, an energy economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that the federal government should take its thumb off the scale by eliminating subsidies for all forms of energy, even it if means slowing development of cleaner-burning fuel sources.
''We would like to get rid of all subsidies,'' Dr. Kreutzer said. ''We know that petroleum and coal survive just fine in places where there are no subsidies. I don't know if that's true for wind and solar now, but someday it will be, when the price comes down.''
H. Jeffrey Leonard, president of the Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm that invests in clean-technology ventures, said that the current subsidy structure was the legacy of 60 years of lobbying and political jockeying in Washington that largely benefits oil, coal, nuclear power and corn-based ethanol. He calls for scrapping all subsidies and letting fuel sources compete on equal ground.
Mr. Obama is not willing to go that far. He has supported favored tax treatment for wind and solar power as well as a 50 percent increase in federal research spending on other alternative energy sources. He also has proposed as much as $50 billion in federal loan guarantees for nuclear power plant construction, money he believes is needed because the private market is unwilling to assume the potential costs of a catastrophic accident.
Energy economists say that the president's call in the State of the Union address for doubling the amount of electricity produced from cleaner technology by 2035 is designed to manipulate energy markets, forcing utilities to shift to the government's preferred sources of energy on the government's timetable, although leaving to them the choice of fuels.
A White House spokesman put it a bit more benignly. ''The plan the president outlined would establish a clear goal for clean energy and let utilities achieve that in the most cost-effective way possible,'' the official said.
Mr. Obama's policies encourage utilities to switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas to generate electricity, which simply substitutes one fossil fuel for another and helps subsidize natural gas exploration and distribution. The president is also proposing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants and oil refineries, another hidden subsidy for fossil fuels.
And, many environmentalists argue, every day that goes by without a policy to put a price on carbon emissions from all sources is a day in which the federal government subsidizes energy producers by socializing the long-term health and environmental costs of their products.
''My view is the country is better off on having a neutral playing field for all forms of energy,'' said Douglas Koplow, founder of Earth Track, a group in Cambridge, Mass., that studies global energy subsidies.
''President Obama defines 'clean fuels' as natural gas, coal with carbon capture, nuclear,'' Mr. Koplow said. ''From my perspective, if you subsidize carbon capture and storage, that's a big subsidy for coal. Nuclear is massively subsidized through a risk transfer from shareholders to ratepayers. It's hard to justify these technologies that can't make it on their own.''
''If we're really concerned about greenhouse gases, we should deal with the problem and cap them,'' he added. ''Instead, politicians and lobbyists want to carve out policies for their own industries.''
Mr. Obama specifically proposes to eliminate roughly $4 billion a year in more than a half-dozen tax exemptions for oil and gas companies and an additional $200 million a year in preferences for coal. The tax breaks for oil have a long history -- the so-called percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas wells dates to the 1920s -- and have withstood repeated efforts to kill them.
The president proposed a global end to such subsidies at the Group of 20 meeting in 2009, and while most nations endorsed the idea in theory, little has been done. And Mr. Obama will have a tough fight trying to get even these relatively modest proposals enacted over the objections of the oil and coal industries, who argue that such tax treatment is necessary to keep drillers drilling and miners mining.
''This is a tired old argument we've been hearing for two years now,'' said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's main lobby in Washington. ''If the president were serious about job creation, he would be working with us to develop American oil and gas by American workers for American consumers.''
Mr. Gerard noted that there was bipartisan opposition to lifting the tax breaks, adding: ''The federal government by no stretch of the imagination subsidizes the oil industry. The oil industry subsidizes the federal government at a rate of $95 million a day.''
Michael Levi, an energy and climate change analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, said calls for an end to energy subsidies missed a broader point: that embryonic energy technologies will need some government help to gain a foothold against the fossil fuel lobbies.
''I'd love to find a quick fix for America's energy problems just as much as the next guy,'' Mr. Levi wrote last week on his blog.
''I'd also be delighted to have a reason to cut subsidies, many of which are hugely wasteful,'' he added. ''But an effort to eliminate all energy subsidies without instituting better alternative policies should be understood for what it is: a recipe for cementing the dominance of traditional fossil fuels against their competitors.''

HEADLINE: Explaining Egypt

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: There are as many explanations for events in Egypt as there are agendas. My favorites? Phones and urbanization. 

 BODY:
[May 8, 3:50 p.m. | Updated | Researchers report in the journal Science that rising temperatures have hurt corn and wheat harvests in some countries, but not others (including the United States). They also fond that gains in other crops related to climate shifts and rising carbon dioxide levels have largely offset the overall impact of climate change so far. In a news report in Science, John Reilly, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology specializing in climate, cast doubt on the findings.]
Everyone with an agenda seems to be able to find it reflected in the extraordinary events unfolding onthe streets of Egypt (and earlier, Tunisia, and now Jordan).
It's social networking. It's a youth bulge in the absence of economic opportunity. It's a strongman who reached too far in stifling dissent and grooming a son for the presidency. It's the economy.
In the environmental community, some have tried to finger high food prices, and even -- as a contributor to food costs -- global warming.
But in coordinating mass action, and then communicating it to others, both inside and outside of Egypt, I can't imagine any factor being more influential than the one reflected in the graphs below. This is the explosive growth in the use of mobile phones in developing countries.
Economies and climate conditions surge and ebb, but connectivity and communication are spreading and cresting in a one-way flood tide of information and imagery.
Here's Egypt:
Here's Tunisia:
Here's the world, developing and developed:
Inflation comes and goes. Heat waves and floods come and go (more frequently with warming, sure). But there's something new and fundamentally different going on, it seems.
Noosphere, anyone?
Combine that with humanity's urban rush and you can get concentrated, collaborative, coordinated consequential action.

HEADLINE: China Is Poised to Raise Rates Again, Bankers Say

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's government, increasingly worried about soaring inflation, plans to continue tightening its money supply and will probably raise interest rates again within the month.
That is the forecast of economists and bankers with knowledge of policy makers' views, who insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of Chinese monetary policy.
Inflation lately has caused friction in China's mighty export machine. Now, Beijing's efforts to fight inflation, through higher interest rates and tighter restrictions on bank loans, could begin to slow segments of China's domestic economy slightly -- particularly the breakneck pace of investment in new factories, office buildings and apartment complexes. 
That, in turn, could weaken demand for industrial materials like steel and copper that depend heavily on Chinese purchases.
And yet, the tighter-money policies and higher interest rates could be good news for Chinese consumers, whose spending China has been counting on for its next wave of growth -- not only to help balance the country's export-dominated economy but to enable more of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens to share in its prosperity.
For one thing, a slowdown in speculative construction could slow or even temporarily reverse the long rise of Chinese real estate prices, as 15 million people a year pour into the cities.
And while much of the construction spending, and the loans that fuel it, involve state-owned companies, households in China are typically savers, not borrowers. They pay for most cars and other large purchases with cash. Even for new homes, they typically borrow half or less of the purchase price.
So far, consumers frequently hold large bank deposits that earn interest rates well below the inflation rate. Higher interest on savings accounts, if the new policies allow, would only improve consumer purchasing power.
Much of China's inflation is being fueled by the extraordinary growth in its money supply, broadly measured as so-called M2, which has soared a total of nearly 53 percent in the last two years. That is largely a result of the country's aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus program in 2009 and early 2010, as Beijing essentially printed money in response to the global financial crisis.
Although China's economy is a little less than half that of the United States, its money supply is now one-quarter larger than America's.
Since the beginning of last year, Beijing has moved several times to start clamping back down on the money in circulation, by increasing the required amounts that banks must hold in reserve, leaving them with less money to lend. The central bank has raised this requirement seven times in the last 13 months, with four of those increases coming in quick succession since mid-November.
The bank has also been raising interest rates. The benchmark rate for one-year corporate loans is now 5.81 percent, up from 5.31 percent a year ago. The central bank has already raised rates twice since late October, and is poised to raise them again this month, the economists and bankers said.
Economists at international banks tend to agree that China needs to take even further action to limit inflation.
''We believe Beijing must act more decisively on credit tightening to stop inflation from rising too fast,'' said Qu Hongbin, the chief China economist at HSBC, in a research note on Monday.
China's consumer price index climbed 4.6 percent last year. But Chinese and Western economists say the index seriously underestimates inflation because of shortcomings in how it measures the introduction of new garments and other goods and because it entirely excludes the cost of owner-occupied housing. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has said it is working on improving the index.
One policy change Beijing is unlikely to take soon is letting the currency, the renminbi, appreciate faster as a way to fight inflation, the economists and bankers said.
The renminbi has already been rising at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent against the dollar since China broke the currency's peg to the dollar last June. China's central bank continues to intervene heavily in currency markets to brake the renminbi's rise, but not enough to stop the renminbi from rising altogether -- as it did for almost two years before last June.
The Obama administration, arguing that an artificially low renminbi gave Chinese exporters an unfair price advantage over Western companies, pushed China hard a year ago to break the link to the dollar. But Washington has been slightly less vocal on the subject more recently. It barely came up in public comments by either side after President Hu Jintao of China's recent state visit to the White House.
Lately, Chinese and American policy makers have been looking at the so-called real effective exchange rate, which includes differences in the two countries' inflation levels. Inflation in the United States is currently running at a rate of only about 1.5 percent.
Depending on which inflation index is chosen in each country, and whether any adjustments are made for the consistent underestimates of Chinese inflation because of methodology problems, the real effective exchange rate measure shows that the renminbi is strengthening by 10 percent or more a year against the dollar.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has said that this real exchange rate is showing that Chinese exporters already face rising costs as they try to stay competitive in the United States market.
There has been some uncertainty in financial markets since Mr. Hu announced in early December that the country would pursue a ''stable'' monetary policy.
But the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has signaled in no fewer than a dozen statements since Mr. Hu's remarks that it plans to throttle back the torrents of money still sloshing through the Chinese economy. And a policy paper from the central bank this winter indicated that, in Beijing, ''stable'' can in fact mean ''tighter.''
The paper described five settings for Chinese monetary policy: easy, suitably easy, stable, suitably tight and tight.
The paper said that policy had moved from suitably easy to stable.

HEADLINE: With Slash Here and Slice There, Cuomo Offers Shrunken Budget

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and THOMAS KAPLAN; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Declaring New York State ''functionally bankrupt,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proposed a $132.9 billion budget on Tuesday that would reduce year-to-year spending for the first time in more than a decade, slash projected spending on education and health care, and slice the budget for state agencies by more than half a billion dollars in the next fiscal year.
Planned spending on Medicaid programs and local school aid would each be cut by $2.85 billion, closing roughly half of a budget gap now estimated at $10 billion, one of the largest in recent history. The likely loss of federal matching funds would roughly double the Medicaid cut, bringing spending down in those programs by about $3 billion more.
Mr. Cuomo's budget, 2.7 percent less than last year's, includes relatively few proposals to raise new revenue. It would seek to raise about $456 million for the coming fiscal year, largely with changes to lottery and gambling rules and through more aggressive enforcement of tax laws. 
But in a novel and potentially risky move, Mr. Cuomo's budget does not identify specific Medicaid cuts, relegating those decisions to a task force he appointed last month. The task force, which includes lawmakers and representatives of labor and health care interests, is to make its recommendations in one month -- time that may buy Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, protection from the withering attack advertisements that those same interests typically unleash on governors seeking Medicaid cuts.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal makes plain his determination to shift the way lawmakers, and the public, view such cuts, laying out how much actual spending will be reduced between last year's budget and the new one. His budget would reduce school aid spending by $1.54 billion for the coming school year, while Medicaid spending would decrease by just under $1 billion.
Presenting his budget at a state theater in Albany, Mr. Cuomo sounded stern, even angry, about the way past governors and lawmakers had built inexorable spending growth into future budgets, even as he urged the Legislature to join him in reining in government expenditures.
He criticized the current budget process as a ''special interest protection program'' that resulted in too much spending with too little accountability for performance, and called for a return to what he described as reality-based budgeting.
''It's not about the industry of government,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''It's not about the bureaucracy of programs. Government is there to serve people.''
And he implicitly faulted Albany lawmakers for opting to use federal stimulus dollars to expand overall spending in recent years, rather than using it to cushion a long-term retrenchment in state spending. Much of the budget's reduction in year-to-year spending comes as a result of the end of stimulus dollars, Mr. Cuomo said. ''We injected it into our body, and it is now gone,'' he said. Lawmakers, notably the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, were restrained in their response. Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has pledged to work with Mr. Cuomo, praised the budget plan but suggested that lawmakers would closely examine how spending cuts would affect patients, schoolchildren and others.
''As the governor said, this is about people and how this budget affects people,'' Mr. Silver said. ''There are children in schools, there are senior citizens, there are people in our hospitals, and I think what we need is an evaluation of this proposal.''
Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader and a Republican, questioned the governor's earlier description of Albany's budgeting as a ''sham'' and suggested that Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, had not objected to such practices.
Groups likely to bear the brunt of Mr. Cuomo's cuts -- government workers, health care interests and others -- were less equivocal.
''We think, unfortunately, cutting services across the board doesn't really make a lot of sense,'' said Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Services Employees Association, the largest union of state workers. ''It means less nurses, less highway guys, less snowplow drivers.''
Even some of Mr. Cuomo's presumed partners appeared to be balking on Tuesday. Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State and a member of Mr. Cuomo's Medicaid task force, issued a statement questioning whether the task force would be able to come up with enough cuts to meet Mr. Cuomo's savings target.
''It will require alchemists, not policy wonks or providers, to transform cuts of this magnitude into gold,'' Mr. Sisto said.
Mr. Cuomo will also seek to delay, as his predecessor, David A. Paterson did, large increases in school spending that were mandated by a 2006 court ruling and intended to help poorer school districts. And also like Mr. Paterson, Mr. Cuomo is proposing to eliminate the annual state aid that New York City has received in the past through a state revenue-sharing program.
That sets up a battle with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
''I have said repeatedly,'' the mayor said in a statement, ''that New York City will find the least painful way to shoulder our share of the burden -- but we must be treated equitably with other parts of the state, and we must get reform and relief from Albany's unfunded mandates.'' Noting that other cities faced comparatively minuscule losses, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Unfortunately, the budget does not treat New York City equitably.''
Mr. Cuomo, sticking to a campaign pledge, does not propose extending a temporary state income tax increase on wealthy New Yorkers, creating another likely flash point with Democrats in the Assembly. The governor also would cut $125 million in property-tax rebates as he seeks a permanent cap on local property tax growth.
And Mr. Cuomo's budget is threaded with language permanently changing the formulas and regulations that determine government spending. This is likely to provoke a serious confrontation with the Legislature, which has, in the past, sought to negotiate these issues separately from the budget.
The budget would limit future growth in state Medicaid programs to the rate of inflation for medical services, a far lower rate of growth than current law envisions. Similar language would cap future growth in school aid.
Mr. Cuomo's use of task forces offers a glimpse of how he will seek to negotiate with the Legislature and outmaneuver unions and other special interests that dominate the budget process in Albany. In addition to the Medicaid panel, he plans to appoint a task force of lawmakers and prison officials to cut more than 3,500 of the roughly 64,000 adult prison beds in the state. Should the task force fail to agree on prison closings, the commissioner of the corrections department would be empowered to make the decisions unilaterally.
Similarly, the proposal would empower the executive branch to unilaterally make any Medicaid cuts that Mr. Cuomo's task force is unable to agree to on its own.
In one of the budget's steepest cuts, proportionately, the budget for state operations, among the larger pots of spending, would be reduced by 10 percent.
The governor said he would try to avoid as many layoffs of state workers as possible. But a table in his budget starkly illustrates the alternative: firing close to 10,000 workers if no agreements with labor unions materialize.
The budget also touches on Mr. Cuomo's intention to redesign New York's state bureaucracy, with plans to merge 11 existing agencies or authorities into 4: the corrections department, one of the largest agencies, would be consolidated with the state division of parole, and several agencies that handle programs for domestic violence and crime victims would be moved into the state division of criminal justice services.

With Charlie Sheen, the star of the hit CBS comedy ''Two and a Half Men,'' in rehabilitation for his persistent problems with addiction, executives seem less concerned that the show is on hiatus than thankful that the circus that has surrounded Mr. Sheen's life in recent years may be over, at least for now.

HEADLINE: Nassau in a Ditch, Again

 BODY:
There is no reason that Nassau County, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States and home to some of the highest property taxes and richest residents anywhere, should be in such a dire state -- its budget $176 million out of whack and its finances now subject to a humiliating takeover by a state control board. 
Nassau needs a county executive capable of setting its affairs in order. Edward Mangano, who was elected a year ago to fix things, has instead made things worse.
A state oversight board has been monitoring Nassau's finances for a decade -- since the last time the county government drove itself into a ditch. After reviewing its 2011 budget, the board voted 6 to 0 to take control. It said that the budget was unbalanced, full of bogus savings and unsupportable revenue estimates.
Mr. Mangano insists things aren't that bad and blames his predecessor, Tom Suozzi, for the troubles. It's true that union contracts passed on Mr. Suozzi's watch (and with the vote of Mr. Mangano, a longtime legislator) were overly generous -- with no-layoff guarantees, strange perks like paid time off for giving blood and six-figure salaries for police officers. When the recession hit the county hard in 2008, Mr. Suozzi made real efforts to manage the problem, including pushing through an unpopular tax on home-heating fuel.
Much more needed to be done to deal with Nassau's long-term budget crisis. So what did Mr. Mangano do on his first day in office? He repealed the fuel tax, opening a $40 million budget hole. Even then he kept insisting that his 2011 budget is balanced -- citing things like $60 million in imaginary union givebacks and phantom sales-tax revenue. No wonder the board stepped in.
The board has given Mr. Mangano until Feb. 15 to rewrite his budget, with the speciousness taken out. He has responded with a lawsuit. The county's bond rating has suffered; a respected top aide, Patrick Foye, has resigned. As bad as things are, Mr. Mangano has apparently not yet decided to be part of the solution.

HEADLINE: B.E., Before Egypt. A.E., After Egypt.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
RAMALLAH, West Bank
I'm meeting a retired Israeli general at a Tel Aviv hotel. As I take my seat, he begins the conversation with: ''Well, everything we thought for the last 30 years is no longer relevant.''
That pretty much sums up the disorienting sense of shock and awe that the popular uprising in Egypt has inflicted on the psyche of Israel's establishment. The peace treaty with a stable Egypt was the unspoken foundation for every geopolitical and economic policy in Israel for the last 35 years, and now it's gone. It's as if Americans suddenly woke up and found both Mexico and Canada plunged into turmoil on the same day. 
''Everything that once anchored our world is now unmoored,'' remarked Mark Heller, a Tel Aviv University strategist. ''And it is happening right at a moment when nuclearization of the region hangs in the air.''
This is a perilous time for Israel, and its anxiety is understandable. But I fear Israel could make its situation even more perilous if it succumbs to the argument one hears from a number of senior Israeli officials today that the events in Egypt prove that Israel can't make a lasting peace with the Palestinians. It's wrong and dangerous.
To be sure, Hosni Mubarak, Israel's longtime ally, deserves all the wrath being directed at him. The best time to make any big, hard decision is when you are at your maximum strength. You'll always think and act more clearly. For the last 20 years, President Mubarak has had all the leverage he could ever want to truly reform Egypt's economy and build a moderate, legitimate political center to fill the void between his authoritarian state and the Muslim Brotherhood. But Mubarak deliberately maintained the political vacuum between himself and the Islamists so that he could always tell the world, ''It's either me or them.'' Now he is trying to reform in a panic with no leverage. Too late.
But Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel is in danger of becoming the Mubarak of the peace process. Israel has never had more leverage vis-a-vis the Palestinians and never had more responsible Palestinian partners. But Netanyahu has found every excuse for not putting a peace plan on the table. The Americans know it. And thanks to the nasty job that Qatar's Al Jazeera TV just did in releasing out of context all the Palestinian concessions -- to embarrass the Palestinian leadership -- it's now obvious to all how far the Palestinians have come.
No, I do not know if this Palestinian leadership has the fortitude to close a deal. But I do know this: Israel has an overwhelming interest in going the extra mile to test them.
Why? With the leaders of both Egypt and Jordan scrambling to shuffle their governments in an effort to stay ahead of the street, two things can be said for sure: Whatever happens in the only two Arab states that have peace treaties with Israel, the moderate secularists who had a monopoly of power will be weaker and the previously confined Muslim Brotherhood will be stronger. How much remains to be seen.
As such, it is virtually certain that the next Egyptian government will not have the patience or room that Mubarak did to maneuver with Israel. Same with the new Jordanian cabinet. Make no mistake: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has nothing to do with sparking the demonstrations in Egypt and Jordan, but Israeli-Palestinian relations will be impacted by the events in both countries.
If Israel does not make a concerted effort to strike a deal with the Palestinians, the next Egyptian government will ''have to distance itself from Israel because it will not have the stake in maintaining the close relationship that Mubarak had,'' said Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian pollster. With the big political changes in the region, ''if Israel remains paranoid and messianic and greedy it will lose all its Arab friends.''
To put it bluntly, if Israelis tell themselves that Egypt's unrest proves why Israel cannot make peace with the Palestinian Authority, then they will be talking themselves into becoming an apartheid state -- they will be talking themselves into permanently absorbing the West Bank and thereby laying the seeds for an Arab majority ruled by a Jewish minority between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
What the turmoil in Egypt also demonstrates is how much Israel is surrounded by a huge population of young Arabs and Muslims who have been living outside of history -- insulated by oil and autocracy from the great global trends. But that's over.
''Today your legitimacy has to be based on what you deliver,'' the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, explained to me in his Ramallah office. ''Gone are the days when you can say, 'Deal with me because the other guys are worse.' ''
I had given up on Netanyahu's cabinet and urged the U.S. to walk away. But that was B.E. -- Before Egypt. Today, I believe President Obama should put his own peace plan on the table, bridging the Israeli and Palestinian positions, and demand that the two sides negotiate on it without any preconditions. It is vital for Israel's future -- at a time when there is already a global campaign to delegitimize the Jewish state -- that it disentangle itself from the Arabs' story as much as possible. There is a huge storm coming, Israel. Get out of the way.

HEADLINE: State Support for Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Talent Magnet'' (column, Jan. 25):
As someone privileged to lead a very vibrant public university, I applaud David Brooks's insightful observations about the importance of promoting conditions ''where brilliance can happen.'' But enabling talent, collaboration and creativity to flourish is difficult when state support for higher education is being reduced so dramatically. 
If taxpayers and legislators are unable or unwilling to provide the support essential to keeping our institutions at the forefront in the global innovation economy, then university presidents and governing boards should be given greater autonomy to determine appropriate and reasonable tuition levels.
At the same time, we need to ensure that when students are asked to invest more in the cost of their educations, there is sufficient financial aid for all of them. This latter issue is one of the most important public policy questions of our time.

HEADLINE: The Paradox Of Corporate Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
The Carnival Corporation wouldn't have much of a business without help from various branches of the government. The United States Coast Guard keeps the seas safe for Carnival's cruise ships. Customs officers make it possible for Carnival cruises to travel to other countries. State and local governments have built roads and bridges leading up to the ports where Carnival's ships dock.
But Carnival's biggest government benefit of all may be the price it pays for many of those services. Over the last five years, the company has paid total corporate taxes -- federal, state, local and foreign -- equal to only 1.1 percent of its cumulative $11.3 billion in profits. Thanks to an obscure loophole in the tax code, Carnival can legally avoid most taxes. 
It is an extreme case, but it's hardly the only company that pays far less than the much-quoted federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Of the 500 big companies in the well-known Standard & Poor's stock index, 115 paid a total corporate tax rate -- both federal and otherwise -- of less than 20 percent over the last five years, according to an analysis of company reports done for The New York Times by Capital IQ, a research firm. Thirty-nine of those companies paid a rate less than 10 percent.
Arguably, the United States now has a corporate tax code that's the worst of all worlds. The official rate is higher than in almost any other country, which forces companies to devote enormous time and effort to finding loopholes. Yet the government raises less money in corporate taxes than it once did, because of all the loopholes that have been added in recent decades.
''A dirty little secret,'' Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, has said, ''is that the corporate income tax used to raise a fair amount of revenue.''
Over the last five years, on the other hand, Boeing paid a total tax rate of just 4.5 percent, according to Capital IQ. Southwest Airlines paid 6.3 percent. And the list goes on: Yahoo paid 7 percent; Prudential Financial, 7.6 percent; General Electric, 14.3 percent.
Economists have long pleaded for an overhaul of the corporate tax code, and both President Obama and Republicans now say they favor one, too. But it won't be easy. Companies that use loopholes to avoid taxes don't mind the current system, of course, and they have more than a few lobbyists at their disposal.
The official position of the Business Roundtable, one of the most important corporate lobbying groups, is telling. The Roundtable says it supports corporate tax reform. But it actually favors only a reduction in the tax rate. The group refuses to say whether it also favors a reduction of loopholes. In effect, the Roundtable wants a tax cut for its members regardless of how much the tax code is simplified -- or whether the budget deficit grows.
The tax filings of companies, like those of individuals, are confidential. In their public reports to investors, however, companies are required to list something called ''cash taxes paid'' -- the total amount of corporate income tax they paid that year, be it to foreign governments, the United States government or state and local governments.
This number varies significantly from year to year, depending on how many loopholes a company qualifies for. So looking at a single year's number is often misleading. But in a 2008 academic paper, three accounting professors -- Scott Dyreng of Duke, Michelle Hanlon of M.I.T. and Edward Maydew of the University of North Carolina -- suggested a new method for analyzing corporate tax avoidance.
It compares cash taxes paid over several years -- like five, as in the analysis for The Times -- to pretax earnings over that same period. The accounting experts I interviewed called it the best available method for looking at corporate taxes.
Some obvious patterns emerge. Companies that lost large amounts of money in previous years can subtract these subsequent losses from their initial profits and avoid taxes until they're turning a consistent profit. Yahoo falls into this category. Of all the reasons to have a low tax rate, this one may be the most defensible, economists say.
Other companies are able to avoid taxes by spending large sums on new equipment or buildings. Such spending can often be deducted. Southwest Airlines, for instance, has bought a lot of planes in the last five years. Several energy companies with tax rates below 2 percent, like NextEra, Xcel and Range Resources, have likewise been expanding.
A third group of companies simply seems to have become expert at avoiding taxes. When the three accounting professors analyzed more than 2,000 companies, they found big variations in tax rates within almost every subset of companies. Companies in the same industry often paid very different rates, even when they were similar in size.
G.E. is so good at avoiding taxes that some people consider its tax department to be the best in the world, even better than any law firm's. One common strategy is maximizing the amount of profit that is officially earned in countries with low tax rates.
Carnival pays so little tax partly because of a provision that lets some shipping companies legally incorporated overseas (Panama, in Carnival's case) avoid taxes. The fact that Carnival's executives sit in Miami and or that many passengers board in Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Seattle doesn't matter. Nor does the fact that Carnival isn't paying much tax in Panama.
Companies that pay relatively high rates tend to be those that are not expanding rapidly and that are not as ingenious as G.E., at least on taxes. The average total tax rate for the 500 companies over the last five years -- again, including federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes -- was 32.8 percent. Among those paying more than the average were Exxon Mobil, FedEx, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, Wal-Mart and Walt Disney.
The problem with the current system is that it distorts incentives. Decisions that would otherwise be inefficient for a company -- and that are indeed inefficient for the larger economy -- can make sense when they bring a big tax break. ''Companies should be making investments based on their commercial potential,'' as Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, says, ''not for tax reasons.''
Instead, airlines sometimes buy more planes than they really need. Energy companies drill more holes. Drug companies conduct research with only marginal prospects of success.
Inefficiencies like these slow economic growth, and they are the reason that both conservatives and liberals criticize the corporate tax code so harshly. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, says it hurts job creation. Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address, said that the system ''makes no sense, and it has to change.''
A lot of economists agree. Then again, any system that creates as many winners as this one won't be changed easily.

HEADLINE: Echoes From the Revolt in Egypt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Exhilarated by Hope in Cairo,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Feb. 1):
In 1977, one of the main reasons I left my native land, Egypt, was my realization that, with its exploding population, its future did not look too bright. In 1977, there were 40 million Egyptians; today there are almost 80 million, with more than half of them under the age of 25.
If President Hosni Mubarak is ousted, the task for whoever takes over is unenviable. The young want jobs, but creating the millions of jobs needed to satisfy the aspirations of those who are protesting today will not be easy. The result will be great disillusionment that could well lead to radicalization. In the meantime, let us revel in their courage, dignity and above all hope. 
Michel Barsoum Philadelphia, Feb. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''The Quest for Dignity'' (column, Feb. 1): David Brooks is right; we as a free society should support those across the world who struggle for the very freedoms that we often take for granted. But Mr. Brooks and other pundits have the luxury of not having to govern.
If he or any other analyst expresses support for the opposition to an established government at the first hint of an uprising, there are no consequences. However, our leaders, like the president and the secretary of state, must walk the tightrope that is international diplomacy.
So when President Obama calls for President Hosni Mubarak to initiate a reform agenda or Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton does not fall into the trap of calling for Mr. Mubarak's ouster, it is because their words have consequences.
Jeff Stanglin Richmond, Tex., Feb. 1, 2011
The writer teaches government at Wharton County Junior College.
To the Editor:
David Brooks belittles the Obama administration's response to the turmoil in Egypt, but President Obama's influence is secondary to the power of the social media technologies driving the revolt.
The uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt suggest a truly destabilizing idea: that any government could be made vulnerable and swept away by citizens under the sway of the new technologies.
Michael Scott San Francisco, Feb. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
A frequent response to recent events in Egypt has been to blame United States support for Hosni Mubarak and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty for the longevity of the Mubarak regime.
This misinterprets Middle East reality. As oppressive as the situation in Egypt is, American support for Egypt, if anything, has attenuated Mr. Mubarak's strong-arm tactics. Almost all of the Arab or Muslim countries in the Middle East are repressive dictatorships. Some, like Syria, Iran and Libya, which are not supported by the United States, are more repressive than Egypt.
Egypt's peace treaty with Israel provided an opportunity for Mr. Mubarak to allocate more resources for political, social and economic development, which he chose not to do, and now it appears that he will pay the price. The other Middle Eastern despots should be paying attention. They may be next on the list.
Jim Shalom Kfar Vradim, Israel, Jan. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
If there is one lesson for Israeli leaders to learn from events in Egypt, it is that making peace with the Palestinian Authority will likely become increasingly difficult. Do they have any remorse for playing diplomatic games with the United States and expanding settlements?
The past two years of commendable peacemaking efforts by the Obama administration may soon be seen as the good old days. Instead of hoping that friendly leaders in the region would be around forever, the Israelis should have struck a peace deal when the going was good.
Jahanshah Assadi

Jan. 31, 2011
To the Editor:
The turmoil in Egypt demonstrates the importance of our strategic alliance with Israel. Israel is the one country in the Middle East that is certain to remain America's ally if and when its government changes.
Foreign aid to Egypt was a gamble on a dictatorship; foreign aid to Israel is an investment in a democracy.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise In Donations To Colleges Seen in 2010

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The nation's colleges and universities received charitable contributions of $28 billion in 2010, an increase of 0.5 percent from the previous year, according to the annual survey by the Council for Aid to Education. 
Support for higher education, measured in total dollars, is at the same level now as it was in 2006, the council said. But adjusted for inflation, it was 8 percent lower last year than in 2006.
''We're still not out of the woods,'' said Ann E. Kaplan, director of the council's Voluntary Support of Education survey. ''Charitable contributions to education are recovering very slowly.''
Stanford raised $599 million from private donors last year, more than any other university. It was followed by Harvard, which raised $597 million, and Johns Hopkins University, which raised $428 million. But all three raised less in 2010 than in 2009, the survey found, as did most of the top 20 institutions.
While the survey included 996 institutions, the top 20 colleges and universities accounted for a quarter of all gifts to higher education last year.
Four of the top 20 universities -- the University of Southern California, Duke University, Indiana University and the University of California, Berkeley -- received charitable contributions in 2010 that were more than 10 percent greater than the previous year.
Over all, alumni giving and participation declined last year, while donations from companies and foundations increased modestly.
The share of alumni who contribute to their college has been declining for years, even when the economy was strong. According to the survey, alumni participation averaged 9.8 percent last year, compared with 11.9 percent in 2006 -- and the average gift was $1,080 last year, compared with $1,195 four years earlier.

HEADLINE: Sales of Larger Vehicles Bring Automakers an Upbeat Start for 2011

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- New-vehicle sales rose 17 percent in January, automakers said Tuesday, led by pickup trucks and other big profitable vehicles even as gasoline prices increased.
Every manufacturer but one, Mazda, reported an increase from January 2010, and General Motors posted its highest market share in more than two years. The industry's seasonally adjusted, annualized selling rate climbed to 12.6 million, the highest since August 2009.
''We're off to a good start for 2011,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insight at TrueCar.com, which tracks sales and prices. ''Gas prices rose quite a bit in the last few months, but that hasn't deterred people from buying larger vehicles.'' 
Sales were up 23 percent for G.M., 23 percent for Chrysler and 13 percent for the Ford Motor Company, which eliminated two of its four brands, Mercury and Volvo.
Toyota's sales rose 17 percent from January 2010, when it had to temporarily stop selling eight popular models to fix defective accelerator pedals. Still, its performance fell short of analysts' expectations, signaling continued difficulty as the company tries to regain the momentum and market share it lost last year.
Toyota was the only major carmaker to sell fewer vehicles last month than it did in January 2009, in the heart of the recession. It announced a new round of incentives, including no-interest financing and down-payment assistance, and a new ad campaign to begin this month.
But Toyota is among those benefiting from surging demand for trucks, a positive sign for the nation's economic recovery. Toyota said it sold 56 percent more of its Tundra pickup than it did a year ago.
Sales of light trucks, a label that includes pickups, sport utility vehicles, crossover vehicles and minivans, were up at least 35 percent at Toyota, Chrysler, Honda and Nissan. G.M. and Ford each reported increases of about 30 percent in pickup truck sales.
Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford's senior United States economist, said numerous economic indicators suggested that automakers would encounter a ''favorable business environment in 2011,'' though she cautioned that January, typically the worst month of the year for auto sales, ''can be difficult to read.''
Trucks are becoming more popular despite a recent increase in gasoline prices. The average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States was $3.101 a gallon this week, 39 cents higher than four months ago, and 44 cents more than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Several automakers said they did not expect gas prices to climb significantly in 2011 but said that they were positioned well, with improved small cars, if a large increase occurred.
For now, though, they are enjoying the fact that trucks, which carry higher prices and profit margins than most of their other offerings, are in demand.
It is particularly good news for Chrysler, which is working to improve its passenger car lineup, but still has a truck-heavy inventory. Sales of its Jeep brand of S.U.V.'s were up 47 percent, but its namesake car brand was down 7 percent.
''We have set the foundation for a year of sales growth with our 16 all-new or significantly revamped models for 2011,'' Fred Diaz, Chrysler's lead executive for United States sales and the head of its Ram truck brand, said in a statement. ''We have started the year on a strong note, and we intend to continue gaining sales momentum as our new 2011 models hit dealer showrooms during this first quarter.''
Some analysts expressed concern that G.M.'s sales increase was the product of more discounting, a practice that it and other automakers had been working to reduce. G.M. officials said incentives were $300 higher in January than in December but insisted it was not evidence that the company was resurrecting its bad habits.
''We're not going to return to the days of driving production with incentives,'' Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations, said. ''We know that's not going to be a recipe for success for us.''
January's sales increase after an 11.1 percent gain for the industry in 2010, to 11.6 million vehicles. Carmakers and analysts project sales will rise to more than 13 million in 2011.
That is expected to result in bigger profits, especially for the three Detroit carmakers, in the year ahead.
Last week, Ford reported that it earned $6.6 billion in 2010, the most in 11 years. Its 40,600 hourly workers in the United States are to receive profit-sharing checks that will average $5,000.
Chrysler on Monday said it lost $652 million last year but that its operations were profitable, excluding $1.2 billion in interest payments to the American and Canadian governments. Still, the company said its 22,000 hourly workers in the United States would receive bonuses of $750 each.
G.M. has not reported its fourth-quarter results.

 BODY:
BIG PAY DAY BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has awarded nearly $13 million in stock and options to its chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, left.
His bonus for 2010 came in two parts -- 46,031 restricted shares and 18,712 three-year options, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. At the closing price of $198.02 on Monday, his award amounted to about $12.8 million. 
SWEETENING A BID Sanofi-Aventis plans to raise its takeover bid for Genzyme by several dollars a share, in an effort to clinch a deal for the biopharmaceutical company, people briefed on the matter said.
Sanofi intends to increase its $69-a-share offer, and is likely to allow for additional payments to Genzyme shareholders if one of the company's drugs hits certain sales expectations, these people said. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED DEAL BREAKER Shareholders unhappy with a proposed leveraged buyout of J. Crew have walked away from a settlement that allowed for changes to the deal, according to a letter filed in Delaware State Court.
Lawyers for the shareholders wrote in the letter that they were unhappy with moves that undermined the spirit of an agreement meant to try to solicit alternative offers to a bid by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners of $3 billion, or $43.50 a share. They now intend to proceed with their lawsuit, Stuart Grant, one of the lawyers, wrote in the letter.
MICHAEL J. de la MERCED NEW BANK SCRUTINY Standard & Poor's, one of the largest credit rating agencies, could soon overhaul its method for rating banks, according to a proposal that the company circulated recently.
Under S.& P.'s new proposal, the rating agency would pay less attention to a bank's bottom line and instead scrutinize whether the bank had put away enough capital for a rainy day. The ratings company said its proposal signaled a ''significant change'' in the wake of the financial crisis, in which drastically undercapitalized banks needed government bailouts to dodge bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Arrival of Nokia Bolsters a City's Hopes

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- City officials are hoping that Nokia's new building here, transformed in just six months to a gleaming corporate headquarters from a structural skeleton, will be the catalyst to revive a troubled 36-acre downtown redevelopment project after more than a decade of false starts by one developer after another.
The regional operations of Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, will be centralized in the $76 million building, which is home to some 500 employees. 
''The Nokia lease is a game changer,'' said L. Gerald Hunt, a managing partner of the Quattro Realty Group, a court appointed receiver of the building. Quattro is serving as the developer on a fee basis and has no ownership in the property.
To complete the Nokia transaction, which was signed last May, Mr. Hunt had to overcome several obstacles. Many tenants might be wary of leasing a property that was half completed in a region that already had a surplus of vacant finished buildings. And the fact that the building was in receivership might not fill prospective tenants with confidence in the owners.
Technically, the project is owned by a venture of RREEF, an institutional investor based in San Francisco, and Sand Hill Property Company of San Mateo, Calif., which ceded control of the property to the courts in 2007.
Mr. Hunt would not disclose the lease terms, citing confidentiality. Office space in Silicon Valley has hovered in the mid-$30s per square foot annually for the past year, according to Colliers International, a real estate brokerage. CB Richard Ellis represented Nokia in lease negotiations, while Cassidy Turley/CPS represented Quattro.
Equally unusual, at least among the high-tech businesses of Silicon Valley, Nokia decided against creating a stand-alone, enclosed campus, with features like its own commissary and gym. On looking for a location in which to consolidate its offices in Santa Clara County, ''there were many vacant buildings, but they tended to be isolated places,'' said Karen Lachtanski, a spokeswoman for Nokia. ''We wanted to be in an area with amenities, such as being able to go out at lunchtime and have a choice of different places to eat.''
The addition of hundreds of Nokia employees to the city's downtown benefits merchants, particularly those on historic Murphy Avenue, a row of mostly vintage buildings that stands between the Caltrain commuter rail station and the new office building.
''Some restaurant owners on Murphy have told us they have already seen an increase in their business'' since December, when the Nokia employees began arriving at the Sunnyvale office, said John Pilger, the city's spokesman. An official ribbon-cutting ceremony is scheduled for Thursday.
Sunnyvale, a city of some 140,000 people about 50 miles south of San Francisco, is less well known than other Silicon Valley cities like Palo Alto or Cupertino, but is a major job center. The city says it has a daytime population of 230,000.
The history of Sunnyvale mirrors that of Silicon Valley as a whole. The city was a whistle-stop for local farmers until the early 1940s, when the federal government built up the military industry on the West Coast. Sunnyvale and surrounding cities remained the home of major contractors throughout the cold war; Lockheed Martin remains the city's third-largest employer, Mr. Pilger said.
Like many other cities, Sunnyvale has tried to use various redevelopment tools to create a coherent, pedestrian-friendly downtown area. In the late 1970s, following the fashion of the times, the city built a regional downtown mall to compete with suburban shopping centers. But less than 20 years later the mall, called Sunnyvale Town Center, changed hands, began to founder and went into receivership in 2002.
After the closing, a revolving cast of developers failed to revive the project. In 2006, a set of owners razed the mall and proposed a mixed-use center with 500,000 square feet of retail, 292 residential units and 275,000 square feet of office space, with more than 5,500 parking spaces. They were unable to find financing, and the project changed hands several more times. The last owners found their financing cut off as real estate crashed in 2007 and the project went into receivership again, this time with Mr. Hunt as the receiver.
While lenders are generally wary of extending more money to failed projects, the interest from Nokia was sufficient to induce the current lenders -- Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- to advance $70 million to complete the building and related infrastructure like streets and sidewalks.
''We were given a project that was distressed, and with work and some luck we were able to add value,'' Mr. Hunt said.
He may need further luck. His next challenge is to find an investor to buy the entire redevelopment area, which has an estimated value of $750 million when all buildings are completed.

HEADLINE: DEAL PROFESSOR; Actions of U.S. and China Now Will Shape Deals to Come

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
To many people, China is the Japan of the 1980s, a hurtling, unstoppable economic goliath.
Whether China will fulfill this destiny or, like Japan, will be tripped up by internal failings remains to be seen, but China will undeniably be a deal-making force for years. Two recently announced acquisitions show the shape of Chinese deal-making and how the United States may react.
The first is the $2.4 billion purchase of a controlling interest in Makhteshim Agan Industries, an Israeli company and the world's seventh-largest agro-chemical manufacturer, by the China National Chemical Corporation, known as ChemChina. The state-owned ChemChina is one of China's largest chemical manufacturers. 
MA Industries manufactures crop protection products, which are important for the Chinese food supply. This deal is about strengthening that supply link and may be followed by similar deals.
ChemChina will pay for the acquisition not in shekels, Israel's currency, but in United States dollars. The Chinese government is sitting on $2.85 trillion of currency reserves. This is a huge number, though it is inflated because all Chinese are required to keep their dollars with the government. Historically, China has invested these dollars in low-yielding United States government securities. But China can use these dollars outside the United States to buy higher-yielding assets that are in line with its internal needs. This is exactly what it is doing with the Israeli purchase.
And when Chinese companies spend these dollars outside the United States, they do not run up against American national security laws, which have been a substantial barrier to Chinese investment. The MA Industries acquisition and similarly large deals outside the United States will give the Chinese a chance to show the world that they are good global citizens and can responsibly own non-Chinese companies.
It is in this light that the second deal must be viewed: the agreement by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to buy the American bank business of the Bank of East Asia.
This $140 million purchase is small, but vitally important for all Chinese banks. Under bank regulations passed after the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the Federal Reserve cannot approve the acquisition of an American bank by a foreign bank unless it can confirm that the foreign bank is adequately supervised by its home country regulator.
If the Chinese bank is allowed to proceed, the Federal Reserve's conclusion that Chinese mainland regulators exercise adequate control over their banks will apply for all future Chinese acquisitions. So this small acquisition has large political implications.
The bank's acquisition is different than that of ChemChina's and most other Chinese acquisitions because it is not about building foreign supply and resource chains. Chinese banking is notoriously inefficient and opaque. With the Bank of East Asia unit, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China would be acquiring management and gaining a toehold in the West. Indeed, it could be the first step toward building itself into a global champion.
Will China succeed in these acquisitions? Chinese outward investment is still small, accounting for only $47.4 billion, or about 2 percent of total global acquisitions last year, according to Dealogic. But it will grow.
The experience of Japan is telling. In the 1980s, Japanese investment in the United States was met with significant hostility. The core national security laws governing acquisitions in the United States were enacted in the 1980s to stop an effort by the Japanese electronics company Fujitsu to acquire Fairchild Semiconductor.
We don't worry much about Japanese investment anymore, but the Chinese may run into the same problems. We do not yet know whether the Chinese are savvy bargainers or are overpaying in a hot global commodities market. There is also the question about how effectively the Chinese can run their new companies. Chinese management is premised on low-paid, replaceable wage earners. The Chinese do not have a special management technique that can be transported as the Japanese did.
And buying assets is one thing, but, as the experience of the Persian Gulf nations has shown, simply having cash or size isn't enough. Chinese companies need to be able to operate these assets effectively in different cultures with different laws. China's service and banking sectors are not particularly efficient, because they are protected from local competition by the government. Many large Chinese companies lack the management skill set to become global.
It is with this knowledge that Washington should respond. The United States has been strictly enforcing the national securities laws with respect to the Chinese, even rejecting a recent proposed Chinese acquisition of a gold company because it owned a mine too close to a United States military base.
There is a role to be played here for national security, particularly when these are purchases to acquire sensitive technology or lock up favorable supply chains. Expect the United States to increasingly coordinate its national security review with other countries to address deals like the one involving MA Industries.
But there is also the wider issue of how to address Chinese companies expanding global operations through acquisitions that do not touch upon issues of national security. In these cases, the United States should be careful not to reflexively block these acquisitions on fears that Chinese dominance will impact United States national security.
The approach in this case should instead be a political one. The Chinese have been adamant about demanding technology transfers to allow American companies to invest in China and have put up barriers to United States entry in many sectors, including banking.
China's efforts to grow globally allow the United States to play the same game and impose a fair playing field. In other words, if the Chinese want to come into the American retail banking sector or another industry, then the Chinese should allow similar investment in their country on equal footing.
The United States, and the Western countries generally, should use China's efforts to expand abroad as a welcome basis for both sides to establish rules for investment that go both ways. Permitting investment on this basis is likely to push Chinese companies to be more open and liberal, further integrating China into the Western world. And it just may show that our fears are unfounded and that American companies are still the best global competitors. For they know something China is about to learn: it takes very hard work to make a cross-border acquisition succeed.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ferries to Ply East River Far More Regularly Soon

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
For all their dominance on Staten Island, ferries have long struggled to muscle their way into the city's mass transit mainstream. Experiments in Queens and Brooklyn have been held back by infrequent service, outsize operating costs and low ridership.
But the city, unfazed by past failures, is now embarking on a more ambitious plan: a year-round ferry network that will provide all-day service in the East River, starting in June. 
Under the plan, to be announced on Wednesday, ferries will travel along a seven-stop route that stretches from Long Island City, Queens, to the Fulton Ferry landing by the Brooklyn Bridge, and includes Manhattan terminals at Pier 11 in the financial district and East 34th Street. During peak hours, boats will arrive at each stop every 20 minutes and travel in both directions.
The service is an attempt by the Bloomberg administration and the City Council to create a robust and viable mass transit alternative for a growing waterfront population that has struggled with clogged subway lines and bus routes that have been truncated or eliminated altogether.
''If we want every part of Brooklyn, every part of Queens, to be as attractive to businesses and residents as Midtown Manhattan is,'' said Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, ''we have to make it as easy as possible to get to and from in an orderly, affordable fashion. That is what ferries can do.''
The program comes with $9 million in guaranteed city money and a commitment to maintain the service for three years. The board of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which will oversee the service, is expected to award a contract to BillyBey, a division of New York Waterway, in a vote on Wednesday.
There is an existing East River ferry service, run by New York Water Taxi, but it makes only a handful of runs each day, during the morning and afternoon rush.
The new network will offer two additional stops in Brooklyn, at India Street in Greenpoint and at North Sixth Street in Williamsburg, and the boats will travel far more frequently, running from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends. In the summer, ferries will also stop at a pier near Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and, on Fridays, make a run to Governors Island.
A spokeswoman for New York Water Taxi, which had also bid for the contract, said the company had not decided whether it would continue its current service along the route.
City officials said they were hopeful that the expanded route -- and subsidized fares, as low as $3 a ride -- would foster a commuting culture, in which waterfront residents integrate the ferries into their daily routines. The boats are to arrive at each stop every 20 minutes during the morning and afternoon rush times, and every half-hour at off-peak hours in the summer. In the winter, the off-peak frequency would be reduced to every hour.
''Consistent and dependable service will be a magnet for potential users,'' Robert K. Steel, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, said in an interview in the fall. ''Development has occurred along this corridor. You've got more people who would potentially find the service attractive.''
Passengers will pay $3 or $5.50 a ride; the route has two price zones, with the northern part of Williamsburg as the dividing line.
Bicycles will be allowed onboard, and at rush hours, a free bus service will pick up passengers at the 34th Street pier and make stops along the Midtown office corridor.
''It's an opportunity for anybody who lives in the area on an overcrowded bus, or an overcrowded subway line,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''It isn't just for waterfront dwellers; it's for people in a radius around the waterfront.''

HEADLINE: Playing to Hedge Funds, a Trophy Rises in Midtown

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When the developer Harry Macklowe contemplated building a boutique office tower with unparalleled amenities at 510 Madison Avenue in the late 2000s, he expected it would be filled with hedge funds and other financial sector tenants who would pay rents well above $100 per square foot.
But the economy slumped in late 2008, and Mr. Macklowe found himself fighting to maintain ownership of 510 Madison, at 53rd Street, where just one company had signed a lease.
He lost that ownership battle to Boston Properties last September. Now, a series of leases signed at 510 Madison late last year for well north of $100 a square foot signifies a turnaround for the building -- and may presage a recovery of Manhattan's overall high-end office market, brokers said.
''Boston Properties had the vision to buy the building at a time in the market five months ago when even then people were very cautious about $100 rents,'' said Paul Amrich, an executive vice president of the commercial brokerage CB Richard Ellis, which is representing 510 Madison. ''But they knew the trophy status of the building and the location of the building would prove that we would get to those rents again.'' 
While there were a total of 91 office leasing deals signed in dozens of Midtown buildings for $100 or more per square foot at the height of the office market in 2008, that number plummeted to just 18 deals in 2009, according to data from the commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle.
The tally for 2010 is about the same, with a total of 19 deals signed in eight buildings, including three at 510 Madison.
But many of those deals took place late in the year, reducing the inventory of available space by 23 percent in buildings that Jones Lang LaSalle considers ''trophy'' properties -- and potentially capable of capturing rents of $100 or more per square foot. Those 52 Midtown buildings tend to be located around the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue, in what is known as the Plaza district, and many have views of Central Park.
They may seem more like country clubs than workaday office buildings, with grand lobbies and elevators, tight security and amenities like upscale restaurants to attract financial companies for whom image and high profit margins go hand in hand.
Those 52 buildings had a vacancy rate of 10.1 percent, compared with 13 percent in 2009, and are poised to outperform the office market in general this year, said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle.
Much of that has to do with the recovery of the financial sector and its endless race to trade up into more prestigious office space, she said. With office rents still well below their 2008 peak, landlords are still offering concessions to offset the cost of moving. That may encourage financial tenants looking to upgrade, Ms. Wasserberger said.
''It sounds kind of funny to say tenants would be taking advantage of a $100 rent,'' she said, ''But a lot of tenants with leases up for expiration may find it justifiable to say, 'I'd rather lock in today at $100 a foot, knowing this building was leasing at $150 or $180 a foot in 2008, so it's a relative bargain.' ''
Several towers were developed or rehabilitated in the market frenzy to achieve steep rents, but 510 Madison is the only new office building in the Plaza district.
''It's an extremely central and rare location to be able to build a brand-new building,'' Mr. Amrich said. ''That alone sets us apart.''
While 510 Madison's Central Park views are limited to the top floors on the northwest side, the tower, which was designed by Mr. Macklowe, SLCE Architects and Moed de Armas & Shannon Architects, has column-free interior space, which allows financial companies to create trading floors, as well as 10-foot ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows in a glass facade.
Newer buildings can be built with amenities that draw financial companies. For instance, 510 Madison will have a top-notch fitness club with a 50-foot pool, a large landscaped and furnished terrace, a private dining area for tenants and their clients and a generator that can provide power in a blackout.
Boston Properties paid $287 million for the 350,000-square-foot office tower and acquired a junior loan on the property for $22.5 million. Besides the three leases signed in 2010 with Senator Investment Group, Chieftain Capital Management and Valinor Capital Partners, Boston Properties also managed to retain the Jay Goldman & Company hedge fund, which Mr. Macklowe signed in 2007 at $135 a foot, at the same rent but on a higher floor. Floors 25 through 28 have been leased, with the exception of 6,000 square feet still available on the 27th floor, Mr. Amrich said.
The hedge funds, private equity groups and wealth management firms that typically seek expensive space tend to be smaller companies, requiring perhaps 5,000 to 25,000 square feet as opposed to 100,000 square feet or more, Ms. Wasserberger said. For that reason, if 510 Madison continues to lease as anticipated, it may account for many more leasing deals of $100 or more per square foot in 2011.
''If the numbers were 19 deals in 2010, I bet we see closer to 40 in 2011,'' she said. ''The reason is 510 Madison is now open for business. It's a 30-story building, and those are going to be some partial- and single- and double-floor tenants, so that could account for a sizable number of deals.''
Of course, the higher the floor the higher the rent, brokers said.
''There's always that premium for the tower view,'' said Alan Desino, an executive managing director of the commercial brokerage Colliers International. ''Is there a building right now anywhere in Manhattan that on the base floor you're going to pay $100 a foot? Probably not.''
A large part of 510 Madison's allure is its location in the Plaza district. Another banner office tower developed speculatively, 11 Times Square, was also hoping for $100-per-foot rents, but its location on Eighth Avenue near the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has been a detractor, Mr. Desino said. So far, the law firm Proskauer Rose is the building's lone large tenant.
Still, the right kind of building -- for example One Bryant Park on Avenue of the Americas, known as the Bank of America tower -- delivered at the right time can create a desirable submarket around it, even driving up rents in neighboring buildings, he said.
''One Bryant Park is a phenomenal building,'' Mr. Desino said. ''Just due to the efficiency and space you have floor-to-ceiling and, let's face it, the views are phenomenal. It's been able to achieve $100 rents in an area that, three years ago, I would have said, not a chance.''
One Bryant Park also happens to be certified by the United States Green Building Council, as does 11 Times Square, and 510 Madison is pursuing that certification. A recent study by the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Washington, showed landlords could achieve an average premium on rents of 5 to 10 percent nationally if a building was certified as environmentally friendly.
Even if it does not guarantee higher rents, that certification carries a certain cachet, said Christopher Macke, a senior real estate strategist at the CoStar Group. ''Maybe you don't get the premium rent, but you get the tenant, and the other guy doesn't,'' he said. ''Put another way, in a green building, you have a higher absorption rate than one that's not green.''

HEADLINE: Eager to Regain Investors' Trust, BP to Pay First Dividend Since Gulf Spill

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- BP said Tuesday that it planned to sell half of its refining capacity in the United States while expanding in faster-growing economies, and that it would resume paying a dividend for the first time since the rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico last year.
The chief executive, Robert Dudley, has been revamping the British oil giant, eager to leave behind the disaster in the Gulf by again focusing BP on increasing its business and regaining investors' trust. The change would make BP ''smaller,'' ''safer'' and ''more agile,'' Mr. Dudley said at BP's London headquarters. 
Improving BP's safety record remains his priority, he said, but BP also wants to double its exploration spending by investing in projects in developing economies like Brazil, Libya and Jordan. At the same time, BP will be seeking buyers for two of its refineries in the United States, one in Texas City, Texas, and the other in Carson, California, which no longer pay off for BP financially. The company expects to get more than $4.4 billion for them.
''It's a relief that they want to sell them,'' said Christine Tiscareno, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in London. ''Those refineries were built a long time ago. They have to be redone constantly. This is expensive.''
BP plans to increase its total investments by about $2 billion to $20 billion next year. A total of 32 projects, including in Alaska, Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and Russia, are planned for the next six years with a potential to contribute about one million barrels a day in production, the company said.
''2011 will be a year of recovery and consolidation,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''But it will also be a year in which we have the opportunity to reset the company, adjusting the shape of our business, and focus on growing value for shareholders.''
BP also said it would pay a dividend of 7 cents a share for the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings for the period rose 30 percent to $5.6 billion from $4.3 billion a year earlier, helped by higher oil prices. BP had suspended its dividend payments, which were most recently 14 cents a share, following the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf. The BP chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, called the dividend level ''prudent.''
Despite the positive quarter, BP posted a loss for 2010 -- its first in almost 20 years. The company lost $3.7 billion last year, compared with a profit of $16.6 billion in 2009.
BP's share price has not returned to its pre-explosion level, but it has risen 60 percent from the low it sank to last July. The shares dropped in London on Tuesday after BP said it expected production to decline this year as a result of asset sales.
To improve BP's safety record, Mr. Dudley set up a new division last year to monitor safety. BP recently suspended some operations in Alaska and the North Sea after the projects failed to meet the new safety standards, Mr. Dudley said Tuesday, without giving further details.
Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, said Monday that its profit in the fourth quarter rose 53 percent to $9.25 billion, the highest for a quarter in more than two years. It cited increased energy demand from a recovering global economy. Chevron and ConocoPhillips have also reported higher earnings for the quarter.
BP set aside an additional $1 billion in the fourth quarter for expenses related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, bringing the total charge to almost $41 billion. BP said it did not expect to be able to give an exact figure for the total costs for a while. A plan to sell $30 billion in assets by the end of 2011 to help pay for costs related to the oil spill was ''on track,'' BP said.
Texas City, BP's largest refinery in the United States, was the site of an explosion in 2005 that left 15 dead and 170 others injured. The U.S. government imposed a record $50.6 million fine on the company last August.
It and Carson, which supplies about a quarter of Los Angeles's gasoline, account for about 28 percent of BP's current total refining capacity. BP said it planned to sell them before the end of 2012. The company plans to continue to invest in its other U.S. refinery operations in Cherry Point, Washington; Whiting, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio.
Jason Kenney, an analyst at ING in London, said PetroChina or other national oil companies might be interested in the assets. PetroChina agreed Monday to buy half of Ineos Group's European oil-refining operation for $1.02 billion.
Mr. Dudley also said that he plans to forge more alliances with national oil companies to ensure a presence in key oil and gas basins. In his first major deal since the Gulf of Mexico accident, Mr. Dudley agreed in January to a share swap with Russia's Rosneft to form a partnership to explore the Arctic.
But the $16 billion deal almost immediately faced opposition from BP's partners in its existing joint venture in Russia, TNK-BP, which argued the Rosneft deal would violate their agreement.
TNK-BP's Russian shareholders asked for an injunction at a London court to stop BP's deal with Rosneft. The High Court ruled Tuesday that the case would go to an arbitral tribunal that is to settle the matter by Feb. 25. BP said it welcomed the court's decision.

HEADLINE: Report Foresees Quick Gulf of Mexico Recovery From Spill Damage

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ and MARK SCHROPE

 BODY:
The Gulf of Mexico should recover from the environmental damage caused by the enormous BP oil spill last year faster than many people expected, according to new estimates in reports commissioned by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the administrator of the $20 billion compensation fund.
That prediction will be central to Mr. Feinberg's plan for paying people who claim their livelihoods were devastated by the spill. It is certain to be controversial among those who believe the damage will be longer-lasting and therefore should result in higher payouts for the spill's victims. 
Mr. Feinberg's report, to be officially released Wednesday, will lay out for the first time the framework for deciding who gets final settlements for spill-related damage and how payments for future losses will be determined.
Based on the work of environmental scientists, economists and other experts, the report acknowledges that ''prediction is not an exact science'' but estimates that the gulf should recover by the end of 2012. The hardest-hit oyster beds could take much longer to come back, it says.
Based on those estimates, the damages paid out by the fund would be double the first year's losses for most of those filing claims, less any money previously paid by the fund. Those whose living is tied to oyster beds would receive four times their 2010 losses.
Mr. Feinberg, appointed in June by BP and the Obama administration, has given out more than $3.5 billion so far in emergency money to those affected by the spill.
But Gulf Coast residents have become increasingly angry over what they say are shortcomings of the program, including inconsistent payments and an opaque process. The methodology for final settlements is meant to answer those criticisms.
Mr. Feinberg has also been criticized by plaintiffs' lawyers who have filed complaints with the judge in New Orleans who is overseeing federal spill litigation. They have accused the administrator of not being truly independent from BP, and asked the judge to exercise authority over the compensation process.
On Tuesday, the governor and attorney general of Louisiana and the attorney general of Mississippi filed similar requests with the judge, Carl J. Barbier.
A key document used to formulate plans for commercial fishermen making claims was a report by Wes Tunnell, a marine biologist at Texas A&M's Harte Research Institute in Corpus Christi, who has extensive experience studying oil spills.
The 39-page report acknowledges that any definitive assessment at this point is impossible, and that fully understanding the spill's ecological effects will take years.
But Dr. Tunnell concluded over all that regional 2011 catches for blue crabs, shrimp, oysters and fin fishes should be in line with catches before the spill.
His report adds, however, that some oyster beds may not recover for 6 to 10 years, and that there will be fewer fish, shrimp and crabs in the nets in some areas.
Dr. Tunnell was paid $225 an hour by the claims fund, which is in turn financed by BP.
Under the new framework for claims, documentation requirements for spill-related damages are expected to be tougher than those under last year's emergency program, but no one is automatically excluded from filing a claim.
Wednesday's announcement will be followed by a two-week comment period in which people can argue with the estimates and methodology. The comments will be available online. Payments will begin after the comment period.
While the new report will define the parameters for future compensation, the settlements will be subject to negotiation.
Some 85,000 people have already reached a settlement with the fund through a quick-pay option that provides $5,000 to individuals and $25,000 to businesses with no additional documentation.
Those who might file claims and who believe that the damage will persist can wait to file for a settlement throughout the three-year life of the fund, and can receive interim payments while they watch and wait.
People dissatisfied with the final settlement offer can, under the Oil Pollution Act, appeal to the Coast Guard. So far 507 appeals have been filed with the Coast Guard, which has so far consistently agreed with the estimates of the Feinberg fund.
BP declined to comment.
A lawyer with thousands of clients along the coast said the new framework would lead him and dozens of other lawyers to the negotiating table with Mr. Feinberg.
''It's in my clients' interest to get this over with quickly,'' said Daniel E. Becnel Jr., a Louisiana lawyer who represents many coastal resorts and condo owners.
Stuart H. Smith, a lawyer in New Orleans who has said he would be interested in exploring settlements, said he had ''serious concerns'' about the plan. ''I don't think that it sufficiently takes into consideration the uncertainty factor,'' Mr. Smith said.
A coastal fisherman was blunt in his criticism. ''This is typical BP trying to get off the hook,'' said Ray Brandhurst, owner of a 47-foot shrimp boat. ''I'm sure you're going to hear people screaming from across the Gulf Coast.''
According to the report, two factors reduced the expected harm. First, the oil gushed for a shorter time than did the Ixtoc I spill off Mexico, which began in 1979, and, second, it occurred during months of relatively calm seas. Also, the closing of fisheries during the crisis allowed marine populations not directly affected by oil to prosper.
Marine experts differed over the conclusions of the Tunnell report. James Cowan, a biological oceanographer at Louisiana State University, said, ''He may be right, and I hope he's right.'' But Dr. Cowan added: ''It doesn't sit well with me. I think it's too soon to just write it off.''
Dr. Cowan's group has been working with shrimp and fish both offshore and near shore, and he said the group members had found troubling signs of apparent oil damage. They have seen reduced growth and higher death rates of shrimp in the marshes, Dr. Cowan said, and significant declines in catch rates for red snapper and other reef fishes.
''In my mind, the long-term, indirect effects are going to be the most insidious and also the most difficult to ascertain,'' he said.
But another leading marine scientist applauded Dr. Tunnell's work. Steve Murawski, former chief science adviser for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said Dr. Tunnell had ''done a great job'' in a situation requiring quick analysis so people can move forward.
''Decisions have to be made,'' Mr. Murawski said, ''and sometimes they are made with imperfect information.''

HEADLINE: In Mexico Drug War, Massacres, but Claims of Progress

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
ACAPULCO, Mexico -- Only a week into the new year, 15 human heads sat outside a gleaming shopping center on the other side of the lush hills that frame this seaside resort's big tourist hotels. Within hours, several bodies turned up in a taxi and elsewhere, bringing the number of victims to 33 in a single weekend, scattered around a side of town few visitors see.
Then two weeks later, the government announced that it had captured the leader of a shadowy criminal organization believed to be responsible for the mayhem, as well as for the disappearance of 20 men who came here for vacation last fall.
The twin events -- the shock of yet another massacre and the government's ability to take down those it believes responsible -- define the seesawing battle for the right to claim victory at a critical juncture in Mexico's organized crime war. 
The increase in violence is indisputable. The government says more than 34,600 have been killed in the four years since President Felipe Calderon took office and threw the federal police and military at the cartels, with last year's toll, 15,273, the heaviest yet.
Mexican and American officials, crediting American training of the military and what they consider to be an increasingly professional federal police force, point out that more than half of the 37 most wanted crime bosses announced last year have been captured or killed. The government also maintains that the last quarter of 2010 showed a decline in the pace of killings.
But the public does not seem to believe it. A poll released Jan. 11 by Mexico's national statistics institute found that more than 70 percent of respondents believed that the country's security had worsened since 2009.
The findings mirrored similar research by pollsters showing that, for the first time in recent years, Mexicans are more worried about safety than the economy, a near reversal from the year before.
''There is a disconnect between what the government thinks it is achieving and what the public perceives as happening,'' said Denise Dresser, a veteran political analyst in Mexico City. Because Mr. Calderon ''made the war the center of gravity of his term, he is now being evaluated on whether he is winning it, and the public perception is he is not winning.''
Both Mexican and American officials, who say the two countries have never worked closer in fighting crime, are facing growing pressure to prove that their strategy is working. With Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, the Obama administration will face renewed scrutiny to account for the $1.4 billion, multiyear Merida Initiative, the cornerstone of American aid in Mexico's drug fight.
''Right now I am concerned whether the administration is focused on giving Merida a chance,'' said Representative Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who is the new chairman of a House subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. He says that while he supports the initiative, he will call hearings over what he considers the slow pace in which it has been carried out.
''There is a lack of execution,'' Mr. Mack said. ''We are going to find out why this is.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a visit to Mexico last week to reiterate American support for the Mexican drug fight, said $500 million in Merida money would be allocated this year.
But unlike in the past year, when the emphasis was on delivering helicopters and other equipment, United States Embassy officials said the aid this year would focus on attacking the impunity that lets criminals get away with murder, by shoring up local and state police forces and the justice system. Only about 2 percent of those charged with organized-crime-related offenses face trial in Mexico, American officials have said.
Carlos Pascual, the United States ambassador, argued that the longstanding impunity, not Mr. Calderon's offensive, should be blamed for the violence.
''The vast majority of the violence we've seen over the past decade in Mexico is not because it has arisen as a result of taking on organized crime,'' he said, adding, ''It's that you've had impunity within the country because there has never been a legacy of investing in state and local police and in a judicial system that was able to crack down and contain it.''
Alarmed at the high death toll, the Mexican Congress summoned Mr. Calderon's top police official, Genaro Garcia Luna, to a hearing on Monday to explain the violence here and in several northern states. Mr. Garcia Luna said a corner was being turned, but legislators, chiefly from opposition parties, did not appear convinced.
''The country is under a security crisis, a crisis without precedent in the history of the country, a systemic crisis that you guys, Mr. Secretary, appear to ignore,'' said Senator Ricardo Monreal Avila.
Mr. Calderon, who has struggled politically since narrowly winning office in 2006, has found his proposals to revamp local policing and prevent money laundering stalled in congress. At the same time, human rights groups and the State Department, concerned over accusations of abuse and unexplained disappearances and deaths, are pressing for civilian trials of military personnel.
The coming months may prove even more challenging for Mr. Calderon because his political opponents may be wary of handing him and his party any victories ahead of the presidential election next year, which is likely to focus on security, political analysts said.
The government responds to critics by citing the many kingpins it has killed or captured. ''The major networks that kidnap, extort and smuggle drugs are being taken apart,'' Alejandro Poire, the government's security spokesman, told reporters last week. ''Through this, the federal government is building true, authentic security for our country.''
But Mr. Calderon has also tried to reassure tourists and investors that Mexico is about more than drugs and thugs. He urged government officials last week to emphasize the positive about Mexico and, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, he sought to do much the same.
That message is literally plastered on billboards here carrying the slogan, ''Habla bien de Aca,'' urging residents and visitors to ''speak well'' of the city.
Acapulco has long been two towns. Along the coast is the fading playland for celebrities, with towering hotels and resorts. Over the hills is a sprawl of slums and working-class neighborhoods housing the people who clean the rooms, serve the food and drive the taxis.
With at least three drug trafficking organizations vying for smuggling routes through here, violence has exploded in the last few years, occasionally coming close to tourist sites and ushering in platoons of federal police officers and the military.
''They have put all the focus on using the military and the federal police without nearly as much attention on the other pieces you need to fight organized crime, like attacking corruption and investing in social programs to prevent it in the first place,'' said Edgardo Buscaglia, a former adviser to the United Nations on organized crime.
Tourism officials here say the hotels are three-quarters or more full, though a view on the streets finds many empty restaurant tables, few trinkets moving off shelves and the city's famed cliff divers hurling into the sea for only a smattering of applause.
''It is clear the criminals did this to Acapulco, but we do not know why the police cannot control it,'' said Alejandro, a candy vendor who declined to give his full name for fear of reprisals by the police or criminals. ''I have to pay a bribe to the gangs every week or I will have trouble.''
Roving patrols of masked and heavily armed federal officers and soldiers caravan through traffic, at once reassuring and rattling visitors.
''It is unsettling,'' said Katherine Williams, 67, a retired teacher from Toronto. ''But,'' she added, waiting for a truck with soldiers to pass as she headed to a Starbucks, ''I have not had any problems, and if you stick to the beach area you would never know there were any troubles here.''

HEADLINE: 11.2 Million Illegal Immigrants in U.S. in 2010, Report Says; No Change From '09

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
About 11.2 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in 2010, a number essentially unchanged from the previous year, according to a report published Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.
Despite continuing high unemployment among American workers, record deportations by the Obama administration and expanding efforts by states to crack down, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the work force -- about eight million -- was also unchanged, the Pew report found. Those workers were about 5 percent of the American work force.
The population of illegal immigrants leveled off after peaking in 2007 at 12 million, then dropping sharply over two years to 11.1 million in 2009, according to the report, which is based on census data. The declines occurred primarily because fewer people from Mexico and Central America came illegally to the United States, Pew concluded. 
The report found no evidence of an exodus of illegal immigrants from the country. In particular there is no sign that Mexicans, who are the largest group -- 58 percent -- of illegal immigrants, are leaving in larger numbers, the report finds.
The Pew report suggests that the high numbers of unauthorized immigrants are confounding enforcement efforts by the Obama administration and also a recent spate of measures by state legislatures to crack down locally on illegal immigration. Federal immigration authorities deported about 400,000 immigrants in each of the last two years, the highest numbers in the country's history, according to Department of Homeland Security officials.
''We just don't see indications that enforcement is pushing people to leave the U.S.,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer and co-author, with D'Vera Cohn, of the Pew report.
The report's findings appeared to bring bad news for groups advocating for a strategy called attrition through enforcement, which inspired many of the tougher state measures, including a law Arizona enacted last year that caused a furor. According to supporters, those laws are intended to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they will opt to go home. Although much of Arizona's law was held up by federal courts, other states, including Georgia, Oklahoma and South Carolina, have also adopted tough laws in recent years.
But some advocates for that approach said the Obama administration's decision to end high-profile raids in workplaces might have contributed to illegal immigrants' remaining here.
''It could be that the shift away from work-site enforcement is making it more attractive for illegal immigrants to stay here, since they do not feel as threatened at work,'' said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks reduced immigration to the United States.
The Pew report found that about 350,000 babies were born in 2009 to families with at least one illegal immigrant parent, a number also unchanged from the previous year, representing about 8 percent of all newborns.
Conservative lawmakers in Congress and state legislatures have announced initiatives to cancel automatic United States citizenship for children born here of illegal immigrant parents. They argue that birthright citizenship, which is described in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, encourages illegal immigrants to sneak in to have babies here in order to gain American citizenship for them.
The Pew report found that about two-thirds of the illegal immigrant parents of the newborns had been living in the United States for at least five years.

HEADLINE: Construction Still Slows; Manufacturing Expands

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The manufacturing sector in the United States expanded in January, while construction spending fell unexpectedly in December, according to economic data released Tuesday.
The Institute for Supply Management's monthly manufacturing survey fits into a pattern of steadily improving data and comes ahead of Friday's closely watched payrolls report, which is expected to show that the United States economy added jobs for a fourth month. 
The manufacturing index climbed to 60.8 in January, the highest reading since May 2004 and well above analysts' expectations. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The prices paid component of the index jumped to 81.5, from 72.5 the previous month, and the employment index reached its highest level since April 1973.
''It's a good number,'' said Gary Thayer, chief macroeconomic strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis. ''Manufacturing is outperforming other parts of the economy, but we're also seeing some inflationary seeds in costs rising.''
The most recent growth data showed the American economy gathered speed in the fourth quarter to regain its prerecession peak with a big gain in consumer spending and strong exports.
The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2010, after expanding at a 2.6 percent pace in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday.
In the latest report on construction, the Commerce Department said that spending unexpectedly fell in December to touch its lowest level in nearly 10.5 years as investment in both public and private projects declined, suggesting the sector would continue to struggle this year as federal stimulus spending tapered off.
Construction spending dropped 2.5 percent to an annual rate of $787.9 billion, the lowest level since July 2000. The government revised November's data to show a 0.2 percent fall, which was previously reported as a 0.4 percent increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending flat in December. For the whole of 2010, construction spending declined 10.3 percent to $814.2 billion, also the lowest since 2000.
Spending in December was weighed down by a 2.8 percent fall in investment in public projects, which reflected an 11.6 percent drop in federal construction projects. State and local government spending on construction projects fell 1.8 percent in December.
Investment in private construction dropped 2.2 percent in December, ending three straight months of gains. Spending on private home building tumbled 4.1 percent, with private nonresidential outlays dipping 0.5 percent.
Home building and the construction of structures were minor contributions to fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With Eduardo Porter

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The author of "The Price of Everything" talksabout religion, the value of life and the reason people get angry about variable-priced tolls.

 BODY:
Eduardo Porter and I were colleagues on the economics beat at The New York Times several years ago, and he is now a member of the editorial board. He's also the author of the recent book "The Price of Everything." Our conversation, the latest installment of this blog's Book Chat series, follows:
Mr. Porter: No.
Religious belief contributes to happiness and well-being by providing social glue to bond groups together. The investments required to participate - from dietary restrictions to, in some societies, mutilation - wall religious groups off from the rest of society, protecting their investment from uncommitted free riders. The rules might contribute to happiness as they lead believers to drop unhealthy behaviors, like alcohol abuse. More importantly, the walls foster trust and solidarity, which allow mutual support networks to emerge. And the enclosed nature of the system reinforces collective belief sets --satisfying believers' need to belong.But religion does not guarantee higher well-being under any circumstance. Religious belief helps people cope with sudden unemployment. But divorce can distress believers much more than non-believers. Devout Americans aren't happier than their secular fellow citizens just because religion confers some benefits in terms of mutual support and insurance. Secular Americans also suffer from being marginalized in a predominantly believing nation. When was the last time an atheist ran for high office in the United States?
Mostly, adherence to a religious faith is not a matter of individual choice. More often it is a decision taken by our forebears before we were born. Fortunately for the secular, there are other ways to improve one's happiness. Higher income is associated with higher happiness. So are more free time and emotional attachments. Surveys may suggest that religious Americans are happier than those of a secular disposition. But surveys also suggest that Danes, a bunch of heathen unbelievers by American standards, are happier than Americans. And this is despite being poorer.
One thing to keep in mind is that the benefits conferred by religion have little or nothing to do with the specific nature of the religious belief. It's all about creating a walled garden with onerous rules of behavior that will allow trust to flourish inside. This presumably could be achieved through a secular belief set. Though maybe that would amount to inventing a new religion.
Mr. Porter: This kind of evaluation is more common than we care to admit. How much do you think we should be willing to pay -- through health insurance premiums, say, or payroll taxes - for a treatment that would add one year to the life of a stranger? Is it $100,000 or $1 million or $10 million? The moment you say stop you have put an upper bound on the value of that stranger's life.
The fact that we believe life to be of incalculable value is a matter of frame of reference: we think, first of all, of our own -- or perhaps those of our children. Sure enough, we would be willing to trade all we have and more to save those. But if we are to allocate scarce resources between competing priorities we need a metric with which to compare a life-saving intervention here against an educational improvement there and an environmental disaster a little further along. This kind of cross-priority comparison requires putting a price on life.
I'm not particularly troubled by the idea that society may place a lower price on my life than I do. It has to. To me the real ethical dilemma lies in the inequities that arise from how we measure it. Standard techniques to value life, used by, among others, the E.P.A., the British health service and the Australian government, rely on the notion that our choices reveal the value we put on our lives: if we speed to save time and money we are putting a price on our odds of dying on the road.
Clever as it is, this approach has some lopsided consequences. Notably, it implies that the rich are more valuable than the poor simply because they take fewer risks and invest more in their safety. Americans are more valuable than Mexicans; Mexicans more valuable than Chinese. Not everyone would agree. When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change prepared a report in 1995 assessing the impact of global warming by valuing lives in poor countries at $150,000 and lives in rich countries at $1.5 million, it almost blew up the process of international cooperation.
The main problem of the approach is that it ignores that people's choices are not "free." They are constrained. When the Titanic went down, the dead included 75 percent of those traveling steerage, 57 percent of those traveling second class and 37 percent of those traveling first. Ticket prices and standard valuation techniques would lead us to conclude that those in steerage put a lower value on their lives than the first class crowd did. I think they just couldn't afford to travel to America first class.
Mr. Porter: I too am often driven nuts by the feeling that I paid twice as much for my plane ticket than the guy next to me in the window seat. I do not find the practice necessarily egregious, though. Price discrimination, as this differentiated pricing is called, has been around for a long time. It takes many guises, from discount coupons to cheap tickets for matinee shows to airlines' fare management techniques. Its purpose is to segment the market by people's willingness to pay in order to charge less to thriftier customers -who wouldn't buy a more expensive version -- and still be able to charge more to those who care less about price.
To work, the two versions of the product must not be identical. Before the e-book era, for instance, publishers used hardcover and paperback releases to charge two prices for the same book: a higher hardcover price for those willing to pay more to get it quickly and a cheaper paperback price for those who could wait a few months to read it. Pricier airfares tend to carry fewer restrictions and are usually bought nearer the departure date.
Price discrimination is one way for businesses to ward off the impact of competition, which drives prices down to firms' marginal cost -- the cost of making one more unit. Yet this segmentation is not necessarily evil. In a competitive market, businesses subject to increasing returns to scale -- like computer companies or sneaker manufacturers, whose unit costs fall the more computers or sneakers they make -- must price-discriminate to survive. That's because the average cost of their products is higher than their marginal cost. If they had to price all their products at their marginal cost they would go out of business. Price discrimination - getting some particularly eager customers to pay more than the bare minimum - is essential for them to survive.
We hate the instances you describe of price discrimination because we sense them as ways for companies to charge us more. But often it is more accurate to see them as a technique to charge people less. If airlines were compelled, by force of conscience or government regulation, to charge the same for every seat, the cheapest fares we see today would disappear and many people who can afford only extra cheap fares would no longer be able to fly. That might be pleasant for less price-conscious passengers, who would now be flying in emptier planes with an empty seat or two beside them. But one could hardly call this a socially desirable outcome.
About the tolls: if the objective were to raise money (rather than reduce the use of bridges and roads,) price discrimination would work wonders on tolls. The main economic argument against tolls is that some drivers who would otherwise profitably use the bridge or road would no longer do so because the toll made the trip unprofitable. All the trips untaken would impose an economic burden - a deadweight loss - on society. But if Mayor Bloomberg figured out a way to charge differentiated prices to drivers depending on their willingness to pay, so that the toll wouldn't make them change their driving behavior, he would have solved the challenge of public infrastructure finance forever.

HEADLINE: For the Foreclosed, Themselves

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
ALBUQUERQUE -- Saving your home from foreclosure is increasingly a do-it-yourself project.
Lawyers are scarce and free legal assistance is overwhelmed in New Mexico, so a community center here is offering an hourlong class in how to download the correct forms, decipher the lingo and mount a defense, however tentative and primitive, against a multibillion-dollar bank.
''I don't see success for someone like me who doesn't understand the law,'' said Skylar Perea, a senior care aide who fell behind on her payments during the eight months she was out of a job. ''But it's better than nothing.''
In New Mexico, New York, Florida and the 20 other states where foreclosures require a judge's approval, homeowners in default have traditionally surrendered their homes without ever coming to court to defend themselves. (In the 27 other states, including California, Nevada and Arizona, homeowners have a much harder time contesting a foreclosure even if they want to.) 
That passivity has begun to recede. While many foreclosures are still unopposed, courts are seeing a sharp rise in cases where defendants show up representing themselves.
One factor driving the increase is the changing nature of foreclosure.
When people went into default in 2008, it was generally because of the exploding cost of a subprime loan. Unable or unwilling to handle sharply higher payments, the homeowner walked away with little protest.
Now many defaults are prompted by stretches of unemployment like Ms. Perea's. These owners do not have the resources to come up with all their missed payments at once. But if they can persuade their lender to restructure the loan instead of seizing the house, they have a chance of staying put.
In New Mexico, this is where the hourlong workshops come in. ''When you cannot pay, this is called 'a breach of contract,' '' Angelica Anaya Allen, director of the nonprofit Fair Lending Center, explained to a small but diverse group one recent morning.
Young and old, solo and in couples, the homeowners in Ms. Anaya Allen's class were all in breach, clutching special-delivery packages from their lenders announcing that the machinery was now engaged to evict them. They took notes, asked questions -- is the courthouse the building on Fourth Street with the blue roof? -- and were resolute if not quite eager for battle.
''I'm not sure where I stand, but I just don't want to let the house go,'' said Ms. Perea.
The legal challenges that she and the other students will make are slowing the foreclosure process. Over the last year, the average delinquency for a foreclosed loan rose to 499 days from 406 days, according to the data firm LPS Applied Analytics. But they are also straining the courts and often encouraging unreal expectations.
Louis McDonald, the chief judge for New Mexico's 13th Judicial District, welcomes the influx of homeowners defending themselves, known as pro se defendants.
''They really want to stay in their houses,'' he said. ''Some of them have fairly legitimate defenses.''
But the law grows more complex as the cases proceed, and foreclosure still looms for those who do not grasp its intricacies. ''The system is failing those who can't afford representation,'' Mr. McDonald said.
The 13th District surrounds Albuquerque on three sides and includes Sandoval County, which has the highest foreclosure rate in the state. Nearly half of the 100 new foreclosure defendants flooding the court every month are there on their own. There are so many of these defendants, and they need so much help understanding the law in a small, overburdened court, that last year Mr. McDonald instituted regular meetings overseen by himself and the district's two other judges. Volunteer lawyers were on hand to advise the defendants, and the bank lawyers were required to attend.
It was, in effect, a court within the court. But the program used a lot of resources for an uncertain result, so it is being replaced by a less comprehensive clinic. The real solution, Mr. McDonald said, would be ''more legal aid.''
That is a common refrain in court systems that have been successful in reaching out to the foreclosed. Before 2008 in New York, for instance, about 90 percent of foreclosure defendants never appeared before a judge. It was, a recent report by the court system said, a ''paper process'' and not a people process.
Then the state legislature directed that the court system hold mandatory settlement conferences to encourage the bank and the homeowner to reach a resolution. More than three-quarters of defendants now come to court, about 32,000 in the first 10 months of last year. But only 12,000 had a lawyer. The rest were in charge of their own fate.
''We're getting the people in here, getting them to the table with the bank, but I don't know what happens to these cases long term,'' said Paul Lewis, chief of staff to New York's chief administrative judge. ''Many of the homeowners would do much better with an attorney.''
The courts would be better off as well. In Suffolk County, foreclosure cases are 40 percent of the civil caseload. Upstate, in Schenectady and Wyoming counties, they are about half. The New York State Unified Court System is asking for an additional $25 million a year to pay for lawyers to represent the poor in civil cases, including foreclosure. The legislature has yet to approve the request.
In Albuquerque, the three lawyers for the Fair Lending Center -- a legal aid group that is paid for by the state -- would be happy to see their financing merely remain the same. But even if it does, they will not be able to handle all the demand.
Ms. Anaya Allen started offering the foreclosure workshops last spring, at a point when she and her colleagues simply could not take on any new cases.
''It was the only alternative: give people the tools to help themselves,'' she said.
Other legal aid groups across the country have been forced to consider do-it-yourself classes. For the Legal Aid Society of Southwest Ohio, demand for foreclosure help rose 51 percent between May and November last year. ''People realized they could fight back,'' said Mark Lawson, a senior lawyer with the nonprofit.
Financing has not kept pace. At any moment, Mr. Lawson has a dozen or so files on his desk -- people who qualify for help but will not get it from him. When he calls and says his lawyers are too busy to take on another case, some homeowners get angry. Others are grateful that at least someone cared.
Mr. Lawson is skeptical that self-help clinics are a solution. ''We have overwhelmed judges and impossible lenders,'' he said. ''It's hard enough for lawyers to deal with them.''
In the Albuquerque class, Ms. Anaya Allen does not promise a happy ending. ''At the end of the day, unless you have major defenses, it's likely the court will make a finding of foreclosure,'' she said.
Norma Canales and her boyfriend, Saul Valdez, were merely hoping for a little leverage against their lender. They fell into default when Ms. Canales got divorced and her husband stopped making house payments.
''We were working with the bank, trying to work something out, and now suddenly we're in foreclosure,'' said Mr. Valdez, 39. The couple never realized they could represent themselves in court. ''It gives you,'' he said, ''some sort of hope.''

HEADLINE: New York State Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''With Slash Here and Slice There, Cuomo Offers Shrunken Budget'' (front page, Feb. 2): As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo attempts to craft a new budget in these difficult economic times, we should be concerned that deep cuts into services for the most vulnerable among us will have serious social consequences that are very costly in the long term -- and, therefore, fiscally unwise. 
Certainly the governor has been left with a near-thankless task, after years of mismanagement and political trading. But slashing a budget and eliminating services, as economic despair affects towns and cities all around our state, will only manage to push New Yorkers, now on the brink, further into poverty and many into homelessness.
Instead, the governor must also look to generating new sources of revenue. Yes, additional taxes, such as the surcharge on high earners, is anathema politically, but our state is a thriving social enterprise, where we must collectively share in the sacrifices and carry our fair share.

HEADLINE: The Cat in the Hat Comes Back

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
THERE was a time when only beggars went bareheaded. This was some while ago, a century or so. But up until World War II and the period just after, a gentleman was not considered properly dressed without a hat. Even the names of hats were rich in character and historical association. The bowler, or derby, with the rigid shape of an upended bean pot, was named for a 19th-century English earl who popularized the style. The fedora's name came from a play of that title, written for Sarah Bernhardt by the otherwise largely forgotten French dramatist Victorien Sardou.
Then the hat went the way of the dodo. Social historians are divided about the cause of the sartorial die-off, although an often repeated canard attributes it to President Kennedy and his rarely covered thatch of luxuriant hair. The real blame probably belongs to automobiles, though. Hats were knocked off when you entered a car and inevitably got squashed beneath a passenger's wayward behind or went into orbit when you lowered the top to a convertible. 
Whatever the reason, there is no arguing with the facts of the hat's decline. In 1940, there were 180 independent major manufacturers of hats operating in the United States. Today there are 10. And while it is true that the headwear business is not altogether on the skids (retail sales of hats in the United States are estimated at $1.75 billion annually, roughly 40 percent of that figure being hats sold to men), it would be stretching things to say the future looks bright.
Or it would have been before the recent men's-wear shows in Paris and Milan.
Who knows what happened in Europe? Was it that the stingy-brim trilby, so popular in Williamsburg that no Halloween hipster costume would be complete without one, made it safe for men to experiment again with broader brims? Was it the influence of a fine museum show sponsored by the Borsalino Foundation at the Triennale in Milan demonstrating cinema's long love affair with the hat? Or was it, as Don Rongione -- the president of the Bollman Hat Company, a Pennsylvania manufacturer founded in 1868 -- said, that hat-friendly entertainers like Justin Timberlake, Usher and Neo have helped acquaint a generation of consumers with the idea that hats might be cool?
Anyone who has seen Douglas Keeve's 1995 documentary ''Unzipped'' knows better than to second-guess the telepathy that causes designers to arrive at the same idea at the same time. In that film, about Isaac Mizrahi, there was an inexplicable run on inspirations derived from the 1922 silent film ''Nanook of the North.''
''The stigma of looking like your father, or even your grandfather, if you wear a hat is gone,'' Mr. Rongione said. ''A young person doesn't relate to a hat that way anymore.''
Designers must certainly think so because the runway shows in Europe looked as if everyone had visited the same hatters' convention. At the Armani and Emporio Armani shows, the designer's favored slouchy berets were replaced with a modernized rendition of the trilby: duotone, high-crowned and often with a pert midsize brim. At Etro, the hats had crowns so high they lent the models a resemblance to Rastafarians or coneheads.
At Dsquared, a latent Sergio Leone theme was suggested by the designer twins Dean and Dan Caten's deployment of broad-brimmed Stetsons in requisite bad-guy black. At Dai Fujiwara's show for Issey Miyake, the cocked hats with their midsize brims were pure James Cagney (''Made it, Ma! Top of the world!''), while at Massimiliano Giornetti's show for Ferragamo the slouch-brimmed Borsalinos in muted jewel tones seemed like a loving, although perhaps unintentional, homage to George Raft.
''For sure, we can say that hats are having a fashion moment,'' said Elisa Fulco, the curator of the Borsalino Foundation. ''But filmmakers have always understood the power of the hat,'' added Ms. Fulco, who, together with the film critic Gianni Canova, viewed more than 1,000 films to find the 400 clips on view at ''Cinema Wears a Hat,'' a show at the Milan Triennale museum through late March.
''There are funny hats, magical hats, eccentric hats, erotic hats, hats that are disturbing,'' Ms. Fulco said. ''Hats are different from other articles of clothing because they are so close to your face; they create a strange link between your appearance and your interiority. Each time you put on a hat, you create an entirely different story.''
Having exhausted the usual narratives of power and gender as expressed through clothing, and wary of runway stunts unlikely to produce much cash register action, designers may have merely been casting about for new tools and communally fell upon the hat. How else to explain the use of hats by designers as unalike as Angela Missoni and Thom Browne?
To her show of subdued knits that looked a lot like pj's, Ms. Missoni added flowerpot hats with brims pulled so low over the models' faces that it wasn't obvious how they knew which way to walk. For Thom Browne's show, a single hat became the signifying design gesture: flat-crowned, the color of ground nutmeg, the modified boater made from feathers was a testament to Mr. Browne's affection for the fast-disappearing skills of artisans everywhere, in this case of the feather craftsmen known as plumassiers.
At the Roberto Cavalli presentation, which owed a lot to Jim Morrison in the guise of the Lizard King, a literal crowning touch was provided by Borsalinos with brims as broad as pizzas. At Givenchy, Riccardo Tisci outfitted his models in caps with looping flaps above the ears that made it seem as if you could hoist one like a six-pack. At Yohji Yamamoto, models came out wearing the steep-crowned brimmed hats that the designer himself has favored for years.
There were stunt toppers, of course, and hats that looked as if they'd been yanked from the bottom of the costume trunk, most predictably those at Galliano, where the heavily rouged models wore cartwheel-shaped fur trapper caps and lame turbans reminiscent of Madame, the Wayland Flowers marionette.
But the best uses of hats in a season that is far from over -- the men's shows in New York begin next week -- came at the Paris shows of Dior Homme and Lanvin. While Kris Van Assche, the Dior Homme designer, favored handsome but austere flat-brimmed hats right out of ''Witness,'' Lucas Ossendrijver, who designs men's clothes for Lanvin, seemed to have fallen in love with the way a broad-brimmed Borsalino with a suggestively pinched crown instantly sexualized an ordinary two-button suit.
''The theory used to be that in difficult economic times, when a man couldn't afford to buy an overcoat and a suit, he would pick up his wardrobe with a hat,'' Mr. Rongione said. That's not what's happening now. Some of the hats on European runways would look perfectly fine on an Average Joe. (O.K., an Average Joe who happens to hang out at the Smile or in the lobby of the Ace Hotel.)
''A regular guy could actually pull off some of these hats,'' Mr. Rongione added. ''As opposed to something no one in his right mind would wear out of the house.''

ARLINGTON, Tex. -- Ted Thompson stood behind a barricade, apart from the Super Bowl team that he constructed. He answered questions with eyes pointed downward and hands shoved into pockets, forever shy, reserved, uncomfortable, even now.
This was Thompson's chance to puff out his chest, find the nearest soapbox and scream ''I told you so!'' at those who pleaded for his termination. The collection of no-name, unremarkable spare parts he funneled onto the Green Bay Packers' roster arrived at Super Bowl media day Tuesday. This was Thompson's moment of vindication.
He returned here to his home state, not as the villain who expedited Brett Favre's departure from Green Bay, but as the general manager who crafted the Packers' post-Favre resurgence.
Yet Thompson, who played for Southern Methodist and the Houston Oilers, felt the need to remind reporters of what should have been obvious but was not. ''I'm happy to be here,'' he said. ''Believe me.'' 
The roster Thompson assembled is filled with late-round draft picks, undrafted free agents and players released by other teams. In a season fraught with injury, Thompson cobbled together an unlikely contender, finding gem after hidden gem.
Take linebacker Erik Walden. Dallas selected him as a defensive end from Middle Tennessee State in 2008. Three teams released him before Green Bay called. When Walden recorded three sacks in Week 17 against Chicago, he started for an injured Frank Zombo, who replaced an injured Brady Poppinga, who replaced an injured Brad Jones, who replaced an injured Aaron Kampman -- football's musical chairs for the mangled.
''The fact that he's been able to cut and paste a championship team together, considering all the players they lost, is remarkable,'' said Ron Wolf, a mentor and former Packers general manager. ''These days, you just don't see that.''
Thompson's creativity, instincts and acumen are evident throughout the Packers' roster. Early in his tenure, he signed Charles Woodson, a cornerback with a questionable reputation who became a cornerstone and was last season's defensive player of the year.
More recently, Thompson took an obscure running back from the University of Buffalo named James Starks in the sixth round of last year's draft. He invited cornerback Tramon Williams for a workout after Houston released him.
Punter Tim Masthay was tutoring students at the University of Kentucky in finance and economics when Thompson called. Sam Shields was a receiver converted to cornerback in his final college season, and Thompson signed him, too.
Williams called this series of transactions ''mind boggling'' and ''masterful.'' Yet one decision Thompson made will always stand above the others. It started in a manner typical of Thompson, in a dark room, eyes fixated on game tape.
The first time he watched California quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Thompson saw some 20 straight completions against Southern California. He filed this away, and when he heard that Rodgers would likely slip in the 2005 draft, he thought, ''We should do a little bit more work.''
The Packers landed Rodgers late in the first round. When Favre departed three years later because Thompson put the team's future in Rodgers's hands, Thompson became perhaps the most criticized man in football's most storied town. Fans created Web sites dedicated to his dismissal. They fretted about the trades he did not make, for Randy Moss or Marshawn Lynch.
No matter what Thompson did in regard to Favre, Wolf said he would have been vilified regardless, a true ''no-win situation.'' Thompson disagreed that he had been ''martyred'' in Green Bay, and when someone suggested that he had briefly become the most hated man there, Thompson joked that perhaps he ranked second. Then he offered a nervous laugh.
''We all knew that we were at a moment in history, that this doesn't happen often,'' said Mark Murphy, the Packers' president. ''Nobody wants to be known as the one that traded Brett Favre away.''
In hindsight, Favre's departure signified the first step toward this Super Bowl run. Rodgers evolved into an elite quarterback who said he took a ''lot of confidence'' from the way the Packers backed him. Meanwhile, Murphy, Thompson and Coach Mike McCarthy became closer, fortified by constant criticism.
Thompson never cared much for perception anyway. He carved 10 seasons with the Oilers out of guts and determination. From 1975-84, he stuck on special teams, always near the bottom of the roster, the same kind of player he now acquires to fill in around his stars.
Back then, Thompson already knew he would become a scout. He found the process of watching tape and evaluating players peaceful. Even now, as general manager, he still views every college all-star game, still traverses the country, still spends more time in front of film than anywhere else.
His story is still a tale of the tape.
Thompson operates by the philosophy he learned as an apprentice under Wolf. He employed the same philosophy at Seattle, where the Seahawks, with 10 starters drafted on Thompson's watch, advanced to their first and only Super Bowl after the 2005 season, one year after he departed.
The system is predicated on stockpiling draft picks and exercising caution in free agency. It can take longer to develop a team that way, but Thompson believes it made the Packers deeper, more able to handle the assault of injuries they endured.
''The biggest thing with Ted is he has a vision, and he's stayed the course,'' said Tim Terry, who played for Thompson in Seattle and now works for him in Green Bay as the assistant director of pro personnel. ''He's resilient and stubborn, and his vision never changes.''
Asked about the crush of reporters who surrounded his shy boss at media day, Terry laughed, then added: ''It's kind of comical. Ted is very serious and to the point. If Ted had his choice, if you know him, he'd be anywhere but here.''
In fact, Thompson said this would be only the third Super Bowl he had watched. Because of jealousy or envy or an addiction to game film, he skipped every other championship game except the two the Packers most recently played in.
Yet for all of Thompson's aw-shucks charm, Wolf believes that part of his protege, the part hidden from public consumption, must be proud of his accomplishments.
''You have to look at his history,'' Wolf said. ''He wasn't drafted. He hung on. That toughness manifests itself now in what he's been able to accomplish. He did it like Sinatra -- his way. And he did it with the most prestigious franchise in the N.F.L. from a historical perspective.''
One of the Web sites that wanted Thompson fired -- firetedthompsonnow.com -- now shows his picture, with the caption: ''I'm not afraid to admit it. I was wrong. Congrats Ted.''
Not that Thompson noticed. He was instead planning the next meeting for the personnel department. It will be held next Tuesday, in typical, understated Thompson fashion.

HEADLINE: Jitters for Oil Companies That Ship Through Egypt

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- As violence has broken out in Egypt, concern has turned to the risk of the blocking of the Suez Canal or nearby pipelines, which could pose a threat to world energy supplies.
So far, oil and gas flows through Egypt have not been interrupted, and the army has stepped up security around the canal and pipelines.
But rising tensions in the port of Suez have led several shipping companies to order their ships not to change crews in Egypt. Meanwhile, disruptions in government port services have slowed the discharge of some crude oil cargo at the Red Sea port of Ain Sukhna, at the southern entrance to the Suez Canal. 
''Potentially, we see attacks on employees of shipping companies and attempted attacks on vessels docked in ports if you see more violent demonstrations around the ports,'' said Helima L. Croft, a director and geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. ''It could be very problematic.''
Egypt is not a major oil producer, and Western oil and gas companies have halted most drilling in the country. But it is a crucial link for oil and gas headed to Europe, Asia and the United States. More than two million barrels of oil and petroleum products traverse the Suez Canal daily, speeding the transit of crude and gas supplies that shippers would otherwise have to send around the Horn of Africa, prolonging delivery times and expenses. About 4.5 percent of global oil supplies flow through the canal and the Sumed pipeline, which connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean.
About 14 percent of the global liquefied natural gas trade is shipped through the canal as well, providing critical supplies to Spain, and to a lesser extent, South Korea and the United States. Egypt also produces about 3 percent of the world's liquefied natural gas supplies at two export terminals, which were reported to be operating normally.
Gen. James Mattis, head of the United States Central Command responsible for military operations in the region, said on Tuesday that it was inconceivable that anyone would want to disrupt the canal.
''Were it to happen, obviously, we would have to deal with it diplomatically, economically, militarily, whatever, but that to me is a hypothetical,'' Reuters quoted him as saying to a policy group in London.
There are already signs of slowing cargo operations at the Alexandria and Damietta Ports, which handle container and bulk shipments of grains and other goods. Canal traffic has not yet been affected, although employees must leave their posts early to comply with the government curfew that begins in the late afternoon.
Egypt has historically taken strong measures to assure oil and gas traffic, and interruptions have been rare. The army is trained to operate the canal in case of any strikes. The canal was closed for several months during the 1956 Suez crisis, and it was blockaded by the military for eight years after the 1967 war with Israel. In recent years, it has been considered a safe passageway.
But analysts say that the defense of Egypt's pipeline network would be particularly problematic in the event of terrorism. They also say that several large refineries are located around Suez, where there have been outbreaks of violence.
Over the last half-century, shippers have built a large fleet of supertankers that can haul oil in case of an interruption of Egyptian operations. Taking cargo around Africa would add about 16 days' time to delivering oil and gas to global markets, and it would add insurance and other costs. But it would probably not cause a dire shortage or bottleneck, energy experts said.
James Burkhard, an oil analyst at IHS Cera, an energy consulting company, noted that OPEC had five million barrels of spare production capacity to bolster world supplies if needed. ''That's a substantial volume, more than we see transiting Egypt,'' he added.
Nevertheless, the turmoil in Egypt and concerns that political contagion could spread to larger oil producers around the Middle East has caused a price spike of nearly 10 percent in some oil benchmarks over the last week. Brent crude oil has broken the $100-a-barrel mark for the first time since 2008. Since natural gas prices in most world markets are tied to oil, they are expected to increase as well.
The unrest in Egypt comes at a time when global oil supplies are tightening mainly because of Chinese demand increasing by 10 percent last year, or by 810,000 barrels a day. Energy analysts expect Chinese demand to increase by an additional 400,000 barrels a day this year. But the United States appears less vulnerable than it did only three years ago to a Middle East crisis.
Demand for oil in the United States remains about 5 percent lower than it was before the recession, and increased domestic production and imports from Canada have moderated the rise in oil and gasoline prices in some regions in recent days.
Spain would be most vulnerable to an interruption of Egyptian transit operations because an estimated 10 to 15 percent of its liquefied natural gas imports come from Egypt. Egypt also exports gas through pipelines to Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, and BG Group, an energy company based in Britain, have halted drilling in Egypt. Other companies, including the Italian company Eni and two based in Houston, Schlumberger and Diamond Offshore Drilling, have moved workers and family members out of Egypt, although oil production in fields far from population centers has continued.

HEADLINE: Gov. Cuomo's Budget

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo was right this week when he said New York cannot allow special interests and inertia to keep driving up state spending. He was right that painful cuts must be made to close a $10 billion deficit in the state's projected $96 billion operating budget.
But Mr. Cuomo's refusal to consider any new taxes, or even extend a surcharge on the state's highest earners, means that his budget -- his first -- is harsher than it needs to be with the heaviest burden borne by some of the most vulnerable citizens. We are particularly concerned about his deep cuts in education spending, which will reinforce the deep gap between poor and wealthy school districts. 
Mr. Cuomo gets high marks for demanding that the state's well-paid employees come up with hundreds of millions in payroll cuts. His call to streamline government and reduce costly requirements for local school districts are welcome. His new approach to the state's budgetary math makes sense, so long as everybody looks closely.
Mr. Cuomo pointedly chose to compare his proposed $88.1 billion operating budget to the $87.2 billion the state will spend this year -- rather than compare it to projected spending of $96 billion.
For years, New York's spending increases have been based on political formulas rather than a rational calculation of what programs need and what the state can afford. That said, Mr. Cuomo's total budget of $132.9 billion is still a 2.7 percent reduction in current spending -- one of the largest in recent history.
The Legislature must approve a final budget by April 1. The state's unions -- teachers, health care workers, government employees -- will push back hard. Senate Republicans will balk at cuts in spending for wealthy school districts. Assembly Democrats will protest overall cuts to education, New York City and health care. Here are some of the issues New Yorkers must consider:
EDUCATION Even using Mr. Cuomo's math, his proposed $1.5 billion cut in spending on K-12 education is too much. It is a 7.3 percent reduction from this year's spending. Mr. Cuomo has proposed to not pay out another $1.2 billion that the state was scheduled to spend under a 2006 court ruling to improve education in chronically underfinanced districts. Gov. David Paterson, his predecessor, shortchanged the poorer districts last year and Mr. Cuomo has now proposed delaying the payout until 2016.
Wealthy districts will be able to get by, but these deep cuts would further devastate the poorest districts that have weak tax bases and depend on the state for 75 percent of their budgets. These districts are reeling from last year's cut, which required them to lay off teachers and slash basic education programs. Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature need to find a more equitable approach.
MEDICAID Mr. Cuomo wants to increase state spending on Medicaid by a hefty $3.7 billion over current spending and local governments would have to increase their shares by almost $400 million. That will still not be enough to offset the loss of more than $5 billion in enhanced federal dollars as the stimulus program phases out. As a result, the total amount spent on Medicaid next year would fall to $52.8 billion, a drop of almost $1 billion.
At first glance, the cuts may seem manageable, but they leave no room for increased enrollment if many more people lose their jobs or their insurance in the downturn. And there is no room to cover the ever-higher costs of medical care. Nobody knows how good the governor's numbers are, but Medicaid had been projected to grow to $58.3 billion in state, local and federal dollars. Now it is budgeted to come in $5.5 billion lower.
Mr. Cuomo has appointed a team of outside advisers, including representatives of various interest groups, to figure out how to save the state money and get sustained savings. If they fail to come up with enough useful proposals, he says his own experts will do the cutting.
Whatever happens, draining $5.5 billion from the total must be done carefully to limit the damage to vulnerable patients and essential institutions.
PERSONNEL Mr. Cuomo is right to ask state employees to make sacrifices, especially when the poor, the sick, the elderly and schoolchildren are facing such steep cuts. While the incomes of millions of Americans fell during the recession, the state's unionized workers have gotten raises of 13 percent over the last four years. The average salary is now nearly $67,000; when the generous benefits for pensions and health care are factored in, the annual cost to taxpayers for the average employee goes up to nearly $99,000.
To force the unions to bargain, the governor is threatening to lay off 9,800 of the state's 236,000 workers to achieve a savings of $550 million. A better scenario is that Mr. Cuomo will instead get a pay freeze along with some furloughs, pay cuts and civil service adjustments.
While at the table, the governor needs to insist that workers contribute more to their pensions and health care -- savings missing from this budget. New York's current contributions are more generous than other states and more than New York can afford. He will need to negotiate even tougher terms for new employees.
NEW YORK CITY Mr. Cuomo's budget will give the state's biggest city $579 million less for education than it got this year. That isn't the only way the city will come up short. State aid to localities used for a variety of expenses is being cut 2 percent everywhere except to New York City, which will lose 100 percent of the promised aid, or another $300 million.
The Cuomo administration says the city has $2 billion in reserves. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says that money is dedicated to closing the city's own deficit of $2.4 billion next year.
More than anything, Mr. Bloomberg wants relief from state laws that let Albany set pensions for city workers -- his biggest fiscal burden. He also wants to change civil service rules, and he's trying to convince the governor to end the last-hired-first-fired rule for teachers. All of these ideas need to be part of the debate.

HEADLINE: 200 Square Feet and Room to Swivel

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
FOR Malena Georgieva, it's been a long trip to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. A native of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, a provincial city about an hour from Sofia, she received a degree in Soviet-style industrial management just as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Adapting to the post-Communist world after emigrating to the United States in 1993, she enrolled in a master's program at the University of New Haven, supporting herself as a hotel chambermaid for $4.50 an hour. (''I thought, if I ever make $10 an hour, I'll be queen of the world,'' she said.) Eventually, she was hired by Deloitte & Touche, beginning a career in risk management, and her simultaneous love affair with New York City.
But Ms. Georgieva had another dream -- to become an artist and designer. So she took continuing-education courses in interior design at New York University, and then set up her own firm. Two days after it opened for business in 2008, the economy took a nose dive. 
Clients weren't exactly beating down her door, so she went back to work in risk management and put her design efforts into her home, a tiny space down the block from the Dakota, on West 72nd Street. The fourth-floor apartment, for which she pays $1,750 a month, consists of a single room, just over 200 square feet, with a bed, a desk, a dining table and a couple of swivel chairs.
It is essential that they swivel -- it allows them to face the dining area, the sleeping area or the living area, depending on how Ms. Georgieva is using the apartment. The Tirup chairs cost nearly $400 each at Ikea, making them far and away the most expensive furnishings in the space. Some items cost $12 (a glass cheese platter that she turned into a tabletop) or $40 (table legs, from Ikea, on which she mounted a board upholstered in imitation leather from the fabric emporium Mood). One substantial expenditure was for lumber, with which she and her father, a retired engineer who visited from Plovdiv, built the queen-size platform bed.
All in all, she spent about $1,500. Given that she would like to open a design firm again someday, and can't deplete her savings, her frugal decorating is just another form of risk management.
Evidence of Ms. Georgieva's cleverness is everywhere. She discovered she could turn a guest mattress on its side and slide it between her bed and the wall, where it functions as a kind of bolster pillow. To make the sleeping area feel like a room, she had three photographs of orchids, which she took on her Canon Rebel, blown up to 6-by-6-foot images, then hung them on the walls and ceiling surrounding the bed. (Ms. Georgieva did have to cut a few inches off the photos to get them up the building's stairs.)
''I need to check my appearance before I go out,'' said Ms. Georgieva, 43, explaining the full-length mirror, a $9 item that she turned into a conceptual artwork, gluing tiny toys to its frame and painting it all white.
She hung another mirror at an angle on the wall, so that it would disrupt the boxy lines of the apartment and send light from the lone window across the room. Below that mirror is a tiny dining table that can seat four, using two stools from Overstock.com and a bench she created by putting an upholstered board on top of a rarely used radiator.
Another upholstered board became her desktop. She attached her cable box to the underside of the board, using leftover curtain rod brackets, so it doesn't take up valuable desk space.
''I'm sure everybody has the tools at home,'' she said, of her ingenious cable-box solution. ''It's just that they don't think about it.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: 1. A photo of Times Square printed on an aluminum panel dominates the living area (left) in Malena Georgieva's apartment. The small table between two swivel chairs is a cheese platter stacked on a vase, both from Pottery Barn.
2. Ms. Georgieva hung an ornate mirror at an angle. ''It deserved to be treated as an art object,'' she said. She bought the wry chandelier -- crystal inside a plastic cylinder -- at Overstock.com. The swivel chairs are from Ikea.
3. Ms. Georgieva can seat four at her homemade table, with a bench made by putting an upholstered board on top of a rarely used radiator and two stools (about $65 each at Overstock.com) that swivel to become ''living room'' seating after dinner.
4. Her bed is flanked by a guest mattress on its side and surrounded by photos of orchids. The Wal-Mart desk chair isn't ergonomically correct, but ''sometimes it's style over comfort,'' she said jokingly.
5. Unable to pay for kitchen or bath renovations, she left cabinetry white, to minimize its visual impact, and hung white-on-white artwork on spare surfaces.
 6. Ms. Georgieva glued tiny toys she bought in Chinatown to the frame of a $9 full-length mirror and painted it all white, turning it into a conceptual artwork. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY TREVOR TONDRO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Festival Films Have Minimalist Themes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Guy walks into a bar. Maybe you already have enough material for a movie at South by Southwest.
Actually, ''Girl Walks Into a Bar,'' written and directed by Sebastian Gutierrez, with Carla Gugino, Danny DeVito and Josh Hartnett among its stars -- about people in 10 bars in Los Angeles -- is not the least elaborate of the 130 feature-length films set to screen at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., next month.
A roster of festival films announced Wednesday includes several that are downright minimalist. 
In the narrative competition ''A Year in Mooring,'' directed by Chris Eyre, with Josh Lucas in the lead, is about a guy on a boat. ''American Animal,'' written and directed by Matt D'Elia, with Mr. D'Elia co-starring, and also in competition, is a small-scale story about roommates. Yet another competition film, ''Charlie Casanova,'' written and directed by Terry McMahon, is mostly set in a bar and hotel.
Janet Pierson, who produces the festival's film portion, which runs March 11 to 19, said she was struck by the number of films that did much with relatively little this year.
''There's an economy of means at play,'' Ms. Pierson said in a telephone interview. ''With the slightest of means, they can grip you.''
Other films in the festival's narrative competition are ''96 Minutes,'' written and directed by Aimee Lagos; ''Fly Away,'' written and directed by Janet Grillo; ''Happy New Year,'' written and directed by K. Lorrel Manning; ''Natural Selection, written and directed by Robbie Pickering; and ''Small, Beautifully Moving Parts,'' written and directed by Annie J. Howell and Lisa Robinson.
Earlier the festival announced some of its higher-profile events, including a premiere of ''The Beaver,'' which is directed by Jodie Foster and stars Mel Gibson as a troubled executive who gets back in touch with his life through a beaver hand puppet.
Feature documentaries on a competition list announced Wednesday are ''A Mouthful,'' directed by Sally Rowe; ''Better This World,'' directed by Katie Galloway and Kelly Duane de la Vega; ''The City Dark,'' directed by Ian Cheney; ''Dragonslayer,'' directed by Tristan Patterson; ''Fightville,'' directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein; ''Kumare,'' directed by Vikram Gandhi; ''Last Days Here,'' directed by Don Argott and Demian Fenton; and ''Where Soldiers Come From,'' directed by Heather Courtney.
Of 1,792 feature-length submissions, the largest chunk, Ms. Pierson said, was made up of films about conflict-oriented sports: wrestling, boxing and such. But only one of those, ''Fightville,'' about hand-to-hand combat, made the cut.
In keeping with the festival's freewheeling approach, several films carried titles with explicit or implied obscenities. ''The Other F Word,'' as it turns out, is not one of them. The title refers to ''family,'' and its unexpected role in the lives of aging punk rockers.
''Something Ventured,'' a film showing in the festival's ''Spotlight Premieres'' category, brings something almost as unexpected from the normally critical documentary world: a sympathetic eye for the achievements of big business.
Directed by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, ''Something Ventured'' looks at investors and entrepreneurs who backed companies like Apple, Intel, Genentech and Cisco.
''They show what it meant to grow these companies,'' Ms. Pierson said. The film, she added, startles with its reminder that venture capitalists and their ilk in just a few years have fundamentally altered things as basic as, say, communication.
''You see how we were all doing these things before,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Inquiries Into a Financial Crisis, Then and Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Frank Partnoy is correct when he argues that the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has proved to be a pale imitation of the original Depression-era Pecora hearings (''Washington's Financial Disaster,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 30). Those hearings captivated the country and created the political climate necessary to pass the New Deal's reforms of the financial industry. 
Mr. Partnoy argues that Congress should try again, but I am doubtful that such an effort would be successful. Perhaps we could find another lawyer with Mr. Pecora's immense talents and willingness to go after the rich and powerful. What we cannot do is recreate Mr. Pecora's impeccable timing.
Mr. Pecora took over the struggling investigation in January 1933. By the time the hearings were over, nearly every bank in the country was closed as governor after governor declared statewide bank holidays.
Mr. Pecora's performance was remarkable. The financial machinations and lavish compensation he revealed shocked the country. Still, the hearings probably would not have had the lasting impact that they did had they not occurred in the throes of the worst financial crisis this country ever faced.
It was the Washington equivalent of a perfect storm -- the precise combination of scandal and crisis necessary to pass substantial financial reform legislation.

HEADLINE: No Way to Run a Trade Policy

 BODY:
Most Republican lawmakers claim they are pro-trade. Their principled position is evidently no match for parochialism and politics. Last month, a conflict over imported sleeping bags between a company in Alabama and a rival in Kentucky led Senate Republicans to block the extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, or G.S.P., which has granted preferential access to some $20 billion worth of imports from developing countries. 
Now Senator Jon Kyl and his colleagues in the Finance Committee are threatening to block the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides income and training for American workers whose employers can't compete with rising imports. It is due to expire on Feb. 12, and Mr. Kyl and company are refusing to extend it unless the White House promises to advance the long-pending trade deal with Colombia.
We agree that President Obama needs to press Congressional Democrats to approve the agreement without delay. But Senator Kyl's tactics make no sense (raising questions about his motivations). His obstruction will punish American workers. It will also hurt Colombia.
That's because Senate Democrats are refusing to support the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act until the trade adjustment bill passes. The preferences, also due to expire on Feb. 12, provide duty-free access to many imports from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru as part of a strategy to combat the cocaine trade by creating jobs in other export industries.
The Andean bill is a core part of the nation's counternarcotics policy. Support for workers displaced by trade is especially important in an economy in which almost 1 in 10 Americans is out of a job. The Generalized System of Preferences has been an effective foreign policy tool since the mid-1970s, premised on the sensible proposition that poor countries can prosper best from trade.
These programs make so much sense that a bill extending all three passed the House on Dec. 15 on a voice vote, only to founder in the Senate. The Andean preferences and the Trade Adjustment Assistance program were extended until Feb. 12 as a stopgap measure. They will expire unless both the House and the Senate vote to extend them before then.
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama blocked the extension of the G.S.P. altogether because he couldn't get sleeping bags removed from the program. He was acting on behalf of Exxel Outdoors, a sleeping-bag maker from Haleyville, Ala., that competes against sleeping bags imported duty-free from Bangladesh by CellCorp of Bowling Green, Ky. The Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, was pushing to pass the G.S.P. in its entirety, so Mr. Sessions put a hold on the bill.
Lawmakers need to look beyond their noses and extend all three programs, including the now-defunct G.S.P. Congress should finally pass the trade agreement with Colombia -- which would boost American exports and help an important ally of the United States.
President Obama has pledged to double exports in five years and identified export promotion as a promising area in which to collaborate with American business. The president and American business could start by giving Senate Republicans and Democrats a sharp push to pass these essential bills.

HEADLINE: Adding SNY to Mets' Sale Pitch Would Increase Allure

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
When Fred Wilpon announced his plan to sell up to 25 percent of the Mets last week to one or more strategic investors, he kept the team's majority ownership of the SNY network, which televises the team's games, off the block.
The decision surprised sports bankers and analysts because the five-year-old network is a lucrative business that could lure buyers eager to own part of a media property in New York. 
SNY generates about $120 million in cash flow a year and could be worth $1 billion -- more than the Mets, which Forbes valued last year at $858 million. A stake in SNY would give an investor a slice of its profits and equity in a growing asset at a time when the Mets are struggling.
But for Wilpon to sell a substantial part of the Mets' nearly 70 percent stake in the network, he would first have to offer it to his partners, Time Warner Cable and Comcast -- which together own about a third of SNY -- and that could slow the process. Comcast would be more likely to want to increase its stake because of its heavy investment around the country in 10 other regional sports networks.
Also, the group more than doubled the debt on SNY to $450 million last year, which would most likely reduce the price an investor would pay for a stake in the network.
But SNY's steady income and growth potential would still attract buyers.
''SNY is an economic lifeline to the team,'' said Lee H. Berke, who consults with teams and owners on starting regional sports networks like SNY. ''Look, anybody coming to say they'll buy the Mets already watches the games on SNY. Everything's in play and investors will assume that, too.''
By walling off SNY from investors, Wilpon seems to be hoping that selling 20 percent to 25 percent of the Mets will be all he needs to satisfy the financial pressures being caused by a lawsuit filed against him and Saul Katz, his brother-in-law, by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme.
The trustee, Irving H. Picard, contends that Wilpon and Katz knew or should have known that Madoff operated a possible fraud, according to two lawyers involved in the case. Picard, according to a lawyer involved in the Madoff cases, is possibly seeking as much as $1 billion -- far more than can be raised from selling a quarter of the team.
All along, Wilpon has said that he is a victim betrayed by Madoff, his old friend.
SNY's place in Wilpon's baseball empire cannot be underestimated, and Mets games make up the most important programming. Even though the Mets' on-field fortunes have declined (and ratings have fallen, though not as drastically as the team has), SNY is thriving.
The channel made its debut in 2006 after the Mets paid Cablevision $54 million to escape the last years of the Mets' deal with the MSG Networks.
Last year the rising value and steady income of SNY allowed the Mets, Time Warner Cable and Comcast to refinance the $200 million they borrowed in 2007. The deal allowed them to pay themselves $240 million in the form of dividends but more than doubled their debt to $450 million.
The refinancing of SNY, at about the same time as a separate refinancing of debt on the Mets, suggested that Wilpon needed the cash to offset his Madoff losses, or was building a reserve to settle Picard's accusations before he filed suit.
Still, the network may be more attractive to an investor than the team is. At the very least, two bankers said, Wilpon should sell parts of the team and the network as a package.
Andrew Herenstein, managing principal of Monarch Alternative Capital, a hedge fund that was a leading creditor of the Texas Rangers before the sale of that team, echoed the view of several bankers and investors that Wilpon and Katz would eventually have to sell a piece of SNY.
''In today's environment,'' he said, ''buyers of sports franchises need to see real value, which is heavily driven by media contracts. It is hard to see a buyer paying a top price for the Mets if SNY isn't included in the sale.''
One way to avoid selling part of the network might be to find wealthy investors who are Mets fans who would view a slice of the team as a trophy.
''All they need is one qualified buyer,'' said Marc Ganis, a sports industry consultant. ''You may have 20 people, 19 of whom would say no. If they find someone to nibble on that basis, they'll take it as far as they can.''
But he said that Wilpon and Katz were not likely to be able to raise $200 million ''for just a 20 to 25 percent stake in the team.''
Another strategy would be to sweeten a minority stake in the team by offering a say in operations or an option to purchase the rest of the team. Yet that may not be enough to please an investor who wants a regular return on a substantial investment, which the network would provide.
Rob Tilliss, founder of Inner Circle Sports, which advises teams and owners, said: ''The problem with the whole thing is, say, I'm Mr. Private Equity or Mr. Hedge Fund. You're just showing me the financials of an underperforming team and leaving all the goodies over there.''
SNY is one of a growing group of regional sports networks that are owned entirely or in part by the teams whose games they televise. The Yankees have YES; the Red Sox have the New England Sports Network; and the Cubs, Bulls, White Sox and Blackhawks own a network in Chicago with Comcast.
Regional sports networks let clubs control their messages, sell tickets and promote their players. More important, they are steady businesses that collect stiff monthly fees from cable, satellite and telephone company subscribers in their markets, building a stream of revenue that flows whether a team wins or loses.
SNY's subscriber revenue should be at least $260 million this year, based on the research firm SNL Kagan's estimate of its $2.37 monthly subscriber fee and total subscriber count of 9.3 million. Advertising revenue augments the subscriber cash.
SNY's main expense is the rights fee that it pays the Mets, which is believed to be $60 million to $70 million.
''The question for the Mets is this,'' Tilliss said. ''Which option is less worse: selling off a piece of SNY or a piece of the Mets?''

HEADLINE: Sell or Build? Devils Owners Clash Over How to Proceed

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The Devils may be streaking back into contention, but the team's majority owner, Jeff Vanderbeek, is becoming bogged down in a fight over the club's future. 
With interest rates relatively low and the economy on the upswing, Vanderbeek wants a loan to add two restaurants in Prudential Center -- the home of the Devils, the Nets and the Seton Hall basketball team -- and to build a hotel nearby.
Raymond Chambers and Mike Gilfillan, who own a substantial minority stake in the club through their company, Brick City LLC, would prefer to sell their shares. But selling minority stakes is difficult because they often do not include control of the team, though they incur many financial risks.
If the entire club was sold at once, Chambers and Gilfillan would have an easier time getting a good price for their shares. But Vanderbeek said he wanted to keep his stake in Devils Arena Entertainment, which owns the team and operates the arena.
So a showdown is under way, with two board members who don't own stakes in the club -- Patrick Hobbs, the dean of Seton Hall's law school, and Arthur Ryan, the former chief executive of Prudential Financial -- trying to broker a solution, according to a person with knowledge of the partnership.
This could include Vanderbeek's buying out Chambers and Gilfillan, or another investor taking their shares. The price is the key. According to Forbes, the Devils were worth $218 million last year, down 2 percent from 2009. The team had debt equal to 115 percent of its value.
Though the team's revenue is growing, it is not profitable. The Prudential Center is expected to turn a profit by the end of 2011.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Hurt By Disarray In Its Books

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If a company's financial reporting were so bad that its auditor had pointed out significant weaknesses in its accounting for seven years running, the Securities and Exchange Commission would most likely be all over it.
But what if the company were the S.E.C. itself?
Since the commission began producing audited statements in 2004, the Government Accountability Office has faulted its reporting almost every year. Last November, the G.A.O. said that the commission's books were in such disarray that it had failed at some of the agency's most fundamental tasks: accurately tracking income from fines, filing fees and the return of ill-gotten profits.
''A reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of S.E.C.'s financial statements would not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis,'' the auditor concluded. 
The auditor did not accuse the S.E.C. of cooking its books, and the mistakes were corrected before its latest financial statements were completed. But the fact that basic accounting continually bedevils the agency responsible for guaranteeing the soundness of American financial markets could prove especially awkward just as the S.E.C. is saying it desperately needs money to increase its regulatory power.
Like the rest of the federal government, the S.E.C. is operating without an increase in its budget, which was $1.1 billion last year. With President Obama talking about extending the freeze and lawmakers continuing their criticism of its embarrassing performance before the financial crisis, the agency's prospects for more money appear bleak.
That has ominous implications for investors. The S.E.C.'s technology systems, for example, lack the ability to perform sophisticated analysis of large batches of financial material. As a result, a Congressional report says, S.E.C. analysts sometimes resort to printouts, calculators and pencils. While investigating the ''flash crash'' of May 6, 2010, S.E.C. computers were so strained by the crush of data from just one day of trading that it took three months to figure out what had happened.
In recent weeks the commission has reduced travel to examine regulated companies, and it cannot fill many jobs vacated in the last year. Meanwhile, Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, says that to carry out the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul signed by Mr. Obama last year, the commission needs 800 additional employees, more than a 20 percent increase over its 3,750-person work force.
Still, by several measures, the S.E.C. is far from starved for money. Its $1.1 billion budget in 2010 was 15 percent higher than the $960 million it received the year before -- and nearly triple its $377 million budget in 2000.
Representative Spencer T. Bachus, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said last week that the tripling of the S.E.C.'s budget occurred in a period that included some of the agency's biggest failures -- the Ponzi schemes of Bernard L. Madoff and R. Allen Stanford and the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
Ms. Schapiro, an Obama appointee, came to the agency after all of those missteps. She has directed sweeping structural changes, increasing enforcement and pouring money into updating its technology infrastructure. To address the shortcomings in financial reporting described by the G.A.O., she decided to outsource those tasks to another government agency.
In an interview, Ms. Schapiro said that she understood the skepticism over her call for more resources but she noted that Dodd-Frank significantly expanded the agency's responsibilities over hedge funds, derivatives and credit ratings agencies.
''When you look at the composite picture of how the agency has changed and I hope will continue to change,'' she said, ''I think we're really poised to be that agile regulator that the country has a right to expect of us.''
Her efforts have attracted some support as well as warnings of the consequences of cutting the S.E.C.'s budget now.
''This is a serious threat to financial reform,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who steered Dodd-Frank through the House. ''What you get is a disproportionate assault on our ability to regulate the financial industries.''
Ms. Schapiro has received plaudits for her reforms from some former S.E.C. officials, who say that the agency has for years fought battles over its budget. ''She's done an awful lot that people should be proud of and optimistic about,'' said Annette L. Nazareth, a partner at Davis Polk and a former S.E.C. commissioner and division director.
At times during the debate over the Dodd-Frank legislation, it looked as if the S.E.C. was going to get a solution to its budget problems. The agency has long been a net contributor to the United States Treasury; last year it collected $300 million more in fees from Wall Street than it cost to run the agency. The difference went to the Treasury.
Efforts to allow the agency to use all of the money it collects and bypass Congressional appropriations died during the Dodd-Frank debate, despite the additional responsibilities the law gave the S.E.C.
''It's almost as if the commission is being set up to fail,'' said Harvey L. Pitt, who was S.E.C. chairman from 2001 to 2003 and who now is chief executive of Kalorama Partners.
Dodd-Frank did authorize a doubling of the commission's budget, to $2.25 billion, over the next five years -- without providing the money for it. It also authorized the commission to spend as much as $100 million beyond its operating budget for new technology systems.
Ms. Schapiro said that buying new technology was crucial because it helped to attract specialists in mathematics and financial systems that the S.E.C. needed to help police the rapidly evolving financial markets.
''It's very hard to attract great people if they think that there's not going to be the opportunity to use technology to get the job done, which can make us so much more efficient,'' she said.
Anticipating new employees, the S.E.C. has been busily leasing more office space -- an effort that has drawn the attention of the agency's inspector general. Last week, he began investigating the S.E.C.'s decision last July to lease more than a million square feet of prime office space in Washington, one of the largest federal leases in a decade.
Within a few months of that decision, its prospects for bigger budgets fading, the S.E.C. began negotiations to return some of the leased space. The latest inquiry is the second investigation of the S.E.C.'s leasing practices in a year. Last September, H. David Kotz, the inspector general, reported that a lack of adequate policies led the agency to make lease payments that could have been avoided, including more than $15 million for space in Manhattan that no S.E.C. employees have occupied in the last five years.
Agency officials say the space was leased after 9/11, when its offices were demolished, but soon proved inadequate for the New York operations, which moved to larger offices.
Lease payments also figured in the G.A.O.'s assessment of the agency's financial reporting. The auditor found that the agency, in a preliminary version of its annual report, had understated its lease payments by $40 million.

HEADLINE: Belarus: Promises of Aid for Opposition

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The United States and the European Union joined Wednesday in Warsaw in a show of support for the democratic opposition in Belarus.
The move is a reaction to a violent crackdown last December after tens of thousands of demonstrators challenged the presidential election results. 
During a donors' conference organized by the Polish government, the United States pledged to increase its annual aid for human rights, educational groups and independent media to $14 million, up from $11 million.
''We want to show our solidarity with the people of Belarus in response to the brutal crackdown,'' said Lee Feinstein, the U.S. ambassador to Poland. The American delegation was led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Daniel A Russell.
The European Union and the United States have already imposed sanctions on top Belarus officials, including President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, as well as the security forces who can be identified in leading the crackdown and arresting over 600 opposition activists.
On Wednesday, the E.U. enlargement commissioner, Stefan Fule, said the Union was now focused on how to strengthen the civil society movement in Belarus. Mr. Fule said the E.U. would quadruple its annual financial assistance to 16 million, or $22 million. He said it would be directed at Belarusian non-governmental organizations, independent media and students repressed by the Belarusian authorities.
Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, announced last month that Warsaw would double its aid, to $14 million.
Poland, which borders Belarus, has taken the lead in rallying support from Europe and the United States for the democratic opposition in Belarus, many of whose members are still in prison while the independent media, radio and television have either been closed or severely restricted. Speaking at the donors' conference, Mr. Sikorski delivered a strong attack on Mr. Lukashenko.
''Mr. President, you are losing. No one is ready to believe in an 80 percent election result,'' Mr. Sikorski said, referring to last December's returns.
''Your methods have no place in modern Europe,'' Mr. Sikorski added. ''Sooner or later you will a have to flee from your citizens and find shelter in a country which professes even lower standards than you do.''
Independent organizations said the conference was also aimed at keeping international attention on Belarus.
''We would very much like for the world to remember the events in Belarus for as long as possible because now the attention is being directed to other events in the world, like the unrest in Egypt,'' said Dzmitry Novikau, president of the board of the independent European Radio for Belarus, which broadcasts news to Belarus from Warsaw.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Weak Earnings and Unrest In Egypt Push Down Shares

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Most stocks fell on Wednesday as earnings reports from companies including Broadcom and Aflac disappointed investors and as antigovernment protests in Egypt worsened.
Broadcom, the chip maker, slumped 5.6 percent after it reported margins that missed analysts' estimates. Aflac, the world's largest seller of supplemental health insurance, fell 2.4 percent as operating income trailed forecasts. Electronic Arts, the video game maker, rose 16 percent and Time Warner rose more than 8.6 percent as profits beat projections. 
The S.& P. 500-stock index retreated 0.3 percent to 1,304.03. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 1.81 points, or less than .02 percent, to 12,041.97. The Nasdaq fell 0.06 percent, closing at 2,749.56
''You need to be somewhat skeptical at this stage,'' said Michael Nasto, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio. ''We've had a very sharp stock rally. It's not surprising that we see the market moving either sideways or lower. There's concern about geopolitical risks. There's been improvement in both economic data and earnings. However, you'd need to see stronger figures to push stocks higher.''
Oil settled at $90.86 a barrel in New York, near the highest price in more than two years.
At current levels, oil will increase airline costs by more than this year's projected earnings, threatening the industry's return to profitability, the International Air Transport Association said.
Interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 92 31/32, and the yield rose to 3.48 percent from 3.44 percent late Tuesday.
Broadcom fell to $43.79 a share after it had reported that fourth-quarter gross margin was 50.9 percent, compared to the 51.6 percent average estimated by analysts polled by Bloomberg.
Aflac shares dropped to $57.10. It posted operating income, which excludes some investment results, of $1.33 a share in the fourth quarter, missing the average estimate by analysts of $1.35. Realized investment losses were $191 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $307 million a year earlier, the company said.
Genworth Financial declined 8.5 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, to $12.76 a share. The mortgage guarantor and life insurer swung to a fourth-quarter loss on $350 million in costs tied to backing home loans as fewer borrowers returned to compliance. The operating loss was 28 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate for a 16-cent profit.
Electronic Arts rose the most in the S.& P. 500, to $18.09 a share. The company reported that its third-quarter profit rose to 59 cents a share, excluding some items, exceeding the 56-cent average estimated by analysts. Sales, excluding changes in deferred revenue, came to $1.41 billion, compared with the $1.43 billion average estimate of analysts.
Time Warner shares rose to $35.10. Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, rose to 67 cents a share, topping the 62-cent average of estimated by analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
Time Warner increased its dividend 11 percent and raised its share buyback program by $4 billion.

HEADLINE: Aesthetics? This Architect Likes the Dirty Work

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Karen Thomas worked for more than 20 years at architecture firms in New York, including Costas Kondylis and Beyer Blinder Belle, after graduating from Pennsylvania State University in 1988. But she eventually realized she would rather manage the construction of complex buildings than draw their blueprints. In 2007 she established her own firm, Karen Thomas Associates, an owner's representative for high-end residential projects. Ms. Thomas, 45, lives in Greenwich Village with her husband, Ralph Gillis, an architect and former employer of hers, and their 9-year-old son, Henry.
Design gene: My family is from California, but I grew up in State College, Pa., where my dad was a college professor. It wasn't an area rich in architectural examples; my schools were nondescript. Our house was modern and mostly designed by my mother. She went to school to be a costume designer and wound up becoming one of the first women to be an Episcopal priest. 
Art plus math equals... My high school art teacher said I should be an architect because I loved math and art, and architecture combined them. Not exactly true. At my college there was a great emphasis on architectural philosophy and the idea that all design came out of philosophic notions.
Platonic Architecture 101? No Plato, more like Dante and Umberto Eco. But Penn State had a premier lighting design program, so I took a course in that, and also architectural engineering.
New York or bust: I came to New York City basically with not a penny in my pockets; I stayed on Long Island for a week with a friend's parents while I looked for a job, and I found one at LCP, a firm that failed in the '90s. They did commercial interiors.
Mixing it up: I worked for my future husband for five years on a nice mix of commercial and residential projects. Then I was with Costas Kondylis for two crazy years. He had a busy office and high-profile clients like Trump. An incredible opportunity, but at the time, it was like, ''Here's a 26-story building project, go do it,'' and ''Hey Karen, I know you're working on two high-rises, but can you take on another?''
Sweating the details: Part of being with an architectural firm is having a lot of arguments with your respected colleagues about aesthetics. It got to where I didn't enjoy it. Also, I didn't like it that as an architect there were so many things you couldn't control. You've got the zoning board, building codes, economics, permits and 88 community board meetings to worry about, but what I found out was I loved dealing with all that stuff, even the controversy.
Making it happen: I guess I'm totally a control freak. The work we do here, we let the architects and interior designers focus on the aesthetics and we do all the things they don't want to; it provokes in me, frankly, more creativity than before. The architect designs the project and we make it happen. Everything has to be beautiful, but everything has to work perfectly. On a single house, there could be 20 consultants; it's highly technical.
Personal projects: We gutted our apartment on 11th Street. I was up every night until 2 worrying over details. I'd call the aesthetic modern with a use of organic materials. Now we're planning to tear down our little 1970s house in East Hampton Village and do something modern, low-maintenance and very, very sustainably designed. As an architect, you try to achieve perfection but never really can.

HEADLINE: Visa Posts 16% Rise in Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Visasaid on Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 16 percent in its most recent quarter as debit card use continued to grow and consumers returned to using credit cards.
The company said net income for the period rose to $884 million, or $1.23 a share, from $763 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the first quarter of Visa's fiscal year, rose across all of its main businesses, gaining 14 percent, to $2.24 billion from $1.96 billion.
Visa said its growth was driven by higher payments volume both in the United States and globally. The total number of transactions handled in the quarter rose 15 percent, to 13 billion.
The results topped Wall Street's expectations. Analysts were expecting profit of $1.20 a share and revenue of $2.22 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.
Shares, however, slipped in after-hours trading. The stock fell 94 cents, to $71.15, after closing up $1.39, or 1.97 percent, at $72.09.
A UBS analyst, Jason Kupferberg, suggested investors might have been disappointed that the results did not exceed expectations by a larger margin. Visa often posts stronger numbers than Wall Street predicts.
Nevertheless, he said that the quarter was strong, there were no major surprises and the increase in global spending on cards was positive. Higher consumer spending ''started to emerge over the last couple of quarters, and now seems to be gaining a little traction,'' he said.
Visa's chief executive, Joseph W. Saunders, called the results a ''great start'' to the company's fiscal year. He said in a statement that the company was ''intensely focused'' on increasing global revenue. He pointed to efforts to expand its money transfer business and card use in countries where cash and checks still dominated, along with investments in new technologies like mobile payments and ecommerce.
Credit card use in the United States, which dropped off during the recession, rose 7.5 percent. Debit card use jumped 16 percent. International credit card use rose 20 percent. Global debit card use, a much smaller business, rose 34 percent.

HEADLINE: Early Maneuvering On Possible Shutdown

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats do not intend to shut up when it comes to a potential government shutdown.
Well aware that a 1995 budget impasse during the early days of Republican control of the House backfired on the new majority, Democrats are moving pre-emptively this time to frame the battle on their terms.
There are two reasons: They say that focusing early on the issue could deter Republicans from pushing ahead with demands for spending cuts that Democrats say are unacceptable. At the same time, they are making the case that voters should hold Republicans accountable if things do go off the rails in the coming months. 
Through statements, news conferences and summoning expert testimony, Democrats are raising red flags about the threat to the economic recovery posed by the possibility of even a temporary interruption in government services or a federal default.
''There is a reasonable chance that push is going to come to shove,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who has been consulting with Senate Democrats on their approach. ''And it is very important for Democrats to start making the case now about why this occurring, that Republicans are willing to put the economy and important government services in jeopardy to advance their ideological agenda.''
Republicans dispute the notion that they are angling for a shutdown, pointing out that party leaders have said they have no interest in reaching that point. And they say Democrats are the ones politicizing the issue.
''If they spent as much time on the policy of getting together and solving the problems as they do on the politics, I think we would all be much better off,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
Other Republicans point to distinct differences between 2011 and 1995. Republicans now control only the House rather than commanding the entire Congress as they did in their showdown with President Bill Clinton. And they say that Americans now see the deficit and debt as a much more serious issue, which could cause them to accuse Democrats of holding out against needed fiscal changes.
''Our debt is $14 trillion and the deficit is $1.5 trillion and the public is looking for some adult leadership on these issues,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. ''I think the same old demagoguery is not going to win the day because in the end we are going to have to do something.''
While some Republican activists and conservative lawmakers have suggested that a government shutdown might not be such a bad outcome for Republicans eager to show determination on spending cuts, the two Republican leaders -- Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- have played down such talk.
This week on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. McConnell said two imminent fiscal deadlines -- a presidential request to increase the debt limit this spring and the March 4 expiration of a stopgap measure funding the government -- present rare openings to take on tough spending decisions. He said Congress and the president should use those opportunities to ''try to accomplish something on a bipartisan basis on both our short-term debt and our long-term unfunded liabilities.''
Democrats have interpreted such comments and more direct statements from House leaders to mean that Republicans will insist on steep spending cuts as the price for keeping the government operating. They say their goal now is to keep the focus on the Republican strategy.
''They are playing a game of brinksmanship,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, who is shaping his party's message in the Senate. ''We want to bring it to light regularly, repeatedly and soon.''
Mr. Schumer sought to sound the alarm about Republicans and a shutdown in his own appearances on the Sunday talk shows, accusing Republicans of ''playing with fire.''
On Thursday, he and other Senate Democratic leaders are scheduled to appear with the economist Mark Zandi to discuss the potential consequences of a government shutdown or default.
The White House is weighing in as well. William M. Daley, the new chief of staff to President Obama, warned on Wednesday of the impact of a shutdown in a Bloomberg News roundtable with reporters.
He said he found it ''hard to believe that anyone's going to screw around with bringing this thing to the brink and have even, you know, a few days of chaos in the marketplace that will affect people's pensions and affect their confidence at a time where the economy is just beginning to come back.''
Democrats say they have demonstrated that they are open to compromise on spending because the president has proposed a freeze and joined lawmakers in expressing a willingness to consider cuts. They say this will provide some protection from Republican charges that they fail to grasp the gravity of the fiscal situation.
But they say a shutdown would have serious consequences that need to be aired.
''We want to talk clearly about the impacts that this could happen and not pretend it is just some political game,'' Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, said. ''This is real business.''

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Raided In Moscow Hotel Inquiry

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
6:10 p.m. Updated
MOSCOW - Masked policemen raided Deutsche Bank's main Moscow office on Wednesday, questioning bankers and unnerving employees.
Police said they were searching for documents in a real estate deal linked to a member of the Russian Parliament, now living in exile in the United States. 
The parliamentarian, Ashot Yegiazaryan, had business dealings with companies tied to the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, who fell from favor and resigned last fall.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement that the search concerned the dealings of a single client, and that the firm's own work was not a matter of suspicion. The bank ''continues to operate as normal,'' the statement said.
In the months since Mr. Luzhkov's resignation, the police have raided dozens of businesses seen as close to his administration.
On Wednesday, the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General's Office said in a statement that it searched Deutsche Bank's offices for evidence in a embezzlement case related to the reconstruction of Hotel Moscow, a Stalinist-era landmark off Red Square.
The committee said it suspected an aide to Mr. Yegiazaryan of embezzling $87.5 million from a company overseeing the hotel construction that Deutsche Bank had partly financed. The company, in turn, was fully owned by the city government, the committee said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Yegiazaryan, still a member of Parliament in the Liberal Democratic Party, has fled Russia. Through his lawyers, he has said he is a victim of political repression. Separately, Russian prosecutors on Monday said that they had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Yegiazaryan.
Whatever the legal or political missteps of such clients, foreign bankers in Moscow have for years implored the government to refrain from conducting such jarring raids on bank offices. Sometimes, police wielding guns force stock analysts and economists onto the floors of their offices. This happens often enough in Moscow financial institutions that such incidents are referred to as a ''masky show,'' a term coined in the 1990s when it began.
The practice continues, though President Dmitri A. Medvedev has said he wants Moscow to become an international financial center that competes with the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore in emerging market business.
In November, police armed with automatic weapons raided a bank belonging to the billionaire Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a part owner of the national airline Aeroflot. Mr. Lebedev said he was sitting in his office when men in commando outfits wearing masks burst in, looking for documents in a two-year-old white-collar crime case.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On Gulf Oil Spill's Effects, Doing Science With a Deadline

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ and MARK SCHROPE

 BODY:
In mid-December, Wes Tunnell's phone rang with a request that would ruin his holiday plans.
The team working with Kenneth R. Feinberg, the administrator of the $20 billion compensation fund for victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, needed an expert opinion on how much time would pass before the gulf and its shrimp, fish, crabs and oysters would fully recover from the oil damage. What's more, they wanted it in two weeks.
''I just dove in,'' said Dr. Tunnell, a marine biologist, who worked nearly nonstop through Jan. 3, taking off only Christmas and a half-day on New Year's, to create a 39-page report. It was released on Wednesday as the scientific foundation for Mr. Feinberg's methodology for determining settlements from the fund. 
Dr. Tunnell's report is a projection that falls somewhere between the deliberate pace of science and the deadline-driven needs of law -- a report that puts an important marker down on the progress of the gulf recovery, but is much more an early stab than the last word.
''This is the first time anybody has stood up and said, 'Here's what we think is the future of the gulf,' '' Mr. Feinberg said in an interview on Wednesday.
And the news, according to the report, is better than many expected: The gulf is undergoing a strong recovery, with overall fish populations potentially back to pre-spill levels by the end of 2012, though oyster beds and some other hard-hit areas could be ailing for a longer period of time, leading to reduced catches for some fishermen.
Working from those estimates, Mr. Feinberg's team developed a plan that calls for payments of twice the damages that most people are claiming for last year, and four times the damages for claims related to oysters last year.
The guidelines outlined by Mr. Feinberg relied on two reports, one by Mr. Tunnell and another by the Analysis Research Planning Corporation, an economics consulting firm with experience in evaluating disasters for litigation.
Mr. Feinberg said he chose Dr. Tunnell because ''he doesn't pull punches -- he tells it like it is, and that's what I wanted to know.''
Dr. Tunnell is associate director of Texas A&M's Harte Research Institute in Corpus Christi, which focuses on the Gulf of Mexico and marine research. It brings together biologists and chemists, but its ranks also include an economist and an expert on marine law and policy.
Harte's executive director, Larry McKinney, said the spill was ''exactly what we were put together to look at.'' The institute endorsed Dr. Tunnell's report.
The report, however, quickly drew criticism from spill victims and from environmentalists who said it underplayed the damage caused by BP's runaway well.
''This is not a scientific report -- it's an opinion,'' said Ian MacDonald, a professor of oceanography at Florida State University and a member of the National Wildlife Federation's science advisory panel. ''It doesn't propose any methodology by which its assumptions and predictions could be tested.''
Dr. MacDonald added, ''We can't use these early rosy scenarios as an excuse to not do what's necessary, which is once and for all establishing a health monitoring method and restoration program for the entire Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.''
Another marine expert, James Cowan, a fisheries scientist at Louisiana State University, said the report ''suffers from way too much lumping,'' by which he meant lumping together so many species that significant impact on some species might be glossed over.
''The question is, does it affect a small number of species more directly and indirectly -- and that's the part that's missing,'' Dr. Cowan said.
Dr. Tunnell acknowledged Dr. MacDonald's criticisms, saying, ''Yes, Ian is correct. It is an opinion.'' But he added that his report was based on a thorough review of the data available at this point.
He also said that his opinion did not conflict with the goals that Dr. MacDonald described. In fact, he said, the Harte Institute was ''doing exactly what Dr. MacDonald is saying needs to be done,'' and was working on further evaluation, restoration and protection strategies for the gulf.
As for the lumping issue, he acknowledged it as a ''weak point of the report,'' but added, ''I doubt that anyone would be willing to write a species-specific report like that.''
Dr. Tunnell said he was prepared from the start for strong reactions and even personal attacks. ''With my 35 years of experience looking at other areas, this is the bottom line of what I think,'' he said, adding that he warns about areas of continuing concern, like damaged marshes and dead deep-sea corals.
''Time may tell that I'm wrong,'' he said, ''but they needed to get on with settlement cases and I felt I could make that call''
Many early reports from environmental analysts, he said, were alarmist.
''When the spill first occurred, lots of people were crying alarm that all kinds of bad things were going to happen and that the whole Gulf of Mexico was going to die,'' he said. ''It's unfortunate that even scientists would react like that because it gives us a bad name collectively when those things don't play out.''
And while the report might seem optimistic to some, he is no pawn of industry, he said: ''I've been training people in how to take care of the environment for decades.''
Mr. Feinberg, the fund administrator, said that the report was not definitive, but that it set the basis for negotiating final settlements. ''I don't claim to have a crystal ball -- it is a murky world,'' he said. ''But the law has deadlines, and this is the best I can do.''
As for those who believe that the estimates are too optimistic and thus payouts from the fund will be too small, they can continue to watch and wait during the three-year span of the payment program to see how the gulf recovers, and file for interim payments during that time.
And ultimately, Mr. Feinberg said, pursuing a lawsuit instead of a settlement remained an option open to all.
''If you don't want it,'' he said, ''don't take it.''

HEADLINE: Payroll Survey for January Finds 187,000 Added Jobs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Private employers in the United States added more jobs than expected in January, the 12th consecutive month that companies took on staff, according to data released Wednesday. 
Other data showed that even though planned layoffs in January rose 20 percent from December, the tally was the lowest for a January since at least 1993.
The private sector added 187,000 jobs in January, compared with a downwardly revised 247,000 jobs in December, a report by the payrolls processor ADP showed.
''Bottom line, even with the December downward revision, the two-month average is a solid 217,000 and certainly a positive for economic activity,'' said Peter Boockvar, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
Most indicators have suggested that the nation's economy is picking up steam, but job creation largely has been slow since the end of the recession in June 2009.
Analysts have closely watched data on private payrolls, which tend to represent the bulk of new job gains.
The January ADP figure was above economists' expectations for gains of 145,000 in a Reuters poll.
The global outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas said January layoff announcements rose to 38,519, up 20 percent from December. The report added, however, that layoffs were down 46 percent compared with January of last year.
Noting that January was typically a month of large job cuts, the report said the slowing in job cuts that began in the latter half of 2010 appeared to be continuing.

HEADLINE: Price-Fixing By KeySpan Will Cost It $12 Million

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Although price-fixing by an electricity company may have cost New York customers nearly $300 million, the federal government can close the books on the case by collecting a penalty of just $12 million, a judge ruled on Wednesday. 
KeySpan Energy Corporation, a wholesale electricity generator, artificially raised the price of electricity from May 2003 to March 2008 by making a complicated deal that gave it a stake in the profits of a competitor, the Astoria Generating Company, according to the Justice Department. The department and the company agreed to a settlement of $12 million, which would go to the federal treasury, but in court filings, Consolidated Edison, the New York State Consumer Protection Board and others objected, saying that the settlement was too small and that the money should go back to ratepayers.
Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan said in a decision that the sum to which the damages should be compared was not the estimated penalty to customers, which economists said could run as high as $300 million, but revenue under the improper scheme, which was probably closer to $49 million. But this was a settlement, not a judgment, and thus the government should expect to settle for less, he said. ''Full damages cannot be expected,'' Judge Pauley wrote.
He ruled that the $12 million represented ''disgorgement,'' or return of ill-gotten gains. Its purpose was not to compensate customers who had been harmed, but to recover profits wrongly gained, he wrote. He said that payment to consumers might be ''optimal'' but that giving the money to the government served the public interest, and was simpler. The judge said this was the first instance of the government's seeking disgorgement under the Sherman antitrust law. Electricity experts said that his ruling had probably set a precedent that would allow use of that law in future cases.
Contacted on Wednesday afternoon, both Con Edison, which had alerted regulators to the manipulation, and the New York State Consumer Protection Board said they were studying the decision and had not decided if they would appeal. Legal experts said that whether or not an appeal was possible, a new lawsuit against KeySpan by an aggrieved customer was possible.
Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said: ''We are very disappointed that the settlement won't be going to the ratepayers who were overcharged, and that the amount doesn't approach the nearly $300 million involved. We do believe our efforts, however, have led to corrections in the capacity markets that will help to prevent similar abuses in the future.''

HEADLINE: Lavish Centennial Plans Testify to the Strength Of Reagan's Influence

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Ronald Reagan would have turned 100 this Sunday, and nearly seven years after his death, one might think he were still alive and leading the Republican Party.
Along with the requisite speeches and academic panels, the festivities include: a Rose Parade float, a six-foot-high cake, commemorative stamps and jelly beans, a Beach Boys concert, a tribute from the Jonas Brothers and a video homage at the Super Bowl, which is also on Sunday. The memorials, including a 21-gun salute and a graveside wreath-laying by Nancy Reagan, are expected to draw hundreds of former aides and supporters.
Reagan is not the first former president to enjoy the honor of a centennial celebration, but it is hard to remember any that were quite so lavish, speaking to his enduring role in American politics. (This weekend's festivities at the Reagan Library here, the highlight of a year's worth of events around the country, will cost roughly $5 million; by contrast, the cost of Lyndon Johnson's centennial in 2008 was a mere $500,000.) 
And a number of the prospective 2012 presidential candidates will be on hand to offer their praise during the revelry, among them Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, who has just written a book about Reagan and, in an interview, called him the ''most successful president at actually achieving his specific and articulated goals.''
The accolades illustrate the unusual durability -- at least among Republicans -- of the Reagan legacy, which has endured even as so many institutions have been under attack. Reagan's near-idol status in the G.O.P. is so ingrained that when potential party chairmen were asked last month to name their political hero, the moderator hastened to add ''aside from President Reagan.''
If the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation has any say, that qualifier will be repeated for decades.
''Our job is to promote the legacy of his words and work, which were simply incredible,'' said John Heubusch, the executive director of the foundation and a former Congressional aide, who said that Reagan inspired him to enter politics. ''I'd go toe-to-toe to debate with anyone who said he was not a transformational president. He certainly was.''
Staff members at the foundation are careful to point out that the money for the events and for the museum's $15 million renovation came entirely from private fund-raising. ''President Reagan would not have wanted Congress to spend any money on this,'' said Stewart McLaurin, the director of the centennial events, who also went to work for Reagan in 1984.
What about the presidential Jelly Belly jelly beans? Reagan was a famous fan, so it is certainly possible that he would look kindly on spending $24.95 for the special edition Reagan Centennial box. Along with 50 flavors of jelly beans, the box comes with a copy of the Declaration of Independence, a brief history of Reagan's life and several of his quotes.
The Reaganisms include the lofty: ''I can assure you that personal faith and conviction are strengthened, not weakened, in adversity.'' And then there's his philosophy on jelly beans: ''You can tell a lot about a fella's character by whether he picks out all of one color or just grabs a handful.''
Perhaps it is hardly surprising for Reagan, who was known as the Great Communicator, to be quoted so extensively.
''He's referred to all the time because he's extraordinarily quotable and inspiring, as much as Lincoln and more than anyone else in the 20th century,'' Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Gingrich is hardly the only presidential hopeful who will lavish such adoration for Reagan in the coming days. Ms. Palin is scheduled to speak at a banquet for the Young America's Foundation, a conservative group that uses the former Reagan family ranch near here as its headquarters. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is also expected to attend the official events, as will former Vice President Dick Cheney.
The love for Reagan is not universal, of course, and liberals do not hold him in such high esteem.
''Reagan holds unique status today because the Republicans don't have anyone else,'' said Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide and a political strategist. ''They can't lionize Eisenhower because, by today's standards, he was a liberal. They can't lionize Nixon because he was a criminal. Who have they got left?''
''He was an extraordinary president,'' Mr. Begala added, ''but the right needed a hero, so they turned him into a hero.''
Still, President Obama's aides were happy to let it be known that his vacation reading list included a biography of the 40th president by Lou Cannon.
Mr. Cannon said that the popular view of Reagan had only improved with time, although his approval ratings were higher than many other presidents when he left office.
''There's always a certain nostalgia,'' Mr. Cannon said. ''But the reality is he really did help end the cold war. The world now ain't a walk in Central Park, but it's certainly a much safer place than when Reagan took office. And he convinced Americans to believe in themselves.''
That is the sort of lesson the foundation hopes to pass on, mindful that most of today's students were not yet born when Reagan left office. This year, they distributed a Reagan-centered curriculum to more than 1,400 high schools throughout the country. The schools will also receive a special Reagan centennial coin, which organizers here hope will be used for the coin toss at Friday night football games. Once the game is done, Mr. McLaurin said, those same schools are expected to use the coin to present a student with a Reagan leadership award.
The flurry of activity is a bit bewildering to those who helped plan Johnson's centennial three years ago.
''Our goal wasn't really an extravaganza, it was something more modest,'' said Larry Temple, the chairman of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation. ''We were just trying to put a spotlight on things that might be overlooked. We were trying to do what any history should do, which is show the relevancy to today.''
The Johnson people did have aspirations for a postage stamp, but they quickly realized that getting even a former president's image on the right corner of an envelope could take years. Reagan Foundation officials, on the other hand, were able to fast-track the process, in part because the Postal Service created the first Reagan stamp in 2004, shortly after his death. The newest version will be issued this month as a ''forever'' stamp, making it valid even when the price of postage increases. This time, it might please Reagan to know, his image will not be subject to inflation.

HEADLINE: Officials Consider Requiring Insurers to Offer Free Contraceptives

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is examining whether the new health care law can be used to require insurance plans to offer contraceptives and other family planning services to women free of charge.
Such a requirement could remove cost as a barrier to birth control, a longtime goal of advocates for women's rights and experts on women's health. But it is likely to reignite debate over the federal role in health care, especially reproductive health, at a time when Republicans in Congress have vowed to repeal the law or dismantle it piece by piece. It is also raising objections from the Roman Catholic Church and is expected to generate a robust debate about privacy.
The law says insurers must cover ''preventive health services'' and cannot charge for them. The administration has asked a panel of outside experts to help identify the specific preventive services that must be covered for women.
Administration officials said they expected the list to include contraception and family planning because a large body of scientific evidence showed the effectiveness of those services. But the officials said they preferred to have the panel of independent experts make the initial recommendations so the public would see them as based on science, not politics. 
Many obstetricians, gynecologists, pediatricians and public health experts have called for coverage of family planning services, including contraceptives, without co-payments, deductibles or other cost-sharing requirements.
Dr. Hal C. Lawrence III, vice president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said contraceptives fit any reasonable definition of preventive health care because they averted unintended pregnancies and allowed women to control the timing, number and spacing of births. This, in turn, improves maternal and child health by reducing infant mortality, complications of pregnancy and even birth defects, said Dr. Lawrence, who is in charge of the group's practice guidelines.
But the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and some conservative groups, including the Family Research Council, say birth control is not a preventive service in the usual sense of the term.
''Pregnancy is not a disease to be prevented, nor is fertility a pathological condition,'' said Deirdre A. McQuade, a spokeswoman for the bishops' Pro-Life Secretariat. ''So birth control is not preventive care, and it should not be mandated.''
About one-half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, last month unveiled a 10-year plan to improve the nation's health. One goal of the initiative is to ''increase the proportion of health insurance plans that cover contraceptive supplies and services.''
The Department of Health and Human Services commissioned the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, to help identify preventive services for women that must be covered at no cost under the health care law. The institute, a nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization, seeks to provide unbiased advice to decision makers and the public.
Using this advice, the department expects to issue ''comprehensive guidelines'' for women's preventive care by Aug. 1.
A White House spokesman, Nick Papas, said it was too early to comment. ''We will wait and see what the study returns,'' he said.
Congress left it to the administration to define the preventive care benefit and adopted an amendment by Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, requiring officials to pay special attention to the ''unique health needs of women.''
Lawmakers said they also meant to require coverage of annual checkups and health assessments known as well-woman visits; screening for domestic violence, heart disease and breast and cervical cancer; and doctor visits for women intending to become pregnant.
In a report more than 15 years ago, the Institute of Medicine said financial barriers to contraception ''should be reduced by increasing the proportion of all health insurance policies that cover contraceptive services and supplies, including both male and female sterilization, with no co-payments or other cost-sharing requirements.''
Brand-name versions of oral contraceptives can cost $45 to $60 a month or more, not including the cost of a doctor visit for a prescription. In recent years, many health plans have increased co-payments for prescription drugs, so even women with insurance may end up paying half the cost of birth-control pills.
Administration officials and Democrats in Congress said free preventive care was just one of the health care law's benefits for women. It also prohibits insurers from charging women more than men of the same age for the same coverage. Such disparities have been common. As a result, premiums for women have often been 25 percent to 50 percent higher than those for men.
Advocates for women's health, including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have urged the administration to require coverage at no cost for family planning, including contraceptive drugs and devices.
Likewise, the American Academy of Pediatrics said, ''Adolescents and adult women need to have access to the full menu of contraceptive methods without cost-sharing,'' along with counseling and education.
This recommendation is supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, the March of Dimes, Naral Pro-Choice America, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National Women's Law Center and scores of Democrats in Congress.
But Ms. McQuade of the Catholic bishops' conference said any requirement for coverage of contraception could violate the ''rights of conscience'' of religious employers and others who had moral or religious objections to it. This concern is amplified, she said, by the fact that some emergency contraceptives can act like abortion-inducing drugs.
Jeanne Monahan, the director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council, said: ''The government should focus on services that prevent disease. Fertility and babies are not diseases. Fertility occurs in healthy women.''
The issue is also complicated by privacy concerns.
Dr. Margaret J. Blythe, a professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said some adolescents would be reluctant to use a preventive care benefit unless the government and insurers guaranteed the confidentiality of family planning services and screening for sexually transmitted infections.
When a doctor or a clinic files a claim, the insurer is often required to send an explanation of benefits to the policyholder, often a parent, describing the services provided. Parents sometimes learn from such notices that their children are sexually active.
Doctors said the need for confidentiality was even greater now because, under the new law, many young adults could stay on their parents' policies until age 26.
Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has studied unintended pregnancy for three decades, said: ''It's absolutely critical that family planning be considered a preventive service. It could prevent all kinds of health problems, and it would actually save taxpayers money.''
''We have rigorous evidence that every dollar invested in family planning saves more than a dollar in welfare and social service costs for children that result from unintended births,'' Ms. Sawhill said.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Proposes Rules to Make Derivative Prices Less Opaque

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
7:03 p.m. Updated
For even the most sophisticated investors, derivatives trading can be murky at best.
But financial regulators are now on the verge of equipping investors with crucial information that has long been secret: the prices at which derivative contracts are trading.
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday proposed new rules that would allow derivatives trading to move from the private corners of the financial world onto new exchangelike platforms, known as swap execution facilities, a term coined by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The financial regulatory law requires derivatives to be traded on the swap execution facilities or on regulated exchanges, both of which would offer enhanced price transparency to investors.
''This is an important and complex undertaking which adds a significant new component to the regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives,'' Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, said in a statement.
Derivatives are complex instruments that derive their value from underlying assets like corporate bonds, mortgages and commodities. Investors can use derivatives, like swap contracts, to hedge against the fluctuating value of the asset - or to place speculative bets that the asset's value will rise or fall.
The S.E.C.'s proposed rules for swap execution facilities somewhat track those proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The proposals, while affording investors much greater insight into the markets, do not require full transparency.
Still, lawmakers and regulators hope that forcing swaps onto exchanges and execution facilities will shine a light on the swaps market, a leading factor in the financial crisis.
In the lead-up to the crisis, investors bought billions of dollars worth of swaps as insurance policies on risky mortgage-backed securities. When the underlying mortgages soured, investors sought to collect their insurance payments. But companies that sold the swaps to investors, like the American International Group, lacked the capital to honor the agreements.
Some $600 billion worth of swaps still trade privately - on the phone or online - as opposed to over a regulated exchange. This so-called over-the-counter trading method keeps investors and regulators in the dark.
''Currently, trading in security-based swaps occurs exclusively in the over-the-counter markets with little transparency or oversight,'' Ms. Schapiro said.
But under the S.E.C.'s proposal, investors who buy derivative contracts from banks would be armed with the trading prices. This information will empower investors to do some comparison shopping among banks.
''Making the information available is the most important part of creating the swap execution facilities,'' said Walter Dolde, a finance professor at the University of Connecticut-Stamford and a former executive at Lehman Brothers and Citibank. ''The Wall Street banks have evidently been making extremely large profits at the expense of their customers.''
The S.E.C.'s five commissioners unanimously agreed to propose the new rules for execution facilities. They are now open for comment during a 60-day period, after which the agency must vote on a final version of the rules.
Banks and securities firms have been lobbying regulators, encouraging them to remain flexible when drafting rules for the execution facilities. The S.E.C. appears to have heeded the message. The agency's proposal would invite a range of trading platforms to become swap execution facilities.
The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gary Gensler, had to tread lightly, too, after some commissioners complained his original plan was too rigid. At first, Mr. Gensler wanted complete price transparency, which would have limited the number of companies that could become execution facilities. The current plan expands the number of players that can jump into the business but reduces transparency.
Dodd-Frank requires both agencies to complete the derivatives rules by July.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With Tyler Cowen

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The author of "The Great Stagnation" talks about possible remedies to the long American growth slump.

 BODY:
Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, is best known as one half of the blogging team at Marginal Revolution. Mr. Cowen's brief new e-book, "The Great Stagnation," on the causes of the American economic malaise, has received a lot of attention in recent days. 
Nick Schulz of the American Enterprise Institute wrote, in Forbes, "It's possible the most important nonfiction book this year won't be published on paper." Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post also praised the book, in his column this week. "As you might imagine," Mr. Pearlstein added, "a spirited debate is under way on economics blogs about Cowen's view that the Internet may not really be the productivity bonanza that was once predicted."
My conversation with Mr. Cowen follows:
I'm interested in your view about what policies might speed up innovation and thus economic growth. For instance, do you think the National Institutes of Health should receive more money? Could and should the federal government play a bigger role in financing clean-energy research? Should financial aid for colleges and graduate programs be increased? Should government agencies hold colleges more accountable for results -- as is, ever so slowly, starting to happen with high schools? And obviously this is not an exhaustive list of possibilities. 
Mr. Cowen: The N.I.H. has done a very good job in promoting medical innovation and this is in large part because it allocates funds on a relatively meritocratic basis; Congress doesn't control particular grants and on many important fronts the N.I.H. has autonomy. It is one reason why the United States is the world leader in medical research and development and I would expand its funding, provided it retains this autonomy. Basic research is often what economists call a "public good" and it offers economic and health returns for many years to come."Clean energy" is a very important issue, for reasons of climate change, but it won't be a job creator in a useful sense. In terms of energy production, fossil fuels are quite powerful. With green energy, at this point, we are simply looking to break even, namely to receive some of our current power but without the negative environmental consequences which accrue from carbon. That's a worthy goal, but we shouldn't start thinking about green energy as speeding up economic growth or creating jobs. It's more like a necessary burden we will have to bear and the fact that these costs lie in front of us - from both the climate change and from the technological adjustments -- is a sobering thought.
The U.S. system of higher education is working very well and it remains a clear global leader. Most of all it is based on ideas of competition and meritocracy. I think it needs better treatment from the immigration authorities, most of all, for both undergraduate and graduate students. It should not be an ordeal for the world's smartest people to come study in the United States. In general, I do not think that our federal government is well suited to lead educational innovation, with or without funding as a carrot or stick. 
Mr. Cowen: The United States is no longer a world leader in graduation rates and in this regard our system of higher education has some major problems. But I don't think we can fix those problems by tackling higher education per se. The real problems start much earlier, namely at the K-12 level and possibly also in the earlier family environment. Too many students simply aren't prepared to finish a decent community college. Most of all, we need to make it easier to fire bad teachers in this country, but we should start at the lowest grades possible. Only then will the lower tiers of our higher education system have a chance to improve.
In general, I would also like to see more of our elite institutions of higher education take the explicitly meritocratic and indeed arguably anti-egalitarian approaches of Caltech and also University of Chicago. Those two institutions are big successes -- M.I.T. too -- yet they are not always so easy to copy. We should be trying harder. In terms of respect for intelligence, achievement, and science, we should be more like Singapore.
Mr. Cowen: Most of all, I have in mind a cultural change. Ask yourself a simple question: how many famous scientists are there? Not so many. Or try this one: how many men or women dream of marrying or dating a scientist? Not so many. These changes have to happen at the individual and family level. I'm not against science prizes or higher pay, but those ideas alone are not going to do the trick, as they are top down solutions.
It sounds like a hard change, but I'm convinced we can do it, if we set our minds to it. There are plenty of countries where doctors have pretty high status, even though they are not paid as much as in the United States.
Most of all, I would think in terms of providing role models for young people and promoting the idea of science in the family, when the children are at very young ages.
I'd like to see us move closer to being a culture obsessed with science and the scientific enterprise.
What has the experience told you about the future of book publishing and, more generally, about the future of charging readers for an online version of the written word?
Mr. Cowen: That is correct, it is only an e-book and it's about 15,000 words long. That's about how long many of the early economics pamphlets were in the seventeenth century and I think it matches up to a natural human attention span. Most books I read should be shorter than they are.
So far the book is doing well, so I think there is a market at this length and at this price. Of course for many readers the e-book experience is somewhat or even totally new, but it is the wave of the future. Books will get shorter and cheaper, and think of "The Great Stagnation" as one step along that path.
Is this reality contradicting the book's message itself? I don't think so. I see the modern world as having lots of good innovations, it's just that most of the innovations are not trickling down the median American. So far, that's still the case with e-books and it's even debatable how much the median American is reading physical books.
We live in what I have called "The Age of the Infovore," and those are the people I am writing for. They are very open to new models of what the reading experience is about.

HEADLINE: The Philadelphia Story

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Bright Side of Blight,'' by Diana Lind (Op-Ed, Jan. 25), characterizes Philadelphia's community development strategy as ''scattershot.'' I disagree. 
Philadelphia has approached community revitalization in a comprehensive fashion. In the Kensington neighborhood cited, Philadelphia has invested in affordable housing, economic development, open space management and other initiatives.
The results are impressive. The conversion of an abandoned factory into housing has sparked the rehabilitation of other vacant industrial buildings, leveraging millions in private investment. Greening strategies have increased property values by more than $12 million.
An important component of this strategy is the community development block grant. Such funds have not only supported holistic community revitalization, but they have also brought private investment into a neighborhood where the market alone cannot yet do so.
Block grants have revived other Philadelphia communities to the point where private investment is now the norm. Rather than cutting or eliminating the community development block grant, Congress should build upon its successes in Philadelphia and elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Impending Trial Puts a Melting-Pot Neighborhood to the Test

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Devon Avenue is one of Chicago's richest melting pots, where Indian stores sell colorful saris next to Pakistani halal butcher shops and Islamic bookstores. Farther west are Orthodox synagogues, Jewish bakeries and Russian gift shops. So residents were shocked when two local men were arrested in 2009 on accusations that they had helped plot the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, and a never-realized assault on a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
Federal prosecutors allege that Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 49, a Pakistani immigrant who owns an immigration-law office and a butcher shop on Devon Avenue, knew about the Mumbai attacks in advance and helped David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American, scout locations. In March, Mr. Headley, 50, pleaded guilty to charges that could carry a life sentence. Mr. Rana's trial, which was scheduled to begin Feb. 14, was recently delayed until May 16. 
The government says that Mr. Rana falsified immigration documents for Mr. Headley and helped him use Mr. Rana's First World Immigration Services as cover for his activities in India and Denmark. Mr. Headley opened a branch of the law office in Mumbai and pretended that he wanted to place an ad for legal services in the Danish paper, according to his plea agreement. The government also says that Mr. Rana passed messages between Mr. Headley and one of his Pakistan-based operatives, and that Mr. Headley gave Mr. Rana a Qaeda video taking responsibility for an attack on the Danish Embassy in Pakistan.
Both men are being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago.
More than 160 people were killed in the Mumbai attacks, in which Indian and Jewish institutions, including the Taj Mahal Hotel and the Chabad House, were attacked. But in Chicago, residents said the arrests had not caused any noticeable tensions along Devon Avenue. People in the neighborhood say they monitor conflict in their homelands from afar, but consider themselves Americans primarily concerned with making a living.
Many residents and merchants on Devon Avenue greeted the news that Mr. Rana's trial had been postponed with the kind of skepticism and annoyance that has characterized local response to the arrests. Many doubt the strength of the government's case against Mr. Rana, whose lawyer has portrayed him as misled or duped by Mr. Headley. Others were shocked by the charges, which they say are contrary to the diverse and harmonious character of the neighborhood. They say they just want to put this chapter to rest.
Merchants and residents say the arrests have not soured relations or business on the street, where Mr. Rana's law firm and grocery store still do healthy business, but they fear extra scrutiny directed at the community during the trial.
Ahmed Khan, 26, an aldermanic candidate in the 50th Ward who runs the Par-Birdie grocery near Mr. Rana's law office, does not see Mr. Rana as typical of the close-knit merchants in the community, Mr. Khan came from India as a baby and is married to a Pakistani woman.
''This gentleman is not representative of the community,'' he said. ''I'm very offended that this individual came and tried to be part of this community and leverage it for what he wanted to do. It's a community that's incredibly diverse, where we all share the same concerns, and the concerns for local residents are local concerns like streets and schools.''
A supporter of Mr. Rana, who asked that her name not be published for fear of harassment, said that many locals did not think Mr. Rana was guilty of wrongdoing but would not speak publicly for fear of being singled out by the F.B.I.
Fawad Ahmed, 27, an Afghan immigrant and employee at a halal shop, said, ''People talk like he's a good person.'' But, Mr. Ahmed added, ''no one knows the real story. Everyone's confused.''
The Devon Avenue neighborhood became heavily Jewish after World War II, largely because of the presence of an Eastern European refugee resettlement group. In the 1960s and '70s, after federal policy changes made it easier for Asians to immigrate to the United States, Indians and Pakistanis began moving into the neighborhood at the same time many Eastern Europeans were moving to the suburbs.
Although political tensions within the Indian and Pakistani communities have sometimes surfaced, residents and community leaders say that for years immigrants have largely left the politics and divisions of their homelands behind. After the Sept. 11 attacks, residents said they feared and experienced some discrimination and suspicion, and many merchants and residents prominently displayed American flags.
Mr. Rana's law office at 2809 West Devon Avenue and his butcher shop on the 2100 block of West Devon are still in business. The law office has Canadian and American flags in the window -- Mr. Rana is a Canadian citizen and lived temporarily in Canada after immigrating to the United States with his wife in 1994.
The butcher shop, Chicago Grocers, sells phone cards, ''snacks and sweets,'' halal meat and other products to a diverse clientele including Indians and Pakistanis. The window holds a large campaign sign for Alderman Bernard Stone (50th Ward).
Amir Ali, 51, owner of a shop on Devon, said he was concerned that publicity around the trial might make people suspicious of all Pakistanis or Muslims.
''As a Muslim, as a Pakistani guy, he's not my relative, but maybe some people will think we're all involved in this,'' Mr. Ali said. ''Islam is a peaceful religion. We give money to the poor.''
Mr. Rana's lawyer, Patrick Blegen, told a judge that witnesses who testified during his client's bond hearing showed he ''is a well-respected businessman and has lived a life of almost 50 years now where he has not promoted violence.'' Supporters have said Mr. Rana gave free legal help to neighbors and raised money for a medical clinic for the uninsured.
Vijay Gupta, who owns an Indian video store on Devon, said that he had visited lawyers at Mr. Rana's law firm several times and that he frequently heard complaints from acquaintances that lawyers there filled out paperwork but did not actively advocate for their clients.
The lawyer currently working at the law firm did not return calls.
Residents and employees in Jewish businesses said they were affected by the targeting of Jews in the Mumbai attacks, but many were unaware of the charges that the attacks had been plotted just blocks away.
''No one is even talking about it; no one knew these individuals,'' said Alderman Stone, who is Jewish. ''Jewish people have been through things like this for centuries.''
Huma Mahtani, an Indian immigrant, and her husband have run a sari shop on Devon Avenue for 25 years. She said she tried to dissuade her daughter from traveling to Mumbai after the attacks and was shocked to learn later that two of the men accused in the plot worked in her neighborhood. But Ms. Mahtani said residents had not dwelled on the arrests.
''People here are just worried about making their mortgages, especially since the recession,'' said her husband, Ramesh Mahtani. ''Everyone's quite busy doing their work. It's not like back home.''

HEADLINE: Pride of Place In Every Drop

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
For Joe Santos, producing and distributing his own gin was a way to say goodbye to the lock-step march of the corporate world and hello to creativity and originality. He wanted to give the gin a name that communicated that. So he invoked a certain New York City borough, the one currently outpacing the others in self-satisfaction.
Brad Estabrooke got into the gin business around the same time, and in a similar, um, spirit. Like Mr. Santos he wanted whatever he called his gin to capture the small-scale, personal nature of his nascent operation. And he too decided to pay homage to the section of the city that is, as he said in a recent interview, ''not only bringing back facial hair but also making all these interesting products.''
Manhattan may have a namesake cocktail, but Brooklyn is playing muse to two rival gins. And the existence of both Mr. Santos's Brooklyn gin and Mr. Estabrooke's Breuckelen gin provides an unusually clear -- you could even say distilled -- example of just how much the symbolism of that borough has changed and just how potent its branding potential is perceived to be. 
Tellingly, neither man has deep roots in Brooklyn, or called it home until the last few years. Brooklyn these days is an identity divorced from ancestry or actual time served.
A legal battle has of course taken shape, with Mr. Santos suing Mr. Estabrooke for trademark infringement. Mr. Santos, whose Brooklyn gin was registered first with the federal Patent and Trademark Office, told me that any confusion created by such phonetically similar names could do him commercial harm. As he sees it, drinkers who ask for his gin could end up being given Mr. Estabrooke's by mistake.
Mr. Estabrooke said that the different spellings and bottle designs adequately distinguish the products. He added that both gins went on the market last year, so neither was trying to take advantage of headway created by the other.
The reason he used the old Dutch spelling, he said, was not because he had knowledge of Mr. Santos's conventionally spelled gin, but because he wanted to bow to the borough without doing something ''so obvious it would be hitting people over the head.''
Neither man is exactly thrilled with the other.
Mr. Estabrooke pointed out that while his gin was distilled and packaged entirely in Brooklyn, Mr. Santos's was made in suburban New York. Mr. Santos said that that was a temporary economic necessity, not necessarily a permanent arrangement, and that he runs his business out of his Brooklyn apartment, parks his delivery truck in Brooklyn and shops in Brooklyn, at the Fairway in Red Hook, for the citrus that flavors his gin.
Additionally, he said, ''I found a glass blower in Red Hook, and I'm working on getting bottles from them.'' In other words, he wants, and is trying, to be as Brooklyn as possible.
As Brooklyn as possible: a decade ago that might have been the goal of a pizza baker or hot-dog maker. Now it's the rallying cry of a broader, trendier array of food and beverage entrepreneurs (as well as garage bands, budding designers and more). New Yorkers' obsession with all things culinary, refracted through Brooklyn's exaltation of all things artisanal, has led to beers, jams, mustards, spiced nuts, cheeses and more made in Brooklyn and marketed with an emphasis on that provenance.
Reflective of all the Brooklyn boasting, there is even a new bar and restaurant in the West Village, the Brooklyneer, that showcases products from the borough for which it is named. And so Manhattan dwellers can experience the magic of Greenpoint and tingle of Clinton Hill without the schlep.
In Brooklyn itself self-fascination has prompted creative adventures in self-referential spelling, not just by Mr. Estabrooke. There is a Breukelen Coffee House, in Prospect Heights, which dispenses with the C, and also the restaurant Breuckelen, in Cobble Hill, which keeps it, as Mr. Estabrooke does. It can't be long before a Brooquelinn cheese shop and Brewckelen specialty teas make their debuts.
I learned about Breuckelen gin -- which technically doesn't use those two words back to back, but is instead labeled gin by the Breuckelen Distilling Company -- when a Brooklyn booster with whom I exchange Christmas gifts gave it to me. He loves Brooklyn, I love gin. It all made perfect sense.
I learned about Brooklyn gin when a bartender at Compose, an ambitious new cocktails and small-plates place in TriBeCa, used it in a drink he made me.
And I learned about the spat between the two distillers from The Brooklyn Paper and several New York nightlife blogs, which mentioned it.
For now both gins are sold almost entirely in restaurants, bars and liquor stores in New York City, and I went recently to the Brooklyneer to see if it stocked either or both. The Brooklyneer had only Brooklyn gin, Mr. Santos's.
I asked my server if it was made in Brooklyn, knowing that it wasn't. He said -- and, as best I could tell, seemed to believe -- that it was. Labeling and packaging can be persuasive.
The Thistle Hill Tavern, a nine-month-old restaurant in Park Slope, has both gins. One of its owners, David Massoni, told me he sells more Breuckelen, probably because it's used in one of the restaurant's special cocktails. But he said he was as proud to support a gin made in New York State, as Mr. Santos's is, as one made smack in Brooklyn.
In terms of flavor, both gins have merit. Breuckelen has a slightly rougher, more intriguing bite -- on purpose -- and confines itself, Mr. Estabrooke said, to five botanicals, or accents: juniper berry, rosemary, lemon, ginger and grapefruit.
Brooklyn gin has 11 botanicals, and because 5 of those are fresh citrus peels, it has a discernibly citrusy taste, along with a clean finish.
Both gin makers turned to spirits as an exit from more conventional careers. Mr. Santos, 37, who grew up in New Jersey, quit a marketing job with Bacardi a year ago and moved from Miami to New York, eventually settling in Park Slope.
He was drawn to Brooklyn by what he called the ''do-it-yourself movement'' there. Because he can't yet afford to set up his own distillery, he pays to use one in Warwick, N.Y.
Mr. Estabrooke, 32, is a former bond trader. He grew up in Maine, went to college in Massachusetts, worked for a while in Boston and then came to New York about three and a half years ago. He lives in Greenpoint and, with investment money rounded up from relatives and friends, built a small distillery between Gowanus and Sunset Park.
''Part of the reason we'' -- Mr. Estabrooke and his girlfriend, Liz O'Connell -- ''came up with this idea is because around Brooklyn we see other people making things from scratch,'' he said.
Although Mr. Santos has suggested that Mr. Estabrooke perhaps rename his gin, his competitor is not inclined to. The lawsuit won't be resolved for many months and has various wrinkles, including the assertion by Mr. Estabrooke's lawyer, Joseph Sherinsky, that the word Brooklyn cannot legally be trademarked.
But while it may not belong to anyone, seemingly everyone wants to raise a glass to it.

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing and the Gulf

 BODY:
The gulf states are still living with the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which swept away more than 70,000 units of affordable rental housing. 
Fewer than a third of those units, which are crucial to housing the poor, the elderly and the disabled, have been rebuilt. The 5,000 or so that are still on the drawing board might never be constructed unless Congress extends a program that encourages businesses to invest in housing by providing them offsets for tax liabilities.
Congress tried to remedy the problem late last year by passing a one-year extension of the program. But investors insist that they need another 18 months to get the deals done, the units built and the tenants in place. If the projects come in late, the tax credits become invalid.
Congress allotted more than $300 million in credits to the gulf states after Katrina and Rita, requiring that the projects be ready for tenants by the end of 2010. The credits sold well while the economy was thriving. But demand fell off during the recession when corporate investors had small tax liabilities.
The appetite for tax credits has picked up, but investors are still shying away from the gulf out of fear that any credits they purchase might expire before they can be used. Unable to raise capital, some developers have walked away from projects that seemed certain to get built before the onset of the recession.
A Senate bill introduced by Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, with the support of several Republicans, would extend the program for an additional year. The bill, which still needs a sponsor in the House, deserves to pass as swiftly as possible. Without it, the gulf states are unlikely to get the housing they need.

Brian Cox, Jim Gaffigan, Chris Noth, Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland star. Bernard Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Zinoman)20110203

Broadway
'The Addams Family' Imagine, if you dare, the agonies of the talented people trapped inside this collapsing tomb of a musical. They include Nathan Lane, Bebe Neuwirth and Kevin Chamberlin, all shamefully squandered (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)20110203
- 'American Idiot' A wonderfully raucous and gorgeously wrought rock opera adapted from the blockbuster album by Green Day. With minimal book, the director Michael Mayer and a terrific young cast explore the crisis of post-adolescence (1:30). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)20110203
- 'La Cage aux Folles' Terry Johnson's inspired, Tony-winning revival of this 1983 musical, about family values as seen through the prism of a transvestite revue, delivers the unexpected lesson that in theater, shabby can be not just chic but also redemptive. Kelsey Grammer and Douglas Hodge (in a bravura Broadway debut) star winningly as the happily mismatched couple (2:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20110203
'Driving Miss Daisy' Those theatrical giants James Earl Jones and Vanessa Redgrave memorably portray the title character and her driver in David Esbjornson's revival of Alfred Uhry's 1986 work. If they feel squeezed or confined by what is a very slender play, they never let on. With Boyd Gaines (1:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, DaisyonBroadway.com. (Brantley)20110203
- 'The Importance of Being Earnest' Brian Bedford, as the magnificent gorgon Lady Bracknell, is giving one of the great performances of the season in this effervescent revival, which he directed, of Oscar Wilde's 1895 comedy of manners (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)20110203
'Lombardi' Dan Lauria stars as Vince Lombardi in Eric Simonson's drama-deficient play about the venerated Green Bay Packers coach (1:35). Circle in the Square, 235 West 50th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20110203
'Long Story Short' The wry stand-up comic Colin Quinn brings an everyguy's perspective to this brisk tour of the follies of mankind dating back a couple of millenniums. Directed by Jerry Seinfeld, the show more or less lives up to its whimsical subtitle, ''History of the World in 75 Minutes'' (1:15). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20110203
- 'The Merchant of Venice' Daniel Sullivan's absolutely splendid production of Shakespeare's fascinating, irksome play combines subtlety with clarity, virtues that don't always walk hand in hand. And as Shylock, the usurer, and Portia, the heiress, Al Pacino and Lily Rabe are giving what promise to be the performances of the season (3:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20110203
'Million Dollar Quartet' A small-scale jukebox musical about a big day in rock 'n' roll history, when Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley all got together for an impromptu jam in the recording studio of Sun Records. The book resembles a standard-issue rock doc, but the music-making is fiery and the songs fun (1:30). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20110203
Off Broadway
'Angels in America'Michael Greif's warm embrace of a revival of Tony Kushner's two-part theatrical epic is more accessible and less startling than the original. The production is like picking up a paperback version of a best seller you once devoured breathlessly: It's a good read, but you don't feel the same urgency (''Millennium Approaches,'' 3:00; ''Perestroika,'' 3:40). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 244-7529, SignatureTheatre.org. (Brantley)20110203
'Black Angels Over Tuskegee' This effective tear-jerker tells the story of these trailblazing African-American pilots (2:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Zinoman)20110203
'Blood From a Stone' Keenly observed and flawlessly acted by a cast led by Ethan Hawke, Tommy Nohilly's drama examines in microscopic detail the snowballing conflicts within a blue-collar family. Despite an impeccable New Group production directed by Scott Elliott, the play grinds through its glum, familiar paces without generating much dramatic heat or emotional resonance (2:30). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20110203
- 'The Divine Sister' This gleefully twisted tale of the secret lives of nuns is Charles Busch's freshest, funniest work in years. Written by and starring Mr. Busch, ''Divine,'' which features a priceless Julie Halston and Alison Fraser, is paradise for those who imagine heaven as an endless swirl of beautifully bad old movies (1:33). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village , (212) 352-3101, divinesisteronstage.com. (Brantley)20110203
The Flying Karamazov Brothers This troupe uses its cheerful new show to crack wise, sing and dance, and juggle most anything at hand (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village , (800) 745-3000, fkb.com. (Ken Jaworowski)20110203
'Freckleface Strawberry' Based on the actress Julianne Moore's picture book ''Freckleface Strawberry,'' about a 7-year-old redhead who earns that nickname from her teasing friends, this family show transcends the usual themes about celebrating the differences that make us special. It does so with a winning score, talented actors and inventive comedy, as well as an acknowledgment of the unfunny aspects of its young heroine's situation (1:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Laurel Graeber)20110203
'Freud's Last Session' This 75-minute play imagines a meeting between Sigmund Freud and C. S. Lewis. The two men debate the nature of God in a story that's sharp though static (1:15). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 10 West 64th Street , (212) 352-3101, freudslastsession.com. (Jaworowski)20110203
'Gruesome Playground Injuries' This blood-spattered twig of a play from the up-and-coming dramatist Rajiv Joseph follows the decades-spanning friendship of two made-for-each-other masochists (Pablo Schreiber and Jennifer Carpenter). Directed by Scott Ellis, the show is rarely more than skin-deep, however lacerated its skin (1:20). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Brantley)20110203
'How I Fell in Love' In this pleasant but thin comic romance, two losers in love find each other, of course. But from there, the playwright, Joel Fields, who mainly works as a television writer, knows enough to send the story to a different ending than the obvious one. In the process he explores the notion that the most important relationship in a person's life may not be the longest-lasting one (1:25). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Clinton , (212) 868-2055, abingdontheatre.org. (Neil Genzlinger)20110203
'Midnight in Havana' No wartime cliche is neglected in Robert Dominguez's tacky comedy, set in a shabby nightclub in the waning hours of Fulgencio Batista's reign. Amateurish performances and clunky direction manage to turn one of the Western Hemisphere's most volatile periods into a complete bore. Friday only (1:15). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street , (212) 307-7171, ticketmaster.com. (Eric Grode)20110203
'The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore'Olympia Dukakis gives a fearless, vanity-free performance as the dying gorgon Flora Goforth in Tennessee Williams's patchy 1963 play about the anguish and fear that can attend our going forth into the unknown (2:15). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)20110203
'The Misanthrope' The Pearl Theater delivers a solid primer on Moliere's classic comedy (2:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street , (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Zinoman)20110203
'Mistakes Were Made' The formidably talented Michael Shannon plays a crass, grasping theater producer in Craig Wright's intermittently funny but ultimately wearying showbiz satire (1:30). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village , (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Isherwood)20110203
- 'Molly Sweeney' This three-actor monologue play by Brian Friel, about a blind woman who undergoes an operation to give her sight, is revived in a wonderful and heartbreaking production, one that stays in the mind long after the applause ends (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Jaworowski)20110203
'The New York Idea' The playwright David Auburn has performed major cosmetic surgery on Langdon Mitchell's 1906 satire of divorce and matrimony, making it slimmer and lighter on its feet. He has also stripped it of most of its original, provocatively barbed personality. Mark Brokaw directs the amiable cast (1:45). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village , (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Brantley)20110203
'Once Five Years Pass' It's not often this marvelously strange Federico Garcia Lorca play is staged. How good to hear this Spanish poet's rhythms, as brought to muscular life by the Repertorio Espanol under the direction of Rene Buch. But English-speaking audience members beware: the live audio translation (via headphones) leaves much to be desired. Saturday only (1:25). Repertorio Espanol at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org/cinco. (Claudia La Rocco)20110203
- 'Other Desert Cities' The only problem with Jon Robin Baitz's seriously satisfying play is that you need to see it five times. That's because you never want to take your eyes off a single member of the five-person cast (Stockard Channing, Stacy Keach, Linda Lavin, Elizabeth Marvel and Thomas Sadowski) in this gorgeously acted drama, directed by Joe Mantello (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center , (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Brantley)20110203
- 'Play Dead' The magician Teller directed and helped create this gleefully gruesome frightfest for grown-ups, in which Todd Robbins, noted light-bulb eater and expert in sideshow freakishness, discusses death, afterlife and some particularly creepy historical figures while working some very effective tricks. Screaming is expected, and audience members are subject to being hauled onstage and ghoulishly murdered (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Genzlinger)20110203
- 'Through the Night' Daniel Beaty's poetic solo show about black men struggling with and taking charge of their lives is a thing of beauty. His wit, grit and piercing lyricism speak to African-American men, but his deepest meanings transcend race and gender. Monday only (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)20110203
'What the Public Wants' The Mint's lifeless production of Arnold Bennett's comedy about a media baron who believes selling news is like selling soap (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 315-0231, minttheater.org. (Zinoman)20110203
'The Whipping Man' Matthew Lopez's atmospheric play depicts the evolving relationships between two former slaves (Andre Braugher and Andre Holland) and an ex-Confederate soldier (Jay Wilkison) in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War. The novelty: all three are Jewish (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street , (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)20110203

'Korach' Sixty-three years after co-founding the Living Theater, Judith Malina is the writer and director of this pageantlike examination of the anarchist faction that took on Moses and lost. With more than two dozen performers at her disposal, Ms. Malina shows a rigorous eye for stage pictures -- and an occasional tin ear when it comes to dramatic nuance (1:20). The Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side , (212) 352-0255, livingtheatre.org. (Grode)20110203
'Miss Abigail's Guide to Dating, Mating, & Marriage' Eve Plumb's time as Jan on ''The Brady Bunch'' didn't give her the improvisational ease necessary for this show, in which she plays an advice-giver who draws her suggestions about love and romance from ancient etiquette guides and health manuals. Ms. Plumb never looks comfortable, and despite bits of audience participation, the show never feels spontaneous (1:30).

Last Chance
'Flipzoids'; closes on Sunday. Fifteen years after the premiere of Ralph B. Pena's empathic but uneven play, Ma-Yi Theater Company revisits it -- and wisely remembered to bring the stunning actress Ching Valdes-Aran along. Even when the generational culture clashes follow a predictable path, her performance as a woman lost between two countries consistently startles and delights (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street , (212) 279-4200, ma-yitheatre.org. (Grode)20110203
'Honey Brown Eyes'; closes on Sunday. Stefanie Zadravec's flawed but harrowing drama, set in a pair of kitchens in the early months of the Bosnian war, approaches the horrors of battle with an empathic eye. Ms. Zadravec uses the lives of three very different women to breathe humanistic life into even the play's least convincing moments (2:00). Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)20110203
'John Gabriel Borkman'; closes on Sunday. This snow-strewn, thaw-proof production of Ibsen's late, labored drama of frozen lives, directed by James Macdonald, isn't very convincing emotionally. But it does feature a theater lover's triple delight of stars: Lindsay Duncan, Alan Rickman and the infinitely cunning Fiona Shaw (2:45). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene , (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)20110203
'Room 17B'; closes on Sunday. This odd, charming show from Parallel Exit takes place in an office full of filing cabinets and incongruity. There is no plot, particularly; just four skilled actors using pantomime, audience participation and almost no dialogue to conjure Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but with a somewhat demented twist. Best moment: an audience member squares off against a cast member in a ridiculous competition involving a rope and a paper bag. Sorry; any more details would spoil it (1:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street , (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Genzlinger)20110203

To the Editor:
Re ''Second Judge Deals Blow to Health Care Law'' (front page, Feb. 1):
In his ruling, Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court said, ''It would be a radical departure from existing case law to hold that Congress can regulate inactivity under the Commerce Clause.''
The ruling does not take into account the enormous impact uninsured individuals have on the market. When doctors and hospitals price services, they take into account uninsured patients who are unable to pay their medical bills. In the aggregate, the effect this has on commerce is substantial enough to provide Congress the power to enact this legislation. 
When the Supreme Court eventually hears this case, it must recognize that Congress has acted within its constitutional powers and uphold health reform.
Laura Unger Pittsburgh, Feb. 1, 2011
The writer is a student in the health law program at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.
To the Editor:
''Judicial Activism on Health Reform'' (editorial, Feb. 2) calls Judge Roger Vinson's ruling that the law is unconstitutional an example of overreach.
True overreach would be to find that within the power to regulate commerce among states is the power to force people to spend their money for a product favored by the federal government. What next, a law forcing people to buy G.M. cars in order to support the economy and protect the employment of federally subsidized workers? If the government can do the former it can surely do the latter.
If the commerce clause is interpreted that broadly, then there are no limits. If the government wants to nationalize the health system and be honest about the costs, present and future, then it should tax and borrow to support it. But please do not applaud the sophistry that forcing people to spend their private resources for a particular product, however attractive, can have anything whatever to do with regulating commerce among the states.
Ron Holdaway Draper, Utah, Feb. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
In citing the original Boston Tea Party in a discussion of opposition to unlimited governmental powers, Judge Roger Vinson, like the current Tea Party, is off the mark.
The original Boston Tea Party's complaint was ''no taxation without representation.'' The health care reform law was enacted by a majority in Congress and signed into law by the president, all of whom were elected by the people.
Health care reform was unquestionably a law founded upon representation. The current Tea Party's use of the term is unwarranted.
Benjamin M. Haber Flushing, Queens, Feb. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Awaiting Health Law's Prognosis'' (Business Day, Feb. 2):
I applaud this article for putting a human face on the health care controversy. As the mother of a young cancer patient, I often wish that legislators opposing health care reform would spend a day on a pediatric oncology floor. For cancer patients -- especially young ones -- lifetime limits and denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions are, truly, death sentences.
It's time to put aside the partisan bickering and listen to the voices of the families of those most in need of health care reform. We have been sleeping better since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Debra Silverman New York, Feb. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
Ultimately, for a country that has become the wealthiest in the history of the world, the health care issue is a matter of right and wrong. Is it right for corporations to make a profit from denying lifesaving surgery, for just one example?
The for-profit health care delivery system is no longer sustainable. Seemingly insurmountable issues -- like whether mandating coverage violates the Constitution -- are but remnants of the 20th-century solutions to the problem, deck chairs on a health care ship sailing to oblivion.
The only remaining question -- who will pay for it? -- has, in effect, been answered. One way or another, we all pay for it, whether through a national delivery system or one by one as ambulances leave uninsured patients at hospital doors.
The only answer that makes sense now is to cut out the middleman.
Tom Hunter Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Feb. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
It is hard to find a reason to believe that Judge Roger Vinson's ruling is not intended to delay indefinitely the implementation of the health care law. The last thing the right wants is for health care reform to be tested on the open market, where the reality will likely prove popular once people's fears have been assuaged.

HEADLINE: A Path to Homeownership Is Becoming a Burden

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James is a columnist for The Bay Citizen.
Tenancies-in-common, a type of shared homeownership that is widespread in San Francisco, were once considered an affordable option for first-time home buyers in an expensive city.
Now some homeowners, unable to sell, are calling them traps. 
Since the recession, sales and property values of T.I.C.'s have dropped more than the market as a whole. At the same time, mortgages for these properties have become scarce, which has diminished the pool of potential buyers. Some units have been on the market, unsold, for more than a year.
And it could get worse, according to about a dozen experts familiar with the situation. City ordinances are clashing with real estate realities, and many T.I.C. owners might lose their homes unless city leaders intervene.
That, however, would take a majority of the Board of Supervisors, which appears unlikely.
Instead, on Wednesday the city once again toyed with the fates of these besieged homeowners with its annual condo conversion lottery. The process transforms selected T.I.C.'s into condominiums, which are more easily financed and sold.
Clutching their application forms like Willie Wonka chocolate bars in the hope of finding a rare golden ticket, 2,309 property owners applied for the lottery; only 200 were picked.
Rachel Pechter had her hopes up for the seventh straight year. Ms. Pechter, a stay-at-home mom and a San Francisco native who grew up in a rental, and her husband, an electrician, used their savings to buy a small two-bedroom T.I.C. in the Castro in 2004.
''We were just excited at the time to buy a house,'' she said.
Now they have two children and need more space, but there are no buyers. ''We're stuck,'' Ms. Pechter said.
Unlike condominium units deeded to their owners, T.I.C. apartments share one deed for an entire building, creating co-ownership of the whole property.
Having one's financial fate so tied to others -- sometimes strangers -- makes these properties less desirable and less expensive to buy, hence their relative affordability.
The number of T.I.C.'s has grown since limits were put on condominium conversions nearly 30 years ago as a way to protect tenants' rights, a popular cause in a city where two-thirds of the residents are renters. The idea was to thwart speculators from converting buildings to condos to raise rents, since condos are not covered by rent control.
Instead, some homebuyers transformed buildings into T.I.C.'s, which are subject to more tenant protections, if rented. The assessor-recorder's office estimates that at least 5,000 buildings are now T.I.C.'s, home to tens of thousands of residents.
To secure financing, many T.I.C. buyers obtained ''fractional mortgages,'' a nontraditional loan that allowed them to finance their part of the building. Few banks ever wrote those exotic loans, and many that did have stopped since the recession. Those that write the loans charge higher rates, can require 25 percent or more down, and do not offer 30-year fixed terms -- only adjustable-rate five- or seven-year loans.
Julian Hebron, San Francisco branch manager for RPM Mortgage and editor of thebasispoint.com, a Web site that reports on loan rates, said fractional loans were ''just too much risk for most lenders.''
''It's non-standard,'' Mr. Hebron said.
Those unusual loan terms have consequences. Many of those short-term mortgages are expiring now or in the next year or two. At the same time, T.I.C. prices have dropped at least 20 percent since 2008 (down 38 percent in some cases), according to an analysis by Paragon Real Estate Group.
''When those loans reset, people could be in a world of hurt,'' said Britton Jackson, a veteran agent with Zephyr Real Estate. Without equity to refinance, Ms. Jackson said, many could lose their homes.
To prevent this from happening, Scott Wiener, a city supervisor for District 8, which contains more T.I.C.'s than any other, wants a one-time expansion of condo conversions. Only owner-occupied units in good standing would qualify -- no real estate speculators -- and a hefty fee would be charged that would go toward financing lower-cost housing.
But the Board of Supervisors rejected a similar proposal last year, and the new board does not appear to have the votes to pass such a plan.
The San Francisco Tenants Union is ''absolutely opposed'' to any increase in condo conversions, said Ted Gullicksen, the group's executive director.
Mr. Gullicksen called most T.I.C. owners ''elite,'' noting that properties sold for an average of $700,000 before the recession. Any tinkering with the current system could undermine rent control, he warned.
Ms. Pachter is not rich, but she is lucky. This week she beat the odds and won the condo conversion lottery. ''There's a light at the end of the tunnel,'' she said.

HEADLINE: From 1983, Hope for Jobs In 2011

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The unemployment rate declined four-tenths of a percentage point in one month. There had not been a monthly decline that large in many years, but economists were unimpressed. After all, the decline was caused in no small part by a surprising reduction in the labor force, which could be an indication that more workers were discouraged and no longer looking. That would hardly be an encouraging development.
Anyway, it was said, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of only 60,000 households, some of whom cannot be reached in any given month. It can be volatile, so you should not pay much attention to it. The president took heart from the figures, but critics said there was no real improvement.
The above describes what happened a month ago, when the unemployment rate for December came in at 9.4 percent. It was the first time in more than 11 years that the rate had declined that much in a single month, but the headline in The Chicago Tribune read, ''U.S. jobs picture gets darker; Unemployment rate dips, but only because workers apparently are giving up.'' 
As it happened, those paragraphs also describe the situation 28 years ago. In January 1983, with President Ronald Reagan reeling from his large setback in the midterm elections the previous November, the unemployment rate fell to 10.4 percent from 10.8 percent. It was the first such decline in five years, but few thought it significant.
''The A.F.L.-C.I.O.,'' The Washington Post reported, ''said yesterday that there was no real improvement in unemployment last month because the decline was caused primarily by people dropping out of the labor force, rather than finding jobs.''
The Reagan administration then thought the unemployment rate was likely to stay above 10 percent throughout that year. Now the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the rate will stay above 9 percent this year.
In fact, the rate at the end of 1983 turned out to be 8.3 percent. Before last month's report, there had been only seven monthly reports during the previous 45 years that showed a decline of at least 0.4 percentage points. Three of them were in 1983.
There are other similarities. Then, as now, the stock market was surprisingly strong, but many people discounted that because of the obvious woes of the economy. I don't have a scientific measure, but I know that my e-mail inbox is getting a lot of messages offering conspiratorial explanations for the strong stock market. One reader asked if I had any evidence that Chinese manipulation was causing American share prices to rise. He did not respond when I asked why the Chinese would want to do that.
There are also many differences between then and now. The report on how many jobs were added during the month -- which got much less attention in those days -- was strong in January 1983, and disappointing last month, when it showed an increase of 103,000. But job figures are often revised substantially in subsequent reports, particularly at inflection points in economic growth.
The Labor Department has already disclosed that on Friday it will revise downward the number of jobs reported in the 12 months through March of last year. In other words, the depth of the recession was even worse than we thought. In the past, there have been substantial increases when the economy was strengthening, so the current figures may prove low.
On Friday, the January figures will be released. A quick upward move in the unemployment rate could indicate that the glum outlook may be justified.
But there are signs that the economy is doing better than some statistics would indicate. The first report on gross domestic product for the fourth quarter showed a surge in consumption spending, rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent. Disposable personal income, adjusted for inflation, rose at a rate of only 1.7 percent. It was the fastest growth in consumption since early 2006, but the overall report was viewed as disappointing.
The consensus seems to be that consumers are back to their old bad habit of borrowing and spending, and that such an increase cannot be sustained. After all, their incomes are not rising, so how else could they be getting the money except by borrowing it?
The trouble with that analysis is that there is no evidence people are borrowing more, at least not in the consumer credit figures released by the government. They show that outstanding borrowings are coming down, not going up.
There is a good chance that the income numbers in the G.D.P. report will be revised up when better data is available. That happened back in 1983.
The first indication of whether that will happen will come four months from now. The earliest estimates of personal income are based solely on the Labor Department's job survey, according to Carol Moylan, the chief of the National Income and Wealth Division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the G.D.P. figures. Next month the third-quarter figures will be revised to reflect more reliable statistics from reports companies file when they pay unemployment insurance premiums. The fourth-quarter figures will be available at the end of May.
Those same reports will be the basis for the final figures on job growth -- the ones you see when you look at history. From 1979 through March 2009 -- the last month to have a benchmark revision -- the median change from the first number to the final one was up or down 71,000 jobs.
Back in 2008, those who were confident there was no recession pointed to the job figures. From April through July, the first reports for each month showed a loss that averaged less than 50,000 jobs. ''That is not what you see in a recession,'' it was said, correctly. The government now says the average loss of jobs during those months was nearly 200,000.
That record of inaccuracy does not seem to bother the Federal Reserve. On Thursday, its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made clear that other positive indicators could not overcome the one everyone watches. ''Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation,'' he said in a speech at the National Press Club, ''we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.''
The list of things that could go wrong is long now. Strife in Arab countries has pushed up oil prices. Europe is focused on whether more countries will need bailouts. Foreclosures continue in the United States, and the banks are still finding out just how much the mortgage debacle will end up costing them. Long-term unemployment will remain a problem even if the overall unemployment rate falls rapidly.
Still, companies report that business is improving, and consumers appear to be willing to spend. Nearly everyone with a job got a raise in January, courtesy of Uncle Sam, who reduced payroll taxes.
Since early 2007, Rasmussen, a polling company, has been asking 275 Americans every night about how they and the economy are doing. The polling is done for Discover, the credit card company, which tries to monitor spending plans. The latest report indicates that consumers are gaining confidence, albeit from a low level.
In January, Discover says, 40 percent of Americans thought the economy was getting worse, while only 33 percent thought it was getting better.
That may not seem encouraging, but the level of pessimism was the lowest the survey had recorded. In May 2007, the survey's first month, more than 60 percent thought the economy was getting worse. It turned out they were correct, although in those days most economic indicators were strong.
Less pessimism is not the same thing as more optimism. But perhaps it will be enough to make 2011 a better year than the experts now expect.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Takes Sides On Debt Limit Vote

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned Congressional Republicans on Thursday not to ''play around with'' a coming vote to raise the government's legal borrowing limit or use it as a bargaining chip for spending cuts.
In remarks after a luncheon speech here, Mr. Bernanke sided with the Obama administration in the fight over the debt ceiling, which the government is on course to hit in April or May, saying it should be raised without conditions. Some Republicans have insisted on immediate spending cuts in exchange for raising the limit.
It was the first time that Mr. Bernanke, who in contrast to his predecessors has avoided taking sides in partisan debates on fiscal matters, had spoken out on the debt ceiling issue. His willingness to do so suggested a desire by the central bank to prevent Washington lawmakers from toying with bond markets that have been volatile since the European debt crisis last year.
House Republicans have vowed to make deep spending cuts a precondition for voting to lift the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The White House has described raising the ceiling as nonnegotiable, saying that spending cuts and tax increases should be considered separately. The increasingly tense debate has left Republican leaders, like the new House speaker, John A. Boehner, in a politically delicate spot. 
Though he called on Congress and Mr. Obama to confront ''daunting fiscal challenges,'' Mr. Bernanke said the debt ceiling should not be used as a negotiating tactic, warning that even the possibility of the United States not being able to pay its creditors could create panic in the debt markets.
''I think this is very remote, but it's not something you want to play around with -- the United States would be forced into a position of defaulting on its debt,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''And the implications of that for our financial system, for our fiscal policy, for our economy would be catastrophic.''
He added: ''So I would very much urge Congress not to focus on the debt limit as being the bargaining chip in this discussion, but rather to address directly the spending and tax issues that we all have to deal with if we're going to make progress on this fiscal situation.''
Mr. Bernanke's remarks, which were made in response to questions at a luncheon at the National Press Club, underscored once again his delicate position as a moderate Republican economics professor who was appointed by President George W. Bush but won a second term last year with support from Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats.
Mr. Bernanke also expressed urgency about fiscal reform, in terms of deficit spending, saying, ''There is only so far that we can kick the can down the road.''
He said, ''We have to address this. And the sooner we do it, the less painful it will be and the better it will be for our economy.''
In his prepared speech, Mr. Bernanke said the United States could not rely on economic growth to solve its long-term fiscal problems, emphasizing that the country would have to cut spending, raise taxes or both.
But as before, Mr. Bernanke declined to specify how the deficit -- about 9 percent of the nation's gross domestic product each of the last two years -- should be reduced.
He did, however, say that plans offered recently by a presidentially appointed fiscal commission and by other prominent groups ''provide useful starting points for a much-needed national conversation.'' Those plans have called for revising entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security and increasing tax revenue, though they differ on many specifics.
Mr. Bernanke's increasingly urgent warnings about the deficit have been welcomed by Republicans, but on Thursday he also indicated support for Mr. Obama's position that the debate over fiscal policy should take into account the need to improve the nation's economic competitiveness.
Mr. Bernanke said that tax and spending changes should ''serve not only to reduce the deficit, but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy -- for example, by reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our work force as well as in new machinery and equipment, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure.''
Mr. Bernanke also reiterated his defense of the Fed's plan to lower long-term interest rates by buying $600 billion in Treasury securities. He called the bond-buying plan, which began in November and is to last through June, an appropriate response to high unemployment and low inflation.
Since August, when the Fed first signaled it was considering the strategy, Mr. Bernanke said, stock prices have ''risen significantly,'' inflation expectations have remained fairly steady, and interest rates on corporate bonds have fallen relative to yields on comparable Treasury securities, suggesting that investors are more confident about the outlook for businesses and less worried about the risk of defaults.
Critics say the effort -- popularly known as QE2 because it is the second round of the bond-buying strategy known as quantitative easing -- could touch off future inflation in the United States and abroad, devalue the dollar and increase the cost of food, energy and other commodities in the developing world.
Mr. Bernanke said the United States was not to blame for inflation in emerging economies, which have been growing at a much faster rate than the rich economies of Western Europe, North America and Japan.
The inflationary pressures, Mr. Bernanke said, arise from long-term trends -- like the tendency of consumers to eat better as they move up from poverty, which tends to push up food prices -- and suggest that some economies are pushing the limits of their capacity for growth.
He said that ''emerging markets have all the tools they need to address excess demand in those countries,'' and added, ''They can adjust their exchange rates, which is something that they've been reluctant to do in some cases.''
That was a clear reference to China, which has managed the value of its currency, the renminbi, in relation to the dollar.
On the eve of new unemployment figures for January that the Labor Department will report Friday, Mr. Bernanke predicted that ''we'll start seeing some stronger payroll reports and some lower unemployment rates pretty soon,'' but cautioned that it would take years for the job market to return to normal.
He said that uncertainty about the recovery's durability was hampering firms from hiring. ''Firms have been using a lot of temporary workers, because they can bring temporary workers on and if the economy weakens again, they can let them go,'' he said. ''It'll be a really good sign when we see those temporary jobs being converted into permanent jobs.''

HEADLINE: Egypt's Agonies

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt could have done many things after he announced he would not run for office again. He could have resigned and let his vice president lead an interim government, as the Obama administration reportedly is urging him to do. He could have opened serious negotiations with antigovernment protesters leading to free and fair elections.
Instead, Mr. Mubarak is making a ruthless bid to retain power. On Wednesday, mere hours after he went on national television in a futile attempt to silence demands for his ouster, men armed with clubs, rocks, knives and firebombs began a bloody assault on protesters. They were obviously encouraged, likely even orchestrated, by the Mubarak regime. 
On Thursday, the brutal crackdown went even further. As fighting between protesters and the armed gangs escalated, Mr. Mubarak's supporters attacked and detained foreign journalists, punching them and smashing their equipment. News outlets were shut down. Two New York Times reporters were among those held and eventually released. Human rights workers were also threatened and detained.
These are the familiar tactics of dictators who want to brutalize their citizens without witnesses. We fear Mr. Mubarak is planning to unleash even more violence -- antigovernment protesters have called another demonstration for Friday. There is speculation that the fighting is being provoked so Egyptians will rally around the government and support a crackdown to restore order.
Mr. Mubarak's attempt to blame the opposition and foreigners for the mayhem -- he told ABC News that the government is not responsible -- is patently absurd. He has ruled the country with an iron hand for nearly 30 years. Mr. Mubarak has lost the legitimacy to continue governing Egypt, but he has chosen survival over his people. He told ABC that he had to stay in office to avoid chaos. In fact, his continued presence ensures only more chaos and instability.
As the street battles raged, the government made conciliatory sounds. It promised that Mr. Mubarak's son would not run for president and called for dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood, the best organized opposition group. It promised to prosecute those behind the violence. The protesters, long accustomed to the government prevarications, are unlikely to be placated.
An important question is what role the army -- which gets nearly $1.5 billion in annual American aid -- is prepared to play. Will it reinforce Mr. Mubarak's repression of a transition to a new order in which the aspirations of the protesters -- fed up with poverty, lack of jobs and education, the excesses of the elite, official corruption and government repression -- will be addressed?
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Thursday that the army has a ''clear responsibility'' to protect the protesters and ''to hold accountable those responsible for these attacks.''
So far, it's unclear where the army stands. As the anti-Mubarak movement grew, some soldiers displayed sympathy for the protesters and manned checkpoints at Liberation Square, or Tahrir Square, to screen for weapons. On Monday, the army announced it would not use force against those demanding Mr. Mubarak's ouster.
But when the melee erupted on Wednesday, the military largely confined itself to guarding the Egyptian Museum and extinguishing firebombs. On Thursday, after shots were fired -- the source was unclear -- the army moved to separate the combatants, but the violence continued. These mixed messages threaten to damage the army's credibility and its status as the country's most respected institution.
The cost of the turmoil is being felt. Tourists are fleeing. The economy is paralyzed. Egypt and its people need a quick transition to an era of greater political and economic freedoms. The violence is making that transition harder.

GLOBAL FOOD PRICES RISE
For Seventh Straight Month
Global food prices are moving ever higher, hitting record levels in January as a jittery market reacted to unpredictable weather and tight supplies, according to a United Nations report. It was the seventh month in a row of food price increases. With some basic food stocks low, prices will probably continue reaching new heights, at least until the results of the harvest next summer are known, analysts said. page A4
DROUGHT ALARMS CHINA 
A severe drought in northern China has badly damaged the winter wheat crop and left the ground very dry for the spring planting, fueling inflation and alarming China's leaders. President Hu Jintao toured drought-stricken regions this week and called for ''all-out efforts'' to address the effects of water shortages on agriculture. page A4
PAKISTANIS FEAR UNREST
While the Pakistani government appeared unruffled, diplomats, analysts and other officials admitted to unease, and conceded that Pakistan contained many of the same ingredients for revolt found in the Middle East, like a poisonous resentment of the United States, Pakistan's biggest financial supporter.

PLAN TO CUT SPENDING
Falls Short of Pledge
House Republicans plan to cut federal spending this year by $32 billion, about one-third of the $100 billion in cuts that Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio promised before the November election. Republicans said that their cuts would fulfill their pledge to reduce discretionary spending to 2008 levels, but their unwillingness to propose steeper reductions reflected the difficulty of slashing spending on the scale demanded by some in their own party. Page A13
HEALTH CARE LAW DISPUTE
Virginia's attorney general announced that he hoped to bypass an initial appellate review by asking the United States Supreme Court to consider the constitutionality of the Obama health care law on an expedited basis. The commonwealth's attorney general said the legal confusion sown by conflicting lower-court opinions demanded a rapid resolution. Page A16
FINDINGS ON FORT HOOD
A new report finds that various federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed to prevent the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead and dozens injured, even though those agencies held information that the man charged in the attack had communicated with a terrorism suspect and held extreme political proclivities.

PROPOSAL SUGGESTS OPENING
Judicial Discipline Hearings
The Legislature will consider a proposal this year to open secret judicial discipline hearings to the public, as it has done periodically for years. However, some supporters of the measure predict that it will get more attention this year than it has for decades because of Albany's new focus on government ethics reform. The state Commission on Judicial Conduct will make opening its hearings a top legislative priority.

REGULATING DISCOUNT BUSES
A new bill to be introduced in Albany would place stricter regulations on the discount buses that businesses say clog up streets in Midtown and Chinatown. If approved, the bill would open the door for the city to establish designated pick-up and drop-off locations for the buses, and require a permit to operate in the city. Page A19

GERMANY'S PLAN FOR EURO
Asks Others to Follow Lead
Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants more economic integration in the euro zone, including regular meetings of its leaders. In exchange for bolstering the euro zone rescue fund, Mrs. Merkel will press others to mimic Germany's economic rise. She is proposing to coordinate retirement ages across countries, scrap any links between wages and inflation and bring corporate tax systems closer together.

RETAIL SALES EXCEED FORECAST
Despite the foul weather across the country, retailers kicked off 2011 with better-than-expected sales in January. Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial indicator known as same-store sales, rose 4.2 percent in January compared with a 3.3 percent increase in the month a year ago and forecasts of 2.7 percent.

STEEL GIANTS TALK MERGER
Two of Japan's largest steel makers said that they were in talks to merge, a move that would form the world's second-largest producer of steel after ArcelorMittal. The two companies, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, are considering merging by 2012. Page B3

PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT
Kept Green Bay's Year Alive
The Green Bay Packers might have saved their season through their handling of quarterback Aaron Rodgers's concussion on Dec. 12. Doctors kept him out against the Detroit Lions and a subsequent loss to New England, before ruling him recovered. The healthy Rodgers has not lost since; had Rodgers returned too soon and sustained another concussion, his season, and his team's, could very well have been over. Page B11

Joseph Chirlee, an American citizen and United States Army private who emigrated from Kenya five years ago, will not be permitted to race in the coming national cross-country championships because he has been a United States citizen for less than two years.

HEADLINE: Secession Percolates Through Big Issues, but It's Just Talk

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.
Texas seceded from the Union 150 years ago this month. It turned out to be a remarkably unprofitable idea.
It's not a red-letter date, although Confederate Heroes Day (Jan. 19) is still on the books. Excepting historians and other nerds, the anniversary of the state's decision to quit the Union generally goes unnoticed.
Most people think secession would be a pretty rotten idea now, but it still comes up sometimes. In April 2009, Gov. Rick Perry popped off about it at a Tea Party Tax Day rally where some in the crowd shouted ''Secede!'' 
After his speech, Mr. Perry told reporters that there were times when Texans might want to secede but that he didn't endorse the idea.
''There's a lot of different scenarios,'' Mr. Perry told The Associated Press. ''We've got a great union. There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what might come out of that? But Texas is a very unique place, and we're a pretty independent lot to boot.''
Texas retained the right, when it joined the Union, to split into as many as five states, but actually seceding? That was settled by the Civil War. After Mr. Perry's early flirtation, he has stayed out of secession conversations with reporters, toning down his rhetoric after a wave of national news and news jabber.
But the germ of the idea remained, growing into the anti-federalist talking points that fueled Mr. Perry's re-election campaign last year and provided the outline for his book ''Fed Up!''
The governor will make his State of the State speech to the Legislature next week, and it's likely to be a central theme.
It's in the fight over federal health care reform and what it does and doesn't require of state government and Texas taxpayers and insurance customers. Texas is among the states that won a round against ''Obamacare'' in Florida federal court this week. The issue was featured in Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst's re-election ads. Attorney General Greg Abbott has been outspoken on both the political and legal fronts.
They're not leaving home, just yelling at their parents.
It's in the fight over who should regulate the state's environment, the subject of another lawsuit that the state has filed over the Environmental Protection Agency's moves into regulatory territory that it had delegated to the state, in North Texas gas fields, in industrial areas in the Houston region, in definitions and rules about greenhouse gases. That one is spun as a battle between economic development and careful flexibility on the state's part versus overreaching federal environmental regulators who don't even follow their own rules. The E.P.A. jumped in strong, its supporters say, because the state put a little too much emphasis on encouraging business and too little on regulating air and water.
You'd think they had ordered the state to clean up its room.
It's in the conversation here and elsewhere in the United States about Medicaid and how much leeway the federal government should allow along with all of the money it provides for that program, about the strings attached to other federal money, like the requirements Texas refused to adopt for its unemployment insurance program in 2009, forfeiting $556 million, or the state's decision against applying for $700 million in federal Race to the Top money for education.
Medicaid is the one to watch here. State officials would like to have the money with more flexibility; Mr. Perry has talked for a while about turning it into block grants with fewer rules. It's a cost runaway that could bust the budget, which gives teeth to the argument for forbearance. He's talked to other governors, to enlist them in the cause.
The state's independent streak doesn't go all the way, as it did (and for vastly different reasons) 150 years ago. One problem for writers of the state's next budget is that they used one-time federal stimulus money for continuing expenses in the current budget. The plug is gone, but the hole it filled remains. And while the state can yell, it can't afford to go it alone. The Texas government will get almost 40 percent of its money from the federal government over the next two years -- $70.2 billion, against a total of $177.8 billion, according to the state comptroller.
This isn't a war. It's just a rebellion.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Campaign Stoops to Political Theater

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
The Chicago mayoral election comes down to this: Will Rahm Emanuel deter us from bouncing quarters off the rock-hard abs we crave?
As Egyptians protest for basic freedoms, our campaign has descended into a policy spitball fight over sales taxes. In particular, there is candidate Gery Chico's invocation of a ''Rahm tax,'' a newly coined pejorative meant to taint Mr. Emanuel's call for higher taxes on luxuries that would be offset by his proposed cut in other sales taxes.
Mr. Chico, a very qualified candidate who should know better, surfaced at a private gym to suggest that a potential tax on its services would even undermine Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign. The implications are that a tax would deter sauna-craving fatsos. Perhaps more astonishingly, low attendance at a Bally's seems right up there with poverty, lousy diets, poor education, unemployment and insufficient parental discipline. 
As part of dueling stagecraft, Mr. Emanuel previously dispatched a limo to a news conference Mr. Chico was holding at a barber shop, where Mr. Chico was also talking about taxing services, to underscore all that isn't currently taxed. Mr. Emanuel's supporters also complicated Mr. Chico's other campaign stops with a mix of semihardball and comic relief.
Most people don't realize that only goods, like clothes and groceries, are now taxed in the state, while luxury services are not. Our narrow sales tax spectrum is preserved by Springfield lobbyists' opposition to any expansion. But Mr. Emanuel wants to reduce Chicago's sales tax rate, which is the highest of any United States city, and recoup lost revenue by expanding the base of what's taxed.
He might have been more specific initially, not leaving himself open to Mr. Chico's assertions of what he'd cover, in turn prompting Mr. Emanuel's denials. It inspired a sideshow that skirts politically incorrect candor on what the candidates would really cut to deal with a megadeficit in the budget and huge unfunded pension liabilities.
''Our financial problems are far bigger than what we could generate even under the most aggressive expansion of the sales tax,'' said Laurence Msall, president of the nonpartisan Civic Federation. ''There are bigger structural problems that will cause politically unpopular decisions by the next mayor and City Council.''
Sales taxes are regressive, tending to disproportionately hurt those citizens with the least, even if voters tend not to see it that way. Voters seem to believe that if everybody pays the same, then it's progressive.
Still, we need to find revenue. It's why a revolutionary copy-cat idea crossed my mind Tuesday as Brad Keywell, one of the young entrepreneurs behind the dazzling success of Groupon, spoke at a Loop gathering on the city's future sponsored by the University of Chicago.
Instead of my morning e-mail Groupons, offering deals on restaurants, massages and oil changes, the next mayor could start our own version to gin up revenue via neighborly competition for city services.
Instead of using clout or sweating out a lottery to get a child into a good public school, what about early morning deals to simply pay for a slot?
''First 50 to Pay $500 Get Kid Into Alcott Elementary!''
As with Groupon's deal with restaurants, the city might go 50-50 on the revenue; in this case a split with entrepreneurial principals, who could throw in their own perks, like pedicures for parents.
Or, as the blizzard suggests, we could compete online to have snow plowed or garbage picked up.
''First 1,000 City Residents to Pay $25 Get Alley Behind Home Taken Care Of by 11 a.m.,'' with a percentage going to the alderman or some other ward boss.
Winners could sit in their cozy dens and watch a neighbor aggravate a herniated disk while shoveling, or see his empty pizza delivery boxes and microwave lasagna containers pile toward the ComEd electrical wires overhead. City coffers would be the beneficiary.
We could get down and dirty. Imagine this: ''60% Off $200 Payoffs to Meter Inspectors.''
This might be tricky since it could pique the curiosity of Patrick Fitzgerald, the chief federal prosecutor, who tends to go only for deals tied to guilty pleas.
Yeah, it's probably just simpler to cuddle up in front of the television, watch Egyptians risking their lives for freedom and look around at our politicians harrumphing about the price of a haircut. Or, for that matter, calling a rival a crack head.

HEADLINE: EGYPT OFFICIALS WIDEN CRACKDOWN; U.S. IN TALKS FOR MUBARAK TO QUIT

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; David D. Kirkpatrick, Kareem Fahim, and Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government on Thursday broadened its crackdown on a 10-day uprising that has shaken its rule, arresting journalists and human rights advocates across an edgy city, while offering more concessions in a bid to win support from a population growing frustrated with a devastated economy and scenes of chaos in the streets.
The campaign was a startling blend of the oldest tactics of an authoritarian government -- stoking fears of foreigners -- with the air of sincerity of a repentant order. Trying to seize the initiative from a revolt that has marked one of the most decisive moments in modern Egyptian history, the government promised that neither President Hosni Mubarak nor his son Gamal, long seen as a contender for power, would run for president and offered dialogue with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, gestures almost unthinkable weeks ago.
As protesters battled crowds rallied by the government for a second day, organizers sought to rally even bigger demonstrations for Friday -- dubbed the ''Friday of departure'' -- in hopes of keeping the momentum behind a popular uprising that has demanded that Mr. Mubarak step down after three decades in power. 
Voiced often in the tumultuous scenes of defiance and determination in Tahrir Square was a fear that if they lost, the protesters and their organizers would bear the brunt of a withering crackdown.
''If we can't bring this to an end, we're going to all be in the slammer by June,'' said Murad Mohsen, a doctor treating the wounded at a makeshift clinic near barricades, where thousands fought off droves of government supporters with rocks and firebombs.
Dr. Mohsen's comments illustrated the changing dynamic of an uprising that has captivated the Arab world, reverberating through Jordan, Sudan and Yemen, where there were peaceful protests on Thursday. New calls for protests went out in Algeria, Bahrain and Libya.
From festive scenes of just days ago, the revolt has become more martial, as exhausted men defend what they describe as the perimeter of a free Egypt around Tahrir Square. Their demands have grown more forceful and the uprising more radical. After pitched clashes of two days that left at least seven dead and hundreds wounded, banners in Tahrir Square declared Mr. Mubarak ''a war criminal,'' and several in the crowd said that the president should be executed. Major television networks were largely unable to broadcast from the square on Thursday.
The United States joined a chorus of criticism, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton saying, ''We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats.''
The government's strategy seems motivated at turning broader opinion in the country against the protests and perhaps wearing down the demonstrators themselves, some of whom seemed exhausted by the clashes. Vice President Omar Suleiman, appointed Saturday to a position that Mr. Mubarak had until then refused to fill, appealed to Egypt's sense of decency in allowing Mr. Mubarak to serve out his term, and he chronicled the mounting losses that, he said, the uprising had inflicted on a crippled Egyptian economy.
''End your sit-in,'' he said. ''Your demands have been answered.''
Mr. Mubarak said in an interview with ABC that he was eager to step down but if he did, ''Egypt would sink into chaos.''
In interviews and statements, the government has increasingly spread an image that foreigners were inciting the uprising, a refrain echoed in the streets. The suggestions are part of a days-long Egyptian media campaign that has portrayed the protesters as troublemakers and ignored the scope of an uprising with diffuse goals and leadership.
''Millions turn out to support Mubarak,'' read the banner headline on Thursday on the front page of Al Ahram, the leading government newspaper.
The propaganda has been so pronounced that an announcer on Nile Television, Shahira Amin, quit. ''I cleared my conscience and walked out,'' she said.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said it had 100 reports of attacks on journalists. Al Jazeera, the influential Arabic channel, said government supporters stormed the Hilton Hotel in Cairo, searching for journalists, and two of its reporters were attacked. A Greek journalist was stabbed with a screwdriver and others were beaten and harassed.
Police also raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a headquarters for many of the international human rights organizations working in Egypt. The human rights workers were told to lie on the floor and the chips were removed from the telephones, someone present in the building said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
As the day wore on, tension descended across parts of the city, which is still guarded by popular committees that banded together after the police withdrew Saturday. Government supporters roamed parts of the downtown, itching for a fight, and looters set fire to a shopping mall along the Nile that was already looted and burned Friday.
The menace was a counterpoint to Tahrir Square, where the literati and well-off demonstrators mixed with the poorest of rough-and-tumble neighborhoods in scenes of camaraderie and determination that have made the square an emblem of the revolt. Protesters flashed V-for-victory signs at dawn, celebrating their success in holding the square and even pushing the barricades forward in clashes that dragged through the night.
Protesters accused government supporters of trying to block them from delivering supplies to the square, but boxes of water, bananas, yogurt and medicine still made it in. The Internet was working. Volunteers swept the streets, pushing piles of rocks to the curb that looked like bluffs of snow. Doctors staffed first-aid clinics, near graffiti that read, ''We are writing the history of a free Egypt,'' and men frisked people entering for weapons.
''Don't incite them!'' shouted Mahmoud Haqiqi, holding aloft a sign that read, ''No to shedding of blood.'' But even those who lamented the turn to violence blamed Mr. Mubarak's supporters for provoking them and vowed not to relinquish the square. ''Right now, it's all here, protecting Tahrir Square,'' said Hisham Kassem, a veteran activist and publisher, who kept a wary eye on barricades built with corrugated tin, wrecked cars and trucks, barrels, buckets filed with sand and metal railing torn from the curb. ''We keep it tonight, and tomorrow the whole country is going to come out.''
He surveyed the crowd and shook his head. ''I can't face the idea of this failing.''
For days, the government seemed to stagger at the scale of an uprising that overwhelmed Egypt's once ubiquitous security forces on Friday. The concessions on Thursday marked its most concerted attempt to address at least some of the longstanding demands in a country that many believe has stagnated under Mr. Mubarak's rule. The newly appointed prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, apologized for the violence and vowed to investigate who instigated it. Mr. Suleiman followed with a lengthy television interview in which he recognized what he described as ''the revolution of the youth.''
Mr. Suleiman sought to project an image of good will, offering dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood, which remains banned, even though it is the country's most influential opposition group. In a sign of the new landscape, Mr. Suleiman referred to it by name rather than the government's usual coded language, though he and Mr. Mubarak have both suggested it was behind the revolt. Its followers have played a forceful role in the protests, but its leaders have, so far, tried to remain in the background.
''We have contacted the Muslim Brotherhood and invited them, but they are still hesitant about the dialogue,'' he said. ''I think that their interest is to attend the dialogue.''
Other concessions came from Egypt's public prosecutor, who issued a travel ban on former government ministers and an official of the ruling National Democratic Party on suspicion of theft of public money, profiteering and fraud, state television reported. Among the four was the hated former interior minister, Habib el-Adly, who commanded a police force that was widely despised for its corruption and routine use of torture.
So far, the government's concessions have done little to diminish the protests, but the relentless message of officials that Egypt faced chaos seemed, at least anecdotally, to be finding an audience.
''This is enough,'' said Ahmed Mohamed, a 22-year-old broker at the National Bank of Kuwait, hanging out at a rarity in Cairo, a coffee shop doing business. ''I want life to go back to normal. We want to go back to work. And what we have done in 72 hours we couldn't achieve in 30 years. It's only a few months until Mubarak leaves.''

HEADLINE: In Asia, Hello to Faster Trades and Goodbye to Lunch Hour

BYLINE: By JETHRO MULLEN

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Nearly 25 years after the fictional financier Gordon Gekko declared in ''Wall Street'' that ''lunch is for wimps,'' Asia's leading stock exchanges seem to have gotten the memo.
With investors' attention focused on the fast-growing markets, the region's main financial hubs are jockeying for dominance with a host of new efforts intended to increase their competitiveness on a global scale. As they move to gain share, local exchanges are upgrading their infrastructure, expanding their operations and even throwing out longstanding traditions like lengthy lunch breaks. 
Such efforts come after a stellar year for the Asia-Pacific markets. Of the 20 exchanges that generated the highest proceeds from initial public offerings in 2010, half were located in the region, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hong Kong took the top spot, easily eclipsing global heavyweights like New York and London.
This year is looking tougher, though. Asian stock indexes are off to a rocky start with increasing concerns over rising inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. And the United States seems to be regaining some of its former I.P.O. strength, with several better-than-expected debuts in recent weeks.
''No one's expecting a year like last year, which makes the viability and the attractiveness of the exchange all the more important,'' said Gary N. Kleiman, senior partner at Kleiman International, a research firm based in Washington that specializes in emerging markets.
At the center of the push in Asia are Hong Kong and Singapore, both vying to be the region's pre-eminent financial domain for international investors. With an economic powerhouse in its backyard, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has the commanding position, serving the booming Chinese market. I.P.O. volume topped $52 billion last year, compared with $5.1 billion in Singapore.
But the Singapore Exchange, known as SGX, is looking to broaden its global appeal. In October, SGX said it would buy the leading Australian stock market, ASX, for $8.3 billion. If the deal is approved, the combined entity will rank among the region's big hitters, which should make it more attractive to large institutional investors.
SGX landed a major victory last month when Li Ka-shing, the billionaire Hong Kong property magnate, said he planned to list his Chinese port assets in Singapore, where tax regulations are more favorable.
Singapore also plans to introduce a high-speed trading engine in August, which SGX says will be the fastest in the world. The software, according to the company, will allow trades to be completed in 90 microseconds, faster than the 98 microseconds the Nasdaq says it takes.
For Hong Kong, the onus is on securing its position as the gateway to China. While Shanghai and Shenzhen scored high in the I.P.O. rankings, the mainland markets remain largely closed to foreign investors, a reason many companies that list their securities in China also do so in Hong Kong.
To help cement that connection, Hong Kong said in November that it would extend its trading hours and shorten its lunch break, more closely aligning its schedule with that of Shanghai. Two months later, Singapore said it would eliminate its midday hiatus altogether.
''This lunch hour competition is a little bit of Hong Kong-Singapore one-upmanship,'' Mr. Kleiman said. ''It's the battle for Asian dominance after a record year of capital inflows.''
The lunch hour is the last vestige of a bygone colonial era. While London shed its more laidback habits more than 60 years ago, the British influence has lingered in Asia for decades.
''When I first arrived it was very British: there was a mandatory half-day on Saturday where people would sit around and read newspapers and clean up their desk,'' said Todd Martin, an equity strategist in Hong Kong for the French bank Societe Generale, who has worked in Asian markets for the past 18 years.
''The Asian crisis changed all that,'' Mr. Martin, a Canadian citizen, said, referring to the financial shock that destabilized many economies in the region in the late 1990s. ''It really shook up the old industry and a lot of the old British brokers.''
Now, the lunch break is disappearing, too - a move that's rather controversial in Hong Kong and Singapore. Stockbrokers and other market professionals point out that they don't simply put their feet up on the desk or go out for a long, leisurely meal. Many spend the time meeting with clients and attending business events like I.P.O. presentations.
''It's terrible,'' said Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong. ''I think they think the employees can work like machines.''
Some also argue the extended trading hours put smaller trading firms at a disadvantage, given the costs of adding staff. It's also unclear whether the extra hours will translate into higher trading volumes and bigger profits. Resistance from local firms is one reason that established Asian exchanges have hung on to lunch breaks for so long.
''It is easier for local brokerages that are smaller to work with fewer people if the lunch breaks are present,'' said Anshuman Jaswal, a capital markets analyst based in Bangalore for the financial consulting firm Celent.
But lunch breaks have also proved problematic, say traders. For one, the computer trading programs on which many firms rely don't function as effectively if stock activity stops in the middle of the day, said Hani Shalabi, who oversees the electronic stock trading for Credit Suisse clients in the Asia-Pacific region.
The changes also greatly reduce so-called gap risk, when a stock price moves significantly after news that comes out in the off hours.
''Anything could happen, war could break out,'' Mr. Shalabi said. ''Weekend gap risk is massive. Lunch is the same thing, but to a smaller extent.''
His job is to help smooth out the potential bumps such situations can create for his clients as he supervises computers delving into multiple markets across the region. All of which does not leave a lot of time for three-course meals.
''We're eating at our desk no matter what happens,'' Mr. Shalabi said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: MasterCard Says Profit Rose 41%

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MasterCard's fourth-quarter profit rose 41 percent, beating expectations, as consumers around the world spent more money using credit and debit cards. 
Revenue rose almost 11 percent, to $1.44 billion, slightly above expectations, and grew from the previous quarter in all regions.
''Based on the spending trends we have seen and the improving consumer confidence, I think I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued improvements in 2011,'' MasterCard's chief executive, Ajay Banga, told investors in a conference call on Thursday.
The company reported a quarterly profit of $415 million, or $3.16 a share, compared with $294 million, or $2.24 a share, a year earlier.
Cross-border volumes, which indicate that people are traveling more and using their cards in foreign countries, grew almost 19 percent.
MasterCard, like its larger rival, Visa, is benefiting from a rebound in business travel.
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which also reported quarterly earnings on Thursday, is among the hotel companies and airlines that are reporting higher-than-expected profits as companies in the United States spend more money on employee travel.
MaterCard's ''earnings showed some really nice fundamental progress,'' said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of the money management firm W. P. Stewart.
''These are signs both that banks are issuing cards, and cardholders are using their cards again,'' he said, ''so we're getting back to normal.''
Stock in MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., rose $6, to close at $245.39 a share.

HEADLINE: In a Town Called Asbestos, a Plan to Restart the Industry That Made It Prosperous

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
ASBESTOS, Quebec -- The belief in asbestos lives on in this mining town of 7,000 people, not just in the name -- retained despite its association with cancer -- but in the ambitions of the mineral's long-time champion here, G. Bernard Coulombe.
Mr. Coulombe, 69, says he believes that you can recapture the past. At a time when Canada, like many countries, is spending millions of dollars to remove asbestos from buildings, to say nothing of covering asbestos-related disability claims, Mr. Coulombe wants a $58 million loan guarantee from the province of Quebec. He is hoping to attract investors and revitalize the mine that gave rise to the town in 1879 and for more than a century has swallowed chunks of it into its ever-expanding pit.
Adding to the controversy over the plan, Mr. Coulombe's strategy is to sell to countries like India, Pakistan and Vietnam, where enthusiasm for cheap asbestos often comes with a lax approach to workplace health and safety. 
It would seem a quixotic venture. Mr. Coulombe's proposal has been widely condemned by the medical and public health community both in Canada and abroad. The mineral's dangers have largely eliminated the market for it in Canada as well as the United States, where the last asbestos mine closed in 2002.
But while many Canadians outside Quebec view the mine's survival as something of an international embarrassment, history suggests it would be unwise to dismiss Mr. Coulombe. The asbestos industry was once a prominent symbol of Quebec's might in natural resources, and the mine -- now known as Mine Jeffrey -- played an outsize role in the province's political history.
''The whole asbestos debate is purely emotional,'' said Paul Lapierre, the vice president for cancer control at the Canadian Cancer Society and an opponent of Mr. Coulombe's proposal. ''As Quebeckers we were once so proud of our mining industry, including asbestos.''
The political strength of asbestos will be tested this month when the province is expected to announce a decision on the loan guarantee.
Jeffrey was once a key operation of Johns Manville, the American building materials company, and at one time provided most of the world's supply of one type of asbestos. But over time a large body of scientific evidence linked it to lung cancer and mesothelioma, a fast-acting cancer of major organs, and asbestosis, a hardening of the lungs that ultimately suffocates its victims.
In 1982, health-related lawsuits forced Johns Manville into bankruptcy; the Jeffrey mine was sold to its managers a year later.
The fortunes of asbestos have continued to sink. After peaking at 4.79 million metric tons in 1977, worldwide production reached only 1.97 million metric tons last year. Some countries, including the members of the European Union, now ban the mineral's general use. Synthetic fibers have assumed most of the tasks it once handled, if at a higher cost. Asbestos's remaining markets are mainly less developed nations as well as China and the countries of the former Soviet Union and China, some of which have mines. Its one remaining attraction is its low cost.
Once it reaches developing countries, asbestos from the Jeffrey mine is usually mixed with cement and formed into inexpensive pipes and roof sheeting.
The town of Asbestos, once prosperous, has tracked the mineral's decline. The former town hall sits abandoned. When repairs to the building proved unaffordable, the local government moved into a church it purchased for $1. The mine pit, which is about a mile wide and 1.2 miles long, and its two huge mills are currently inactive.
As he rapped on a wall in his shabby office, Mr. Coulombe, an engineer who joined the mine 42 years ago, lamented that its asbestos-based wallboard was no longer available.
Mr. Coulombe readily acknowledges the mineral's dangers and the harm it has done. But he asserted that the trouble mainly resulted from other forms of asbestos and not the variety, known as chrysotile, produced at Jeffrey as well as operations in nearby Thetford Mines. ''The people against us in the medical community, they know nothing about chrysotile,'' Mr. Coulombe said. ''We show our opponents all sorts of studies done over the last 25 years all around the world that demonstrate that there is no problem working with chrysotile. But they don't take that into account. They say 'It's a carcinogen, it's a carcinogen, it's a carcinogen.' ''
While some studies suggest that the five other varieties of asbestos may be more dangerous, Mr. Coulombe's opponents are adamant that this does not mean chrysotile is safe, even when used with precautions.
The World Health Organization has declared chrysotile a carcinogen and notes that ''the most efficient way to eliminate asbestos-related diseases is to stop the use of all types of asbestos.''
Mr. Coulombe said his potential investors were mainly his customers in India and Pakistan. The only one publicly identified is Baljit Singh Chadha, whose Montreal-based trading company, Balcorp, is Jeffrey's sales agent in India. Mr. Chadha has raised money for the provincial Liberal Party, which currently holds power, as well as the federal Liberal Party, which now opposes the asbestos industry.
For a province with a population of 7.9 million, the Jeffrey mine promises relatively little in economic terms. Mr. Coulombe's hope is to close the open pit and complete an underground mine he started 14 years ago, employing up to 500 people.
But the mine occupies a significant place in the province's culture. Clement Gignac, the province's economic development minister, noted that even the main opposition party supported the mine. ''I think we will maintain our historical position on asbestos,'' he said.
Criticism of asbestos is not well received in this town of about 7,000. Last year, it canceled a long running fundraising walk for cancer research because of the Canadian Cancer Society's opposition to the Jeffrey mine plan.
The Jeffrey mine's hold on Quebec and Canadian politics started with an unusually violent strike against Johns Manville in 1949. The walkout was embraced by many prominent intellectuals and signified the beginning of broad political, economic and social changes in the province. Many historians argue the fallout from the strike spurred the formation of modern Quebec.
Michael D. Behiels, an historian at the University of Ottawa, said that neither government could risk losing support in the electoral districts surrounding Asbestos, located about 100 miles east of Montreal, by refusing Mr. Coulombe.
''They need every seat there so they'll do whatever it takes, even if it means keeping the asbestos industry, this dodo bird, on life support,'' Professor Behiels said.
As for Mr. Coulombe, he owns 65 percent of the mine (with employees holding the remainder), and any loan guarantee will be conditional on his remaining as investor for several years.
''For me it's not a business, because I will not touch any money until I am 80 years of age, maybe,'' he said before returning to his list of complaints against litigation lawyers, public health officials, the asbestos removal industry and manufacturers of asbestos substitutes. ''It's a cause. This is much more of a mercantile war than a real safety or environmental war. I'm convinced I have a good cause.''

HEADLINE: Food Prices Worldwide Hit Record Levels, Fueled by Uncertainty, U.N. Says

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- Global food prices are moving ever higher, hitting record levels last month as a jittery market reacted to unpredictable weather and tight supplies, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.
It was the seventh month in a row of food price increases, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which put out the report. And with some basic food stocks low, prices will probably continue reaching new heights, at least until the results of the harvest next summer are known, analysts said.
''Uncertainty itself is a new factor in the market that pushes up prices and will not push them down,'' said Abdolreza Abbassian, an economist and the grain expert at F.A.O. ''People don't trust anyone to tell them about the harvest and the weather, so it has to await harvest time.'' 
Scattered bright spots in the report led experts to suggest that a repeat of the 2008 food riots stemming from similar sharp price increases might not be imminent. Rice was slightly cheaper and meat prices stable, they noted. But the overall uncertainty and inflation could eventually make the situation worse than three years ago, they said.
Riots and demonstrations erupting across the Middle East are not directly inspired by rising food prices alone, experts noted, but that is one factor fueling the anger directed toward governments in the region. Egypt was among more than a dozen countries that experienced food riots in 2008.
The F.A.O. price index, which tracks 55 food commodities for export, rose 3.4 percent in January, hitting its highest level since tracking began in 1990, the report said. Countries not dependent on food imports are less affected by global volatility. Still, food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent in the United States this year.
Four main factors are seen as driving prices higher: weather, higher demand, smaller yields and crops diverted to biofuels. Volatile weather patterns often attributed to climate change are wreaking havoc with some harvests. Heavy rains in Australia damaged wheat to the extent that much of its usually high-quality crop has been downgraded to feed, experts noted.
This has pushed the demand and prices for American wheat much higher, with the best grades selling at 100 percent more than they were a year ago, Mr. Abbassian said. The autumn soybean harvest in the United States was poor, so strong demand means stocks are at their lowest level in 50 years, he said.
Brokers are waiting to see how acreage in the United States will be divided between soybeans, corn and cotton, with cotton fetching record prices, Mr. Abbassian said.
Sugar prices are also at a 30-year high, he said. Prices for cereals are rising but still below their April 2008 peak. Oils and fats are up and close to their 2008 level, and dairy is higher but still below its 2007 peak, the report said. Even positive news, like good rains in Argentina and a strong harvest in Africa, has failed to keep prices from rising.
''Food prices are not only rising, but they are also volatile and will continue this way into the future,'' said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the World Bank managing director.
Changing diets around the world stemming from higher incomes, especially in places like China and India, mean a greater demand for meat and better grains. Although it takes time for that to translate into higher prices globally, it does buoy demand, the experts said.
In 2009, the richest nations pledged more than $20 billion to aid agriculture in developing countries, including $6 billion for a food security fund housed at the World Bank. Just $925 million of those pledges has been paid, Ms. Okonjo-Iweala noted, because of financial problems in the donor countries. That will bring consequences, she said, as one billion people already go without sufficient food daily.
Derek Headey, an economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute, noted that in 2007 and 2008 many African countries were hit hard by soaring import bills, as were nations spread across the world, like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ecuador.
But some of the world's largest and poorest countries experienced rapid economic growth and only modest food inflation, so the number of people facing food insecurity in nations like China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam actually went down at that time, he said.
''This time around there is still strong economic growth in these countries, but inflation is much more of a problem,'' he said. ''So it is possible that the impact could be worse in 2011, especially if food prices stay high.''
It will take some months for those figures to emerge, he added.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Skips City Hearing as Protesters and Council Members Assail Stores' Impact

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
It was a moment long planned and carefully prepared for -- a moment that had twice been delayed by snow. But when the moment finally arrived, the main protagonist was missing.
The City Council held a hearing on Thursday afternoon to examine the economic impact Wal-Mart would have should it succeed in opening its first stores in New York City.
But Wal-Mart's official representatives were no-shows, which was something company officials had made clear would happen weeks ago when the hearing was first scheduled. 
So critics, from council members to representatives of small businesses, had no one to direct their anger at and spent hours making the same familiar arguments -- the death of family-owned businesses, poor labor practices by Wal-Mart -- to a mostly sympathetic audience.
The reason no one from Wal-Mart accepted an invitation, a spokesman for the retail giant said, was that it felt it was being singled out unfairly in a city full of big-box stores, including Home Depot, Sears and Target.
''Our decision not to attend today's hearing has nothing to do with our willingness to answer questions or our belief that our stores would be good for New York City,'' the spokesman, Steven Restivo, said, ''and everything to do with the hypothetical nature of the proceedings and the fact that it ignores the hundreds of similarly sized stores that exist in the city today.''
The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, wasted no time pointing out Wal-Mart's absence.
''I want to say how deeply disappointed I am that one very important part of the equation, Wal-Mart, decided not to join us here today,'' she said as the hearing began. She said the company's ''refusal to attend, sadly, only leads me to be further skeptical about them as a company.''
Several council members said they shared her misgivings.
''My community needs jobs, but even if you're hungry, someone shouldn't feed you garbage,'' Councilman Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn said.
The verbal volleys against Wal-Mart started early. At a rally on the steps of City Hall before the hearing, a crowd of more than 300 people waved anti-Wal-Mart signs as the public advocate, Bill de Blasio, called the company destructive and a ''Trojan horse.''
And Councilman Charles Barron, who represents the East New York section of Brooklyn, one of the places where Wal-Mart is considering opening a store, called the store ''a plantation.''
Two hours into the hearing, Andy Sullivan, the founder of a group called 911 Hard Hats and a union construction worker who had come to testify in favor of Wal-Mart, stood up and complained that no one on his side had yet had a chance to testify.
When it was his turn, Mr. Sullivan noted that Wal-Mart had recently made final a deal with a politically powerful construction union, the Building and Construction Trades Council, promising to build and renovate its stores in the five boroughs with union workers for five years. Wal-Mart used the same strategy to gain support for stores in Chicago several years ago.
''The pain is here, it is now,'' Mr. Sullivan during his testimony, citing what he said was a 30 percent unemployment rate among unionized construction workers. ''It's not being caused by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's not here!''
Charles Fisher, the chairman of the Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council in Harlem, also spoke in favor of Wal-Mart. Last year, Wal-Mart flew Mr. Fisher down to its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., at the company's expense, for a three-day ''stakeholder summit'' of community leaders from around the country.
Instead of speaking directly to the Council, Wal-Mart, which has not announced a specific store opening in New York, has begun an all-out publicity drive, with direct mailings, radio advertisements and a Facebook page.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has said that New York should be open to any legal business that wants to come here, was asked by a reporter on Thursday about the hearing and if it was in the city's best interest to let Wal-Mart set up shop.
''You should let the marketplace decide,'' he said. ''Anybody who has tried to manage the marketplace, it has not turned out very well. I think the Soviet Union is as good an example as you'd ever need of that.''

HEADLINE: Inventing A New Life, Yet Again

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When she first came to this country and this city in June 2007, Nour al-Khal wore a head scarf, as was proper for a woman from Basra, a Shiite-dominated city in southern Iraq. She continued to wear it for more than a year. Then, on an August day in 2008, the scarf came off.
She was a bridesmaid at a wedding. To Ms. al-Khal, it seemed a good moment to lose this ''small piece of cloth on my head'' that instantly, and incorrectly, made her an Islamic radical in some people's eyes. ''It was a crucial step on my part to be integrated in the society here,'' she said the other day. 
But integration requires more than a wardrobe change. Work is essential, too. A job is one thing that Ms. al-Khal has not had for the past 15 months.
''I've been applying basically for anything: translating, teaching, baby-sitting, cat-sitting, everything -- jobs I never thought of in my life,'' she said. ''I'm not lazy. I'm not sitting on the couch all day. I just want to move forward.''
Perhaps you recall Ms. al-Khal's story. It has been told before.
With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, she parlayed a degree in English from Basra University into a translator's job with the United States Agency for International Development. She also did translation for foreign reporters, working most closely with Steven Vincent, a freelancer from New York who had gone to Basra to chronicle spreading violence there.
In August 2005, the two of them were abducted by armed men believed to have been part of a police death squad. Mr. Vincent, 49, was killed, his body dumped in the street. Ms. al-Khal -- a name that she adopted for her own safety when she went to work for the Americans -- was shot three times. A bullet is still lodged in her left leg.
While she recovered in Iraq, Mr. Vincent's widow in New York, Lisa Ramaci, knocked on many doors to convince the American government that Ms. al-Khal deserved to be classified as a political refugee. Her perseverance paid off. Ms. al-Khal, then in her early 30s, landed here in mid-2007 to begin life anew.
Things started out well enough.
She lived for half a year in Ms. Ramaci's narrow, book-filled apartment in the East Village, where photographs and mementos in a window form a shrine to Mr. Vincent. She took a job as a receptionist at a real estate firm. She found other places to live, first in Chelsea, then in Astoria, Queens, sharing space with an Iraqi family. She landed a new job, a good one. Working from home, she did English-Arabic translation for a nonprofit group that advised the American and Iraqi governments on international law and human rights issues.
That job lasted until November 2009. Her employer lost its government contract, and Ms. al-Khal was laid off.
For a while, she got by on her savings, but they evaporated. Unable to keep up the rent payments in Astoria, she moved back in with Ms. Ramaci this week, back to a bedroom that used to be Mr. Vincent's office. Ms. Ramaci is unemployed herself, let go last summer by an auction house in New Jersey where she had worked.
''Welcome to America in 2011,'' Ms. Ramaci told her old and new roommate. ''You've got 35-year-olds moving back home with their parents. It's not just you.''
Indeed, it isn't, for Americans or for refugees.
Among Iraqis, thousands have had trouble reinventing themselves in this country, which bears considerable responsibility for their displacement with its long war. Many had worked in Iraq for American government agencies and news organizations, often as translators in dangerous situations. Now they find themselves in a recession-battered America that has diminished interest in Iraq -- and in the Iraqis who had helped it.
It may not be just about Ms. al-Khal, but like Yossarian in ''Catch-22,'' she can't help taking it personally.
She has even begun talking about a return to Iraq, though that does not seem realistic. She would probably lose her refugee status. Also, she acknowledged, Basra is still perilous. Besides, Ms. Ramaci said to her: ''there is no way that I will let you go back to Iraq. We will find you a job, and we will get you a life.''
For Ms. al-Khal, work and life are intertwined. And to her mind, no matter how weary of war Americans may be, the fact that she is an Iraqi with a skill should matter. ''A lot of work needs to be done between the two countries,'' she said. ''We still have business. We're not finished with each other.''

HEADLINE: Kellogg's Income Increases 7%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company, the cereal maker, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter income climbed 7 percent despite falling volumes as it cut costs and raised prices. 
Kellogg, which makes Frosted Flakes, Pop Tarts and other foods, is increasing its investment in new product development by 25 percent after scaling back during the recession.
It will also spend more on auditing suppliers and testing raw materials to avoid a repeat of a major cereal recall and problems with its Eggo waffle distribution that hurt its results.
In addition, it is increasing prices on some of its products to offset higher ingredient costs. The company put some increases in place during 2010, but those are expected to continue through the year as the cost for corn and wheat rise.
Kellogg's price increases also helped make up for softer sales volume during the period.
The company reported that its fourth-quarter revenue fell 1 percent, to $2.86 billion, but that still topped the average forecast of analysts surveyed by FactSet for revenue of $2.85 billion.
Kellogg earned $189 million, or 51 cents a share, during the period, meeting analysts' expectations. That compares with $176 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
Shares of Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., rose $2.16, or 4 percent, to $52.52.

HEADLINE: Multiple Reports Hint That Economy Is Gaining Momentum

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Growth in the nation's services sector in January was the fastest in more than five years, another sign the economy started 2011 on a solid footing, with measures of employment showing more strength.
Reports on Thursday, including a decline in weekly claims for jobless benefits, painted a strengthening picture for the economy as it recovered from the worst recession since the Great Depression. 
Inflation pressures appeared mostly under control as businesses kept a tight grip on labor costs, the largest expense for most companies.
''Momentum from the end of 2010 is carrying over,'' said Robert Dye, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. ''It will be another year of recovery and repair.''
The Institute for Supply Management's index of national nonmanufacturing activity rose to 59.4 last month, its highest level since August 2005, from 57.1 in December. Economists had expected a decline to 57.0.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the nation's jobs, and it was the 14th consecutive month of growth.
The surprise pickup in growth, which mirrored a similar acceleration in manufacturing in January, was further evidence that the economic recovery was broadening.
The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged the improvement in the recovery on Thursday but said the economy still needed help, citing persistently high unemployment.
Economists say they believe strengthening domestic demand will mean increased hiring.
A Labor Department report showed new claims for state jobless benefits fell 42,000, to a seasonally adjusted 415,000. Economists had expected claims to decline to 420,000.
The claims data falls outside the survey period for the closely watched payrolls report for January, due on Friday.
The economy probably created 145,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll, after adding 103,000 in December. Reports on Wednesday suggested private hiring was gathering pace.
Expectations for a pickup in job growth were bolstered by a jump in the Institute for Supply Management's employment gauge to its highest since May 2006.
Heavy snow and cold weather slowed the downward trend in initial jobless claims by causing a backlog in applications, but economists say they believe claims will soon drop below 400,000, a level believed to signal strong job growth.
''We think the trend in claims is coming down because small firms are firing fewer people,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ''With credit now easing, we are hopeful claims will fall significantly further over the next few months.''
A second Labor Department report showed that although businesses faced rising input costs, they kept labor costs down by getting more from workers, helping keep inflation muted.
Nonfarm productivity, a measure of hourly output per worker, rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter after rising at a 2.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
The increase, which was well above economists' expectations for a 2 percent growth rate, bodes well for company profits.
Unit labor costs, a gauge of potential inflation pressures closely watched by the Fed, fell at a 0.6 percent rate after dipping 0.1 percent in the third quarter.
''It's showing that even though we are seeing some sector-specific inflation among businesses that are exposed to commodities, that is not threatening to cut into profits,'' said Mr. Dye from PNC Financial Services.
Mr. Dye said he did not expect the rise in commodity prices to feed into so-called core inflation, which the Fed monitors, as overall economic conditions still remained slack. Core inflation strips out volatile food and energy costs.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Ethnic Makeup Shifts, and Population Drifts Southward

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In the last decade, the number of white people in New Jersey declined as the number of Asians and Hispanics soared, and the population shifted southward -- some of the many shifts with broad cultural and political implications that were revealed in 2010 census figures released on Thursday.
Newark, the state's largest city, grew 1.3 percent, to more than 277,000 people, reversing five decades of contraction, and the second-largest, Jersey City, grew 3.1 percent, to more than 247,000. But populations declined in several of the largest and most heavily minority cities and towns, including Paterson, Trenton, Camden, Union City, East Orange, and Irvington. 
In particular, the state's most crowded areas saw something of a black exodus from 2000 to 2010; the total population dropped 11.2 percent in Irvington and 8 percent in East Orange, both places that are predominantly black. At the same time, the cities became much more heavily Hispanic.
Over all, the population of New Jersey grew 4.5 percent, to nearly 8.8 million people, but that was far behind the 9.7 percent national growth rate.
Growth was slowest in the state's densely packed northeast, where most of the population resides. Essex County, which includes East Orange, Irvington and Newark, shrank 1.2 percent, to about 784,000 people, well below its peak of more than 932,000 in 1970. The state's most populous county as recently as the 1980s, Essex slipped to third in 2010, behind Middlesex, which grew to almost 810,000 people. Bergen County, the most populous, grew 2.4 percent, to 905,000, and Passaic and Union Counties also grew by less than 3 percent.
The southern half of the state boomed by comparison -- the populations of Gloucester and Ocean Counties each grew by 13 percent. Lakewood Township in Ocean County, with an expanding Orthodox Jewish population, had the fastest growth of any large municipality, soaring almost 54 percent in the decade, to nearly 93,000 people.
''In some of the more developed areas, you have towns that are pretty much built out, and a lot of empty-nesters,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Factors drawing people to South Jersey, he said, were more-affordable housing and construction of highways providing access to job centers.
The number of non-Hispanic white people living in the state fell by more than 300,000, to about 5.2 million, dropping from 66 percent of the population to 59.3 percent. The shift was even more pronounced among whites under 18, who by 2010 were just 51.6 percent of the state's children.
''Those are pretty astounding changes,'' said Tim Evans, research director at New Jersey Future, a research group. ''It's another sign that New Jersey is on a similar path to California, in terms of becoming majority-minority.''
The Asian population jumped 51 percent, to more than 700,000, or 8.2 percent of the total, while the number of Hispanics climbed 39 percent, to more than 1.5 million, or 17.7 percent. The black population changed little, at 1.1 million, or 12.8 percent.
The ethnic shifts could presage altered economic and political patterns, though financial and voting power can lag decades behind a rise in raw numbers.
In the United States House of Representatives, New Jersey has seven Democrats, representing mostly terrain in the northeast corner of the state, and six Republicans. But the state will lose one seat based on the census.
The census shows heavily Democratic and minority areas losing sway as the state embarks on the once-a-decade task of redrawing district lines for the Legislature and Congress, based on the numbers released on Thursday. Even before the figures were published, Republicans had high hopes of making gains in that process.
But the census also shows traditionally Republican and swing areas becoming more ethnically diverse, with fast-rising numbers of Hispanics, Asians and blacks. In Sussex and Warren Counties, in the northwest corner of the state, the minority population, while still small, nearly doubled.
''A lot of what we're seeing is the continuing suburbanization of New Jersey, including significant minority suburbanization,'' Mr. Hughes said.
One indicator of that suburbanization is that towns that had 20,000 to 50,000 people in 2000 had the fastest growth rate, 6.4 percent. Those with over 75,000 grew just 1.5 percent.
Asian population growth was heaviest in suburban Middlesex County, particularly in Edison, Piscataway, Woodbridge and East Brunswick. The number of Asians in the county jumped more than 50 percent, and by 2010 accounted for 21.3 percent of the population. In Edison, Asians reached 43.1 percent of the population, surpassing whites as the largest group.
In places that were already majority Hispanic in 2000, like Perth Amboy, Passaic, North Bergen and Paterson, their predominance increased markedly. Hispanics became a majority in Elizabeth and nearly did in New Brunswick; they overtook blacks as the largest group in Camden; and they passed whites as the largest group in Hackensack.

HEADLINE: Fire Department to Replace New Gloves After Six Suffer Hand Burns

BYLINE: By AL BAKER; Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The New York City Fire Department has determined that its new fire-retardant gloves have a critical flaw: they do not adequately protect firefighters from burns.
Since November, six firefighters have suffered second-degree burns on the backs of their hands fighting four house fires around the city, fire officials said. All were wearing the new Blaze Fighter model of gloves; in each instance, the gloves themselves were not damaged.
The department is quickly moving to replace the gloves, made by the Glove Corp. They are now being worn by 6,500 firefighters in the 11,500-member force, at a total cost of about $850,000. 
The first sign of trouble came on Nov. 14, when three men on a hose line at a house fire in Brooklyn suffered second-degree burns to the backs of their hands.
''The largest is the size of a quarter,'' said James Long, a Fire Department spokesman. ''It was blisters on the back of the hands, and on the fingers.''
Three days later, a firefighter on a Brooklyn rooftop was burned in a similar fashion. On Dec. 25, a fifth firefighter suffered the same burns; on Jan. 23, a sixth, in the Bronx, was burned.
The department bought the gloves in September, after a successful trial run. Officials at the time hailed them for their state-of-the-art design and tapered fit; they met National Fire Protection Association standards.
But after the series of injuries, officials from the department's safety command began an inquiry, using an ''independent, outside expert'' to determine if the physical make-up of the gloves had been a factor, Chief of Department Edward S. Kilduff said.
The analysis revealed that the manufacturer had changed one of the materials used in the gloves. The change from a cotton fiber to a polyester blend made the gloves noncompliant with the national safety standards, Chief Kilduff said.
The Glove Corp put out an advisory last month noting that the Blaze Fighter model had ''encountered issues with the performance of the conductive heat resistance test,'' adding that the company had received ''reported cases of back of hand burns with a few pairs of this glove model.''
This is not the first time the Fire Department has grappled with issues of equipment -- or the lack of it.
A controversy erupted in 2005 when two firefighters, working without personal safety ropes, were killed when they jumped from a burning apartment in the Bronx to escape flames.
After the events of 9/11, failures in radio equipment -- including a device meant to increase the signal of hand-held radios so it could reach the trade center's high floors -- were cited as having possibly led to unnecessary deaths. Communications on Sept. 11 were also hampered as firefighters were using old, analog radios instead of new digital ones, and as police and fire radios operated on different frequencies.
''Their history with equipment has been really mixed over the years,'' said Glenn P. Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''The F.D.N.Y. has been a leader in development of new equipment around the nation; with air packs and hose lines and the Halligan tool. On the flip side, they have also been, in some cases, slow to respond.''
The Fire Department decided in 2009 to phase out the gloves that it had used for a decade. The Blaze Fighter model was chosen, mostly because firefighters liked them during a test phase. A Fire Department press release last year offered an endorsement from Firefighter Aaron Buch, of Rescue Company 1, who described being able to feel his ''call button'' through his glove to issue a Mayday after falling through a floor at a fire in Chinatown.
The Fire Department has referred the matter to the city's Law Department, said Gail Rubin, the chief of the city Law Department's affirmative litigation division.
The Glove Corp's Web site does not list any of its clients, and telephone calls to its general manager were not returned. A woman who answered the phone said the company had closed as of Jan. 31, though she could provide no details. The closing of the company could complicate the city's efforts to recoup costs.
But possible legal or economic battles, aside, Chief Kilduff said, ''The most important part of it, in our mind, is we need to get these gloves replaced as soon as possible.''
The department has put its unions on notice about the problems and on Thursday evening sent a ''department order'' to every firehouse letting rank and file members know of the plans to get other gloves in place, soon.
''We understand we have to act as quickly as possible,'' Chief Kilduff said. ''One injury is one too many.''

Corporate directors in America may be getting a J. Crew makeover of sorts. The anger J. Crew elicited from investors in handling its buyout is causing a stir at other companies in private equity buyers' sights. It probably explains the decision by the academic-heavy board of BJ's Wholesale Club to kick off an auction after six months of deer-in-the-headlights inaction. It's a good sign for shareholder rights.
By hiring Morgan Stanley to explore options on Thursday, BJ's is saying no to the kind of closed-door, sweetheart deal that J. Crew's chief, Millard Drexler, engineered for himself and his private equity backers, TPG and Leonard Green & Partners. It's no secret that Leonard Green has been itching to take BJ's, the $2.7 billion club retailer that toils away in the shadows of Costco and Wal-Mart, private for months. 
Yet with its light debt and solid cash flow, BJ's may attract serious bidders other than Leonard Green, whose previous retail investments have included Petco, Rite Aid and Neiman Marcus. More important, by throwing the doors open to all, the board is more likely to get the best price possible for shareholders.
By contrast, Mr. Drexler danced with his buyout buddies for weeks before bothering to inform the board, which then blessed the $3 billion buyout without conducting an auction. This week, J. Crew's settlement with disgruntled shareholders fell apart amid accusations that the company made a sham of the extended go-shop exercise that was supposed to turn up alternatives to the joint bid by TPG, Leonard Green and Mr. Drexler.
BJ's board certainly looks to have dawdled since Leonard Green took a 10 percent stake in the company in July and said it would approach management to buy the rest. But if the shenanigans at J. Crew led BJ's board to spring into action, however belatedly, then no harm may have been caused by the delay.
With a little luck, it may even allow for the three academics out of seven independent directors on the BJ's board -- including the dean of Dartmouth College's Tuck business school, the president of Babson College and a finance professor at Boston College -- to avoid becoming corporate government case studies for their own students.
Next Egyptian Crisis
Egypt's financial system faces a moment of truth. The country didn't have an economic crisis before the last 10 days of protests began. But its banks and stock exchange have been closed for a week. When they reopen, the fear is that the political turmoil could prompt a financial crisis.
The central bank is due to reopen on Sunday, while stock market trading will resume the next day, though that could be delayed if violent clashes continue. So far, markets across the Middle East have largely ignored the unrest. Yet before the Egyptian market closed, there were signs that investors were fleeing.
An exodus of foreign investors would probably be manageable. The central bank says its official reserves are $36 billion. Additional assets held with commercial banks -- regarded as unofficial reserves -- are estimated at around $20 billion. Before the crisis, foreigners held just 7 percent of Egypt's total public debt, equivalent to a little over $11 billion.
The bigger worry is if Egyptians also become frightened. The rich could decide to shift their money into gold, dollars or overseas markets. The poor, many of whom are relatively new to banking, may choose to stash their life savings under mattresses instead.
Egypt's banks could probably cope with a short-term run. Lenders are well financed with loan-to-deposit ratios of around 50 percent. More than half the country's 38 banks are owned by foreign groups, which are likely to back their subsidiaries. Public sector banks, which account for about half the market, benefit from full government support.
However, banks are the main buyers of government bonds. So sustained bank trouble would make it harder for the Egyptian government, already running a deficit, to borrow or refinance debt as it comes due. A declining currency, one possible consequence of turmoil, could fuel inflation.
Any prolonged unrest will, therefore, force Egypt to make more tough choices. Propping up its banks and currency could quickly drain the central bank's reserves. But keeping banks and the stock exchange closed could further erode confidence. Capital controls and withdrawal limits at banks may be the least bad of several unattractive options.

HEADLINE: Crops Wither And Prices Rise As China Deals With Drought

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- A severe drought in northern China has badly damaged the winter wheat crop and left the ground very dry for the spring planting, fueling inflation and alarming China's leaders.
President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao separately toured drought-stricken regions this week and have called for ''all-out efforts'' to address the effects of water shortages on agriculture, state media reported on Thursday. Mr. Wen made a similar trip just 10 days ago and called for long-term improvements in water management.
Rising food prices were a problem last autumn, even before the drought began, prompting the government to impose a wide range of price controls in mid-November. The winter wheat crop has been parched since then in northern China while unusually widespread frost has hurt the vegetable crop in southern China. State media began warning a week ago that price controls on food might not be effective. 
Some of the driest areas are close to Beijing, which has had no appreciable precipitation since Oct. 23, although there were brief snow flurries on Dec. 29. If the drought lasts 11 more days it will match one in the winter of 1970-71 as the longest since modern recordkeeping started in 1951, according to government meteorologists quoted by state media.
Particularly hard hit have been Hebei Province, which is next to Beijing and which Mr. Hu visited from Tuesday to Thursday, and southern Shandong Province to the east, which Mr. Wen visited on Wednesday and Thursday. The dirt in farmers' fields has become bone dry and is easily lifted by breezes, coating trees and houses in fine dust.
Food prices have been rising around the world, a result of weather problems in many countries, like the unusual heat wave in Russia last summer. High food prices have been among the many reasons for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.
But even a prolonged drought in China appears highly unlikely to cause acute food shortages. China has spent years accumulating very large government reserves of grain and also has $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, giving it virtually unlimited ability to import food as long as major grain producers do not limit exports.
When commodity prices last surged in 2007 and 2008, however, at least 29 countries sharply curbed food exports in attempts to prevent domestic food prices from rising as quickly as world prices. And if China does become a large importer of wheat -- it imports a lot of soybeans but tries to be essentially self-sufficient in rice and other grains for national security reasons -- then it could push up world prices and make it harder for poor countries to afford food imports.
Gary Blumenthal, chief executive of World Perspectives, a Washington-based agriculture trade consulting company, noted that wheat was grown in many countries and said that Chinese purchases would not necessarily result in a sustained jump in already high world prices. ''The wheat market can restore any imbalances more readily than perhaps other grains,'' he said.
China's wheat imports have risen to 893,700 metric tons in 2009 and 1.2 million metric tons last year from just 31,900 metric tons in 2008, according to figures from Global Trade Information Services, a data company in Columbia, S.C.
But those totals are small compared with global output that according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reached 682 million metric tons in 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available. China accounted for one-sixth of global wheat production that year, which could make a broad failure of the Chinese crop hard to replace immediately.
Higher food and energy prices are spreading to other parts of China's economy, contributing to broader inflation. Prices rose 4.6 percent last year, according to the consumer price index, but Chinese and Western economists say that the index understates the true extent of inflation because of methodology problems. The National Bureau of Statistics has said that it is trying to improve the index.
The government has cushioned the effects of rising food prices by encouraging provinces and cities to sharply raise the minimum wage, which has been climbing 18 percent a year in Guangdong Province, in southern China.
Accelerating inflation in China is starting to show up in the prices that American companies pay for imports from China. After years of showing little change, a United States Bureau of Labor Statistics index of average import prices suddenly jumped 0.3 percent from September to October, then jumped the same amount in November and again in December.
As many Chinese exporters demand double-digit percentage increases for the renewal of contracts this year, American buyers have delayed signing contracts, producing a hiccup in trans-Pacific trade. Shipping lines are discounting rates and canceling some sailings this spring while waiting for exporters and buyers to reach deals.
But imports from China are equal to only 2 percent of American economic output, so most economists expect inflation in China to have a limited effect on broad price indices in the United States.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopefuls Leave Egypt Crisis To the President

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A parade of prospective Republican presidential candidates has been visiting the Middle East in recent months, making pilgrimages that are the first steps in a methodical process of building credibility in foreign policy.
But as the crisis in Egypt has intensified this week, elevating foreign affairs above domestic political skirmishes, the potential Republican candidates and the party's leaders in Congress have, with only a few exceptions, had little to say.
As a result, President Obama has had the moment practically all to himself -- for better or worse -- as he gingerly proceeds without a sustained counterargument on a matter that could reshape United States foreign policy for years. 
The lack of debate underscores the relative absence of muscular Republican voices on foreign affairs in general, a sharp contrast to the way things were four years ago, when President George W. Bush's Iraq policy was a flashpoint between the two parties at this point in the election cycle.
To some degree, the silence from Republicans reflects a lack of substantive differences, especially on Egypt. House Speaker John A. Boehner set the tone on Sunday, saying, ''Our administration so far has handled this tense situation pretty well.'' And in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said Tuesday, ''America ought to speak with one voice, and we have one president.''
Party elders have largely agreed. On Wednesday, James A. Baker, the former secretary of state, said of the Obama administration, ''They've been handling this Egyptian crisis quite well, frankly.''
The delicate nature of the situation in Egypt, where events have moved fast and turned violent in the past week, helps explain the measured Republican response.
But the crisis has illustrated a broader pattern in which Republicans have been strikingly unwilling or unable to draw sharp contrasts with the administration on foreign policy -- including Iraq and Afghanistan -- and have instead taken aim mainly at Mr. Obama's domestic agenda.
While it is hardly rare for opposition candidates to have limited foreign policy experience -- take, for example, Senator Barack Obama as he started his candidacy four years ago -- the president's Republican rivals so far do not even have a high-profile issue, as Mr. Obama did with Iraq, on which they can offer national security policies and values that contrast with those of the White House.
The escalating crisis in Egypt has attracted fresh attention to foreign policy at the very time that prospective Republican contenders are trying to establish their credentials as prospective commanders in chief. Gone are the days when the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire were the only obligatory stops on the campaign trail. Particularly for candidates who want to appeal to evangelical voters, Israel, Jordan and other points across the Middle East are now important stops as well.
Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, completed his 15th visit to Israel this week. Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi is set to leave on Saturday for a trip to Israel that is scheduled to include a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, made a similar visit last month, and Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, has led a trade delegation to Israel.
While most of these potential Republican contenders have offered mild criticism of how the United States has handled the Egypt crisis, particularly Mr. Obama's delay in distancing himself from President Hosni Mubarak, the tenor of the remarks has been muted in comparison with the Republican reaction to the administration's health care law or economic policy.
In a policy sense, Republicans, like Democrats, are walking a fine line between support of a quick transition to a new government in Egypt and the concern, felt especially keenly in Israel, that the removal of Mr. Mubarak could lead to instability and the possible rise of an Islamist government.
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, who seldom goes more than a few days without criticizing the administration, has been silent about the turmoil in Egypt.
Nor have the sounds of disagreement been heard on Capitol Hill, where Republican advisers urge party members to keep dissent to a minimum and continue to focus on domestic issues like health care, government spending and jobs.
Instead, most of the alternative foreign policy views to those of the administration have come by way of the Fox News Channel, where several potential Republican contenders also serve as paid analysts. (Mr. Huckabee assumed the role of a roving pundit for Fox, filing on-the-scene dispatches from Israel, saying the credibility of the United States was quickly eroding.)
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who is considering a presidential bid, has been among the most critical voices.
''I don't think they have a clue,'' Mr. Gingrich said of the White House's stance toward the Mubarak government in an interview on Fox News this week with Greta Van Susteren. ''It's very frightening to watch this administration.''
Bob Kasten, a former Republican senator from Wisconsin who has traveled extensively in Egypt and was scheduled to be there this week in his role as a trustee at American University in Cairo, said that strong Republican voices had been lacking in the Egypt discussion.
An effort to show unity, he said, may have sent the impression that Republicans think the president has handled the situation flawlessly.
''The major issues of the day among most Americans are the economic issues, and the Republican Congress wants to keep the focus on those issues, but foreign policy is so important,'' said Mr. Kasten, who served on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
''The administration and the president are trying to be too cute and trying to have it all ways,'' he said. ''They are going to end up with all sides being disappointed with them.''

HEADLINE: Steel Giants Nippon and Sumitomo in Talks on Merger

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
Two of Japan's largest steel makers said on Thursday that they were in talks to merge, a move that would form the world's second-largest producer of steel after ArcelorMittal.
Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steel producer, and Sumitomo Metal Industries, the country's third largest, are in talks to merge by October 2012, the two companies said in a statement. At their closing stock prices Thursday, they would have a combined market capitalization of 2.88 trillion yen, $35 billion, compared to $57 billion for ArcelorMittal.
A merger would help create economies of scale, enabling the companies to cut costs and ease the effect of rising prices for raw materials and a strong yen, which have weighed on their overseas earnings. 
Japanese steel makers are also looking to expand overseas, motivated particularly by sluggish demand at home. Though the Japanese economy is likely to rebound in the first quarter after a slight contraction in the last three months of 2010, activity remains lackluster compared with that of its fast-growing Asian neighbors. By some measures, China overtook Japan last year as the world's second-largest economy behind that of the United States.
''Global competition in the steel industry is growing more intense, at a more rapid rate and to a greater extent than expected,'' Shoji Muneoka, representative director and president of Nippon Steel, said in a statement. The Japanese steel industry, meanwhile, ''is confronted with drastic changes, such as stagnation of domestic demand, inflation of cost of resources and the strengthening of the Japanese yen,'' he said.
By uniting, the two companies hope to ''dramatically develop business in the global market'' and ''strengthen the competitiveness of both companies,'' Mr. Muneoka said.
Several big deals have occurred in the last decade, including the merger in 2006 of Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, and Mittal Steel of India. At the time, the Arcelor deal was valued at 26.8 billion euros ($36.9 billion at today's exchange rates). In Japan, Kawasaki Steel and NKK merged in 2002 to form JFE Steel, now the world's fifth-biggest steel producer.
It was not immediately clear whether the merger of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal would face regulatory difficulties. But the Japanese trade minister, Banri Kaieda, said on Thursday that he supported the deal.
''The merger aims to strengthen global competitiveness by reorganizing competition, as global competition heats up in the steel industry,'' he said. ''I value such a move highly.''
World steel production is surging, driven by strong economic growth in emerging markets like China. Global crude steel production hit a record 1.4 billion tons in 2010, an increase of 15 percent from the previous year, according to the World Steel Association.
The recent floods in Australia have contributed to rising costs of production by disrupting exports of coking coal, which is used to make steel. The disruptions have driven coking coal spot prices up by about 15 percent, to as much as $290 a ton.
Speaking at a conference on commodities in Geneva this week, Pascal Lamy, director of the World Trade Organization, warned of rising prices for crucial commodities through this year, a result of a rebound in the global economy.
ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg, was the world's top steel maker in 2009, producing 77.5 million tons, according to the steel association. Nippon Steel ranked fourth, after Baoshan Iron & Steel of China and Posco of South Korea, while Sumitomo Metal Industries ranked 19th.
Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal already hold minority stakes in each other and supply each other with partly finished products. They plan to set up a committee to develop a merger agreement by April 2012, and hope to merge the next October after gaining shareholder approval, Nippon Steel said in a statement. The companies have yet to decide on a merger ratio.
Japan is the world's second-biggest steel producer after China. Japan produced 109.6 million tons of crude steel in 2010, 25.2 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the World Steel Association. Meanwhile, China's crude steel production reached 626.7 million tons in 2010, an annual increase of 9.3 percent.
Nippon Steel booked revenue of 3.5 trillion yen ($43 billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2010, while Sumitomo Metal had revenue of 1.3 trillion yen in the same period.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pakistanis See Seeds of Revolt And Fear Strife at Home

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Protests over crippling prices and corrupt leadership are sweeping much of the Islamic world, but here in Pakistan this week, the government blithely dismissed any threat to its longevity or to the country's stability.
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani insisted that Pakistan was not Egypt or Tunisia. ''Our institutions are working and democracy is functional,'' he said. The economy, while under pressure, is not in crisis.
But while Mr. Gilani appeared unruffled, diplomats, analysts and other Pakistani officials admitted to unease, and conceded that Pakistan contained many of the same ingredients for revolt found in the Middle East -- and then some: an economy hollowed out by bad management and official corruption; rising Islamic religious fervor; and a poisonous resentment of the United States, Pakistan's biggest financial supporter.
If no one expects Pakistan to be swept by revolution this week, the big question on many minds is how, and when, a critical mass of despair among this nation's 180 million people and the unifying Islamist ideology might be converted into collective action. 
Some diplomats and analysts compare the combustible mixture of religious ideology and economic frustration, overlaid with the distaste for America, to Iran in 1979. Only one thing is missing: a leader.
''What's lacking is a person or institution to link the economic aspirations of the lower class with the psychological frustration of the committed Islamists,'' a Western diplomat said this week. ''Our assessment is: this is like Tehran, 1979.''
Mr. Gilani is right in that Pakistan held fairly free elections three years ago, when the democratically based Pakistan Peoples Party, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, won.
But the return to civilian government after a decade of military rule has meant little to the people because politicians have done nothing for voters, said Farrukh Saleem, a risk analyst and columnist in The News, a daily newspaper.
As it has been for all of Pakistan's more than 60 years of history, Parliament today remains dominated by the families of a favored few, who use their perch to maintain a corrupt patronage system and to protect their own interests as Pakistan's landed and industrial class. The government takes in little in taxes, and as a result provides little in the way of services to its people.
''Ninety-nine percent of Pakistanis are not affected by the state -- it doesn't deliver anything for them,'' Mr. Saleem said. ''People are looking for alternatives. So were the Iranians in 1979.''
There is little question that the images from Egypt and Tunisia are reverberating through Pakistani society, and encouraging workers to speak up and vent frustration in ways that were unusual even three months ago.
''There's no electricity, no gas, no clean water,'' said Ali Ahmad, a hotel worker in Lahore who is usually a model of discretion. ''I think if things stay the same, people will come out and destroy everything.''
When a young banker in a prestigious job at a foreign bank was asked if Pakistan could go the way of Egypt, he replied, ''I hope so.''
At the core of Pakistan's problem are the wretched economic conditions of day-to-day life for most of the people whose lives are gouged by inflation, fuel shortages and scarcity of work.
They see the rich getting richer, including ''the sons of rich, corrupt politicians and their compatriots openly buying Rolls-Royces with their black American Express cards,'' said Jahangir Tareen, a reformist politician and successful agricultural businessman.
Food inflation totaled 64 percent in the last three years, according to Sakib Sherani, who resigned recently as the principal economic adviser at the Finance Ministry. The purchasing power of the average wage earner has declined by 20 percent since 2008, he said.
Families are taking children out of school because they cannot afford both fees and food. Others choose between medicine and dinner.
A middle-class customer in a pharmacy in Rawalpindi, the city where the powerful army has its headquarters, told the pharmacist last week to sell him only two pills of a course of 10 antibiotics because he did not have enough money for groceries.
The most popular fuel for home cooking, gas, has been severely rationed this winter. Gas supplies to power textile mills in Faisalabad were suspended this week, leaving about 400,000 workers without their daily wages, said Abdul Qayyum, a textile union official.
At the same time, joblessness has soared. The true unemployment rate was 34 percent, meaning 18 million people, mostly young, were officially seeking jobs in Pakistan, Mr. Sherani said.
Many of these jobless young men are products of religious schools, known as madrasas, run by radical clerics who favor Islamist teachings and an anti-Western creed. For the last 15 years, according to a government estimate, two million young men have passed through them, many then scooped up by the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other militant groups.
The breadth of hard-line Islamist belief was exposed last month when an elite police guard shot a senior politician, Salman Taseer, for his opposition to the nation's blasphemy laws.
The security guard, Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, has catapulted to the front row of contemporary Pakistani heroes and was hailed by lawyers, mainstream politicians and religious leaders. Rallies are being held on a weekly basis in his honor.
Well-to-do secular families who serve liquor in their big city homes nervously talk of their servants ''doing a Qadri,'' voicing a fear that the flotilla of help that is common among the privileged will turn on their patrons.
In a sign of the anxiety among politicians about the mood on the street, the government decided Monday not to raise gas prices as scheduled. In January, to stave off the collapse of its parliamentary majority, the government similarly canceled a 9 percent fuel increase.
In combination with the failure of members of Parliament to raise taxes on themselves, the steps have done little to heal Pakistan's budget woes. In a briefing to the members, the finance minister, Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, said the fiscal deficit would reach 8.5 percent of the gross domestic product by midyear, nearly double the target set by the International Monetary Fund.
But Pakistan has become the nuclear-armed version of ''too big to fail.'' It has been made easier for Mr. Zardari, Mr. Gilani and other politicians to balk at hard economic choices knowing that the I.M.F. and the United States -- which is now providing about $2 billion a year in assistance -- will continue to bail them out, analysts and diplomats say.
''The West looks at Pakistan with increasing horror but continues to insist that this is called the pain of evolving democracy,'' said Mr. Tareen, the politician and businessman.
But before democracy could take hold in Pakistan, the patronage system that passes for it will have totally plundered the country, he said.
Then, he said, the people, frustrated by the failure of representative democracy, will respond to the slogans calling for Islamic rule and the ouster of the United States. ''Those forces will sweep into power,'' Mr. Tareen said, ''and it will be as much of a surprise to us, the ruling elite, as the elite guard's murder of Salman Taseer last month.''

HEADLINE: Another Pitch for Investment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
President Obama on Thursday took his message of economic innovation and clean energy to Pennsylvania, a crucial electoral swing state.
In a speech at Pennsylvania State University in State College, he promised new tax incentives, government investment and revamped regulations for energy efficiency. He also toured laboratories where researchers are studying ways to make buildings more energy-efficient. 
The president's remarks, delivered to several thousand students in the university gymnasium, echoed the theme of his State of the Union address last month.
''These are places where the future will be won,'' Mr. Obama said. ''These are the places where the new jobs and the world's best businesses will take root.''
The president spent much of last year promoting the benefits of investment in clean-energy technologies. On Thursday, he vowed that new government investment would spur American innovation.
That message is at the center of a philosophical clash with Republicans on Capitol Hill, who deride Mr. Obama's use of the word ''investment'' as code for greater government spending in the face of a growing federal deficit.
''Talking about innovation is nice, but removing Washington barriers to innovation is what job creators are really looking for right now,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner.
Mr. Obama, who acknowledged that the tax credits he wanted would take money from the Treasury, received the most applause when he repeated his call for Congress to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies. ''They are doing just fine on their own,'' he said. ''It's time to stop subsidizing yesterday's energy. It's time to start investing in the future. That's what progress is.'' MICHAEL D. SHEAR

HEADLINE: Blighted Area? These Business Owners Beg to Differ

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Damon Bae's commercial laundry on Third Avenue in East Harlem may never be mistaken for the kind of glamorous businesses found near Wall Street, Times Square or Madison Avenue, but it is a thriving concern in this neighborhood of three- and four-story buildings and vacant lots.
The laundry, Fancy Cleaners, serves the five dry cleaning stores Mr. Bae owns in Manhattan, and the small retail dry-cleaning operation he opened inside the laundry has attracted customers from Harlem and beyond in the five years since he moved here from Murray Hill. 
''I didn't expect such a huge volume,'' Mr. Bae said. ''There aren't many residential buildings nearby. But you offer a good price, and people will find you. You should see the line on Saturdays. I've even got people coming from the Bronx.''
But Mr. Bae, and more than a half-dozen other small-business owners in this neighborhood bound by Second and Third Avenues, from 125th to 127th Streets, are waging an uphill fight to hold onto their property. The Bloomberg administration has so far moved successfully in the courts to condemn six acres on behalf of a big developer for a $700 million East Harlem Media, Entertainment and Cultural Center.
''I think that the city is going to take away our properties and businesses so they can make another developer with deeper pockets a lot of money,'' Mr. Bae said.
The city approved the project in 2008. It will include office and retail space, a small hotel, cultural space and 800 apartments, 600 of which will be set aside for low-, moderate- and middle-income families.
The first phase of the construction -- a 49-unit residential building at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Third Avenue -- is nearing completion.
Many of the business owners knew that a large stretch of the area was included in a 150-block urban renewal effort that was approved in 1968 but never quite materialized. But property owned by at least three of the businessmen was not included in the renewal zone, at least not until 2008, when the Bloomberg administration added those parcels to the mix.
At the time, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the creation of jobs and housing, and the city justified taking the private property by declaring the area ''blighted'' -- a description that Mr. Bae and the other business owners found galling.
The city owned most of the land, allowing it to sit fallow for decades while turning down Mr. Bae and other business owners who wanted to buy parcels to expand their operations.
''It's artificially manufactured blight,'' Mr. Bae said.
In a recent decision by a panel of judges at the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, Justice James M. Catterson agreed. He said the city's claim of blight and underutilization were ''nothing but a canard to aid in the transfer of private property to a developer.''
But he said he was forced to concur with the court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Mr. Bae and other property owners because recent rulings by the Court of Appeals had ''made plain that there is no longer any judicial oversight of eminent domain proceedings.''
The battle against eminent domain in East Harlem has received less attention than similar disputes at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, Willets Point in Queens and the Columbia University expansion in West Harlem. But in each case, longtime businesses were pushed out to make way for large developments.
Jacob Toledo, the owner of Cycle Therapy, runs the city's largest motorcycle dealership in a refurbished five-story building on East 127th Street. Rows of new and used Triumph, BMW, Honda and Yamaha motorcycles and scooters line the neat shop, while the smell of oil hangs in the air. Mr. Toledo says he may be forced to close his business permanently if the city takes his land.
Five years ago, he said, he crisscrossed the city looking for a new location after he was pushed out of a site on the West Side of Manhattan by new zoning and rising real estate values.
Only days after buying the orange-colored building in East Harlem, Mr. Toledo said he learned that the property might be condemned.
''I don't think we can find any place in the city that can fit my business,'' he said.
Evan Blum, another local businessman, is not part of the lawsuit to stop eminent domain on 125th Street, but he is very much opposed to it. This is his third encounter with eminent domain, he said.
''The city makes it so hard for the small businessman to exist,'' Mr. Blum said. ''I'm not politically connected. Small businesses can't make contributions to politicians. So the big guys always win.''
Mr. Blum owns the building housing Demolition Depot on the south side of 125th Street, between Second and Third Avenues. Celebrities, billionaires, restaurant owners and brownstone dwellers make their way to Demolition Depot for that must-have claw-footed bathtub, or for gargoyles, stone lions and chestnut doors.
However, a building he leases across 125th Street, stocked with four floors of marble, wood and stone fireplace mantles, is threatened by the condemnation effort.
Nearby, Gary Spindler, the owner of Uptown Auto Repair, also says he worries about the future of his business if the property is condemned. He bought the business in 1999, attracted to its location near the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, formerly known as the Triborough. ''I thought I was buying an opportunity to run our business and have the property appreciate in value,'' he said.
Proponents of the project argue that the property owners should have known that someday their property could be subject to eminent domain because it sat within the old urban development zone. But both Mr. Spindler and Mr. Bae said title records indicated that their properties were not part of that plan when they bought them.
''Our properties were carved out of the urban renewal plan,'' Mr. Bae said.
The business owners say they remain in limbo while the court case plays out.
''Now I don't know if I'll be here next year,'' Mr. Bae said. ''I'm afraid to make an investment in my business.''

HEADLINE: A Fresh Face for an Area Where Finance Once Ruled

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Next year, Fidelity Investments will move from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City.
Deloitte & Touche, the auditing and financial advisory firm, is also leaving the area, for Rockefeller Center, while a neighbor, the Japanese bank Nomura, appears headed to Midtown.
The loss of additional companies from the city's historic financial district and the surrounding blocks has in the past led to hand-wringing by planners, politicians and landlords about the dubious future of Lower Manhattan. 
But this time, the news has been greeted with as many yawns as laments.
Finance still dominates the neighborhood, but Lower Manhattan has changed remarkably over the past 10 years. The residential population has more than doubled since Sept. 11, and the number of hotels has tripled to 18. More important, there are a growing number of law firms, tech companies and nonprofit organizations moving into the district.
Among the 60 media firms that now, or soon will, call Lower Manhattan their home are Newsweek, which recently merged with The Daily Beast; The Daily News and American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer, Playboy and other titles. Conde Nast Publications is negotiating a 1 million-square-foot lease at 1 World Trade Center, the skyscraper under construction at ground zero. And the number of tourists continues to swell.
''You never want anyone to leave,'' said Elizabeth H. Berger, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''But the real story is that while financial services remains our signature industry, Lower Manhattan has diversified. The bottom line is we're a very attractive place for a lot of different kinds of commercial tenants.''
More than 40 percent of residents walk to work, Ms. Berger said.
The Federal Reserve Bank is still in Lower Manhattan, as is Deutsche Bank. Goldman Sachs recently built a new headquarters for thousands of employees. Oppenheimer Funds, Dow Jones and Commerzbank, whose leases expire soon, are expected to remain in Lower Manhattan. Morgan Stanley, whose headquarters is in Times Square, is looking for more space there.
Still, the very institutions that symbolize the citadel of capitalism are moving or changing in ways that will continue to transform the old financial district. With an ever-increasing percentage of trading conducted electronically at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Commodities Exchange, financial firms no longer feel that being located near those institutions is necessary.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved to the Empire State Building from Lower Manhattan last year, and next year, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which clears and trades securities for many brokerages and banks, will move the bulk of its operations and 1,400 employees to Jersey City.
Both American International Group and Merrill Lynch, once among the largest employers in the area, are shrinking. So the loss of Deloitte, and possibly Nomura, is a blow to Lower Manhattan, some real estate executives say, especially with at least two skyscrapers being built at ground zero.
''The situation with Nomura and Deloitte isn't the end of the world,'' said Peter G. Riguardi, president of New York operations for Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate broker. ''But it's disappointing, a setback.''
Since the 1960s, financial firms have been moving from the area to more modern buildings in Midtown, where they could be closer to clients and to the homes of their workers. Concerned about costs, banks began shifting their data operations to the office towers sprouting on the Jersey City waterfront 20 years ago. Fidelity, like its rivals Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, also moved there to reduce costs.
But for many city officials, landlords and real estate executives, the idea that Deloitte and Nomura would remain in the financial district was a foregone conclusion.
Last August, the Bloomberg administration agreed to provide Deloitte with up to $21 million in tax breaks to expand its payroll, with the understanding that it would enlarge its presence at the World Financial Center. It would take as much as 630,000 square feet as it moved its world and United States headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan.
But in December, Deloitte began to focus on Rockefeller Center, which offered more prestigious, but older and presumably more expensive office space in Midtown. Real estate executives familiar with the negotiations said that many Deloitte partners preferred being in Midtown, closer to their competitors and to Grand Central Terminal. Since the deal is not yet finalized, no one involved is willing to discuss it. But city officials told Deloitte that they would be far less generous with tax incentives if the company left the financial district.
Real estate brokers said that Deloitte's move to Rockefeller Center would be dependent, in part, on the law firm Chadbourne & Parke's vacating its offices there. The brokers said that the law firm is talking to Boston Properties, which was hoping to build a new billion-dollar office tower at Eighth Avenue and 55th Street.
Nomura had also nearly renewed its lease at the World Financial Center when the bank opened talks with the owner of Worldwide Plaza, an office tower on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Nomura's current landlord, Brookfield Office Properties, is still battling to keep the bank downtown.
''Downtown's success cannot come just from financial services,'' Mr. Riguardi said.
The loss of both Deloitte and Nomura, more than 1 million square feet combined, would increase Lower Manhattan's already rising vacancy rate. But officials contend that the neighborhood, where rents are about 30 percent lower than in Midtown, will be increasingly attractive.
Also, the city's two newest and most technologically advanced skyscrapers are expected to open in 2013 at ground zero. Conde Nast, which was negotiating to bring its stable of chic magazines to the first tower, would draw an increasing range of companies to the area, brokers said.
Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that financial services must remain an important part of that area's economy. But, he added, ''We're encouraged, though, by the complementary evolution that has been taking place in the area, evidenced by the explosive growth of its residential population and the arrival of new and growing industries.''

HEADLINE: The Impresario

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
DALLAS -- The most visible owner in Super Bowl history held his own news conference Tuesday. He talked, as only Jerry Jones can talk, for 75 minutes.
Yet neither Jones nor his Dallas Cowboys will affect the game Sunday. Instead, Jones slipped comfortably into his designated role as the emperor of excess, the omnipresent host who built football's grandest stadium. He is the rare owner who adds to the spectacle of the Super Bowl, who has boasted of his desire to break the game's attendance record.
Jones, 68, embodies what the Super Bowl has become, with his $1.2 billion Cowboys Stadium, his massive video board, his go-go dancers, his parties, everything exaggerated and indulgent. He stood in stark contrast to the blue-collar participants, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers.
''The stadium, the entrances, the glass, the doors, the roof, the arches, the artwork -- it's very much like a beautiful woman,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It has curves in all the right places.'' 
The bombastic Jones took a bow this week. Nothing could dim his optimism. Not the absence of his Cowboys, whose season ended in disappointment; not the ice and snow storms that shut down schools and transportation; not the cloud of labor uncertainty that hung over the proceedings.
Jones learned showmanship from his father, Pat. Pat Jones went to work in the grocery business wearing white suits and giant cowboy hats; he even built a bandstand in the center of one store and held amateur nights that were broadcast on live radio.
His son banked billions from the oil business and bought the Cowboys for $160 million in 1989. He famously promised to oversee every aspect of his team, from ''socks to jocks.'' He later made cameos on the HBO series ''Entourage'' and irked other owners with his outsize personality.
Jones developed a reputation as a meddler. He fired the beloved coach Tom Landry and clashed with Jimmy Johnson, Landry's replacement, eventually parting with him, too. Although Jones's franchise won three Super Bowls to stake its claim as the best team of the 1990s, the last was in 1996, and the Cowboys have since won one playoff game.
This season, Jones insisted, would be different. His Cowboys would be the first team to play essentially a home game in the Super Bowl. Instead, Dallas, with the league's most expensive payroll, started 1-7, fired Coach Wade Phillips and finished 6-10. Jones said the Cowboys had been too full of themselves, starting at the top, but he found his role as host eased some of the sting.
In 2010, Forbes listed his team's worth at $1.81 billion, the single most valuable American professional sports team. His stadium, a monument to football, Texas and extravagance, is nicknamed Jerry's World, and this, Super Bowl XLV, is Jerry's Week.
''Clearly, he loves all this,'' Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, said. ''His personality is perfect for it.''
Before Mark Cuban bought the Dallas Mavericks, he watched Jones, studying his relentless sales pitch. When Cuban interviewed with the N.B.A.'s board of governors, Dave Checketts asked if ''I would be like the other owner in Dallas, and not in a positive light,'' Cuban wrote in an e-mail. His answer: absolutely.
To Cuban, Jones resembled Blake from ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' the character who says: ''A-B-C. A always, B be, C closing. Always be closing!''
Love him, hate him, Jones never stops closing. He sold the Cowboys to America. He sold the stadium to Arlington. He sold Dallas to the Super Bowl committee. He even tried to sell the weather here because he insisted -- cough, cough -- it set low expectations for the weekend.
Gil Brandt, an analyst for Sirius N.F.L. radio, worked for the Cowboys from 1960 to 1989. He attended 42 of the previous 44 Super Bowls, and said he could not recall another owner who had stepped this boldly into the spotlight. Perhaps Carroll Rosenbloom (Baltimore Colts, Los Angeles Rams) came closest. But Jones also fits into a larger evolution, an ownership example of the change in the N.F.L.'s scope. At the first Super Bowl, Brandt said, the Kansas City Chiefs' owner, Lamar Hunt, walked around unrecognized.
''For decades, owners were in the family business,'' said Randy Cross, a former player who is an N.F.L. analyst for CBS Sports. ''You had guys that were stoic, head-of-the-family types, the Rooneys, the Maras, right down the list. Now, in this multibillion-dollar business, you have multibillion-dollar businessmen. You have Jerry Jones.''
He helped drag the N.F.L. into this modern era. He increased marketing, pushed merchandise, built more stores, put them at local airports. He added stadium suites. He signed a contract with Pepsi in defiance of the league. He pushed for the current television contract, which enriched all teams.
Still, some find Jones obnoxious, too visible, too public. He never cared about that. Every step was taken, he said, ''with the Super Bowl in mind.'' If people found him over the top, well, he intended to create that impression.
His stadium serves as a reminder of what Jones stands for. In his original pitch to Dr. Robert Cluck, the mayor of Arlington, Jones estimated the cost at $625 million. Cluck said he figured ''it would be much bigger and more expensive,'' this being Jones and all, and Cluck immediately said the city would take responsibility for half.
The result is Cowboys Stadium, the giant gray spaceship that lords over the landscape in Arlington.
Jones enlisted the Cowboys legend Roger Staubach as the face of his Super Bowl bid in 2006, with a promise to construct the ''finest stadium in the world.'' Jones focused on the in-stadium experience. The video board, seven stories high and nearly 60 yards long, became the centerpiece of that effort. The idea came to Jones while watching Celine Dion perform in Las Vegas. He was fixated on the video screen that displayed the details in her pupils, and he turned to his wife and said, ''Football can be viewed that way, too.''
During construction, Jones managed the minutiae. He called the original renditions of the video board ''dinky,'' said they looked ''like a little postage stamp.'' When the economic downturn hit, confidants expected Jones to scale back, but he went bigger, grander, more opulent.
(The only thing Jones did not plan for was poor weather, with seven people being injured Friday by falling slabs of ice from the roof.)
The stadium, Brandt said, ''will never, ever, ever be duplicated.''
Before Jones owned the Cowboys, he attended more than a dozen Super Bowls. He took some 100 people from his oil business each time, as a gift. He wanted to become more involved with football, so naturally he bought a team.
Except for the absence of his Cowboys, this game and this week represented the culmination, the best possible situation. Jones was ubiquitous. He took questions at his news conference, his white hair combed just so, his suit pressed, his teeth beaming white.
Jones gave custom saddles to each player and provided Martha Stewart a stadium tour. Last week, Cowboys Stadium received thousands of mentions by more than 5,000 reporters here, while Jones sold his message -- that Dallas deserved a place in the Super Bowl rotation, that Texas is steeped in football history and Southern charm -- in the way only he can.
''You wouldn't see a lot of owners put themselves that out there,'' Staubach said. ''They wouldn't want to be that visible. But Jerry does. And Jerry is.''
As Jones dressed Thursday, he said, he was overwhelmed with reflective thoughts. He recalled the way his father chastised him for taking on too many tasks and how proud Daddy would have been now. He thought about the stadium, the politics, the economic strife.
''I know that this event isn't bigger than life,'' Jones said. ''But I know that on Sunday, it will feel that way. It will feel like a triumph.''
Jones paused, silent, perhaps for the first time all week. The significance of the moment spoke for him.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XLV; Ice and Injuries Mar Super Bowl Events

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
DALLAS -- As a photographer scheduled to cover Sunday's Super Bowl, Win McNamee was walking outside Cowboys Stadium on Friday, shooting weather-related pictures. He heard what sounded like a jet engine overhead, and soon found himself in the middle of the story.
''I looked up and there were these huge, bowling-ball sized chunks of ice falling,'' McNamee said shortly after being released from a hospital with a shoulder broken in four places. 
Seven people at Cowboys Stadium, site of Super Bowl XLV, were injured when large slabs of ice slid from the roof and fell to the plaza below, according to the N.F.L. None of the injuries were life threatening, the league said, although one man was hospitalized with a head injury and was in stable condition.
The accident -- or accidents, because it was unclear whether all injuries were sustained from the same cascade of falling ice -- highlighted a week's worth of weather-related havoc that plagued the build-up to football's showcase event.
About five inches of snow fell Thursday night and Friday, three days after an ice storm brought much of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area skidding to a prolonged halt.
The unusual weather blasts surely took a bite out of the $611 million economic impact that the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Host Committee had estimated for the game.
At best, organizers and the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, the man who built the stadium and persuaded other N.F.L. owners to bring the Super Bowl to the Dallas area for the first time, faced a public-relations mess that they never anticipated.
McNamee had a few seconds to react, he said, but could not outrun the broad swath of falling ice. He ducked into a ball and covered his head.
''There were three or four seconds of chunks of ice hitting me,'' he said. ''I could tell right away that my left shoulder was messed up.''
McNamee, a Washington-based photographer for Getty Images, will return home Saturday and await word on surgery.
N.F.L. officials said Friday afternoon that the stadium roof would be cleared of snow in time for the game. All entrances were shuttered except for the dock tunnel, which was a safe distance from the falling ice. Hospitality tents outside the stadium sat with torn roofs, where ice and snow ripped through.
The frosty weather double-whammy of Super Bowl week does not appear to threaten Sunday's game between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, although the teams spent the week forced to practice indoors. The game will take place under the retractable roof of Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.
Hundreds of flights to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport were canceled this week, many of them on Friday. The area's secondary airport, Love Field, was closed Friday morning before resuming operations.
Roads, many still sheathed in ice from Tuesday's storm because temperatures remained below freezing, were also frosted with snow, a troublesome predicament for a spread-out metropolitan area ill-equipped to handle such blasts of winter. A burst pipe under one major street Friday shot water far into the air, geyser-like, adding to the calamitous scene.
Sports Illustrated's Peter King, who covers the N.F.L., conveyed the mood with a single Twitter post: ''I'm telling you: I-30 between Dallas + Fort Worth is a plow-less, snow-windswept moonscape. This is officially a debacle.''
It serves as a reminder of what might be expected in 2014 when the Super Bowl will be played at the roofless New Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey. The N.F.L. awarded the home of the Giants and the Jets the first-ever Super Bowl to be played outdoors at a cold-weather site amid criticism that an ill-timed storm could wreak havoc on the best-laid plans.
''I think you have to be prepared for everything,'' N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said during his annual state-of-the-league news conference Friday. ''North Texas was prepared if this happened. And certainly in New York, not only are they prepared, they're probably planning on this type of weather. I think the fact is, they're going to be prepared for this.''
Better weather is on the way to North Texas. Snow ended on Friday afternoon, and temperatures in the 40s are forecast for the weekend.
But the game is increasingly seen as a mere exclamation point on a celebratory week. Tourism officials, along with restaurants, retailers, golf course owners and party organizers, expected a big surge in business, especially with two of the N.F.L.'s most fervent fan bases eager to cheer their Packers and Steelers.
Instead, it has felt more like the Packers and Steelers packed their hometown winter weather and brought it with them. Streets and plazas are mostly empty as fans huddle in hotel lobbies. The Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, was expecting to play golf Saturday. There will be no such outdoor activities.
Tony Fay, spokesman for the North Texas host committee, said that hotels had not reported widespread cancellations and that no N.F.L.-related events had been canceled.
''While we have ice and snow, and it's not what we might have wanted, it's not debilitating,'' Fay said.
Still, it raised fears that North Texas may not be awarded a second Super Bowl anytime soon. Jones hopes to bring the 50th Super Bowl here, too.
''This is inordinate,'' Jones said during a news conference Wednesday. ''So I think all of that would be factored in. I do believe the attendance, the economics, this part of the United States, will be recognized.''
At Big D Party and Event Rental, the owner Pete Willis needed reinforcements for many of the red-carpet parties his company was to supply. He had 20 vertical, patio heaters in his warehouse, but sent a crew north to Oklahoma to find as many as they could at Home Depot, Lowe's and other stores. He now has 60 such heaters, to be deployed at parties around the area.
''We're trying to keep everyone warm down here,'' Willis said.

HEADLINE: When Formulas Alone Determine How New York State Spends Money

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The Sunrise Nursing Home and the Manor at Seneca Hill nursing home sit just a few miles from each other in Oswego County near the shores of Lake Ontario. They each have 120 beds and serve comparable patient populations.
Yet under state law, New York taxpayers will reimburse Seneca Hill about $62,681 this year for each Medicaid patient under its care, while Sunrise will get about $45,829, according to the State Department of Health. That is because each home was given its own base rate more than 20 years ago -- and under state law, the department cannot adjust those rates, no matter how much they reflect each home's current costs and services. The only budgeting decision that the governor and lawmakers typically make each year is whether to grant the homes an inflation adjustment upward. 
''The formula assumes that the costs will go up, without any rethinking of the base expenditures,'' said James Introne, the state's deputy secretary for health and the director of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's task force on reshaping health care. ''You don't go back to the base, or say, 'How could it be more efficient?' ''
Such rules, baked into government programs like education and health care and left virtually untouched every year, are at the heart of what Mr. Cuomo believes is a fundamental problem facing New York: spending that goes up inexorably with too little accountability for results.
And in what will most likely be a defining battle of his tenure, Mr. Cuomo aims not only to rein in spending this year, but also to permanently expand the authority of the executive branch to administer programs and drive down costs. ''Permanent law has built in rates and formulas that continually drive up this unsustainable spending,'' Mr. Cuomo argued on Tuesday when he unveiled a spending plan intended to close a $10 billion budget gap.
''If the economy was running great guns, this would not be an issue,'' he added, but, ''in a down economy, this is a death spiral.''
Examining these rates and formulas can be a frustrating exercise because they are complex, opaque and marbled through hundreds of different laws. And the rules are rarely amended. A new formula to reimburse nursing homes based on broad regional rates, for example, was supposed to go into effect two years ago, but has been delayed twice by the Legislature.
In some cases, programs can seem almost devised to grow without restraint. One example that particularly bothers Mr. Cuomo is home care, a Medicaid program under which the government pays for poor and elderly patients to receive basic medical care at home. Originally devised to be a cheaper alternative to nursing homes, home care has become the state's fastest growing health care program: from 2003 to 2009, spending on home care grew from $760 million to $1.35 billion, even as the number of people receiving services decreased.
Like many programs, home care is uncapped, meaning there is no fixed legal limit to how much the state spends. Home care agencies themselves determine how much their costs go up each year and bill the state accordingly. A result, officials said, is a system where the agencies have no incentive to control costs -- and the state has no choice but to pay them.
''They report their costs and we pay,'' said Andrew Zambelli, a counselor to Mr. Cuomo. ''We can go after fraud, but if someone is just running a really inefficient system or ordering excessive services, we have no way of squeezing it out.''
Home care advocates, however, say that a small number of home care agencies account for nearly all the growth in spending and that many agencies are operating in the red.
''We've asked the Health Department to use its tools and resources, which are many, to figure out what is happening related to that growth,'' said Joanne Cunningham, president of the Home Care Association of New York.
Yet examples of seemingly unchecked growth are sprinkled throughout state government. Over the past 10 years, state school building aid has increased an average of 10 percent annually and was projected to reach $2.7 billion in the new fiscal year, which begins on April 1.
Mr. Cuomo argues that the cause is not merely need -- crumbling schools that need replacing or growing student populations -- but perverse incentives. Under current law, Albany pays for an average of 70 percent of the cost of constructing new schools. Once local voters approve a project, the reimbursement is an entitlement that must be paid. Another example is prescription drugs, the administration argues. Under current law, the price paid by the state for prescription drugs is linked to an industry index known as the average wholesale price. That index goes up every year; the price for the popular cholesterol drug Lipitor rose 70 percent from 1997 to 2011, according to state officials. Yet the state is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers or pharmacy chains.
Of course, there are clear political reasons why these rates exist. They have been installed over decades by lawmakers and governors. Some are supported by well-financed and politically influential lobbies and trade associations. And while many lawmakers seem willing to find ways to improve state programs, they are not necessarily eager to give up their authority to shape policies that affect millions of New Yorkers.
''The rate-setting legislation is pretty important public policy,'' said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Democrat from Manhattan and the chairman of the Assembly's health committee. ''It's not a set of mechanical decisions.''
''I think in a democracy,'' Mr. Gottfried added, ''the Legislative branch is responsible for basic policy.''

HEADLINE: The Young and the Restless in Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Japan Blocks the Young, Stifling the Economy'' (''The Great Deflation'' series, front page, Jan. 28): 
Japan is aggravating one of the worst demographic age inversions in the developed world. If the Japanese will not use the talent of their young, we should.
The United States needs more immigrants like those highly educated and motivated young people described in the article. They could bring their talents to our businesses, helping them compete globally, while reducing our demographic age imbalance. It is a win-win-win situation. While helping support our retirees and strengthening our economy, these new Americans would get the opportunities they deserve to work, prosper, marry and raise families.
There would be no losers. Japan gains nothing from the frustrated young or their untapped talents. Until it changes its ways, we would be doing Japan a favor by removing some unproductive consumers. Every major corporation and university should be actively recruiting in Japan and the United States consulates there should be aggressive partners in their efforts.
Kyle Towers Sturgis, Mich., Jan. 28, 2011
To the Editor:
With young talents being wasted, it is no wonder that Japan is in the third round of its ''Lost Decade.'' The current difficulty Japanese college seniors, who are graduating this March, are having seems worse than the one I went through three decades ago. That was referred to as the ''Ice Age'' of employment for new graduates.
It was especially hard for female graduates. They were not even considered for positions male classmates were applying for. I was told by a reputable newspaper company, ''We do not hire women for reporters' positions, but there is an opening for a receptionist.'' I did not study international relations to become a receptionist. I left Japan.
That was three decades ago. Now, my niece is graduating this March. She is a student of Tsukuba University near Tokyo and is fluent in English and captain of the university's women's ice hockey team. Let's see what job she will land.

HEADLINE: Europeans Struggle for Consistency on Egypt

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European leaders condemned the violence in Egypt on Friday but struggled to find a consistent message.
Britain issued a tough warning against state-sponsored violence there, while Italy suggested that President Hosni Mubarak could manage a transition to democracy.
After a meeting of the 27 heads of government in Brussels, the European Union issued a declaration saying that an orderly transition to a broad-based government must start ''now,'' and condemning in the ''strongest terms the violence and all those who use and encourage violence.'' But the statement did not mention Mr. Mubarak, whose immediate resignation has been demanded by protesters. 
And comments emerging from leaders reflected the dilemma confronted by nations, hesitating between a desire to promote democracy in the Middle East and a fear that Mr. Mubarak's government could be replaced by a leadership more hostile to Western interests.
''If we see on the streets of Cairo today state-sponsored violence or the hiring of thugs to beat up protesters, Egypt and its regime would lose any remaining credibility,'' said the British prime minister, David Cameron, as he arrived at the meeting. His comments followed events on the streets of Cairo on Thursday when pitched battles took place between supporters of Mr. Mubarak and protesters demanding his resignation.
Mr. Cameron pressed successfully for Friday's statement to include a veiled threat that European Union aid might be a stake if Egypt fails to observe minimum standards on human rights. The country was allocated $760 million between 2007-10.
In contrast, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy struck a different note and called for continuity when he arrived for the meeting, which had been called to discuss energy policy and the euro-zone debt crisis.
He said he hoped there could be ''in Egypt a transition towards a more democratic system, without a rupture, with a president like Mubarak who, for all the West starting with the United States, has always been considered a wise man and a point of reference.''
The European Union's reaction to the crisis has been uncertain and there has been private criticism of the profile of the bloc's, foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who is facing the first major crisis of her time in the job. ''Our Egypt policy follows American policy like Burger King follows McDonalds,'' said one European Union diplomat not authorized to comment publicly.
Ms. Ashton's officials argue that the differences between member states have complicated her task in voicing an agreed position. She will visit Egypt after a visit to the United States, possibly next weekend.
On Thursday, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Berlusconi had agreed to a declaration that echoed calls from President Obama for an immediate transition to start in Egypt. That statement was also signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain.
''Only a quick and orderly transition to a broad-based government will make it possible to overcome the challenges Egypt is now facing,'' the declaration said, adding that the ''transition process must start now.''
During their meeting Friday leaders went slightly further in their declaration but did not call on Mr. Mubarak to quit immediately. He has announced his intention not to stand in presidential elections in September but protesters want him to step aside now.
Instead the European Union ''called on the Egyptian authorities to meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people with political reform not repression.''
European Union diplomats said that an immediate start to the transition process, could be demonstrated by preparations for elections which all parties would be able to contest.

HEADLINE: The Reagan We May Never Know

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Lately, the best-known thing about Ronald Reagan is that he was unknowable. His legend has only grown in the 22 years since he left office, but time hasn't demystified his presidency; it has mostly revealed the opacity of his good nature.
Edmund Morris, the official biographer who was so baffled by his subject that he published a semi-fictional life history in 1999, says in the HBO documentary ''Reagan'' that questioning the former president was like ''talking into a large, rather cool cave.'' In his memoir, ''My Father at 100,'' Ron Reagan grapples with his father's sunny ''strangeness.'' Nancy Reagan was his closest confidante and in some ways his only intimate friend, and she once put it this way: ''You can get just so far to Ronnie, and then something happens.''
The centennial of his birth on Sunday has inspired a national orgy of tributes and commemorations, including a video homage during the Super Bowl. In the coming days, three television documentaries seek to wade through the rapture and nostalgia and explore the man who inspires them. They can get just so far to this former president, but the journeys alone provide viewers with a fascinating look in the rearview mirror of recent history. 
The History channel's biography ''Reagan,'' on Tuesday, has some nuggets, but it is a formulaic work that is preoccupied with the most dramatic highlights of its subject's presidency: the 1981 assassination attempt and the brinksmanship that helped end the cold war.
''Nancy Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,'' on PBS on Sunday, painstakingly documents what everyone now knows, namely that Mrs. Reagan was her husband's watchdog and shadow chief of staff. It's not exactly a hard-hitting expose -- financing for the film comes from, among others, Reagan's former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the Annenberg Foundation. But it is interesting, not least because of a rare interview Mrs. Reagan gave in 2009 to the reporter Judy Woodruff.
On Monday the HBO film ''Reagan,'' by Eugene Jarecki, who wrote and directed a 2006 documentary about the military, ''Why We Fight,'' covers all of that material, and much more. This biography is the most playful and colorful of the three, but it's also by far the most thorough and thoughtful.
Mr. Jarecki's account is irreverent about the Reagan myth -- he includes a clip from ''The Simpsons.'' Much of Reagan's legacy is examined skeptically, particularly Reaganomics. Yet ''Reagan'' provides an unblinkered but respectful look at the man as well as a skillful, imaginative retelling of his long and improbable career.
The wealth of archival material is almost overwhelming -- Reagan made more than 50 Hollywood movies and numerous television appearances during his years as the host of G.E. Theater. Most Reagan documentaries make ample and sometimes sardonic use of his filmography, juxtaposing a presidential decision with an echoing scene from an old B movie. ''Reagan'' is no exception: when a historian describes Reagan's obsession with the missile defense system known as Star Wars, the film cuts to a 1940 clip of Reagan in ''Murder in the Air,'' dressed as a sailor and packing his duffel bag to foil spies with designs on what he calls ''the greatest war weapon ever invented.''
The film also mines the archives of his early days as governor of California for clips that show a grim, belligerent Reagan battling riots, hippies and campus unrest. But a moment in a 1967 encounter between Reagan and a small group of male students on the Yale campus is used to illustrate Mrs. Reagan's importance as a consigliere.
''I could ask Nancy to verify it for me,'' he says as the camera pans to the back of the room, where Mrs. Reagan, in a sleeveless salmon pink dress and sunglasses, was standing, intently overseeing the exchange.
''Reagan'' stretches from his modest boyhood in Dixon, Ill., to the ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall'' visit to Berlin, and beyond, touching on the fog of Alzheimer's. But it still manages to linger over Reagan's transformation from liberal Democrat to conservative. The film notes that while Reagan declined to name names to the House Un-American Activities Committee in public when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild, he did privately cooperate with F.B.I. investigators under the code name Informant T-10.
The commercials Reagan made for General Electric -- in the kitchen with Nancy and baby Patti -- are a hoot. But his experience as a spokesman for G.E. shaped his politics and polished his public persona; the film credits Lemuel Boulware, a G.E. executive, with steering Reagan to his pro-business, anti-union, free-market ideology.
Reagan's optimism and imperturbable cheer came to him much earlier. ''The thing that is most interesting is that the successful child of an alcoholic is able to repress all of the tough stuff and concentrate on what's positive,'' Lou Cannon, author of ''President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,'' explains.
Many of the biographers, journalists and policy experts who appear in the film are critical of Reagan's social policies. But one of the most damning testimonials comes from a fan, the economist Arthur Laffer, ardent proponent of supply-side economics and father of the Laffer Curve.
''Trickle-down economics is if you feed the horse enough oats, the sparrow will survive on the highway,'' he explains cheerfully.
The main voice of reason is that of Reagan's son Ron, who is interviewed by a swimming pool, describing his father with affection, but also critical distance. He traces his father's worldview to his success as a young lifeguard, despite his terrible eyesight. (Nearsightedness kept Reagan in Hollywood making propaganda and training films during World War II.)
''He grew up seeing himself as somebody who saved people's lives,'' Ron Reagan says. ''I think that carried through into his later years as well, the sort of roles he liked to play in movies. He wanted to be the hero.''
And that yearning to be America's lifeguard helps explain Reagan's thinking in the Iran-contra affair, which darkened the second term of his presidency. He denied trading arms for hostages in Iran, then later admitted it in a televised address. The film cites the secret diary of the former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who recorded that when warned that the deal was illegal, Reagan said he didn't care.
''I can deal with charges of criminality,'' Mr. Weinberger's notes say. ''But I can't deal with the American people thinking I'm big, strong president Reagan, I didn't do everything I could to get those hostages out.''
Mr. Jarecki can only get just so far to Ronnie, but it's close enough.

HEADLINE: The Gamble Of Lending Peer to Peer

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
The Talking Business column by Joe Nocera, which normally appears on this page, will return next week.

 BODY:
When peer-to-peer online lending first became possible in the United States five years ago, using the Web to make money by lending it to fellow citizens in need seemed wonderfully subversive.
No more banks! Let the people play loan officer! The hype was literally suffused with the rhetoric of revolution when a company called Prosper began operations in February 2006. ''Prosper gives people the opportunity to take back the marketplace for consumer credit,'' the company's co-founder, Chris Larsen, said in its news release.
The big idea went something like this: Borrowers would post a request for funds and explain why they needed the money. Lenders could put money into part or all of any loan that caught their fancy. And Prosper (and later, Lending Club) would run credit checks of aspiring borrowers for the lenders, watch for fraud, collect and distribute monthly payments and take some money off the top for itself.
People borrowed for breast implants and home renovations, and lenders pored over payment data in search of patterns that could help them select better borrowers in the future. To the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, all of this looked like investing, not lending, and both companies stopped taking in new lenders for months in parts of 2008 and 2009 to get their regulatory houses in order. 
Even today, the companies are still trying to persuade over 20 states, including sizable ones like Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, to let individual lenders there put money into loans. And as it works its way through the states, the industry appears to be settling into something both less and potentially more than it once promised.
All the stuff about taking back the marketplace aside, here's the far more basic function that these companies actually serve: the majority of customers who borrow use the loans to pay off higher interest debt. They are paying 18 percent or more to credit card companies, and they seek Prosper or Lending Club loans that charge, say, 10, 12 or 14 percent. So as an investor, your return would be the interest rate that borrowers pay, minus the companies' small fee and whatever money the borrowers fail to repay.
Most lenders throw a couple of $20 bills into many dozens of these loans. And once they do they end up with a portfolio of sorts. So it isn't a stretch to see how these loans may look, in aggregate, like an entirely new asset class, one that could zig when bonds or stocks zag.
This has attracted investors who are hardly motivated by helping the little guy or needling the banks. Hedge funds are writing seven-figure checks to Lending Club to get in on the action. More conservative types, like money managers for wealthy families, are also dipping their toes in. In total, borrowers have signed up for more than $400 million in loans through the two companies in the last five years.
And so the question is this: Just how badly could you get burned if you invested a little money?
I've been asking this question ever since Prosper made its debut, and I'm glad I waited before investing any of my family's money. While the basic outline of the business hasn't changed much, there was more room to do something foolish when Prosper began.
Back then, the company would accept loan applications from people with FICOcredit scores as low as the subprime 520 (or lower in the first couple of months, before the frightening default rates caused the company to establish a floor). Lenders would bid, auction-style, for the right to invest, with interest rates falling as more lenders piled in.
Human nature being what it is, starry-eyed lenders were attracted to the higher interest rates that people with low credit scores seemed willing to pay. But as the lenders' bids for those loans pushed the interest rates down, the rates ended up being lower than they should have been, given the risk the borrowers posed.
And wouldn't you know it? Of all of the loans that Prosper helped originate in its first three years, just over one-third went bad. The average investor lost 4.95 percent annually on the loans made during that period. Former lenders now spew bile toward the company on the user forums at Prospers.org, and the company is the target of a class-action suit.
Lending Club was much more conservative when it began in 2007. Its minimum credit score for borrowers was 640, and now it is 660, though most borrowers have had scores higher than 700. It set the interest rates for loans based on borrowers' credit history and other factors; there was no reverse auction as there was at Prosper. Lending Club's co-founder, Renaud Laplanche, said that no lender who had invested more than $10,000 on his platform (generally spreading money among many loans) had ever lost money.
Prosper is now aping Lending Club's approach, raising its credit standards and getting rid of the loan auctions so it can set the loan terms itself. It has also added credit risk experts and beefed up its collection efforts. And in a show of chutzpah, given the sorry performance of early Prosper loans, the company now claims that Lending Club is the one that underestimates the risks lenders face. (I've linked to a Prosper blog post that makes this case in the online version of this column.)
Lending Club states quite plainly in its government filings that its estimated default rates for loans of varying credit quality are not based on its own (admittedly limited) experience. Instead, it bases the guesses on decades of credit bureau data that looks at repayment rates on other types of loans.
But peer-to-peer loans may well perform differently. Aspiring borrowers, for instance, can and do make up all sorts of stories to make themselves more attractive or sympathetic.
Lending Club does not necessarily check out all these tales. From April through the end of November 2010, the company verified income or employment data on about 60 percent of borrower applications. For the period ending in September, just 65 percent of the borrowers from those files provided it with satisfactory responses. The others ignored the inquiries, withdrew their applications or sent along data that did not match the original posting. In the end, fully one-third of the applications did not pass muster.
Frightening, right? Mr. Laplanche noted that Lending Club had flagged those loans for specific reasons, which would suggest that there were probably fewer errors or lies in the 40 percent of his overall portfolio that he did not double-check. Still, it doesn't smell quite right. And if you cannot necessarily trust some portion of the borrowers, and the still-young companies do not have much data on completed three-year loans, which are the most popular ones, this sure seems less a bond purchase than a new type of casino game in Las Vegas.
Mr. Laplanche does not much care for this characterization when it applies to high-grade loans, noting that one life insurance company, which he will not name, has put $5 million to work on Lending Club. ''I wouldn't qualify that as casino investing, unless you think insurance companies invest customers' premiums at casinos,'' he said. Meanwhile, his company is winning in the marketplace; it put about $14.8 million to work in new loans last month, more than four times what Prosper did.
Still, this is precisely the sort of uncertain situation that experienced investors with a high risk tolerance (or a big collection of safer securities elsewhere) can capitalize on. Sure enough, Lending Club now has 25 accounts with more than $1 million at work or in line for lending.
Robert Maroney manages money for a handful of wealthy families at the firm Connecticut Investments, and he put $500,000 to work on the Lending Club platform in the middle of last year.
He invests money in higher-quality loans, using an automated system that any investor can use to put small amounts of money into scores of loans. He thinks he will get a 7 percent annual return. His experience has been good enough that he is considering putting more money into similar loans, though even then the investment would be only a tiny fraction of the total amount of money he manages. He said he liked the loans in part because their terms were short; long-term bonds could pose risks if interest rates were to rise.
As for individual investors, he worries that the gaudy 12 or 14 percent returns that Prosperand Lending Club dangle in front of people who want to invest in the riskiest loans may prove too tempting. ''I'm not sure they would make the right choices,'' he said. ''I'd hate to see someone on a fixed income get sucked into that.''
So you could pile into the less risky loans with the professionals like Mr. Maroney. Or you could wait another year or two to see how things shake out for current lenders. After all, Mr. Larsen managed to bring Prosper back from the brink only by raising its standards. He is, in effect, calling a do-over. ''In some ways, the industry just starts now,'' he said.
To my mind, though, that is a reason to wait a little longer before you invest much money.

HEADLINE: The Inexact Science Of the Jobless Numbers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE American economy added 36,000 jobs last month.
That is what the government said Friday. Of course, it also said the unemployment rate plunged to 9.0 percent. It is hard to put those two observations together and think they refer to the same economy.
The unemployment rate may be wrong, but it is unlikely to be revised. The jobs number, however, will be changed, again and again. Eventually, those looking at the history may see a number very different from 36,000. 
But it is the first number for each month that people remember. The revisions over the next two months will be barely mentioned in news stories. When the final numbers are posted, they will seem like ancient history.
Some of that history was written on Friday. The government revised the job gain and loss numbers for the months from April 2009 to March 2010. It turns out that things were even worse than we thought they were. If you add up the first estimates for those 12 months -- the ones that made headlines -- you would get a loss of almost 2.3 million jobs. But if you look at the same months after the latest revision -- what the government calls a ''benchmark'' revision -- they add up to a loss of 2.6 million jobs.
The accompanying charts compare the first number -- the one that gets the attention -- with the latest one. In the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tended to underestimate job growth. That was evidently because it was not adjusting for the fact that new jobs created by young companies could not be included in the monthly survey of 140,000 employers.
So starting in 2000, the government phased in a ''Birth/Death Model,'' which tried to correct for that.
It has not worked particularly well, as can be seen in the charts. Now, in an effort to improve that model, the bureau is changing some estimates to quarterly from annually. But there is little it can do about the basic problem: when the economy turns up, there will be more new jobs than previous experience would predict. When the economy turns down, the opposite will happen.
One reason for the large changes is that the benchmark revision is based on returns the companies file when they pay the premiums for unemployment insurance, rather than on the survey of employers. The tax returns are deemed more accurate, but they take a lot longer to be available.
The worst period ever for the jobs survey came in the fall of 2008, as Lehman Brothers failed and a credit squeeze led many companies to cut employment. The initial reports were bad -- losses of 159,000, 240,000 and 533,000 in the months from September through November. But the final numbers say the actual carnage was worse, by about 270,000 jobs each month.
By that standard, the miss in the 12 months through last March was mild, an average of only 29,000 a month. That figure, of course, is reduced by the fact some misses offset others.
Over all, from January 1979 through March 2010, the first estimate was off -- either higher or lower -- from the final figure by a median of 74,000 jobs. If that holds true now, there is a 50 percent chance that the final number for January will be somewhere between a loss of 38,000 and a gain of 110,000. And there is an equal chance that it will be outside that range.
None of that reduces the importance of jobs data, particularly in the months after a recession ends. But it does serve as a reminder that the first attempt at estimating employment is far from authoritative.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Revised Job Statistics: The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday the results of its annual ''benchmark revision,'' in which it updates the monthly job figures using information from unemployment insurance premium payments, rather than from its monthly survey of employers. The new figures, for the 12 months through March 2010, show that job losses were more severe than originally reported. But the figures were not nearly as inaccurate as in the previous year, when the recession was most severe. Figures for April 2010 and later reflect monthly revisions only, not a benchmark revision.

HEADLINE: BUCKS; A Tool for the Risk-Averse

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Even the most disciplined savers are heavily relying on the stock market to reach their retirement goals. But that often amounts to a giant gamble, which is the thrust of the thinking behind a new retirement planning program that treats investing in stocks like a trip to the casino.
In this program, however, you lose every single bet you make. In other words, if you invest 60 percent of your contributions to retirement savings in stocks each year, that money is treated as if it were lost on the craps tables. But the program also shows the chances that all will not be lost.
Even during the latest market crash, people generally didn't lose all of their money, so why model for Armageddon? Market returns are not a sure thing, obviously. And the point of the program, called Upside Investing, is to establish a stable, guaranteed standard of living over the course of your entire life by showing you how much to save and spend.
So the program only allows you to spend the money it considers safe - that is, money not in stocks. It also shows the probabilities that you will have more money to spend each year, and how much. 
The program is a new feature of the ESPlanner financial planning software, developed by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who has been perfecting his software for several years. Upside Investing still feels like a work in progress, and combing through the results will require more time (and patience) than your typical online program.
But the results can be illuminating. Going through the exercise shows the risks of investing in the market, by listing how much you should be spending now to ensure a steady standard of living.
''This treats investing in the market like going to the casino with a fixed amount of money you are prepared to lose,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said, ''and not spending your winnings until you leave the slot machine.''
First, some background: The program is based on the ''economics approach'' to financial planning. The goal is to adapt your saving and spending behavior so that you can attain the highest stable standard of living over time, or what Mr. Kotlikoff refers to as your floor. When you play around with the program, you'll see that investing more money in the stock market improves the odds that you'll have more money to spend, but it also lowers your floor (or the bare minimum you are guaranteed to have each year if you follow the program's suggestions).
Conventional financial planning programs, meanwhile, usually focus on achieving a specific goal, like a target amount in your portfolio when you retire or replacing a percentage of the income you earned during your working years, say 75 percent. Mr. Kotlikoff argues that those targets are generally far off base.
***
The program costs $60. (That's $40 annually for an up-to-date version of the ESPlanner Basic retirement planning program that allows you to save your data, and an additional $20 for Upside Investing.)
You start by entering your basic information (birth date, family members, etc.), and choosing the ''Upside Investing'' method of planning. You also need to choose a rate of return for your ''safe'' money. Since Mr. Kotlikoff believes that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, are the only truly ''safe'' asset -- they keep pace with inflation, and are backed by the United States government -- the default is set at 2 percent, or about what the securities yield now. That's why he believes TIPS should substitute for conventional bonds. So the program assumes that whatever is not invested in stocks is in TIPS.
I ran the numbers for a 35-year-old New Yorker who earns $75,000 a year and pays $1,100 in rent each month. She's already saved $50,000 for retirement, contributes 10 percent of her salary to a 401(k) plan, and receives a 2 percent matching contribution. Her retirement portfolio is composed of 70 percent stocks and 30 percent TIPS, and she expects to retire at age 67. Users need to decide when to start converting their stock money to TIPS (remember, the program allows you to spend money only once it's safe), so I chose to have her start converting at age 55. Her portfolio is completely converted by age 95.
Once you enter all of your information through a series of drop-down menus (be sure to look to the far right of the screen for helpful hints), it takes about 35 seconds for the program to generate suggestions for you.
You can click through the detailed results using the tabs on the left side of the screen, under ''View Plan.'' After paying her rent, she has $2,000 a month to spend on everything else (or $24,000 annually for the rest of her life, assuming her stocks lose all of their value). ''Anytime you spend more than that, you are taking a gamble that your living standard will drop below that floor in the future,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said.
But the program says she needs to save an additional $12,275 this year. That's above and beyond the $7,500 she's already saving, since 70 percent of that money, which is in stocks, can be lost. In other words, the program is suggesting that she sock away 25 percent of her salary. That's the price of a risk-free retirement plan.
The problem, of course, is that most people either can't or don't want to save that much. Instead, they're willing to bet that the stock market will deliver (at least something), which will give them some more wiggle room today.
''This behavior may be too cautious for half the population,'' Mr. Kotlikoff says. ''But for the other half, it may be exactly what they are looking for.''
This advice is not without its own set of weaknesses. You could end up dying with a pile of money after years of giving up even the smallest of niceties.
You can actually view the odds, or likelihood, of having a higher living standard for each year of your life under the Upside Investing tab. Five percent of the time, our worker gets to spend $57,170 or more at age 67. And 25 percent of the time, she gets to spend $40,158 or more.
The likelihood of having to live at the floor -- that is, the guaranteed amount -- declines through time. But the risk-averse among you can rest assured that the amount will never dip below that figure.
To increase your guaranteed standard of living, you need to lower your stock allocation (which will also limit your potential upside). So I reran the numbers, reducing our 35-year-old's stock allocation to 50 percent from 70 percent.
She doesn't gain that much. With the lower stock exposure, she can spend only an additional $2,362 a year for the rest of her life. And at age 67, she will get to spend $48,719 or more 5 percent of the time, down from $57,170 with the higher stock exposure.
Bottom line: She gives up a lot of potential upside later, for a small increase in spending today.
The idea, Mr. Kotlikoff said, is to run the software each year to give you a sense of how much you can safely spend as your life changes.
Some of the program's results really need some more explanation or clarification, and that can throw you off track at times. For instance, the program assumes that you put the extra money it suggests that you save into a regular savings or brokerage account. Most people would probably want to save that money in a tax-deferred or tax-sheltered account of some kind. But it's basically up to you to go back and figure out how much of that money you should re-direct into your 401(k) or I.R.A. You also can't override the program's assumption that you will live until 100.
In the end, however, the costs of a risk-free path to retirement become quite clear. It's probably too high a bar for many families to clear on their own, which means they'll continue to roll the dice in the market, at least to some degree.
But at least you'll know how much you stand to lose -- and how it will affect your lifestyle.
What do you think about this approach to financial planning? Please share your thoughts below.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: JOB GAINS SLOW EVEN AS RECOVERY LOOKS STRONGER

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The United States labor market is still having trouble achieving liftoff.
Payrolls expanded by 36,000 jobs in January, a sharp decline from the gains of recent months and well below the level economists had forecast. The reluctance of employers to add jobs at a time of robust corporate profits, strengthening consumer spending and other economic improvement renewed concerns that this near-jobless recovery could continue for an extended period.
The picture painted by the Labor Department's monthly snapshot of the job market was confounded by a more encouraging drop in the unemployment rate to 9 percent, from 9.4 percent a month earlier, for its lowest rate since April 2009. The unemployment rate is gleaned from a survey of households, rather than companies, and can be volatile.
The snowstorms in January probably had some effect on the anemic job growth, given that the transportation and warehousing sector and the construction sector both shed jobs. Government layoffs, particularly at the state and local level, also reduced the overall number. 
A mosaic of other indicators this week suggested that the economic recovery was gaining momentum. A closely watched survey of manufacturers rose to its highest level since May 2004, and spending by consumers has outpaced expectations. On average, fewer people are filing for unemployment insurance.
As a result, some economists said they would largely disregard January's weak payroll data. Others, however, cautioned that underlying job growth was still not robust.
''You can blame weather for the number being as low as it is,'' said Steve Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research. ''But even if you abstracted out the weather, you're still not getting the dynamic job growth that is going to cut the unemployment rate significantly.''
The private sector added 50,000 jobs, while government shed 14,000 jobs. Analysts had forecast an overall increase of about 145,000, roughly the number needed to absorb people joining the labor pool in good times.
A broader measure of unemployment -- which includes those whose hours have been cut, those who are working part time because they could not find full-time jobs, and those so discouraged that they have given up on the search -- was 16.1 percent, down from 16.7 percent in December.
That left 13.9 million people still out of work.
For the unemployed, the situation is growing increasingly frustrating. Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, said that given growth in corporate profits, ''this is when we need to see jobs growing hand over fist.''
A few sectors are indeed picking up. Health care and retail businesses added jobs, and manufacturing, a highlight of the recovery so far, added 49,000 jobs last month.
While average weekly earnings for private sector workers barely budged, economists noted that average weekly earnings for manufacturing workers increased to $959.45 from $948.19, and an index of average weekly hours was also up.
''Those firms are working the people they have harder,'' said Heather Boushey, senior economist at the liberal Center for American Progress. ''And they will have to bring in new employees.''
Cliff Waldman, economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said companies could be adding more jobs but were having some trouble filling slots that required workers with more skills.
''The modern manufacturing sector requires a different kind of worker than the manufacturing sector of 20 years ago,'' Mr. Waldman said. ''They have to be more literate, better at math and able to work in teams.''
That does not bode well for those who have fewer skills and less education. The disproportionate burden that the grim labor market has imposed on the less skilled remained pronounced in January's numbers. The unemployment rate among people with less than a high school diploma was 14.2 percent, while the rate among those with a bachelor's degree or higher was 4.2 percent.
Recruiters and staffing companies underscored the fact that employers that were hiring were looking to fill slots that generally required candidates with college degrees.
Evan Davis, chief operating officer of MRINetwork, which has 700 franchised recruiting offices throughout the United States, said the company had seen a strong increase in postings for information technology, engineering and health care jobs. In fact, Mr. Davis said, some employers were having a difficult time hiring for such openings.
''It's actually hard to meet the demand that's out there,'' he said. ''It's really hard to find top talent.''
Michael Bove, who recently secured a job in San Antonio helping sports teams work with ticketing software a year after he was laid off as a manager with a soccer team in Houston, said he could not imagine what it would be like to search for a job if he did not have his college degree.
''You hear stories of the people who are in their mid-40s or early 50s that have been working 20 or 25 years as bank branch managers or I.T. people and have all this experience but now they're out there competing for entry-level positions that in the past might go to someone who doesn't have a college degree,'' Mr. Bove, 30, said. ''Now companies can pick and choose who they want.''
The number of people who had been out of work for six months or more eased to 6.2 million from 6.4 million. Austan Goolsbee, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, disputed the suggestion that a significant portion of the long-term unemployed won't be able to find work.
''The durations are essentially what you would expect when the overall unemployment rate is high,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. ''It's still a serious problem, but the way we must address that is getting the growth rate up higher and encouraging firms to hire back workers.''
The Labor Department's survey of household members, which tends to better account for the self-employed and those in newly formed firms than the payroll survey, showed a rosier view of the job market. The number of employed people rose by 589,000 last month, when the effects of adjustments to the total work force population numbers were stripped out.
The government does not include those population adjustments in retroactive numbers, however, making comparisons with the unemployment rates through the months of last year more difficult.
Other revisions to the data on the payroll side suggested that job growth in 2010 was slightly lower than originally reported. The report included upward revisions to November and December's numbers, lifting job creation in November to 93,000 from 71,000, and in December to 121,000 from 103,000. Elsewhere, temporary help, which had been strong throughout 2010, actually declined by 11,400 jobs, and construction lagged, shedding 32,000 jobs.
Economists noted that job growth would not truly hit the levels needed to seriously dent the unemployment rate until employers outside of a handful of industries started hiring in earnest. A crucial factor holding back job growth is that construction, which was among the hardest hit during the recession, has not yet revived.
''It's very brutal in our industry,'' said Brantley Barrow, chairman of Hardin Construction, a builder of office buildings, malls, hospitals and hotels based in Atlanta. ''Even though the general economy is getting better, it's going to be another year or two before things start to improve in our industry.''
Victor Fernicola, a construction worker from Queens, N.Y., said he had been out of work since last February. He has high hopes that his union, Laborers Local 79, will soon send him job opportunities.
''It's actually been moving,'' he said of the construction labor market. ''At one time it was pretty much at a standstill.''
Many workers are waiting for the pace to pick up. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Thursday that ''until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.''

HEADLINE: Lacking Peace Talks, Israel Offers Economic Package for Palestinians

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel announced on Friday a package of steps meant to develop infrastructure and encourage economic growth in the Palestinian territories, in what appeared to be an effort to mollify the Western-backed Palestinian Authority leadership and allay international criticism in the absence of peace talks.
The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the gestures were meant ''first of all to enhance stability'' by improving the Palestinian quality of life, in a reference to the mass protests rocking Egypt, Israel's neighbor and longtime peace partner, and other parts of the Arab world. 
But officials said that the measures had been under discussion for months and that the timing of the announcement probably had more to do with the meeting scheduled for Saturday of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers, consisting of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.
The foreign ministers of the quartet and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, were due to meet on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to talk about the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The Israeli package was negotiated with Tony Blair, the quartet's special envoy, who presented it jointly with Mr. Netanyahu here on Friday.
''Even against the background of events in the region,'' Mr. Blair said in a statement, ''and the absence of direct political negotiations, it is important we continue to do all we can to improve the conditions and living standards of the Palestinian people. Indeed it is now especially important.''
Several of the proposed steps relate to Gaza, where the authority's rival, the Islamic militant group Hamas, holds sway. But Israel said that the beneficiaries of the improved infrastructure there would be the Gaza population, the Palestinian Authority and Israel itself.
Significantly, Israel has agreed to begin discussions on the development of a Palestinian Authority gas field adjacent to an Israeli gas field off the coast of Gaza, which need to be developed simultaneously. Future revenues from the Palestinian field will go to the authority, Mr. Netanyahu said.
Israel also agreed in principle to allow the development of electricity, sanitation and water projects in Gaza, including the introduction of desalination plants, with the intention of making Gaza ''independent of Israeli infrastructure,'' Mr. Netanyahu said. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
In addition, Israel is supposed to approve additional construction projects and new procedures for the controlled entry of construction materials into Gaza.
Among the proposals for the West Bank, Israel said that it would speed up the building process for schools and health clinics in Israeli-controlled areas and that it approved in principle the extension of the Palestinian Authority's security presence to seven towns in areas under Israeli security control, a longstanding authority demand.
Israel also said it encouraged projects for the improvement of infrastructure in Arab neighborhoods of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. The Palestinians and most countries of the world do not recognize Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as the capital of a future state.
The measures were announced before they had been formally presented to the Palestinian Authority, and there was no immediate response from the Palestinian side. Many details still have to be fleshed out in discussions over the next few months, and sounding a note of caution, Mr. Blair said, ''Obviously, agreement to all this is not the same as implementation.'' He added that ''none of this is a substitute for a credible political process.''
Short-lived negotiations stalled in September after a 10-month Israeli moratorium on building new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank expired.
The Palestinians say they will not resume negotiations without an additional settlement freeze and clear terms of reference for the talks. Israeli officials have proposed offering alternative gestures and incentives as a way of coaxing the Palestinians back into negotiations. But there was no suggestion in the Netanyahu or Blair statements made Friday, or in a document outlining the new measures that was provided to The New York Times, that their implementation was conditional on a resumption of talks.
Mideast Unrest Appraised
PARIS -- Unrest sweeping Egypt and other parts of the Middle East reflects a deep desire for political change and is likely to have a positive effect on regional stability in the long run, Salam Fayyad, prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, said Friday.
The protests, spreading from Tunisia and Algeria to Egypt and Yemen, are ''an expression of a desire for positive change, for inclusiveness, for enfranchisement -- something which is not in abundance,'' Mr. Fayyad said at the Academie Diplomatique Internationale in Paris. ''I view it as a predominantly political phenomenon -- not a revolt by the angry, not a form of protest against the poor living conditions,'' he said of the disparate movements pushing autocratic regimes for accountability, democracy and the rule of law.
Mr. Fayyad was speaking at the end of a visit to Paris, during which he met President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon.

HEADLINE: Parliament Picks Insider As President Of Myanmar

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- A former prime minister and longtime adjutant to Myanmar's military dictator was elected president on Friday by the country's newly inaugurated Parliament, a move that cements the military's control of a new political system.
Thein Sein, a career army bureaucrat who as prime minister was the public face of the military government, won more than 60 percent of the vote in the two-chamber Parliament, news agencies reported from Myanmar. 
After the first week of parliamentary sessions, a picture has emerged of Myanmar's self-styled democracy: secretive, heavily scripted and dominated by the hierarchy of the departing junta.
After nearly five decades of military rule, elections last November and a new Constitution were ostensibly meant to usher in a return to civilian rule.
But of the top five political figures under the new system -- the president, two vice presidents and the speakers of the lower and upper houses of Parliament -- four are former senior military officers.
Mr. Thein Sein is regarded as a low-key administrator who is perhaps best known within the military for his fealty to Than Shwe, the country's aging senior general, who now appears to be taking a behind-the-scenes advisory role similar to Deng Xiaoping's in China during that country's transition to a market economy.
As commander in chief and head of the junta, Senior Gen. Than Shwe has wielded near absolute power in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, since he took over in 1992.
''How much will he be involved in day-to-day affairs? This is the most important question in Burmese politics today,'' said Aung Naing Oo, deputy director of the Vahu Development Institute, a research organization based in Thailand. ''How much will he remain in the shadows or how much does he want to impose his authority on the new government -- we don't know.''
Mr. Thein Sein must now select his cabinet, but analysts say many of the choices have already been made, with some ministers reportedly picked by General Than Shwe himself, according to Win Min, a professor at Payap University in Thailand who is on leave in the United States.
''It's become clear that Than Shwe will remain the most powerful person,'' Mr. Win Min said. ''People believe that where Than Shwe is, the power will follow.''
Among other appointments this week, Thura Shwe Mann, a senior member of the junta, was elected speaker of the lower house of Parliament, and Khin Aung Myint, a retired general, ran unopposed and became speaker of the upper house.
The two vice presidents are Tin Aung Myint Oo, a former member of the junta, and Sai Mauk Kham, a doctor from the ethnic Shan minority.
The proceedings this week -- the first meeting of a Parliament in Myanmar in more than two decades -- have been highly choreographed, with only sketchy details reported in the state news media. Reporters for foreign news agencies have been banned from Parliament.
In a country where large popular uprisings have challenged the military at least twice in recent history, the senior generals appear continually wary of threats to their power.
State media have run ample coverage of international news -- everything from the war in Afghanistan to allegations that the actress Lindsay Lohan stole a necklace from a jewelry shop in California -- but have not mentioned the upheaval in Egypt and Tunisia.
''They don't want people to get the idea that protesters can overthrow a government,'' Mr. Win Min said.
General Than Shwe warned in a bold-faced article on Friday's front page of the government's mouthpiece, The New Light of Myanmar, that ''external elements'' were seeking to mobilize the local population ''to disrupt national development.''
''I would like to urge the entire people to guard the nation with political awareness against any forms of disruptions in order that the mother country's independence and sovereignty will never be under alien influence,'' General Than Shwe said.

HEADLINE: The Kindling of Change

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
It is impossible to know exactly which embers spark a revolution, but it's not so hard to measure the conditions that make a country prime for one. 
Since the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, speculating about whether the fervor will spread and to which countries has become something of a world-watcher's parlor game.
So I've decided to give over much of my space this week to providing more data for that discussion.
As The New York Times headline declared earlier this week, ''Jobs and Age Reign As Factors in Mideast Uprisings.'' And the Economist Intelligence Unit's Index of Democracy has used levels of democracy to identify countries at risk around the world.
These are solid measures, but I would add spending on essentials like food (there is nothing like food insecurity to spur agita), income inequality and burgeoning Internet usage (because the Internet has been crucial to the organization of recent uprisings).
Seen through that prism, Tunisia and Egypt look a lot alike, and Algeria, Iran, Jordan, Morocco and Yemen look ominously similar.
Please, explore for yourself.

HEADLINE: Bewitched By the Numbers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The data zealots have utterly discombobulated themselves.
They were expecting something on the order of 150,000 new jobs to have been created in January. That would have been a lousy number, but they were fully prepared to spin it as being pretty good. They thought the official jobless rate might hop up a tick to 9.5 percent.
Instead, the economy created just 36,000 jobs in January, an absolutely dreadful number. But the unemployment rate fell like a stone from 9.4 percent to 9.0 percent. 
The crunchers stared at the numbers in disbelief. They moved them this way and that. No matter how they arranged them, they made no sense. Nothing even close to enough jobs were being created to bring the unemployment rate down, but for two successive months it had dropped sharply. (It dived from 9.8 percent to 9.4 in December.)
A baffled commentator on CNBC said, ''I think there is an improvement in the economy, though you can't see it in today's payroll survey.''
Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics, who is frequently very good at this stuff, said: ''I think these numbers are meaningless. I don't think they mean anything.''
What data zealots need to do is leave their hermetically sealed rooms and step outside, take a walk among the millions of Americans who are hurting to the bone. They should talk with families that are suffering, losing their homes, doubling up, checking into homeless shelters.
We behave as though the numbers are an end in themselves -- just get the G.D.P. up or the jobless rate down -- and we'll be on our way to fat city. But the numbers are just tools, abstractions to help guide us, orient us. They aren't the be-all and end-all. They don't tell us squat about the flesh-and-blood reality of the mom or dad lying awake in the dark of night, worrying about the repo man coming for the family van or the foreclosure notice that's sure to materialize any day now.
The policy makers who rely on the data zealots are just as detached from the real world of real people. They're always promising in the most earnest tones imaginable to do something about employment, to ease the awful squeeze on the middle class (policy makers never talk about the poor), to reform education, and so on.
They say those things because they have to. But they are far more obsessed with the numbers than they are with the struggles and suffering of real people. You won't hear policy makers acknowledging that the unemployment numbers would be much worse if not for the millions of people who have left the work force over the past few years. What happened to those folks? How are they and their families faring?
The policy makers don't tell us that most of the new jobs being created in such meager numbers are, in fact, poor ones, with lousy pay and few or no benefits. What we hear is what the data zealots pump out week after week, that the market is up, retail sales are strong, Wall Street salaries and bonuses are streaking, as always, to the moon, and that businesses are sitting on mountains of cash. So all must be right with the world.
Jobs? Well, the less said the better.
What's really happening, of course, is the same thing that's been happening in this country for the longest time -- the folks at the top are doing fabulously well and they are not interested in the least in spreading the wealth around.
The people running the country -- the ones with the real clout, whether Democrats or Republicans -- are all part of this power elite. Ordinary people may be struggling, but both the Obama administration and the Republican Party leadership are down on their knees slavishly kissing the rings of the financial and corporate kingpins.
I love when the wackos call President Obama a socialist. Wasn't it his budget director, Peter Orszag, who moved effortlessly from his job in the administration to a hotshot post at Citigroup, beneficiary of tons of government largess? And didn't the president's new chief of staff, William Daley, arrive in his powerful new post fresh from the executive suite of JPMorgan Chase? And isn't the incoming chairman of Mr. Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness very conveniently the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt?
You might ask: Who represents working people? The answer, as Tevye would say with grave emphasis in ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' is, ''I don't know.''
Maybe the data zealots have stumbled on a solution. They've created a model in which a radically insufficient number of jobs has resulted in a sharp decline in the official gauge of unemployment. If that trend can be sustained, we'll eventually get the jobless rate down to zero. People will still be suffering, but full employment will have finally been achieved.

HEADLINE: Hiding Money Overseas? You're Taking a Big Chance

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
ANYONE who squirrels away money in an offshore bank account, confident that it will remain a secret, should think again.
In the last three years, there have been a series of prominent cases in which formerly secretive banks, including UBS and Julius Baer in Switzerland and the LGT Group, the Liechtenstein royal bank, have had to notify clients that former employees had taken their account data and were about to make it public. And now the founder of WikiLeaks has indicated that he has another trove of documents from Julius Baer that he could release any day.
Yet some wealthy people continue to turn to offshore accounts, including growing numbers who are now going to Singapore and Hong Kong in the wake of the crackdown on private banking in Switzerland.
Asher Rubinstein, a lawyer in New York who specializes in complicated tax matters, said he had people come into his office who were willing to risk disclosure. He said most people who asked about opening an account offshore or declaring an existing one realized the risks they were taking. 
''I say, 'Make yourself tax-compliant, because if you don't do it, your penalties are great, including jail time,' '' Mr. Rubinstein said. ''Nine out of 10 say, 'You're right.' They're not happy about it because they're going to have to part with a big chunk of money in taxes. But one out of 10 is going to say, 'Thank you very much, I'm going to take my chances.' ''
To any logical person, this is irrational behavior, particularly when the United States government can seize up to 50 percent of an account's value for every year it existed.
And if UBS and Julius Baer have highlighted anything, it is that the source of the secret documents may not be driven by righteous indignation against offshore banking. In both instances, former bankers became whistle-blowers only after their firms paid them less than they felt they deserved.
Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service offers rewards for information on tax evasion, so a disgruntled business partner or jilted former spouse could just as easily reveal hidden money.
Still, in an increasingly globalized world, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to have offshore accounts. The accounts are perfectly legal as long as the I.R.S. knows about them and the owner is paying taxes on any income from the holdings.
Here is a look at the state of play as nervous clients wait to see what, if anything, might be revealed in a new trove of WikiLeaks documents.
ILLEGAL ACCOUNTS For obvious reasons, lawyers and financial advisers were not willing to speak about how someone goes about setting up an illegal offshore account. But as Mr. Rubinstein noted, people are still doing it despite increasing evidence that they may get caught.
Small banks in the Swiss cantons continue to be attractive to people trying to hide money. Unlike UBS, which has a banking license and significant assets in the United States, these banks have nothing that could be seized by the American government.
In addition to local banks in Singapore and Hong Kong, many Swiss banks have opened offices there. ''Singapore has become more important,'' said Karl G. Wellner, president and chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. ''They're not going to yield to pressure from the U.S.''
Wealth advisers note that Americans are not the only ones looking for offshore accounts. And wealthy people from other countries do not come with the baggage of United States regulators.
Yet the number of American citizens evading taxes may not be as large as popularly imagined. James N. Mastracchio, co-chairman of the tax controversy practice at the Baker Hostetler firm, has been working with people who came forth during the I.R.S.'s last amnesty program in 2009.
He said only about 5 percent of the cases involved blatant tax evasion. But those who did come clean did so because they feared this was going to be their only chance to avoid criminal prosecution.
''There was a fear that the accounts would be released, and they would be brought in,'' he said. ''People will keep going until they think they're going to get caught.''
HONEST MISTAKES While it may strain credulity, there are people who have had offshore accounts for years, if not decades, and have never declared them because they did not think they had to. The amnesty program brought out two such groups.
In one are the people who inherited offshore accounts. Mr. Mastracchio said a large portion of his clients were relatives of Holocaust survivors who had set up Swiss bank accounts to protect what money they had. Problems arose when relatives inherited these accounts and then had to decide what to do with them.
While the I.R.S. has always allowed people to amend their tax returns back six years and pay any tax plus penalties, the United States Treasury created a form in 2004 requiring citizens to declare all foreign bank accounts.
But few people knew about this requirement, which carried severe penalties for not complying. People who intentionally did not file the form were subject to fines up to 50 percent of the account balance, though those who could prove they did not know about it were fined only up to $10,000.
The other group is people who moved to the United States and maintained bank accounts in their home countries. ''They thought it was two different systems and they didn't know the U.S. wanted income reported worldwide,'' Mr. Mastracchio said. ''It wasn't tax evasion that created the problem; it was life circumstances.''
Both groups still had to pay penalties, but they were not as severe as those for people who set out to evade taxes. One case in which people cannot hope for leniency is when they created structures to hide the true ownership of an account.
''It's not just someone opened an account at HSBC in Geneva in his name,'' Mr. Asher said. ''It's he opened a foundation in Panama and the foundation opened an account at some Swiss cantonal bank. That's an additional layer that really draws the ire of the I.R.S.''
LEGAL ACCOUNTS People who legally open offshore accounts do so for a variety of reasons that range from the simple to the secretive. There is nothing illegal about the accounts as long as they are declared and taxes paid.
A child may be studying abroad, or someone may have a business interest in another country. In both cases, they need a bank account in that currency.
Or, given the global economic uncertainty, investors may want to open an investment account denominated in a foreign currency to diversify their portfolio.
''It's a shame that offshore banking is painted with this stigma,'' Mr. Wellner said. ''People think it's to hide drug money or for illicit purposes. In the vast majority of cases, it's legitimate.''
Still, a big reason to set up these accounts is to shield assets from future litigation. Doctors often set up the accounts, allowing them to shield assets if they are sued for malpractice. But this is even more of a reason to make sure the account complies with all tax laws.
''If the patient loses the malpractice suit and says, 'I'm going to tell the I.R.S.,' the doctor has to be fully compliant so he can say, 'Go ahead,' '' Mr. Asher said. If the doctor can say that, ''then he's fine.''
While that may not sit well with some people, it is perfectly legal.

HEADLINE: The Siege Of Planned Parenthood

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
As if we didn't have enough wars, the House of Representatives has declared one against Planned Parenthood.
Maybe it's all part of a grand theme. Last month, they voted to repeal the health care law. This month, they're going after an organization that provides millions of women with both family-planning services and basic health medical care, like pap smears and screening for diabetes, breast cancer, cervical cancer and sexually transmitted diseases.
Our legislative slogan for 2011: Let Them Use Leeches. 
''What is more fiscally responsible than denying any and all funding to Planned Parenthood of America?'' demanded Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the chief sponsor of a bill to bar the government from directing any money to any organization that provides abortion services.
Planned Parenthood doesn't use government money to provide abortions; Congress already prohibits that, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. (Another anti-abortion bill that's coming up for hearing originally proposed changing the wording to ''forcible rape,'' presumably under the theory that there was a problem with volunteer rape victims. On that matter at least, cooler heads prevailed.)
Planned Parenthood does pay for its own abortion services, though, and that's what makes them a target. Pence has 154 co-sponsors for his bill. He was helped this week by an anti-abortion group called Live Action, which conducted a sting operation at 12 Planned Parenthood clinics in six states, in an effort to connect the clinic staff to child prostitution.
''Planned Parenthood aids and abets the sexual abuse and prostitution of minors,'' announced Lila Rose, the beautiful anti-abortion activist who led the project. The right wing is currently chock-full of stunning women who want to end their gender's right to control their own bodies. Homely middle-aged men are just going to have to find another sex to push around.
Live Action hired an actor who posed as a pimp and told Planned Parenthood counselors that he might have contracted a sexually transmitted disease from ''one of the girls I manage.'' He followed up with questions about how to obtain contraceptives and abortions, while indicating that some of his ''girls'' were under age and illegally in the country.
One counselor, shockingly, gave the ''pimp'' advice on how to game the system and was summarily fired when the video came out. But the others seem to have answered his questions accurately and flatly. Planned Parenthood says that after the man left, all the counselors -- including the one who was fired -- reported the conversation to their supervisors, who called the authorities. (One Arizona police department, the organization said, refused to file a report.)
Still, there is no way to look good while providing useful information to a self-proclaimed child molester, even if the cops get called. That, presumably, is why Live Action chose the scenario.
''We have a zero tolerance of nonreporting anything that would endanger a minor,'' said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood. ''We do the same thing public hospitals do and public clinics do.''
But here's the most notable thing about this whole debate: The people trying to put Planned Parenthood out of business do not seem concerned about what would happen to the 1.85 million low-income women who get family-planning help and medical care at the clinics each year. It just doesn't come up. There's not even a vague contingency plan.
''I haven't seen that they want to propose an alternative,'' said Richards.
There are tens of millions Americans who oppose abortion because of deeply held moral principles. But they're attached to a political movement that sometimes seems to have come unmoored from any concern for life after birth.
There is no comparable organization to Planned Parenthood, providing the same kind of services on a national basis. If there were, most of the women eligible for Medicaid-financed family-planning assistance wouldn't have to go without it. In Texas, which has one of the highest teenage birthrates in the country, only about 20 percent of low-income women get that kind of help. Yet Planned Parenthood is under attack, and the State Legislature has diverted some of its funding to crisis pregnancy centers, which provide no medical care and tend to be staffed by volunteers dedicated to dissuading women from having abortions.
In Washington, the new Republican majority that promised to do great things about jobs, jobs, jobs is preparing for hearings on a bill to make it economically impossible for insurance companies to offer policies that cover abortions. And in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry, faced with an epic budget crisis that's left the state's schools and health care services in crisis, has brought out emergency legislation -- requiring mandatory sonograms for women considering abortion.

HEADLINE: China's Currency Avoids 'Manipulated' Ruling Again

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said on Friday that China's currency remained ''substantially undervalued'' compared with the dollar but declined once again to cite Beijing for currency manipulation. 
The administration cited commitments made by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, during a state visit here last month to promote ''exchange rate reform'' and allow greater ''exchange rate flexibility.''
In a twice-a-year report required by Congress, the Treasury Department reiterated its view that China's longstanding management of the exchange rate ran the risk of worsening inflation in China, expanding the supply of credit too quickly and potentially destabilizing the country's robust economic growth.
American officials have long contended that China's currency policy has the effect of making Chinese exports to the United States cheaper, and American goods flowing to China more costly, than they otherwise would be.
The report concluded that China had not met the standard for currency manipulation -- a legal designation that could initiate economic retaliation by the United States -- in light of its pledge last June to allow the currency, the renminbi, to move more freely. The pace of the renminbi's appreciation has accelerated in recent months, and Mr. Hu pledged last month to build on that progress.
''Treasury's view, however, is that progress thus far is insufficient and that more rapid progress is needed,'' the report stated.
In nominal terms, the renminbi has appreciated against the dollar by about 3.6 percent since last summer. But after adjusting for China's higher rate of inflation, and the relative weight of China's share of world trade, the renminbi has appreciated 5 to 6 percent relative to the dollar -- or as much as 10 percent on an annualized basis.
That movement -- which is similar to the appreciation China permitted from 2005 to 2008 -- has prompted the administration to soften its tone on the issue.
''I smell a deal here: deafening silence from the Americans in return for, maybe, some kind of commitment from the Chinese to let the rate move,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization here.
Last September, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill seeking to add pressure on China to allow its currency to rise in value. But the new Republican leadership in that chamber is divided on the issue.
In the Senate, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed disappointment with the new report, saying in a statement: ''China has been given a free pass on its currency practices for far too long. We need to hold China and our other trading partners accountable for their actions, and we must acknowledge -- and take steps to remedy -- those actions that harm the competitiveness of American businesses and workers.''

HEADLINE: Rising Stress on Campus: Looking for the Causes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Record Level of Stress Found in College Freshmen'' (front page, Jan. 27) suggests that the increase in depressed and anxious college kids may be linked to the weak economy. While economic stress is real, there are broader truths behind the surge. 
Many children whose treatment for psychiatric and learning disorders allowed them to succeed in high school lose their support system in college. Eager to reinvent themselves, they stop taking medication and hide learning problems. New friends miss key signs of distress.
Girls have a more negative view of their emotional well-being than boys, and the gap is growing, reflecting the increasing pressure they feel to excel. Hypercritical of their bodies and performance, girls are vulnerable to depression and eating disorders.
Still, this self-reported surge can be a good thing, because it means that children feel comfortable admitting unhappiness and seeking help. That's important, because untreated mental health problems can be catastrophic.
Harold S. Koplewicz New York, Jan. 27, 2011
The writer, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, is president of the Child Mind Institute.
To the Editor:
While the poor economy may be partly to blame for increasing levels of stress on college campuses, I think we have another culprit: our obsessive use of social media.
Pay a visit to any college campus and I guarantee that you will find students wrapped up in their digital social lives. For too many students, the Internet is a blank canvas with which to paint a new, more exciting identity. But our infatuation with social media increases both social pressure and distractions, creating all-too-tempting alternatives to learning.
It's not fair that my art history lecturer must compete with Facebook for attention. Northern Renaissance art will always lose to the seductive temptation of social media when computers are allowed in class.
Perhaps social and academic stress could be alleviated if we could begin a more frank discussion about limiting social media tools at our colleges.
Louise H. Dufresne Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Jan. 27, 2011
The writer is a sophomore at Vassar College.
To the Editor:
''Record Level of Stress Found in College Freshmen'' notes that mental health issues among college freshmen often start before college. This is an important point that should not be lost.
In addition to ramping up mental health services on college campuses, we urge a strong focus on the mental health of our nation's youth in early adolescence, when symptoms first begin to appear. According to National Institute of Mental Health research, over half of all mental health disorders have their onset by age 14. And it typically takes two to four years between the onset of symptoms and a full-blown mental disorder. This gives a window of opportunity to address mental illness in early easier-to-treat stages.
Research has shown that mental health checkups are an accurate and effective way to identify mental illness. Making mental health checkups a routine part of adolescent care would provide at-risk teenagers a critical opportunity to prevent long-term disability and the many other negative consequences that too often result from mental illness. Our teenagers deserve nothing less.
Laurie Flynn New York, Jan. 28, 2011
The writer is executive director of TeenScreen National Center for Mental Health Checkups at Columbia University.

HEADLINE: Steelers' Coach Takes a Quiet Route to Brilliance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Fort Worth
During a Super Bowl week with so much hype and thousands of words, Pittsburgh Coach Mike Tomlin spoke sparingly and economically, with precision and grace.
Tomlin chooses words carefully, thinks before he talks and rarely blurts out an uncensored thought.
He acknowledges his roots but plays down the significance of being an African-American head coach in the N.F.L. 
Yet if Tomlin leads the Steelers to victory on Sunday against the Green Bay Packers and wins his second Super Bowl ring in four seasons, he may become the first African-American head coach to be called brilliant.
The language of adulation has been reserved for white coaches. Tomlin can bridge this divide, though that depends more on the news media than it ever will on Tomlin.
A pattern emerged last season when the Indianapolis Colts started 14-0 under the first-year coach Jim Caldwell. Many commentators attributed the Colts' success to Peyton Manning, not Caldwell. Even Tony Dungy, the first African-American head coach to win the Lombardi Trophy, was minimized as a good coach who thrived only because Manning was his quarterback.
But there is no question that Tomlin, not Ben Roethlisberger, runs the Steelers.
With a victory Sunday, Tomlin will be one championship ring behind Joe Gibbs, Bill Walsh and Bill Belichick, and two behind Chuck Noll, the Steelers legend who won four in the 1970s.
Noll began his career in Pittsburgh in 1969, going 1-13, 5-9 and 6-8 in his first three seasons. Belichick endured five mostly miserable seasons as the coach in Cleveland, held two jobs as an assistant coach, then was hired by New England and connected with Tom Brady.
Tomlin, 37, does not come off as a romantic and does not engage in nostalgia. He is confident and unapologetic. Asked how reaching two Super Bowls in just four years contrasted with his expectations when he took the Steelers job, Tomlin said, ''It's probably about two Super Bowls too short of my vision.''
''I'm not in a reflection mode,'' he continued. ''I'm just trying to do it. We've got a really good football team -- guys who are not only talented, but are selfless in work. So we are trying to maximize the opportunity that we have. Maybe later in life when we're all old, maybe we'll sit around and reflect a little bit.''
Rex Ryan, the Jets' bodacious coach, showed Tomlin the ultimate respect: he didn't boast before their teams played in the A.F.C. championship game. Ryan had been talking a blue streak all season and during the playoffs. He said matchups with Manning and then Belichick were personal. When the time came time to play Pittsburgh, Ryan spoke of Tomlin in glowing terms. ''He's one of my favorite coaches,'' Ryan said. ''He's a man's man, and his team plays like that.''
Dungy gave Tomlin his start in the N.F.L., as he has done for nearly every African-American head coach. When asked about Dungy's effect on his life, Tomlin lowered his shield for a moment last week and allowed a look at the way he sees himself and his role as head coach.
''I can give a really pointed answer because I am very conscious of Coach Dungy's influence in terms of how I do my job,'' Tomlin said, adding: ''He tries to lead through service, and I do the same. I learned that from him in providing the men what they need to be great. Every day when I go to work, I don't think about things I have to do, I think about the things I can do to make my men successful. So I have a servant's mentality in terms of how I approach my job, and I get that from Coach Dungy.''
Tomlin has had to put that philosophy to use with the Steelers throughout the season, imploring backup players to step in and perform, and young players to grow up and contribute.
''If you have a helmet on, you're a guy who is capable of making deciding plays,'' Tomlin said. ''We don't grade on a curve. If I give any of these guys a helmet on Sunday, I expect them to potentially put themselves in position to be the reason why they win. I think there is not a man in our locker room who doesn't embrace that. We're not interested in style points.''
Tomlin resisted the hype.
He answered questions the way he coaches, directly and efficiently. Asked to describe his emotions in such a pressure-packed spot, Tomlin said: ''I'm a robot. I'm just going to ride the wave.''
Two Super Bowl appearance in his first four seasons as head coach.
That is one great wave.

HEADLINE: Marathon's Tiny School District Grabs at a Lifeline

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH; msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
MARATHON -- If you close the school, you close the town.
The phrase has the burnish of a truism in this outpost amid the vast, high-desert expanse of far West Texas, about 50 miles north of Big Bend National Park. The 400 or so residents here are closely watching the fate of their tiny public school -- and working hard to keep it open.
The senior class at Marathon Independent School District will have a valedictorian this spring -- Michelle Campbell, 17. She is also the only senior. With a pre-kindergarten through 12th grade enrollment of just 56 students, Marathon I.S.D. is one of the smallest districts in the state.
But for Marathon's ranchers, artists (trendy Marfa is 60 miles away), a growing number of retired baby boomers and the occasional political celebrity (the large family ranch of the state comptroller, Susan Combs, is nearby), the school's fate is critical to the survival of this remote town known for its blend of the frontier and funky. 
Now a new initiative, a foundation created by residents to help support the school, offers fresh hope for the area. And if what is happening here is successful, it could serve as a model for rural towns scattered across Texas looking to shield their way of life from the death knell of school closings.
Long before the State Legislature convened this month and presented initial budgets that would cut $10 billion in financing to public schools, Marathon I.S.D. was in severe-enough trouble that the Texas Education Agency appointed a monitor to watch its finances.
When Neal Harrison became superintendent in 2009, the district had just finished paying off a $248,000 loan to cover its debt, which left it short on savings. He points out that because of the district's size, $1,000 is ''like talking $100,000 to somebody else.'' Harrison scrutinized every line of the budget as the district went into a state of financial exigency last year, which allows the district to eliminate jobs.
Under his supervision, the school did away with four staff positions, reduced stipends for extracurricular activities and travel, and combined grades that had only a few students. Now, Mr. Harrison said he expects the education agency to end its conservatorship by the end of the school year.
The struggle to keep the school doors open in Marathon attracted the attention of Claudia Huntington, a San Antonio resident whose husband is a local landowner. In June, Ms. Huntington helped create the Marathon Foundation, and since then, three ranching families in the area, with more to come, she said, have contributed more than $200,000.
The foundation has developed eight grants intended to help the district compete for teachers and students. They include $20,000 a year in college scholarships for students who have attended Marathon for at least four years, and $4,000 signing bonuses for teachers.
''We want Marathon to stay healthy,'' Ms. Huntington said. ''We are very aware that without a school that isn't going to happen.''
For the town's major employers and property holders -- like the historic Gage Hotel -- a school is vital to keeping families, and therefore customers and employees, living in the town. But Ms. Huntington also said their work is motivated by the belief that it is the right thing to do.
Having a school helps maintain property values, too, said Marci Roberts, who owns the local grocery store. Marathon's economic vibrancy distinguishes the school from those in other rural areas, she said.
''Marathon is pretty thriving. It's a major tourist town,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''You close the school, and now that's at risk.''
Harold Cook, an Austin Democratic political strategist with a home in Marathon, agreed.
''For those who lament the decline of small-town America, try being a small town, otherwise vibrant, building on a solid economic development foundation, while attempting to explain to potential business owners why there are no local schools for their children,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It just doesn't work.''
Mr. Harrison said that through scrimping and keeping a close watch on spending, the school now has money in the bank. And even with the impending reduction in state money, he expects it will stay there.
While the district will feel the cuts, Mr. Harrison said, it will not be as bad as it would have been a few years ago. ''Then, we'd be out of business,'' he said.
For now, consolidation, not money or low test scores, is Mr. Harrison's biggest worry. What weighs on him is a suspicion that neighboring Alpine, with a population of 6,400 and the seat of Brewster County, would not mind absorbing those 56 students and the property values that come with them. If that happened, students in Marathon would be bused 30 miles up the road.
''I don't want any of my 5- and 6-year-olds to ride a bus to Alpine,'' he said. ''That's just not right.''
Consolidating small districts has not gained traction in the 82nd Legislature -- so far -- as a solution to the state's education budget woes. That may change as the administrative costs of running the state's schools come under scrutiny. For the past several legislative sessions, Representative Fred Brown, Republican of Bryan, has proposed legislation that would combine districts within a county. Passing it this time around is a priority for Mr. Brown, a spokesman said.
Marathon could also lose students because it cannot offer the sports and other extracurricular activities or the more varied curriculum that is provided by larger schools. Currently, it shares services like diagnostic testing, speech therapy and support for students with learning disabilities through a network of 11 other districts in the area.
Students at the school are often taught in combined classes; in middle school, fifth and sixth graders and seventh and eighth graders study together.. A goal of the Marathon Foundation is to help the school attract enough students to sustain a six-man football team.
But the question remains whether such a tiny school should continue to operate independently. Those who want to see the town survive are adamant that the answer is yes.
''If you drive through Texas, you'll see cemeteries,'' Mr. Harrison said. ''There used to be a town there. And once they lost their school, it just went away. It would be disastrous for Marathon.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the Marathon Independent School District, and a foundation created by residents to help support it, misstated the amount of the district's debt when Neal Harrison became superintendent in 2009. The district had just finished paying off a $248,000 loan to cover its debt; it was not $248,000 in debt.

HEADLINE: A Death at Soho House

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
SYLVIE CACHAY started the morning of Dec. 8 the same way she started every day before it, wondering what she could do to get her swimwear business back off the ground. She was a promising young designer, but one who was frustrated by having to work for someone else's company, not her own.
That day, her friend Lesa Wright McHale had e-mailed her with some news: after a decade as a partner in a fashion public relations company, she was starting one of her own. Ms. Cachay's response was, as usual, full of encouragement, humor and expressive punctuation.
''Where's the office???'' Ms. Cachay wrote back. ''Can I rent space? Or, be there for free, haha!!! Okay, no -- I'm kinda serious and would consider both... work for you??? Again, seriously!'' 
Ms. Cachay had closed her swimwear line, called Syla, in 2008, and she often asked Ms. Wright McHale for advice. She asked all her friends, in e-mail messages, on the phone, at dinner. She was determined to succeed with a drive and a single-mindedness that escaped no one. In that note to Ms. Wright McHale, Ms. Cachay wrote: ''I was just in Miami and I swear random women were asking me about my suits! I mean how much more of a hint do I need??? Now, money -- that's the question!''
There was no question in the minds of Ms. Cachay's friends that she would someday make it big in the fashion business. She was intelligent, compassionate and gorgeous, too, practically the ideal model for her own collection. She was not unlike many young women who come to New York to follow their dreams, feeling independent and invincible -- imagining the kind of world portrayed in ''Sex and the City.'' She wanted that life from an early age, and she seemed to possess the tools and talent to attain it.
So the events of that night, when Ms. Cachay's body was discovered in an overflowing bathtub at the members-only club Soho House, could not have seemed less plausible to her friends: a sudden, inexplicable ending for the life of the 33-year-old designer.
It was a tabloid sensation: a young, attractive woman with a glamorous career, ''a famous fashion designer,'' as she was described in the news media (though she was not yet that), and a much younger boyfriend who sounded like trouble. He was Nicholas Brooks, 24, a man who was often out of work, with whom she argued on several occasions and whose father, the Oscar-winning songwriter Joseph Brooks, was at the center of another scandal, accused of raping or sexually assaulting numerous young women in an ongoing case. Ms. Cachay had told her family over Thanksgiving that she was breaking off the relationship.
And yet Ms. Cachay had entered Soho House, the exclusive meatpacking district club, which also has hotel rooms, shortly after midnight that night with Mr. Brooks. A few hours later, after guests reported water leaking through the ceiling of a fourth-floor room, her body was discovered with marks around her neck in the bathtub of the room above. Mr. Brooks, who has denied killing Ms. Cachay, was arraigned last month on a second-degree-murder charge, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
''You can't wrap your head around information like that,'' said Alicia Bell, a fashion designer who was a longtime friend of Ms. Cachay's. ''I look at e-mails from her and they are full of exclamation points and underlines. They are so alive. She had so much life, and that is the one thing that is so confusing to me, because I know there was so much more that she wanted to do.''
SYLVIE CACHAY came from a wealthy, tight-knit family that encouraged her interests and afforded her many privileges. Her father, Dr. Antonio Cachay, a prominent doctor, and her mother, Sylvia Panizo Cachay, an artist, maintain homes in McLean, Va., and their native Lima, Peru, where Ms. Cachay grew up with her mother's son and stepson from a previous marriage, Patrick and David Orlando. Ms. Cachay attended the Langley School, and then the Madeira School, private schools near Washington. The two things she most loved, said her half brother, Patrick Orlando, four-and-a-half years her elder, were animals and fashion magazines.
''She had ferrets, hamsters, birds that she had saved off the street, turtles -- she was a really kind person,'' Mr. Orlando said. ''From very early on, she would take my mother's Vogue magazines, when she was 5 or 6 years old, and cut them up. She would dress up in my mom's clothing. She was really artistic, doodling and drawing throughout her whole life. It never really stopped. I always thought she would want to be a model, to be on that side of the business, but she never pursued that. It was always her dream to make her own designs.''
The summer after her high school graduation, Ms. Cachay came to New York to enroll in an intensive study program at Parsons the New School for Design. She planned to study fine arts at Marymount University in Arlington, Va., in the fall, to remain near her family, but the summer was to be her chance to explore the city and its fashion firsthand.
The first day, she met Ms. Bell, a freshman who had just arrived from Chicago with her curly blond hair wrapped in two braids to either side. Ms. Bell must have looked like a hippie to Ms. Cachay, who was dressed in stylish, professional clothes. They were opposites, Ms. Bell said, but they bonded right away, and because Ms. Bell's roommate at the dorms on East 12th Street never showed up, Ms. Cachay took her place and moved in. They ended up spending the following summer together at Parsons in Paris, daydreaming of starting their own lines.
''She was crazy about fashion,'' Ms. Bell said. ''We both knew early on that was what we wanted to do, and also that if you are serious about being in the fashion industry that it's not going to be easy.''
In 1999, after graduating from Marymount, Ms. Cachay moved to New York fulltime and landed an internship at Marc Jacobs. She arrived with her college boyfriend, who was pursuing a career in banking. ''She was a natural for New York,'' Mr. Orlando said. ''She wanted to hang out with interesting, creative people, and live a true New York experience, the fashion designer-slash-artist experience.''
A few months later, at Tommy Hilfiger, she started as an assistant designer for juniors sportswear, not exactly a glamorous position. But within a few years, Mr. Hilfiger, who said she displayed ''a great deal of talent and dedication,'' promoted her to head designer for women's sportswear and sent Ms. Cachay and her team to Japan to scout for street trends.
She worked long hours, friends said, but still attended every baby shower and family wedding to which she was invited. Even as an adult she would travel to visit her family in Peru two or three times each year. In 2002, when she was just 25, she was recruited to join Victoria's Secret to lead its design team for swimwear.
''She wanted to make her own name,'' Francoise Jakobsson, a cousin of Ms. Cachay, recently recalled. ''I'm sure her background gave Sylvie privilege, but she wanted to prove herself.''
In 2003, Ms. Cachay married the college boyfriend. But he wasn't really into the fashion scene, and talked about leaving New York. ''Sylvie wanted to stay in New York with her career,'' Mr. Orlando said. They divorced after a year.
She had changed, her friends said. She wanted to be more creative, to go out more, and she was ready to start her own company. She began to date an Australian photographer whose career was also taking off. And through another friend, she was introduced to a Mexican family that was willing to put up $2 million to help her start Syla in 2006.
Ms. Wright McHale remembered getting a call that year from Ms. Cachay, who was looking for a publicist for her new collection. Upon entering Ms. Cachay's studio on Lispenard Street in TriBeCa, Ms. Wright McHale remembered being floored by entire walls that were covered with swatches of Italian fabrics, hand-drawn prints, magazine clippings and other photographs that inspired her. An ornate birdcage, off to one side, held a very large ratty-looking pigeon.
''I was like, excuse me, is that a pigeon?'' Ms. Wright McHale said. ''An injured animal would find her and have a very good chance of coming home with her, anywhere she went.''
Ms. Wright McHale loved the collection. The swimwear had a bright, bohemian flair, with inventive details, like an adjustable strap of a bikini bottom, similar to those that are commonly used on bras. ''Not only did she completely get it, she had everything buttoned up from the logo to the marketing material,'' Ms. Wright McHale said. ''She took everything to the nth degree. You were drinking the punch within a few minutes of meeting her.''
Alexa Cahill, the global director of a fashion showroom called Salon9, had a similar impression when she met her in early 2008. ''You could tell this line was her passion,'' she said.
Spring had just begun, and things seemed to be taking off for Ms. Cachay. She was engaged to the photographer (but they later called it off and decided to remain close friends). With Ms. Wright McHale and Ms. Cahill, she began to plan her first runway show at a big swimwear trade show in Miami that July. Her entire family flew in for the event, where Ms. Cachay showed a Syla collection that was a knockout, with turquoise bathing suits and cover-ups.
Barneys New York, Lane Crawford, Shopbop and Anthropologie all placed orders for the line, and the press lined up to interview Ms. Cahill. One of her designs was chosen for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
''I've only seen it happen one other time that quickly,'' Ms. Cahill said. Ms. Cachay was having a blast. And that made it that much harder to see her business fail.
As soon as the economy faltered that October, the Mexican investors pulled out. Ms. Cachay was devastated. According to Ms. Cahill, Ms. Cachay jokingly described the family as ''private-jet wealthy,'' and she was surprised that they would give up on the line just as it appeared to be succeeding.
''Fashion is not a quick business to make money in,'' Ms. Cahill said. ''They wanted a quick return.''
Ms. Wright McHale said the next several months were really hard for Ms. Cachay: ''It was like losing a dream. You had ascended to such great heights in a short period of time, and the rug was pulled out from under you.'' At the end of 2009, she took a job as the head designer at Anne Cole, which was looking to revamp its image.
The night of June 14, 2010, Ms. Cachay went on her first date with Nicholas Brooks, according to Ms. Bell. The two had been introduced by a mutual friend at a party.
She was walking her dogs -- teacup poodles named Pepper and Loli, short for Lolita -- late that night. She did not walk them on leashes, and the dogs were so devoted to her that she had never had a problem controlling them, though they often drew a crowd. Pepper was 7 to 8 years old at the time, and Loli was a year older.
That night, a group of people approached them on Hudson Street. One of them startled Pepper, who dashed into the street and was hit by a car. Ms. Cachay had to euthanize him. This, Ms. Cachay's mother said shortly after her death, was one of the reasons her relationship with Mr. Brooks may have continued as it did. He consoled her.
Ms. Cachay, despite the image conjured by her membership to Soho House, was not a person who went out constantly or partied irresponsibly, her friends said. She went to dinner with friends or to a neighborhood bar, Employees Only. At least that was the case until her close friend Ms. Bell moved to Chicago a year ago, and Ms. Cachay said she believed she needed other outlets to meet people, especially potential allies for her business plans.
''I remember her talking about Soho House and that she wanted to join,'' Ms. Bell said of a conversation last spring. ''She was so gorgeous, and they were looking for more creative types. People wanted her to be part of whatever they were doing. She had the credentials.''
None of her friends said that they liked Mr. Brooks, but Ms. Cachay did not express any serious concerns. She told her friends he was not her boyfriend, but then they would go out together again. ''I did not like this guy,'' Ms. Bell said. ''It didn't make sense to me. She wanted to find love like everybody in the world, get married and have kids. I didn't understand. This didn't seem like a guy who wanted to have kids. He was 24 years old.''
Ms. Wright McHale said, ''I got the impression she knew he wasn't right for her.''
What happened the night Ms. Cachay died is not entirely clear. According to documents filed in Manhattan Criminal Court, Mr. Brooks told the police that he had accidentally caused a fire in Ms. Cachay's apartment by setting a candle too close to her bed, and that they wanted to stay someplace else because of the smoky smell.
The police and prosecutors have said that Ms. Cachay and Mr. Brooks checked into a room at 12:30 a.m., Dec. 9, and that Mr. Brooks left the room at 2:15 a.m. Her body was discovered at 2:49 a.m. Mr. Brooks, who had said he had gone out for drinks, returned to the hotel around 3:30 a.m. His defense attorney, Jeffrey C. Hoffman, said at an arraignment on Dec. 11 that the fact that Mr. Brooks returned to the room at all should cast doubt on the theory that he had harmed or killed Ms. Cachay.
But Ms. Cachay's family remains certain that Mr. Brooks is responsible for her death. Her cousin, Ms. Jakobsson, said the anger she feels about what happened becomes more intense with each day.
''This wasn't something that should have happened to her,'' Ms. Jakobsson said. ''The choices she made in her life -- she didn't take those things lightly. She was intelligent, too. She wasn't some innocent little fresh face who didn't know what she was doing. She was so New York.''
The other day, Ms. Jakobsson stumbled across an old photograph that showed all the cousins together as children during one of their visits to Peru. In the image, Sylvie faces the camera, holding an object up to the camera. It was an injured turtle that she had just rescued.

To the Editor:
Re: ''Go Ask Mary,'' Habitats, Jan. 30:
I had a smile on my face reading the delightful, heartwarming article about Mary Sansone. What a woman! I wanted to run to Brooklyn to hear more of her life and stories. It reminded me of when I was growing up in the 1940s and '50s. My father owned a tire business and when he had customers who couldn't pay him for the tires, he put a ''barter'' system in place. Our house was painted and our brick front steps were repaired. 
There were other ''exchanges'' over the years through which he was able to give his customers a sense of dignity. Today, with the economic problems that exist for many people, this barter system seems like a good idea.

HEADLINE: City's Inequities Belie World-Class Imagery

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Wandering the aisles of a Jewel on West 87th Street last week, I asked the African-American clientele about the mayoral race and heard chagrin over Carol Moseley Braun, support for Rahm Emanuel and a distinct sense of isolation.
When it came to the politics, it was a patently unscientific survey. When it came to the larger social reality, I suspect that a Gallup poll would reach the same conclusion. 
''The mayor promoted us as a world-class city,'' said Lucas Redmond, a retired refrigeration repairman, using ''promoted'' in a positive light. ''But he wasn't able to do much for the poor.''
The next mayor will have to deal with a big budget deficit, stratospheric unfunded pension liabilities, an inconsistent school system, mass transit in need of rejuvenation and the complexity of urban crime. But there's also the reality of multiple Chicagos, set apart from one another in heart, mind and pocketbook.
Asked about any parting regrets at a University of Chicago forum on the future last week, Mayor Richard M. Daley pointed to insufficient progress in a school system that remains a nationally watched laboratory of change.
He could well have added those left behind by the city's ascent into the upper ranks of globally important economies. It goes beyond race and includes intertwined elements of class, skills and culture and results in a gloomy resignation at odds with the dazzle and shine of the Bean in Millennium Park, a symbol of civic vitality to many and to the outside world.
In an unexpected way, the recent trial and sentencing hearing of Jon Burge, the notoriously heavy-handed former Chicago police commander, brought these matters to the fore via an unlikely witness.
He was Adam Green, a young historian at the University of Chicago who researches topics related to African-Americans in the city. Federal prosecutors beckoned him during a two-day sentencing hearing to underscore the way lack of punishment for police misconduct undermines trust in authority.
Mr. Green's research and conclusions resonate well beyond a minority community's relationship to crime and the police. It might be worth the next mayor's time to check out his work, even if solutions for the challenges that Mr. Green details are bedeviling.
During his Burge testimony, Mr. Green referred to deep segregation here, pointing to well-known indices in the academic world, especially among demographers who crunch census data. Those means of quantifying segregation put us on the threshold of what the experts call hypersegregation.
''Most tellingly, the figures for Chicago are worse than those of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore and St. Louis -- none of these models of racially unified cities,'' Mr. Green told me last week in an e-mail exchange.
Mr. Daley has displayed impressive salesmanship, recently exemplified by President Hu Jintao of China making Chicago his only American stop beyond Washington. And you can make the case that, especially after the racially divisive Council Wars of the 1980s, he has been a healer.
But when it comes to the data on segregation and isolation, only Detroit, Milwaukee and Newark are worse than Chicago, Mr. Green said. ''And they are not the kind of company that Daley boosters would like to have Chicago associated with.''
Manifestations of segregation abound, according to a 2006 Loyola University Chicago study. They can be seen in income and employment, wealth generation, transportation and job access, housing, education, health and crime.
The median income for black households is 66 percent of the average white household's, with 10 of the poorest 15 neighborhoods at least 94 percent black. Blacks are five times more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites. The jobless rate for blacks far outpaces whites, with housing segregation between blacks and whites of the same social class as bad as that between all blacks and whites.
The realities of separate and unequal are everywhere: commuting times, pensions, proximity to branch banks, reading and math scores, dropout rates, school segregation, obesity, asthma, cancer, teenage pregnancy, breast cancer, drug arrests, reliance on unlicensed caregivers, makeup of the foster-child population, incarceration and victimization by crime.
The crunching of 2010 census data continues, so we just don't know if there will be improvement in any of those measurements. Anecdotal evidence, like what I gathered on my visit to a South Side Jewel, suggests they won't improve, certainly not enough to bridge huge gulfs.
''These are facts which need to be spoken by anyone who would claim to have united the city, or claim to unite it in years to come,'' Mr. Green said.
Whoever wins the election will be steward of a city growing in reputation, self-confidence and value. But the candidates best not fool themselves: it remains woefully divided.

HEADLINE: Get Married, Save Thousands on Tuition

BYLINE: By TESS TOWNSEND; ttownsend@baycitizen.org. 
ttownsend@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Students worldwide compete to attend the University of California, Berkeley, considered one of the best universities in the United States.
But economically, in-state students have a huge advantage over non-Californians, for whom tuition costs an additional $22,000 a year (as of 2010-11). 
The financial stakes are so high that some out-of-state students are employing an unusual technique to meet the University of California's strict residency requirements: they're getting married.
These marriages do not technically break any laws, but students are understandably hesitant to speak publicly about them. The Bay Citizen was able to find nine such couples.
U.C. students from out of state must meet three requirements to establish residency -- physical presence, intent to stay and financial independence -- a complicated process that takes at least two years. The independence test is the hardest to pass.
When students marry, they can automatically claim themselves as independent, provided their parents do not claim them as dependents on their taxes. After that, gaining in-state tuition is a breeze.
A few years ago, a student from the Midwest believed she could not afford the annual $30,000 in student fees (including $20,000 in out-of-state tuition), so she posted on Facebook that she was looking for a husband.. (The woman requested anonymity out of fear of repercussions from U.C.)
An out-of-state student whom she did not know responded to her post, and they married in 2007, the summer before her junior year. She graduated in 2009 and estimated that the marriage had saved her $50,000. The couple has divorced.
Of 16,000 Berkeley undergraduates who received financial aid during 2009-10, just 416 were married. University officials said they were not aware of any students marrying for tuition purposes; the number of married students has not changed significantly in recent years, they said.
''If a student has a valid marriage license, it is accepted as proof of his/her marriage,'' a U.C. spokesman, Ricardo Vazquez, wrote in an e-mail.
Together, the nine couples identified by The Bay Citizen cost U.C. Berkeley an estimated $350,000 in out-of-state tuition.
After she was accepted to Berkeley in 2006, Elaine Davis of Utah tried hard to establish California residency. She registered to vote in California, got a California driver's license, worked full time in the state, filed her own taxes and had her parents stop claiming her as a dependent.
When Berkeley still denied her residency (living in an apartment owned by her father disqualified her as independent), Ms. Davis married a childhood friend. She saved $38,000 in out-of-state tuition over two years.
It is impossible to know how common such marriages are, but at least one national Web site exists to facilitate this kind of union.
Whypaytuition.com, created by Rick Conley, an air traffic controller in Texas, is a matchmaking site for couples seeking to marry in order to gain in-state tuition privileges and other savings that come from being classified as independent. It has attracted only 56 registered users since going online in 2008.
Marriage, of course, does not necessarily relieve students of the cost of college. Despite the perks of saying ''I do,'' Ms. Davis still graduated owing $29,000 in school loans.

 BODY:
LOSING THE NEWS: The Future of the News That Feeds Democracy, by Alex S. Jones (Oxford University, $16.95.) Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, offers a glimpse of the void we'll inhabit if the task of newspapers withers away. Without the ''iron core of information,'' Jones warns, editorial pages, columnists, bloggers, talk-show hosts and others won't have much to say -- and the public will have little clue about what those in power are up to. 
THE INVISIBLE BRIDGE, by Julie Orringer. (Vintage, $15.95.) Inspired by her family's history, Orringer's evocative first novel captures how Hungary's Jews were devastated by the Holocaust. Andras Levi, a promising architecture student, leaves his native Hungary to study in Paris in the late 1930s -- until his scholarship is revoked when anti-Jewish laws go into effect. Forced to return to Budapest, Andras is conscripted to serve in a labor unit and is driven apart from his wife, a dancer and Hungarian-born Jew in Paris whose secret past threatens her family's fortunes. ''The strength of 'The Invisible Bridge' lies in Orringer's ability to make us care so deeply about the people of her all-too-real fictional world,'' Andrew Ervin wrote in the Book Review.
THE NEXT HUNDRED MILLION: America in 2050, by Joel Kotkin (Penguin, $16.) By the Census Bureau's estimate, the American population reached 300 million in October 2006. (It topped 200 million less than 40 years earlier, and passed 100 million in 1915.) As Kotkin, an urban scholar, sees it, by 2050 America will be home to 400 million people, and the nation's ''demographic vitality'' -- driven by higher birthrates and a continuing influx of immigrants -- will make it not only bigger but better.
BLACKLANDS, by Belinda Bauer (Simon & Schuster, $14.) Bauer's chilling first novel is a dual character study of a young boy and a grown man drawn to each other through separate obsessions. Twelve-year-old Steven befriends a serial killer -- supposedly locked up for life -- to find the body of his mother's brother, who went missing from the moor surrounding their English village 18 years earlier.
THE BIG SHORT: Inside the Doomsday Machine, by Michael Lewis (Norton, $15.95.) Lewis tackles big, engaging stories -- the 1980s Wall Street collapse, the 1996 presidential campaign, the dot-com boom, the use of quantitative analysis in baseball -- by identifying characters whose personal narratives reveal larger truths. At the center of his account of the 2008 financial crisis are investors who saw the folly and fraud behind subprime mortgages and minted fortunes by going short: making unpopular, calculated bets that the American housing bubble was going to pop. Our reviewer, Daniel Gross, called ''The Big Short'' ''funny, incisive . . . and illuminating -- full of difficult-to-like underdogs whose vindication and enrichment we end up cheering.''
BURNING BRIGHT: Stories, by Ron Rash (Ecco/HarperCollins, $12.99.) Rash's latest collection roams the harsh, complex history of Appalachia, from a Civil War-era tale of a farmer's wife fending off a marauder while her husband serves in the Union Army to modern-day stories about the ravages of methamphetamine addiction.
YALTA: The Price of Peace, by S. M. Plokhy (Penguin, $18.) Plokhy, a Harvard historian, draws on newly declassified Soviet documents to reappraise the eight days of meetings at the 1945 Yalta conference, where Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin partitioned Germany, redrew the borders of Eastern Europe and took another step toward the founding of the United Nations.
RANSOM, by David Malouf (Vintage International, $14.95.) This moving novelization of the climactic episode of the ''Iliad'' explores the encounter between the Greek hero Achilles and King Priam of Troy, who ventures to the Greek camp during the Trojan War to ransom the body of his fallen son, Hector.
THE DEVIL AND SHERLOCK HOLMES: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, by David Grann (Vintage, $15.95.) These 12 true stories, several of which first appeared in The New Yorker, explore the fixations that propel people into unfathomable, often deadly circumstances. There's the curious case of a garroted Sherlock Holmes expert; the 23-year-old Frenchman who cons an American family into thinking he is their missing teenage son; the secret world of ''sandhogs'' digging water tunnels under New York. ''In the end these stories seemed to provide at least glimpses of the human condition,'' Grann writes, ''and why some people devote themselves to good and others to evil.''
FAT BOYS: A Slim Book, by Sander L. Gilman (Bison/University of Nebraska, $19.95.) Santa Claus, Falstaff, Sancho Panza, Babe Ruth. Opening a valuable conversation about the historical representation of obesity, Gilman examines depictions of the ''fat man'' in Western culture, from Greek medical texts to 20th-century literature and from opera to popular entertainment.

HEADLINE: It's Not Candid Camera, It's Random Culture

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- It was just another winter Saturday morning at the Reading Terminal Market, an expansive food hall at the heart of this city's downtown. Toward noon people began flocking to the restaurants in the central court, creating such a din that nobody seemed to pay much mind when the sound of recorded music floated through the air.
Suddenly a man standing in line at a cheese steak stand raised his arm with a flourish and turned to the crowd. ''Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre'' he sang in a thrilling baritone. Before anyone could figure out what was happening -- that he had launched into the ''Toreador Song'' from Bizet's ''Carmen'' -- another man leaped onto a table across the court and took up the second verse. He was joined by a third man, who had seemingly wandered in from the crowd.
And soon more than 30 members of the Opera Company of Philadelphia chorus were singing, dancing and toasting one another with coffee and soda cups, as the soloists turned the cheese steak stand into an impromptu opera stage. Around them people laughed and cried in wonderment, many of them whipping out their phones and cameras to preserve the moment. 
As the music ended four people in the crowd held up signs reading, ''You have just experienced a Random Act of Culture.''
Since October more than 160 such pop-up events have taken place in eight cities around the country. In Akron, Ohio; Charlotte, N.C.; Detroit; Macon, Ga.; Miami; St. Paul; and San Jose, Calif., as well as here, anyone who's happened into the right mall, market or municipal building at the right time has been jolted from the daily grind by an eclectic range of performances, from arias and string quartets to tangos and poetry readings. The project is the first major initiative undertaken by the Knight Arts Program, begun last March by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
''Everything we do revolves around the idea of weaving the arts into the fabric of the community,'' said Dennis Scholl, the arts program's director, who aims to produce 1,000 Random Acts by the end of 2013. ''Our hypothesis is that people care about the arts, and if you analyze where they are and bring art to them, they will be passionate about it.''
But he added that, in contrast to most flash mob performances, ''we're taking incredibly talented professionals and putting them into the streets.''
The passion he speculated about is evident on YouTube, where professionally shot videos of Random Act events have become something of an Internet sensation. The biggest hit by far has been the Oct. 30 performance of Handel's ''Hallelujah'' chorus, also organized by the Philadelphia opera, for which more than 650 singers burst into song in the Grand Court of Macy's Center City accompanied by the store's legendary organ. The clip now has over seven million views and has inspired countless other ''Hallelujah'' flash performances around the world.
''That's the beauty of the Web,'' Mr. Scholl said. ''You can create a sense of community that isn't geographic.''
Founded in 1950 by the scions of the Knight newspaper chain, the Knight Foundation is probably best known for financing digital innovation in journalism. Yet its overarching mission is ''to create informed and engaged communities'' in the 26 cities where the company had newspapers in 1991, the year James L. Knight died, focusing primarily on the eight ''Random Acts'' towns, where Knight maintains individual program offices.
The seeds for the arts program were already germinating in 2007, when the foundation's president, Alberto Ibarguen, embarked on a three-year survey, known as ''Soul of the Community,'' with Gallup to ascertain how people become attached to their locales. What he learned, Mr. Ibarguen said, radically countered his preconceptions.
Especially after the 2008 recession, ''I would have expected jobs to be the No. 1 reason people were attached to place,'' he said, ''or political or civic engagement.'' Instead the top three factors turned out to be how many opportunities a community offers for socializing, its openness to different types of people and its aesthetic surroundings. Knight is always on the lookout for ways to ''bring people together to share experience,'' Mr. Ibarguen said, and the survey ''supported our notion'' that the arts were a good way to do it.
To head the program, which disbursed over $15 million worth of grants last year, he tapped Mr. Scholl, the director of the Miami community program. A contemporary-art collector, Mr. Scholl has a long history as a visual arts patron. And he was already overseeing the Knight Arts Challenge, which since 2008 has invited people in Miami to suggest projects they'd like to realize, and has financed the winning ideas.
Although Knight previously supported cultural projects, the approach Mr. Scholl has taken with the new program is ''to look at our grants through the lens of community engagement,'' he said, ''and to look for ways to use technology and social media.'' In addition, each of the eight cities serves as a laboratory to develop pilot projects that can be spread to the others.
Last year, for example, Mr. Scholl expanded the Knight Arts Challenge to Philadelphia. (Winners will be announced in March.) Another project involves helping museums in Akron, Charlotte and Miami put portions of their holdings online. A third, whose location will be announced in March, will let people buy shares in local artists' work: the cultural equivalent of a farm share program. ''Instead of a box of vegetables,'' said Mr. Scholl, ''they'll get a box of editioned artworks.''
Then, of course, there's Random Acts. Mr. Scholl conceived the idea early last year, after someone sent him a link to a YouTube video of a pop-up opera performance in the Central Market of Valencia, Spain. (At the end someone holds up a sign that reads, ''Ves como te gusta la opera?'' -- ''See how you like opera?'')
Although that video was actually part of a guerilla marketing campaign, Mr. Scholl saw in it the makings of a broader cultural experiment. As he put it, ''What would happen if we brought the arts to people where they are en masse?''
He decided to try out ''a beta performance'' with a string quartet in the Miami-Dade County government center in May. As soon as the music began, ''the crowd just gathered and gathered, and they went wild,'' he recalled. ''So we knew we had something.'' He had already decided to finance 1,000 Random Acts when he realized that the Opera Company of Philadelphia was already doing its own pop-up performances, prompted by the same video from Valencia.
David B. Devan, the executive director of the company, said the link came his way when the company was trying to figure out ''how we communicate the joy of singing to people who never go to the opera.'' So on April 24 the opera mounted its first pop-up performance at Reading Terminal Market, a 35-singer rendition of ''Brindisi,'' the drinking song from Verdi's ''Traviata,'' which they were about to open. The reaction was so positive, with a flurry of donations and many excited e-mails (not to mention more than 3.4 million YouTube views so far) that the company decided to try something bigger: putting on Handel's ''Hallelujah'' at Macy's.
''We were trying to figure out how to pay for it,'' Mr. Devan said, ''when the phone rang and it was Dennis, saying, 'We want to partner with you.' ''
Knight's support allowed the ''Hallelujah'' performance to escalate wildly, eventually involving 28 groups -- ''everything from the Presbyterian church choir to the Gay Men's Chorus,'' Mr. Devan said. The opera now has a $30,000 Knight Foundation grant to create more collaborative performances with other groups here.
Not only have contributions risen, Mr. Devan said, but the Random Acts projects have transformed the company into an important player in the community.
Before, ''if we had told the city's marketing people that we wanted to help rebrand Philadelphia, they'd have laughed,'' Mr. Devan said. ''But now they're calling us. And it's not just good for the opera, it's good for all the other arts as well.''

HEADLINE: What Being Biracial Means Today

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Black? White? Asian? More Young Americans Choose All of the Above'' (''Race Remixed'' series, front page, Jan. 30):
As an early national leader for biracial equality, I am gratified, 20 years later, to see self-confident, beautiful young people boldly speaking out. But your article does not fully do them justice.
A biracial identity is not about defeating societal prejudice or eliminating affirmative action; it is a personal decision. It is insulting to refer to multiracial people as ''ethnically ambiguous.'' 
Being biracial means embracing all that you are, regardless of what society says. As the African-American father of two proudly biracial young adults, I am hopeful that our colorful future will mirror what we yearned for in the past.

To the Editor:
This is a tough one. On the one hand, it is important and valid for people to respect one another's ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. On the other hand, our collective focus on our own individuality is eroding our sense of nationalism and our ability to act as a collective.
Without making any judgment on either side of these aspects of our American culture, it is important to note that China seems to have more of a monoculture, imbuing its people with a sense of being part of a collective whole. In the coming decade it will be interesting to see how its monoculture fares in the wake of growing economic prosperity, and how the United States economy fares in the wake of our eroding social fabric.
Tom Short San Rafael, Calif., Jan. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
I was glad to see you raise the issue of the ''where are you from?'' question. Those of us who look different (not white) are frequently asked this offensive question. Most who ask are innocently curious, but they don't realize that by asking ''where are you from?'' in terms of racial heritage, they are implying that we aren't ''real'' Americans.
When someone asks me ''where are you from?'' I answer literally (the United States, Oregon or my hometown), prompting the lovely follow-up question ''No, where are you from?'' Obviously, I'm meant to realize that he or she is asking for my racial background, yet the phrasing sets me apart: not a real American, but someone in America originating elsewhere.
I am an American of Japanese and European extraction. My mother's family has lived here for more than 100 years, and my father's ancestors fought against the British. And yet, every time someone asks those questions I am reduced to defending my right to simply be ''American.''
Sumiko Chambers Sherwood, Ore., Jan. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
I have recollections of how Virginia's racial laws affected my multiracial families -- Hemings and Bolling.
Up until 1910, if a person had less than one-quarter of Negro blood and was free, that person was legally white. When some of my Hemings family members were freed, they didn't have to pass for white in Virginia because by law they were white.
The Racial Integrity Law of 1924 deemed anyone with a single drop of nonwhite blood as being colored. But there was one exception to the law -- often referred to as the Pocahontas exemption. Had this exemption not existed, some of my Bolling family members, like Rear Adm. Richard Byrd, the polar explorer, Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson, and many others, who claimed descent from Pocahontas, would have been classified as colored in Virginia.
Edna Bolling Jacques Chappaqua, N.Y., Feb. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
We noted that many of the biracial young people interviewed in your article were also binational, meaning born to parents of different nationalities.
In our research on ethnic identity formation of binational and biracial young adult Americans, we found that having one foreign-born parent and thus a deep understanding of at least one other culture and worldview had a significant, positive impact on the participants' understanding of themselves and their place in the world.
Early on, these binational and biracial individuals learned that the meaning of race is contextual; their being biracial in America was a totally different experience from being biracial in other countries, especially in countries that use identity constructions for people of a mixed racial background. These young adults know, from personal experience, that racial identity is a fluid, culturally determined phenomenon, and that how they are seen, racially, and whether that perception carries positive, negative or neutral connotations, depends on where they are.
Your article was excellent, but missed this significant aspect of the biracial experience in the United States.

HEADLINE: The Fountain of Old Age

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
IT'S not easy being gray.
For the first time ever, getting out of a car is no picnic. My back is hunched. And I'm holding on to handrails as I lurch upstairs.
I'm 45. But I feel decades older because I'm wearing an Age Gain Now Empathy System, developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Agnes, they call it.
At first glance, it may look like a mere souped-up jumpsuit. A helmet, attached by cords to a pelvic harness, cramps my neck and spine. Yellow-paned goggles muddy my vision. Plastic bands, running from the harness to each arm, clip my wingspan. Compression knee bands discourage bending. Plastic shoes, with uneven Styrofoam pads for soles, throw off my center of gravity. Layers of surgical gloves make me all thumbs.
The age-empathy suit comes from the M.I.T. AgeLab, where researchers designed Agnes to help product designers and marketers better understand older adults and create innovative products for them. Many industries have traditionally shied away from openly marketing to people 65 and older, viewing them as an unfashionable demographic group that might doom their product with young and hip spenders. But now that Americans are living longer and more actively, a number of companies are recognizing the staying power of the mature market. 
''Aging is a multidisciplinary phenomenon, and it requires new tools to look at,'' Joseph F. Coughlin, director of AgeLab, tells me, encumbered and fatigued after trying to conduct a round of interviews while wearing Agnes. Viewed through yellow goggles, the bright colors of Professor Coughlin's bow tie appear dim. ''Agnes is one of those tools,'' he says.
AgeLab, like a handful of other research centers at universities and companies around the country, develops technologies to help older adults maintain their health, independence and quality of life. Companies come here to understand their target audience or to have their products, policies and services studied.
Often, visitors learn hard truths at AgeLab: many older adults don't like products, like big-button phones, that telegraph agedness. ''The reality is such that you can't build an old man's product, because a young man won't buy it and an old man won't buy it,'' Professor Coughlin says.
The idea is to help companies design and sell age-friendly products -- with customizable font size, say, or sound speed -- much the way they did with environmentally friendly products. That means offering enticing features and packaging to appeal to a certain demographic without alienating other consumer groups. Baked potato chips are just one example of products that appeal to everybody but skew toward older people. Toothpastes that promise whitening or gum health are another.
Researchers at AgeLab are studying the stress levels of older adults who operate a hands-free parallel-parking system developed by Ford Motor. Although this ultrasonic-assisted system may make backing up easier for older adults who can't turn their necks to the same degree they once did, the car's features -- like blind-spot detection and a voice-activated audio system -- are intended to appeal to all drivers who enjoy smart technology.
''With any luck, if I am successful,'' Professor Coughlin says, ''retailers won't know they are putting things on the shelves for older adults.''
THE first of about 76 million baby boomers in the United States turned 65 in January. They are looking forward to a life expectancy that is higher than that of any previous generation.
The number of people 65 and older is expected to more than double worldwide, to about 1.5 billion by 2050 from 523 million last year, according to estimates from the United Nations. That means people 65 and over will soon outnumber children under 5 for the first time ever. As a consequence, many people may have to defer their retirement -- or never entirely retire -- in order to maintain sustainable incomes.
Many economists view such an exploding population of seventy- and eighty-somethings not as an asset, but as a looming budget crisis. After all, by one estimate, treating dementia worldwide already costs more than $600 billion annually.
''No other force is likely to shape the future of national economic health, public finances and policy making,'' analysts at Standard & Poor's wrote in a recent report, ''as the irreversible rate at which the world's population is aging.''
The S.&P. analysis, called ''Global Aging 2010,'' warns that many countries are not prepared to cover the pension and health care costs of so many additional retirees; if those governments do not radically alter their age-related spending policies in the next few decades, the report said, national debts will grow to rival -- or even more than double -- gross domestic product.
But longevity-focused researchers including Professor Coughlin, whose blog is called Disruptive Demographics, are betting that baby boomers, unlike generations past, will not go gentle into the good night of long-term care. In fact, a few research groups at institutions like Oregon Health & Science University, M.I.T. and Stanford, along with foundations and the private sector, are devising policies and systems for an alternate scenario: older adults living independently at home for longer periods, whether that home is a private residence or a senior community.
Devices for I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up catastrophes, they say, represent the old business of old age. The new business of old age involves technologies and services that promote wellness, mobility, autonomy and social connectivity. These include wireless pillboxes that transmit information about patients' medication use, as well as new financial services, like ''Second Acts'' from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, that help people plan for longer lives and second careers.
Together, those kinds of products and services are already a multibillion-dollar market, industry analysts say. And if such innovations prove to promote health and independence, delaying entry into long-term care, the potential savings to the health care system could be even greater.
That's the upbeat message that Eric Dishman, the global director of health innovation at Intel, has been trying to get across to policy makers and industry executives for more than a decade. A charismatic health policy wonk, Mr. Dishman has held audiences at TedMed conferences spellbound with his lecture on the subject, in which he carts around an old-school rotary telephone, a prop dramatizing the need to connect older adults and technology.
In his office in Beaverton, Ore., he demonstrates some prototypes, like a social networking system for senior housing centers, that older Americans are already testing. Often, he says, field studies of his gadgets result in ''success catastrophes'' -- the devices prove so popular that testers and their families are loath to return them. The people testing the social network devices, for example, asked for extra models for off-campus friends.
''There is an enormous market opportunity to deliver technology and services that allow for wellness and prevention and lifestyle enhancement,'' he says. ''Whichever countries or companies are at the forefront of that are going to own the category.''
Industry is beginning to hear his message. Last month, a group including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Aegon said it had formed the Global Coalition on Aging, to help governments and industries better handle the age boom. ''Companies are starting to think about how they can be age friendly much the same way they have been thinking about how they could be environmentally friendly over the last couple of decades,'' says Andy Sieg, the head of retirement services at Bank of America.
THE Mirabella, a new $130 million high-rise in the South Waterfront section of Portland, Ore., may be the greenest luxury retirement community in the nation.
The building has solar-heated hot water, a garage where valets stack cars in racks atop one another, sensors that turn off the lights when stairways are empty and platinum certification from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, the group that sets national benchmarks for sustainable building.
The Mirabella also aspires to be the grayest -- by providing an opportunity to develop and test the latest home-health technology and design concepts for older adults.
The building's architects, Ankrom Moisan Associated Architects, turned on its head the idea of putting retirees out to pasture. This urban high-rise, conveniently located next to Oregon Health and Science University, enables residents to stay as healthy, engaged and socially connected as possible, says Jeff Los, a principal in the firm.
''Historically, upscale senior housing has been a rural three-story entity spread over 30 acres,'' he says. ''This is a 30-story building on one acre with a streetcar stop at the front door.''
The developers, Pacific Retirement Services, bought land from the university with the idea of encouraging research next door, at the school's Oregon Center for Aging & Technology, also known as Orcatech. As part of that project, the company spent nearly a half-million dollars to install fiber optic cables so that Mirabella residents could be encouraged to volunteer for a ''living laboratory'' program in which wireless motion sensors, installed in their apartments, track their mobility and, by extension, their health status in real time.
Older adults in other parts of the city are already participating in the program; researchers hope to prove that continually monitoring them can help predict and prevent problems like falls, or even social withdrawal, says Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, a neurology professor who directs Orcatech.
And some residents may eventually want to modify the monitoring system so that they can download and make use of their own health data, Mr. Los says.
In fact, even before Mirabella opened last fall, residents asked for adjustments to the building. They demanded space in the garage for their kayaks, recalls Mr. Dishman, who serves on the building's steering committee.
''Baby boomers are going to be very different seniors,'' he says.
ABOUT 30 older adults in the greater Portland area have volunteered to participate in the Orcatech living laboratory program.
Dorothy Rutherford, 86, a petite redhead with a deadpan wit, is one of them. And she is a model for the kind of independent aging, abetted by technology, that the researchers hope to encourage.
Her bone-colored earrings -- a gift from a dentist who made them from denture material -- dangle as she gives me a tour of the equipment that researchers have installed in her apartment. Sensors that monitor the speed and frequency of her activity dot the ceilings and cling to furniture, appliances and doors.
''I have no worries about privacy whatsoever,'' she declares, waving at the ceiling. ''They are just sensors, not video cameras.''
A wireless smart pillbox reminds her to take her daily vitamins. A computer on which she plays specific word and number games tracks her daily scores.
But her favorite experiment so far involved an anthropomorphic robot from Vgo Communications, nicknamed Celia, that was equipped with a video screen. Mrs. Rutherford's granddaughter and great-granddaughter in Wyoming could remotely operate Celia any time they wanted to follow her around for a video chat.
Mrs. Rutherford, a retired waitress, already uses Skype to talk to family members. But Skype is stationary, she says, while the robot conveniently wheels itself from room to room.
''When I saw Celia the robot, I thought there are all kinds of possibilities to get you set up at home,'' she says. ''Why would somebody go to a retirement community if they can figure out a way to keep people home longer?''
Even so, the pilot program is not inexpensive: it costs about $1,000 to set up each participant with a computer and $6 sensors, plus $2,600 a year for technical support, Internet access and home visits from researchers. Monitoring costs vary. (The robot, which is not a regular feature of the program and which participants tried for about a week each, costs $6,000 plus a monthly $100 service fee.)
The continuous monitoring of people like Mrs. Rutherford may point the way to more preventive health care -- an alternative to the pattern of doctors seeing elderly patients on an infrequent basis, often treating them only after they have developed acute illnesses or had accidents. ''What if there were thousands of homes around America that had these simple systems in place?'' Dr. Kaye of Orcatech says about the monitoring system.
The idea is to determine whether changes in daily habits -- like walking speed, posture, sleep, pill taking, computer game scores -- can accurately predict things like cognitive decline or balance problems, allowing doctors to intervene before someone falls and, say, breaks a hip.
Intel and General Electric recently started a joint venture, Intel-GE Care Innovations, to develop technologies that help older adults stay independent. They are already marketing the Intel Health Guide, a home monitoring system that helps doctors remotely manage patients' care.
There's just one obstacle: the marketplace for age independence technology is in its infancy. Because of ageism, Mr. Dishman says, many retailers aren't ready to make space for such products and many companies don't even want to develop them.
''Life enhancement technology for boomers is a chicken-and-egg problem,'' he says. Is ''the market going to take the first plunge, or are companies going to create technologies without knowing whether we can sell it?''
He has been on a mission, he says, to have Congress put the issue on the national agenda; he'd also like to see the White House establish a commission on aging. The European Union, he points out, has already committed more than one billion euros to study technology and aging.
But so far, the officials he has met with have not taken up the cause, he says. In the laundry list of initiatives in his State of the Union address last month, President Obama pushed clean energy, not gray tech.
Mr. Dishman asks: ''What do we need to do for aging and gray technology to have the same urgency and investment that global warming'' and green technology have?
GRAMPA. Golden ager. Elderly person. Senior citizen.
Americans have come to associate agedness with frailty and disability rather than with institutional memory and expertise.
''People somehow assume that when we are young, we are vital,'' says Ken Dychtwald, the C.E.O. of AgeWave, a research and consulting organization that focuses on population aging. ''Then, when we pass 40, we are on a downward slope to death.''
For more than a quarter-century, Mr. Dychtwald, 60 and thus himself a baby boomer, has been trying to rebrand aging as a positive phenomenon. He's coined a word -- ''middlescence'' -- to convey later life as a transformative stage, like adolescence, in which people have free time and an increased interest in trying new experiences. He also came up with an antidote to retirement: ''rehirement.''
Now that the oldest baby boomers are turning 65, he says, their sheer numbers may attract industries that had earlier shied away. ''If you are a Fortune 100 company, or an inventor in a garage, where are you going to find another demographic that is that large, that robust in spending power, that open to new possibilities, and that underserved?'' he asks. ''There's nothing to rival it.''
In 2009, for example, baby-boomer households in the United States spent about $2.6 trillion, according to estimates from AgeWave based on a consumer expenditure survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But so far, he says, very few companies have applied creative intelligence to understanding older adults and developing game-changing technologies, services, experiences and even new careers for them.
Imagine a new real estate sector, he says, that caters to the former hippies among baby boomers who want to form retirement communities with friends by buying six-bedroom communal penthouses in Chicago or farms in Vermont. Or Internet cemeteries, he says, that would preserve video libraries of people's lives for their descendants to enjoy.
''Rather than viewing maturity as an opportunity to sell people a golf membership or an arthritis medicine,'' he says, ''since a person who turns 60 has another 20 years, why not create educational programs whereby people can be motivated to go out, learn new skills and have an encore?''
AGNES, the age empathy suit developed by the M.I.T. AgeLab, is calibrated to simulate the dexterity, mobility, strength and balance of a 74-year-old. My empathy has clearly deepened after a few hours of road-testing it. But, sheepishly, I still want to shed the suit and its instant add-on decades.
Professor Coughlin started AgeLab in 1999 to address what he calls ''the longevity paradox'' -- the idea that, while people in many developed countries now live several decades longer than those born a century ago, very few policy makers, institutions and industries are dedicated to helping people make those extra decades healthy and productive.
More than a decade later, with boomers starting to turn 65, experts like Professor Coughlin hope to make gray the new green. Their job would be easier if it were fun to wear Agnes.
Correction: February 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the market for new products for an aging population erroneously included a service among those offered by the Mirabella, a retirement community in Portland, Ore. It does not provide Toyota Priuses as loaner cars to residents. (A sister Mirabella community in Seattle does provide its residents with the loaner cars.)

Calibrated to make the wearer, in this case the student Katii Gullick, experience life as a person in her mid-70s, the suit has harnesses and bands that restrict joint and limb movements. Agnes also has a helmet attached to a harness that constrains the neck and spine, plastic gloves that make it harder to open packages, and foam soles on the shoes to throw off balance.(BU1)

HEADLINE: Who's the Boss, You or Your Gadget?

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
GIVEN the widespread adoption of smartphones, text messaging, video calling and social media, today's professionals mean it when they brag about staying connected to work 24/7.
Technology allowed Karen Riley-Grant, a manager at Levi Strauss in San Francisco, to take care of some business with her New York publicist while she was in labor in the hospital last November. ''I had time on my hands,'' she says, and ''full strength on my phone -- five bars.''
It once enabled Craig Wilson, an executive at Avaya in Toronto, to take his children to a Linkin Park concert and be able to duck out to finish a task for a client in Australia, he says, ''without disruption to my family commitment or my work commitment.''
And it recently gave Perry Blacher, chief executive of the social investing firm Covestor, a way to participate in a board teleconference while attending a christening celebration at a pub in England. 
But all of this amped-up productivity comes with a growing sense of unease. Too often, people find themselves with little time to concentrate and reflect on their work. Or to be truly present with their friends and family.
There's a palpable sense ''that home has invaded work and work has invaded home and the boundary is likely never to be restored,'' says Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. ''The new gadgetry,'' he adds, ''has really put this issue into much clearer focus.''
The phenomenon started with the rise of BlackBerrys and has snowballed with the use of more smartphones, social media and tablet computers. Employees are using their smartphones and other devices to connect with corporate e-mail, applications and data wherever they happen to be -- whether at home, on the go or even on vacation.
Now add the effects of the recent recession. Because jobs and promotion opportunities are scarce, many workers are worried that someone who is more connected and available could outclimb them on the corporate ladder, says Peggy Klaus, an executive coach in Berkeley, Calif.
''Even if you have a career that is pretty solid,'' she says, there is the feeling that advancement requires being plugged in at all times.
But at what price?
Ms. Riley-Grant, who is 35 and director of global consumer marketing for the Dockers brand, has felt the stress of trying to stay constantly connected -- not because of pressure from her bosses, she says, but her own fear.
''I love my job,'' she says. ''The decision to plug in or unplug is a personal one. My job is fast-paced and demanding. If I'm not paying attention during the off-hours, things could go south.''
But even before the birth of her second child last year, she recognized that she needed to power down to achieve the right work-life balance. So with the help of Ms. Klaus, she made a plan to take small steps: she let her co-workers know that she would be turning off her iPhone for a few hours on weeknights and weekend days, and completely on certain Friday nights.
She tries to communicate a need for balance to employees who report to her, too. ''I worry about the speed at which they are going,'' she says, adding that she wants them to ''shut down'' when needed, for the sake of their families and their health.
The conversation about what's expected of workers ''after hours'' is crucial to managing expectations, researchers and workplace specialists say. Mr. Wilson, 52, global director of strategic consulting for Avaya, a provider of business communications systems, says he is respectful of his colleagues who work in different countries and time zones. ''If I e-mail someone at 7 at night,'' he said, ''it's not legitimate of me to expect a response that night or at 7 in the morning.''
TO a large degree, how workers incorporate devices into their daily routines depends on the individual. Some people insist on keeping work and life concerns separate, while others integrate components of both and manage them together.
For example, Stephanie Marchesi of the marketing firm Fleishman-Hillard in New York developed a system that involves carrying four devices at all times: an iPhone and an iPad for family and social life and a BlackBerry and a laptop for work. ''I can pull out one and pull out the other and check on both aspects of my life,'' she says.
Ms. Marchesi, 47, managing director and senior partner of global integrated marketing communications at the firm, says technology ''allows me the flexibility I need to balance work life with personal life.''
She maintains separate e-mail addresses and calendars because her company can access her work e-mail and calendar. ''I want my personal life personal,'' she says. ''I have chosen to keep things separate. I don't need my work to know when my son has a play date or dentist appointment. It's not their business.''
On a typical day, she says, she is up early at her home in Darien, Conn., to make sure that both her children get off to school. She catches the 7 a.m. train to Manhattan and immediately pulls out her Internet-connected laptop and BlackBerry. For the next hour, it is as if she is in the office, she says: ''When I am commuting, I have not disappeared.''
The same is true, she says, on the 5:57 p.m. train back home. Her only downtime is the 10 minutes it takes her to get to the station. In the evening, she allows time for dinner and family, but then she pulls out her laptop.
Occasionally, the routine varies -- she might have to take a child to the doctor, or attend an after-school conference -- but the fluidity remains. On weekends, she works on the laptop and checks her BlackBerry.
The entire routine ''feels very natural,'' Ms. Marchesi says. ''I'm not a stressed-out person, nor am I this maniac. I am committed, connected and responsive.''
Alan Atwell doesn't keep his work and personal life on separate devices, but he does try to ensure that his work life doesn't hold his personal life hostage. Mr. Atwell, 44, national leader for tax process and technology at RSM McGladrey, an accounting and business consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C., tries to be accessible when he is away from work. But only to a point. A few weeks ago, for example, he was helping to coach his son's basketball team, and an important text message beeped in. He says he was able to answer it quickly without disrupting practice.
''If something important comes up, if I need to step out, I can,'' he says. ''At the same time, I can wait if I am with my family or taking care of civic obligations. Generally, I try not to walk around staring at the phone. I do try to pick moments when I need to be present for whatever group I am interacting with.''
One upside of technology, of course, is that it enables people to be present even if they are not in the same room. On a recent trip to New York, Mr. Blacher, 37, of Covestor, pulled out his Sony Vaio and started a video chat with his 2-year-old son in London. ''It's really hard to be away,'' he says. ''If you didn't have things like Skype, I don't know how I'd do it.''
While on a business trip, Ana Dutra, 46, of the executive recruiting firm Korn/Ferry in Chicago, helped her teenage daughter at home pick out a dress for homecoming via Skype, text messages and photographs. She communicates this way with her other two daughters as well. ''That's actually wonderful,'' says Ms. Dutra, ''to be able to see them even if I am far away.''
It would not be odd to find Ms. Dutra, chief executive of Korn/Ferry's leadership and talent consulting business, answering an e-mail on her BlackBerry and talking on her iPhone at the same time. At night, she used to keep her phone on vibrate mode -- and it would go off 20 times. ''This is crazy,'' she thought. ''That's the point, in my view, when instead of improving your quality of life, technology is destroying your quality of life. I was waking up tired every day.''
So now both of her phones are on silent mode at night. She has instituted other changes, as well, to find balance. If she needs quiet time to meditate, she takes it. She also practices yoga, even if only for 20 minutes a day.
''If you need some quiet time,'' she says, ''it's up to you to not allow yourself to be bothered for an hour or half an hour.''
Technology has afforded her more freedom, Ms. Dutra says, ''but there's a little bit more slavery as well.''
''If you are available all the time,'' she adds, ''what does that mean?''
John Lilly, the former chief executive of Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, recently pondered publicly what it meant to be so connected and decided to initiate a temporary reprieve.
Mr. Lilly is by choice and necessity a power user of multiple gadgets and social media. As he prepared for his new role as a venture partner at Greylock Partners, the Silicon Valley investment firm, he announced on his blog that he was taking time ''to be a little more generative, to think bigger, more original thoughts.''
He said he would turn off Google Reader, Twitter and Facebook. ''I'm really excited to have a bit of time to start 2011 to slow down, try to think longer term, and to slow down my clock,'' he wrote.
Mr. Lilly, 40, says he tried. But as it turns out, too much of his life was tangled up in e-mail and social networks. ''I couldn't figure out how to disengage from all that stuff,'' he says. ''More to the point, I didn't really want to.''
Still, in anticipation of his new job, he has slowed his pace, which had been in overdrive at Mozilla. ''As an investor, the entrepreneur is the thing,'' he said. ''I want to get to a place to focus on them, to be present and listen and hear what they are about.''
Since he has slowed down, he says, ''I probably feel less twitchy -- I don't feel the need to check e-mail and Twitter feeds every five minutes.''
''But I don't like going days without it,'' he adds. ''I like being in touch with my friends, seeing what they are doing. I think of Twitter as my peripheral vision.''
The good news about technology, he says, is you can be anywhere and still work. The bad news, he says, is that ''anywhere you are, you have to work.''
Too much connectivity can damage the quality of one's work, says Robert Sutton, author of ''Good Boss, Bad Boss'' and a professor at Stanford. Because of devices, he says, ''nobody seems to actually pay full attention; everybody is doing a worse job because they are doing more things.''
Mobile devices and social media, he says, ''make us a little more oblivious, a little more incompetent.'' Just recall those pilots who overshot their destination two years ago because they were using computers, he adds.
''The emotionally compelling nature of the device and live information it carries -- and the intermittent reinforcement it carries, plus the pressure of living in a world where for many people 'immediately' now really means immediately -- causes people to be entranced by their devices and to ignore real life as it unfolds in front of them,'' Professor Sutton says.
SOMETIMES avoiding real life might be part of the appeal. When Ms. Riley-Grant was in labor and tapping away on her phone, she was ''in denial that my life and everything I knew to be real and true was about to change,'' she says. ''Going from one child to two can rock your world a bit -- from what I had heard -- and I don't think I was ready. I'm still not ready! Working allowed me to hold on to my 'old self' before surrendering to a new life.''
On leave, she has switched from using her smartphone for work to keeping up with friends and family. At the same time, she is bracing herself for technological re-entry and all its demands.
''We're in a technology tsunami,'' says her coach, Ms. Klaus. ''Whether you love it or hate it, ultimately we have to figure out how to survive it and make it work for us.''

HEADLINE: INTO THE MUSIC; A Requiem So Big That Performing It Takes a Multitude

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
UNDERSTANDABLY, composers through the centuries have responded to the text of the Roman Catholic Requiem and its evocations of the day of wrath, the last trumpet and other apocalyptic images with music of high drama (Mozart) if not overt theatricality (Verdi). But in the case of the French composer Hector Berlioz and his ''Grande Messe des Morts'' (''High Mass for the Dead''), the dramatic impulse seems to have come first, needing only a pretext -- a death or an anniversary -- to give it wing.
Berlioz had for years grappled with the notion of an oratorio depicting the day of judgment when, in 1837, he was commissioned to write a work for the anniversary of the July Revolution of 1830, honoring its dead. Composed quickly, the work fell victim to bureaucratic whim and went unperformed.
But when your subject is death, you can be sure that another occasion will arise soon enough. The work had its premiere in December 1837 at the funeral of Gen. Charles Denys, comte de Damremont, killed in battle in Algeria, at Les Invalides, a hospital, home and church for military veterans. 
Not to slight Damremont, but the work, for huge chorus and multiple orchestras, is almost too grand to memorialize an individual. Though it is full of surprising subtleties, it represents Berlioz at his most grandiose, a formidable notion in itself: both untidy and glorious. Its most natural home today is on the concert stage, or rather, the stage and the balconies needed to accommodate the added batteries of brass instruments.
A favorite of choristers who like crowds, the Requiem will be prepared this week in a Carnegie Hall choral workshop, leading to a concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke's next Sunday. This is the second time the work has been presented in Carnegie's annual choral festival, founded in 1991 by the choral wizard Robert Shaw; Mr. Shaw conducted the first performance, in 1993.
Robert Spano, a successor once removed of Shaw as music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, will conduct, and Norman Mackenzie, Shaw's immediate successor as director of the Atlanta Symphony Chorus, will oversee the workshop, aided by members of the orchestra's chamber chorus. The festival chorus will be joined by the National High School Festival Chorus and Thomas Cooley, as tenor soloist.
Mr. Spano recorded the work with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in 2003 for Telarc. (He should not take it amiss if I also recommend the classic Charles Munch recording for RCA with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the tenor Leopold Simoneau from 1959, the first I knew.) That outing, Mr. Spano said in a recent interview, represented his only encounter with the work, though he has been ''a Berlioz fanatic'' all his life.
''I find him to be out of time,'' he added. ''He always seems to be avant-garde to me, fresh and daring.''
And extravagant, he might have added, beyond the means of most performing groups. The score of the Requiem calls for an orchestra of 140 -- independent of the 38 brass players in the auxiliary bands, 10 timpanists and other percussionists -- and a chorus of 210. (Major orchestras today have 100 or so players.) And no, Berlioz wasn't kidding when he added, ''If space permits, the chorus may be doubled or tripled and the orchestra proportionately increased.''
A live recording of the work from 1987 on the Musica Opera Sacra label, conducted by Jean-Pierre Lore at the Church of Saint-Roch in Paris, advertised 800 participants. Not for nothing does the performance sound -- the occasional cataclysm apart -- distant, inert and at times almost comically disunified.
Since it was mainly the drama of the apocalypse that attracted Berlioz to the Requiem in the first place, he seems to have had few compunctions about trimming and adapting the liturgical text; ''mangling,'' some have said. He organized the standard sections of the Mass and the parts added specifically to a Requiem into 10 movements, often presenting stark juxtapositions of subdued, airless utterances and grand blowouts.
The first of the big brass and percussion effects comes in the Dies Irae (No. 2), at ''Tuba mirum,'' where, in the text, the trumpet spreads its wondrous sound to the tombs of every region. Mozart used a solo trombone; Verdi essentially imported brass fanfares from ''Aida.'' Berlioz uses four groups of 8 to 12 brass players, specifying that they be positioned north, east, west and south.
The other big statements are in ''Rex tremendae majestatis'' (''King of fearful majesty,'' No. 4) and ''Lacrymosa dies illa'' (''That tearful day,'' No. 6). The brasses and drums reappear at the end of the work, in the Agnus Dei (No. 10), when Berlioz uses the return of ''Requiem aeternam'' (''Eternal rest'') as the basis for a musical summation. But now everything is hushed as, at ''Amen,'' eight timpanists beat out rhythms at a piano dynamic, eventually fading to pianissimo (pp) and finally a barely audible triple piano, and the long journey that began in gloomy G minor ends in understated and resigned G major. The moment is made all the more powerful by an awareness of the thunderous potential of those many kettledrums left untapped.
Other subtleties too abound beneath the work's obvious effects. Literally and figuratively Berlioz wrote the book on instrumentation, and another feature of that final summation is a series of chords combining four flutes, high and slender, with eight trombones, low and burly.
That outlandish bit of orchestration (this time with only three flutes) is a building block of ''Hostias et preces tibi'' (''Sacrifices and prayers to you,'' No. 8), where it is the principal accompaniment to a hymnlike treatment of the chorus. As often as not, with a world of sound at his command, Berlioz achieves his purposes with utmost simplicity.
Nowhere is that economy more striking than in the Offertorium (No. 7). For most of the long movement, until a final genteel jailbreak when the text speaks of the multiplying seed of Abraham, the chorus is confined to just two notes a half step apart: A, rising to B flat and slumping back, over and over in rhythms varied to suit the words. Berlioz, meanwhile, works his orchestral magic around this pattern, providing an ever shifting array of harmonic contexts.
The tenor soloist (or, alternatively, a chorus of 10 tenors in unison) appears only in the Sanctus (No. 9). That is also the movement in which Berlioz trod most heavily on the text, jettisoning the undramatic Benedictus section (''Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord'') in favor of a repeat of the Sanctus (''Holy, holy, holy'').
Where some might dwell on lacunas, others can point to purposeful incisiveness and imaginative synthesis. And to those who still subscribe to the hoary canard that Berlioz had genius but no talent, Mr. Spano had a simple response: ''How much talent did he need?''

HEADLINE: Still Evolving, With an Assist From an Old Pro

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Madrid
TWELVE sinuous dancers emerged from the shadows, twisting and turning to the stark rhythms of guitars. Chests raised, their visceral response to the music clear, they formed eloquent arabesques with their hands and arms. These are the electrifying opening moments of ''Flamenco Hoy'' (''Flamenco Today''), a two-hour journey through the genre's history that is coming to City Center in New York, Feb. 16 to 20.
The show departs from several conventions, but perhaps the most important departure is in the choice of director: the filmmaker Carlos Saura. Over the years theater producers have often sought out Mr. Saura, 79, because of his affinity for flamenco, demonstrated by projects like ''Flamenco, Flamenco'' (2010), only the latest of his several movies on the subject. 
But Mr. Saura has rarely been involved in theater or with live presentations of flamenco. It took the urging of producers and others involved in ''Flamenco Hoy,'' including the composer Chano Dominguez and the choreographers Rafael Estevez and Nani Panos, to persuade him to direct the show in 2009. The current popularity of flamenco played a role too. Though Spain's economy ranks among the worst in Europe, its signature dance and music form is undergoing an expansion. More than a million spectators around the world have attended flamenco shows in the past 10 years, more than double the number from the previous 10 years.
As Mr. Saura put it, ''Flamenco is at a fantastic moment.''
Miguel Marin, a major international presenter of flamenco, would attest to that. Since establishing his first flamenco festival in New York in 2001, he has produced similar festivals in more than 50 cities in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. ''The festival idea was really born in New York,'' said Mr. Marin, who is a native of Andalusia, flamenco's heartland. ''The terrific reception there set the stage for the international expansion. Once New York approved of it, cities everywhere felt confident about starting their own.''
In Europe, for instance, Mr. Marin has found avid flamenco audiences, whose numbers have quickly multiplied. Nine thousand people attended the first London performances, in 2003; 27,000 bought tickets last year. He expanded to Asia in 2004, as well as to Australia and New Zealand. Next fall he will offer shows in Brazil and Russia, taking a year off from New York, where the festival will resume next year and continue biannually. Support from the Andalusian Culture Ministry, Mr. Marin's chief sponsor, could not cover the costs of presenting in New York and in new countries this year, and the ministry preferred the emerging markets.
Not wanting to disappoint New Yorkers, Mr. Marin asked the producers of ''Flamenco Hoy'' to fill his usual week at City Center. ''Carlos is a remarkable director,'' he said, ''with a gift for staging and lighting that make everything he does strikingly visual.''
Sitting with the show's creative team in the grand Bellas Artes cafe here recently, Mr. Saura, an imposing man with a mane of gray hair and a resonant voice full of enthusiasm, held forth about flamenco. In many ways he can take credit for popularizing the art form internationally in the '80s with his film trilogy, ''Blood Wedding'' (''Bodas de Sangre''), ''Carmen'' and ''Love, the Magician'' (''El Amor Brujo''), based on the choreographic works of Antonio Gades.
Theater rarely tempted Mr. Saura before, he said, because the offers had involved old-fashioned concepts. (He made an exception for ''Salome'' in 2004, a narrative work that he also directed for film.) For decades most flamenco shows consisted of exhibitions of pure dance, with dancers and musicians displaying their skills and personalities. Flamenco is so anchored in this format that evening-length narratives, like Mr. Saura's comprehensive exploration of flamenco's evolution, have proven hard to pull off.
It's not surprising that the old way of presenting flamenco onstage wouldn't be very interesting for Mr. Saura, who filmed a documentary-style ''Carmen'' (as a play within a play) that eschewed Bizet's music for original compositions, and a verite-style ''Blood Wedding.'' The ''Flamenco Hoy'' team went to Mr. Saura specifically for his aesthetic: a stripped-down, stylized approach that dramatically counters flamenco's flamboyance.
''I love the energy of the choreographers, dancers and musicians,'' he said. ''They exude such vitality.''
Though evening-length productions sell tickets, aficionados and critics regularly express disappointment. Aside from Gades's works and ''Medea,'' by Jose Granero, created for the National Ballet of Spain in 1996, few flamenco choreographers have mastered the skills to sustain a theme. But the challenges didn't deter Mr. Saura and his collaborators.
With ''Flamenco Hoy,'' he said, ''we decided to break a lot of rules.'' To give the show a youthful look they selected dancers under 30, rather than have a group of all ages, as is common. Mr. Dominguez was also given free rein with the music, which he scored for surprising instruments -- cello, bass, saxophone and flute -- as well as more traditional ones. He features old forms like sevillanas, but musicians speak or shout the lyrics rather than sing them.
The biggest difference, though, lies in Mr. Saura's vision. ''I directed it as I would a film,'' he said. ''From the costumes and staging to the lighting and timing, I tried to present it in a dramatic and fast-paced, cinematic style. You can't do close-ups and wide angles on the stage, but you can approximate them. I wanted it to be decidedly unfussy, with clean simple images. Every dance and song, whether alegrias, bulerias and rumbas, has its own individuality, but each one fits into the overall panorama.''
He recalled that when he was growing up flamenco was seen only in cafes and homes. Now it's presented in distinguished halls like the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and deemed an ''Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity'' (by Unesco in November). ''I'm very optimistic,'' Mr. Saura said. ''Flamenco speaks to every age and to every culture. We gave our show the voice of today.''

HEADLINE: Still a Home for Directors, and Big Foot

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
THE Sundance Film Festival has been very, very good for American cinema, and perhaps Hollywood most of all. Great American directors, including those magnificent Andersons, Paul Thomas and Wes (no relation), each made an early splash at Sundance in 1993 with their respective shorts, ''Cigarettes and Coffee'' and the first iteration of ''Bottle Rocket.'' Both might have found studio patronage without Sundance, but the festival ushered them into the larger film world.
Now in its 27th year, the festival has had its share of oversights and triumphs, but despite the economic hard times and myriad uncertainties -- is theatrical dying, and if not now, when? -- it feels as urgent as ever. Over the years the festival has served as a world stage for visionary voices from the Black New Wave, the New Queer Cinema and the New Talkies. Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino took turns as the new Sundance Kid. So did Kelly Reichardt, who after winning admirers in 1994 for her debut feature, ''River of Grass,'' and then stalling out in Hollywood, returned in 2006 with ''Old Joy,'' one of the high points of that festival. 
Ms. Reichardt was back again this year with ''Meek's Cutoff,'' a frontier story with Michelle Williams that will be released in the spring by Oscilloscope Laboratories. That distributor is one of a handful of small outfits that have emerged in the last few years and helped brighten a mood darkened when various studio specialty divisions, including Warner Independent Pictures and Picturehouse, were shut down or absorbed into their host bodies, thereby joining the distribution ghosts of Sundance past like Island and October Films. Oscilloscope is tiny, which is why it's the kind of company that can nurture the genuine art films that Ms. Reichardt makes.
There are other small distributors fighting the good fight, like Kino Lorber, that release movies that win critical love if not the large audience that a studio division like Fox Searchlight can bring in. Notably, although Paramount seemed to have moved out of the specialty business when it scaled back its division, Paramount Vantage, the studio entered the Sundance fray early by buying Drake Doremus's romantic drama ''Like Crazy'' a week before it won best dramatic feature. One theory is that it wants to be in business with the movie's young leads, including Anton Yelchin, a featured player in its reboot of its ''Star Trek'' franchise.
Perhaps, though it's just that the line between the studios and the independents, has become, in a climate in which everyone is just trying to get work seen, increasingly moot. Certainly it's a line that both the Sundance Institute (created in 1981) and the festival (1985) -- which developed into major film institutions because they created bridges between Hollywood and the independent world -- did their part to eradicate.
''Scratch the surface of most independent filmmakers, and you'll find that what they want is to go to Hollywood,'' Robert Redford, who started the institute, said in 1995. ''But I don't think independent filmmaking is necessarily anti-Hollywood.''
That remains open to debate, of course, and I doubt that Mr. Redford, who solemnly narrated a promotional short that played before many selections this year (''Imagine a world without stories''), would say that now. That's true even if finding common ground between Hollywood and the independent world -- at the festival or the institute, where mainstream filmmakers serve as advisers at the filmmaking labs -- has long been the Sundance way. Though after its flirtation with Hollywood turned into a near-fatal attraction, with tacky nonofficial ventures (swag lounges) threatening to tarnish its brand, Sundance appears to have been trying to get back to basics, hence this year's emphasis on story.
They believe in stories at Sundance, to be sure, usually with three acts, sympathetic leads, closure, teachable moments and sincerity, which makes sense for a festival where filmmaker Q. and A. sessions can feel like religious revivals. Do I hear an Amen for the brave young filmmaker down front? Hallelujah and pass the audience ballot! It's easy to mock Sundance and its pretensions to purity, but it's also hard not to be moved when these filmmakers find communion with their audiences. One of my fondest memories from this year was trying to decide if Christopher Munch -- who was there with his pleasurably eccentric feature ''Letters from the Big Man'' and, after one screening, read a letter from the Sasquatch ''people'' in perfect deadpan -- was pulling our collective leg. The polite audience didn't blink, and neither did he.
It's possible that Mr. Munch's film -- with its lapidary landscape photography, off-kilter environmental theme and up-and-coming starlet, Lily Rabe, who plays an outdoorswoman collecting samples for a field study and attracts a benevolent hirsute stalker -- will find distribution. I hope so. ''Letters From the Big Man'' drifts a bit after its absorbing first hour, but it's the kind of off-Hollywood production that still makes Sundance surprising. (Curiously, it was the first of two Big Foot movies I saw. The second, ''Sasquatch Birth Journal 2,'' from the Zellner Brothers, was a self-consciously crude short that purports, with irreverently comic effect, to show the birth -- shake, drop and roll -- of one of these creatures.)
Even if its finds a distributor, a film as willfully independent in its vision as ''Letters From the Big Man'' is unlikely to enjoy the relative commercial success of Lisa Cholodenko's ''Kids Are All Right'' or Debra Granik's ''Winter's Bone.'' Both were at Sundance last year and went on to become art-house hits with stories that were, in their different fashions, calibrated for uplift. With its crystal-meth hillbillies, ''Winter's Bone'' looks and talks tougher than ''The Kids Are All Right,'' a winning comedy-drama about a lesbian couple trying to keep the family peace. One reader, responding to something I recently wrote about Sundance, insisted both are corporate products -- but really, these are mainstream narratives.
And more power to them. Last fall, at the start of the so-called awards season, Sony Pictures brought out ''The Social Network,'' but this was a diamond glittering on a yearlong slagheap of cookie-cutter action flicks, romantic comedies and buddy romps. However mainstream their narratives, films like ''Winter's Bone,'' when seen against so much ''product'' similarity, help give American cinema the variety that typified the old studio system, which -- in making A movies and B, musicals and westerns, pictures for women and men both -- cast a wide net. In their seriousness, adult themes and stories that are different from the usual multiplex fare -- if not dissimilar enough to be alienating -- these independents help fill an increasing gap created by the studios.
Even as their specialty divisions trolled independent cinema, some smart executives tapped Sundance veterans like Mr. Soderbergh, Bryan Singer and Christopher Nolan for blockbuster duty. Mr. Nolan's ''Dark Knight'' was personal filmmaking on a chart-busting scale and the culmination of a path that had started when Sundance turned down his first feature, ''Following'' (1998). By the time Mr. Nolan resurrected Batman for Warner Brothers in 2005, the studio had its own autonomous division in Warner Independent Pictures. But after three years, it shut the division down, suggesting that its bolder choices -- including directors like Mr. Nolan and films like ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' -- might become a thing of the past.
After years of skimming the cream from Sundance and the American independent scene the big studios seem in creative retreat. For the last several decades they have looked to Sundance and independent film for sustenance, which could make for oddly divided slates (bloated blockbusters, lean art-house titles) but also gave audiences real choices. This was especially critical given that actual independent companies remain under terrific pressure on assorted fronts, the continuing crisis in foreign-language distribution one among many. In such a climate all you can do is cross your fingers that someone picks up festival films like ''The Interrupters,'' a gut-wrenching documentary from Steve James about a grass-roots antiviolence program in Chicago, and ''Knuckle,'' Ian Palmer's intimate look at fighting Irish travelers.
For all the indie talk it is instructive that midway through Sundance, some festivalgoers cheered when the news hit that ''Winter's Bone'' and ''The Kids Are All Right'' had been nominated for the best picture Oscar, as if these nods somehow affirmed Sundance's good taste rather than underscoring its place in the cinematic mainstream. As it happens, 8 of the 10 best picture nominees were directed by filmmakers who, once upon an independent time, took the festival by storm, including Joel and Ethan Coen (from ''Blood Simple'' to ''True Grit'') and David O. Russell (from ''Spanking the Monkey'' to ''The Fighter''). It makes sense that as the most important stage for American mainstream independent film, Sundance became a crucial part of the movie ecosystem, even if its Sasquatch dreamers have long been outnumbered by those big-footing their way to Hollywood.

HEADLINE: It's Not Candid Camera, It's Random Culture

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- It was just another winter Saturday morning at the Reading Terminal Market, an expansive food hall at the heart of this city's downtown. Toward noon people began flocking to the restaurants in the central court, creating such a din that nobody seemed to pay much mind when the sound of recorded music floated through the air.
Suddenly a man standing in line at a cheese steak stand raised his arm with a flourish and turned to the crowd. ''Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre'' he sang in a thrilling baritone. Before anyone could figure out what was happening -- that he had launched into the ''Toreador Song'' from Bizet's ''Carmen'' -- another man leaped onto a table across the court and took up the second verse. He was joined by a third man, who had seemingly wandered in from the crowd.
And soon more than 30 members of the Opera Company of Philadelphia chorus were singing, dancing and toasting one another with coffee and soda cups, as the soloists turned the cheese steak stand into an impromptu opera stage. Around them people laughed and cried in wonderment, many of them whipping out their phones and cameras to preserve the moment. 
As the music ended four people in the crowd held up signs reading, ''You have just experienced a Random Act of Culture.''
Since October more than 160 such pop-up events have taken place in eight cities around the country. In Akron, Ohio; Charlotte, N.C.; Detroit; Macon, Ga.; Miami; St. Paul; and San Jose, Calif., as well as here, anyone who's happened into the right mall, market or municipal building at the right time has been jolted from the daily grind by an eclectic range of performances, from arias and string quartets to tangos and poetry readings. The project is the first major initiative undertaken by the Knight Arts Program, begun last March by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
''Everything we do revolves around the idea of weaving the arts into the fabric of the community,'' said Dennis Scholl, the arts program's director, who aims to produce 1,000 Random Acts by the end of 2013. ''Our hypothesis is that people care about the arts, and if you analyze where they are and bring art to them, they will be passionate about it.''
But he added that, in contrast to most flash mob performances, ''we're taking incredibly talented professionals and putting them into the streets.''
The passion he speculated about is evident on YouTube, where professionally shot videos of Random Act events have become something of an Internet sensation. The biggest hit by far has been the Oct. 30 performance of Handel's ''Hallelujah'' chorus, also organized by the Philadelphia opera, for which more than 650 singers burst into song in the Grand Court of Macy's Center City accompanied by the store's legendary organ. The clip now has over seven million views and has inspired countless other ''Hallelujah'' flash performances around the world.
''That's the beauty of the Web,'' Mr. Scholl said. ''You can create a sense of community that isn't geographic.''
Founded in 1950 by the scions of the Knight newspaper chain, the Knight Foundation is probably best known for financing digital innovation in journalism. Yet its overarching mission is ''to create informed and engaged communities'' in the 26 cities where the company had newspapers in 1991, the year James L. Knight died, focusing primarily on the eight ''Random Acts'' towns, where Knight maintains individual program offices.
The seeds for the arts program were already germinating in 2007, when the foundation's president, Alberto Ibarguen, embarked on a three-year survey, known as ''Soul of the Community,'' with Gallup to ascertain how people become attached to their locales. What he learned, Mr. Ibarguen said, radically countered his preconceptions.
Especially after the 2008 recession, ''I would have expected jobs to be the No. 1 reason people were attached to place,'' he said, ''or political or civic engagement.'' Instead the top three factors turned out to be how many opportunities a community offers for socializing, its openness to different types of people and its aesthetic surroundings. Knight is always on the lookout for ways to ''bring people together to share experience,'' Mr. Ibarguen said, and the survey ''supported our notion'' that the arts were a good way to do it.
To head the program, which disbursed over $15 million worth of grants last year, he tapped Mr. Scholl, the director of the Miami community program. A contemporary-art collector, Mr. Scholl has a long history as a visual arts patron. And he was already overseeing the Knight Arts Challenge, which since 2008 has invited people in Miami to suggest projects they'd like to realize, and has financed the winning ideas.
Although Knight previously supported cultural projects, the approach Mr. Scholl has taken with the new program is ''to look at our grants through the lens of community engagement,'' he said, ''and to look for ways to use technology and social media.'' In addition, each of the eight cities serves as a laboratory to develop pilot projects that can be spread to the others.
Last year, for example, Mr. Scholl expanded the Knight Arts Challenge to Philadelphia. (Winners will be announced in March.) Another project involves helping museums in Akron, Charlotte and Miami put portions of their holdings online. A third, whose location will be announced in March, will let people buy shares in local artists' work: the cultural equivalent of a farm share program. ''Instead of a box of vegetables,'' said Mr. Scholl, ''they'll get a box of editioned artworks.''
Then, of course, there's Random Acts. Mr. Scholl conceived the idea early last year, after someone sent him a link to a YouTube video of a pop-up opera performance in the Central Market of Valencia, Spain. (At the end someone holds up a sign that reads, ''Ves como te gusta la opera?'' -- ''See how you like opera?'')
Although that video was actually part of a guerilla marketing campaign, Mr. Scholl saw in it the makings of a broader cultural experiment. As he put it, ''What would happen if we brought the arts to people where they are en masse?''
He decided to try out ''a beta performance'' with a string quartet in the Miami-Dade County government center in May. As soon as the music began, ''the crowd just gathered and gathered, and they went wild,'' he recalled. ''So we knew we had something.'' He had already decided to finance 1,000 Random Acts when he realized that the Opera Company of Philadelphia was already doing its own pop-up performances, prompted by the same video from Valencia.
David B. Devan, the executive director of the company, said the link came his way when the company was trying to figure out ''how we communicate the joy of singing to people who never go to the opera.'' So on April 24 the opera mounted its first pop-up performance at Reading Terminal Market, a 35-singer rendition of ''Brindisi,'' the drinking song from Verdi's ''Traviata,'' which they were about to open. The reaction was so positive, with a flurry of donations and many excited e-mails (not to mention more than 3.4 million YouTube views so far) that the company decided to try something bigger: putting on Handel's ''Hallelujah'' at Macy's.
''We were trying to figure out how to pay for it,'' Mr. Devan said, ''when the phone rang and it was Dennis, saying, 'We want to partner with you.' ''
Knight's support allowed the ''Hallelujah'' performance to escalate wildly, eventually involving 28 groups -- ''everything from the Presbyterian church choir to the Gay Men's Chorus,'' Mr. Devan said. The opera now has a $30,000 Knight Foundation grant to create more collaborative performances with other groups here.
Not only have contributions risen, Mr. Devan said, but the Random Acts projects have transformed the company into an important player in the community.
Before, ''if we had told the city's marketing people that we wanted to help rebrand Philadelphia, they'd have laughed,'' Mr. Devan said. ''But now they're calling us. And it's not just good for the opera, it's good for all the other arts as well.''

IN TURKEY'S EXAMPLE,
Some See a Map for Egypt
Arriving at a template that effectively integrates Islam, democracy and vibrant economics has been a near-impossible dream for Middle East reformers. But no country in the region has come closer to accomplishing this trick than Turkey. As a result, diplomats and analysts have begun to present the still-incomplete Turkish experiment as a possible road map for Egypt. Page 10
RECONCILING A PAINFUL PAST
The restoration of Iraq's Victory Arch, two enormous sets of crossed swords that stand as one of the most audacious symbols in Baghdad of Saddam Hussein's oppressive rule, represents a small but potentially significant act of reconciliation with a past that remains deeply divisive nearly eight years after Mr. Hussein's government crumpled. Page 6 
PUNISHED FOR LEAVING ISLAM
Afghanistan's Constitution, established in 2004, guarantees that people are ''free to exercise their faith.'' But it also leaves it open for the courts to rely on Shariah, or Islamic law, on issues like conversion. One Afghan, Sayed Mussa, is facing a potential death sentence for his conversion to Christianity from Islam nine years ago. Page 8
AN ARGENTINE FOE RETURNS
High inflation, a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades, is soaring again. Independent economists say the country's inflation rose by 25 percent to 30 percent in 2010, the highest level since the calamitous 2002 devaluation that sent the economy into a tailspin. Food-price increases began to outstrip wage increases in 2010, leading Argentines to buy less food, private economists say. Page 16

THE EARTHQUAKE SWARM
Thousands of earthquakes have been felt in the small town of Guy, Ark., since the late summer. Though none of them have been very large and have left negligible documented damage, in their sheer numbers they have been relentless, creating a phenomenon that has come to be called the Guy earthquake swarm.

WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW,

The widespread adoption of smartphones, text messaging, video calling and social media, today's professionals mean it when they brag about staying connected to work 24/7. But at what price? All of this amped-up productivity comes with a growing sense of unease. Too often, people find themselves with little time to concentrate and reflect on their work. Or to be truly present with their friends and family. Page 1
WHAT ONLINE COURSES LACK
Developing that best-in-the-world online course -- in which students would learn as much, or more, than in an ordinary classroom or a hybrid online class -- requires significant investment. Many universities have put free videos online featuring their best lecturers, but students cannot interact and do not receive vital feedback about their own progress that an instructor or software provides.

HOUSING CRISIS PARALLELS
The current housing market's bubble and eventual burst aren't comparable to any national or international housing cycle in history. Previous bubbles have been smaller and more regional.

In the workplace, it is important for each sex to better understand the way the other thinks, particularly for women because there are still more men who hold executive positions.

TOUGH WITHOUT A GUN
The Life and Extraordinary Afterlife of Humphrey Bogart
By Stefan Kanfer
Illustrated. 288 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.
Has any leading man ever made women work so hard to get his attention? There he is, just minding his own business when along comes some dame who gets it in her head that they should fall in love. She flirts with him, kisses him first, talks back when he tells her off, stays when he buys her a ticket to go. He puts up a fight with all the grim resolve of a guy closing the shutters on a storm that's about to raze his house. Sooner or later, the dame, who happens to be beautiful, wears him down and he comes around, against his better judgment. Humphrey Bogart's shell was ''a carapace,'' as Stefan Kanfer writes about one of his roles, ''meant to cover the psychic injuries of a decent man trying to forget the past.'' 
Experience had engraved itself on his face. By the time his film breakthrough came, he was 42 and already wearing the vestiges of betrayal, loss and resignation that would bring the shadow of a back story to every role he played. Photographs of Bogart in the 1920s, when he was in his 20s, show a bright-eyed, smooth-cheeked actor whose features haven't set yet. The transformation took place before we made his acquaintance. The Bogart we came to know on the screen was mature when he arrived, with compressed emotions, an economy of gesture and a compact grace in movements that were wary and self-contained, as if all the world were not a stage but a minefield. Kanfer's book takes its title from Raymond Chandler, who approved of the decision to cast Bogart in ''The Big Sleep'' as Philip Marlowe, the hard-boiled detective he had created, because Bogart could be ''tough without a gun.''
Kanfer recounts Bogart's own back story, the life that loomed just behind the acting. Such a steady diet of disappointment, failure and alcohol would be enough to relieve any man of his hopes and disabuse him of his faith in human nature. The star who made a name for himself playing gangsters, convicts, private investigators and boat captains for hire came from a family in the New York social register. The son of Belmont DeForest Bogart, a physician and a graduate of Columbia and Yale, and Maud Humphrey, he repeatedly failed to live up to his parents' expectations and flunked out of prep school at Andover. A stint in the Navy in World War I brought time in the brig, a demotion in rank and no action overseas. As an actor, he found work on the stage, but fame eluded him; between jobs, he played chess for 50 cents a game in the arcades on Sixth Avenue. His father became addicted to morphine and died leaving $10,000 in i.o.u.'s, which Bogart paid. His three disastrous marriages before the one to Lauren Bacall fell into a pattern of professional rivalry (his wives were all actresses) and resentment, sometimes building to loud late-night arguments punctuated by flying ashtrays and the sound of broken glass. (His third wife, Mayo Methot, whom he nicknamed Sluggy, stabbed him with a knife.)
Time and again, Bogart was cast as a man of principle, and his finest qualities are on display in ''Tough Without a Gun'': his decency and courage in championing Fatty Arbuckle, Peter Lorre, Joan Bennett and Gene Tierney when they were in dire straits and out of favor; his generosity to charities; his integrity in a town where promises were forgotten, not kept. Still, some angles are unbecoming. Crusading against the witch hunt conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, he flew to Washington along with colleagues from the movie business to testify in defense of the First Amendment, but later rescinded his support when he discovered that several of his fellow protesters had in fact been affiliated with the Communist Party. When his mother, an emotionally distant feminist, died after a long career as one of the most successful commercial illustrators of the time, he listed her occupation as ''housewife'' on the death certificate. Insistent on Bacall's fidelity, he carried on a long affair with his personal hairdresser.
And then there was the drinking. In an era when people drank a lot, Bogart drank more. ''The whole world is about three drinks behind,'' he complained. Not that he was willing to pause and wait for the world to catch up. He drank right along with Mayo during her steep descent into alcoholic psychosis. As one of the founding members of the Rat Pack (christened by Bacall), he built the booze into his charisma.
So strong is the force of Bogart's presence on screen that his performances induce a kind of double vision: we're watching Rick, or Sam Spade, or Captain Morgan, and Humphrey Bogart at the same time. Kanfer, who has written biographies of Groucho Marx, Lucille Ball and Marlon Brando, is at his best examining the ways Bogart's life and his performances converged. His WASP roots paradoxically worked in his favor in gangster roles, Kanfer contends. While Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson claimed the ethnic ends of the spectrum, representing ''immigrants, or the children of immigrants, who had taken a wrong turn,'' Bogart stood in for Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow -- ''notorious malefactors from the heart of the heart of the country.''
The sudden violent flashes of anger, the bitter sense of defeat running just beneath the stoic surface seem to have been imported wholesale from Bogart's life into the role of Dixon Steele, the broken-down screenwriter at the vortex of ''In a Lonely Place.'' Bogart screened ''A Star Is Born'' (the Janet Gaynor-Fredric March version) every year on his birthday, ''with tears streaming down his face at the fate of Norman Maine,'' a former matinee idol down on his luck and forgotten. ''I expected a lot more of myself,'' Bogart told the writer and director Richard Brooks, who was present on several of these occasions, ''and I'm never going to get it.''
Kanfer's bibliography lists two dozen books devoted to Bogart, and that's not counting the study of his mother's work or the memoirs of his colleagues. Why another one, and why this one? Kanfer makes the case, mustering superlatives: Bogart, ''the most imitated movie actor of all time,'' ''the highest-paid actor in the world'' (in 1946), ''the most important American film actor of his time and place.'' And, evidently, the most influential from beyond the grave: in his ''extraordinary afterlife,'' Bogart has inspired Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Paul Belmondo (''Breathless''), Francois Truffaut (''Shoot the Piano Player''), Woody Allen (''Play It Again, Sam''), Mos Def and Taye Diggs (''Brown Sugar'') and Thomasville Furniture (the Trench Coat Chair). Bogart's enduring place in the culture has been secured not only by his skills as an actor, Kanfer argues, but by our chronic nostalgia for his brand of masculinity. A chorus of sources in the industry confirms the recent dearth of the ''man's man.''
Kanfer agrees that there will never be another Bogart, that there can't be another Bogart, but not -- or not only -- because guys have gone all sensitive and tentative. Instead, he attributes the demise of manhood as a Hollywood ideal to the demographic shift in audiences and lists as evidence the 20 top-grossing films of all time, from ''Avatar'' to ''Finding Nemo'' -- every one of them aimed at a junior audience. He cites results of surveys that measure filmgoing by age, with those in the 14-17 category seeing more than twice as many movies as those over 50. ''Small wonder, then,'' he concludes, ''that producers keep coming up with products that border on the puerile -- and with boy-men to star in them.'' This makes sense but goes only so far. Consider the recent spate of late-middle-age romantic comedies and end-of-life buddy films, clearly intended for the boomer market and featuring Jack Nicholson, that superannuated adolescent, and other leading men soon to be eligible for Medicare, playing characters in whom an inability to commit and bewilderment at the state of their own lives are meant to be endearing.
The real reason there will never be another Bogart lies embedded in Kanfer's account of his career as it was shaped by the anxieties of a nation mired in the Great Depression, sending its sons and husbands off to a far-flung war. Bogart became the model of the man circumstances demanded, a reluctant everyday hero who finally rises to the occasion when pushed too far. The age-old debate about nature versus nurture overlooks the role of culture, and Bogart, both on and off the screen, is testimony to the fact that we become who we are in response to the times in which we live, that the times favor some traits, some people -- and some actors -- over others.
Bogart's appeal was and remains completely adult -- so adult that it's hard to believe he was ever young. If men who take responsibility are hard to come by in films these days, it's because they're hard to come by, period, in an era when being a kid for life is the ultimate achievement, and ''adult'' as it pertains to film is just a euphemism for pornography.

HEADLINE: Doing the Outsourcing

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
Except for a few odd jobs, I had been out of work for nine months when I was offered a job setting up an offshore help desk, with the possibility of more such work to follow. I want to refuse. My father's auto-industry job was outsourced, and I don't feel right helping co-workers lose their I.T. jobs. My wife argues that if I don't take this, someone else will, and that I have no duty to protect an industry that no longer employs me. Would it be ethical to accept the offer? NAME WITHHELD, SEATTLE
It is not unethical for an ambitious young person in, say, Mumbai to land a job that might otherwise go to an ambitious young personin, say, Seattle, and there is no opprobrium in your helping him or her land it. Americans do not enjoy moral precedence over Indians. Some people feel we have a greater ethical duty to those closest to us -- our neighbors -- but in an era of global trade and travel, that is a recipe for tribalism and its attendant ills. 
If this employer treats its offshore workers fairly -- you might consult the various organizations that monitor such things -- and if its American clients have not broken any promises to their domestic workers or the communities where they've long operated, then you may accept the offer. There are undoubtedly winners and losers in such economic relocations, and genuine hardship may occur, but it needn't follow that anyone involved acted improperly.
That is fortunate, because your wife's argument -- if you don't do it, someone else will -- would not justify nefarious conduct. Someone else will do pretty much anything. I've met ''someone else,'' and he's quite the little weasel. Nor have you any duty -- or, for that matter, much ability -- ''to protect an industry,'' whether or not it currently employs you. In any case, your taking this job is not akin to sneaking into a local I.T. firm and squirting Krazy Glue into its door locks.
I can understand your feelings of personal loyalty -- to friends, to former co-workers, to your own father's history. Such sentiments are worthy of respect. You may of course reject this offer simply because it makes you uneasy, guided by Pliny's dictum quod dubitas ne feceris. When in doubt, don't.
UPDATE: He declined the job out of principle. He continues to seek work.
I am a pediatric surgeon. After I scheduled an operation to remove the tonsils of a 10-year-old, her family told me that shortly before the surgery, her mother will enter prison for five years for orchestrating a large-scale Ponzi scheme.They urged me to ask the court to delay the startof her sentence so she can be with her child for the operation and a two-week recovery period. I feel the mother does not deserve a break, but the daughter does. Should I make the request? NINA L. SHAPIRO, LOS ANGELES
The request does carry the faint perfume of opportunism. This surgery is not exactly life-threatening. That mother no doubt wants to defer entering prison. (Has she made a similar plea to her child's dentist regarding a scheduled cleaning?) And yet the operation could be frightening to a child, who might be comforted by her mother's presence. Therefore you should either move up the date of the operation or make that request to the court: doing either could help your young patient. As her doctor, you must emphasize her well-being. The corollary benefit to the mother is irrelevant. Besides, how much of a ''break'' is it to delay -- not shorten -- her five-year sentence by two weeks?
No matter what you do, the child will suffer from her mother's absence for years, something the mother should have considered when committing these crimes: her victims were not just those she swindled but also the membersof her own family. The rest of us should also contemplate this cruel side effect of our criminal-justice system: it punishes not only the prisoner herself but also her family and, indeed, all who love her. A system that racks up so much collateral damage is one we should re-examine.
UPDATE: Shapiro made the request, but the court denied it. The father has since lost his health insurance and the operation was canceled.

LENGTH: 1165 words

HEADLINE: The Elephant in the Showroom

BYLINE: By EZRA DYER

 BODY:
INFINITI has a new hybrid on the way. The M35h, due in the spring, is said to be the only vehicle to offer more than 350 horsepower along with a 30 mile per gallon economy rating on the highway. That's an admirable achievement, and I'm sure that plenty of Infiniti buyers will take note of the new hybrid as they stroll past it on their way to buy a new 400-horsepower, 5,850-pound QX56 4WD. As the sales charts prove, the death of the S.U.V. has been much exaggerated.
The previous QX was based on the Nissan Titan pickup and was built in Canton, Miss. The redesigned 2011 QX56 is produced in Kyushu, Japan, and is based on the Nissan Patrol -- the longtime international competitor of Infiniti's parent company to the Toyota Land Cruiser. On other continents, you see Nissan Patrols used as desert police vehicles and warlord limousines. And, with apologies to the Titan, a rebadged despot-mobile is way more credible than a rebodied pickup. Stick some flags on the front fenders and you're halfway to running your own banana republic. Or, in the case of Americans' actual S.U.V. assignments, running to Banana Republic. 
The QX doesn't rewrite the giant-S.U.V. formula. But, as the only new player on the field, it does have all the latest gear. Its 5.6-liter V-8 engine, now fitted with direct fuel injection and variable valve timing and lift, makes 413 pound-feet of torque in addition to its 400 horses. That's roughly the same power as the Cadillac Escalade, but the Infiniti's fuel economy rating -- 14 m.p.g. in town and 20 on the open road -- beats the Caddy's by a couple of m.p.g. (The Escalade Hybrid, though, handily trumps them both.)
Evidence that engineers worked hard to wring better economy include the QX's new 7-speed gearbox, which even includes a transmission-fluid warmer to reduce internal drag on start-up. The fuel economy still isn't great, but at least you get a highway number that starts with a ''2.''
In redesigning the QX, Infiniti put a lot of thought into improving the day-to-day experience of owning a monster truck. A hydraulic system combats body roll, and the steering feels as if they let someone from the GT-R side of the company tune the rack. (This, I've found, is a trend in Nissan trucks: unexpectedly direct steering.)
A clever tire-pressure monitor helps you figure out how much air to add when the tires are low, softly honking the horn when they're aired up.
The seats with the Deluxe Touring Package are trimmed in something called semianiline leather, which is so soft that I imagine full aniline leather must feel like riding on the shoulders of an angel who's driving a hovercraft across a sea of warm marshmallow.
The QX's most helpful features, though, are the ones that apply to the simple challenge of seeing out of the thing. Visibility is always a problem in a full-size S.U.V. You're sitting up there in the wheelhouse and your bumpers are somewhere down below the cloud ceiling, possibly in different counties. You're always getting home and finding small items like A.T.M.'s and hot-dog carts stuck in the wheel wells and wondering, ''How long has that been there?''
To address this problem, Infiniti's Around View monitor uses multiple cameras to digitally stitch together a bird's-eye view of the vehicle, which is mighty useful in parking lots and other close quarters. A blind-spot-warning system lets you know when a Miata is swimming like a remora off your rear flank.
My favorite electronic helper, though, is Distance Control Assist, part of the $2,850 Technology Package. (The full-boat QX56 4WD that I drove included that option, as well as the $2,450 Theater Package and $6,950 Deluxe Touring Package, bringing the grand total to $72,170.)
You could probably live without the Theater Package's twin DVD screens, but the Technology Package should be considered mandatory. It includes Distance Control Assist, which uses lasers to scan the road ahead; if it concludes that you're on a collision course with a car or other obstacle, the accelerator pedal physically pushes back to clue you in to slow down. If you're still oblivious, the QX hits the brakes for you, which could be a real boon in mind-numbing stop-and-go traffic.
The system really works; I drove the QX several hundred miles and didn't crash into a single thing. I attribute this success to Distance Control Assist, my own careful driving and the fact that the QX56's front-end styling physically repels most living things. One gentleman driving ahead of me took a look in his rearview mirror and promptly set a new land speed record for an octogenarian in a Buick Park Avenue.
The QX56 looks good from the back. It looks good from the side. The front end? Well, imagine if a hammerhead shark and a manatee mated and raised their mutant spawn in the Gowanus Canal. I can imagine a focus group where 2 percent of participants rated the QX front end ''profoundly disturbing'' and the other 98 percent turned to stone.
Apparently, though, buyers are unbothered by the styling, because the QX56 is selling at a healthy clip. From July through December of last year, sales shot up 182 percent from the period a year earlier. That statistic points to the dirty little not-so-secret of the auto industry: for all the growth of (relatively) efficient crossovers, for all the talk about electrics, we Americans still love our giant four-wheel-drives.
Last year, Land Rover sales were up 21 percent over 2009. G.M.'s full-size pickup sales were up 17 percent. The full-size Mercedes-Benz GL was up 32.8 percent. As long as a tank of fuel costs something less than a bucket of caviar, America is going to buy big trucks.
And, driving the QX56, you remember why. It is more than you need most of the time -- more power, more towing ability, more ground clearance, more sheer size -- but when you have occasion to call on its abilities, it's supremely satisfying. This isn't a revelation on S.U.V. psychology, but when the forecast calls for a foot of snow or you've got six or seven people to cart around (or both, at once) it's awfully convenient to have a mondo S.U.V. at your disposal.
This isn't a rebodied front-wheel-drive sedan, in the crossover vein. It's a body-on-frame truck that can tow 8,500 pounds. And in this class, Infiniti is the only company with new metal in the showrooms.
Frankly, I'm surprised they had the time to deal with the QX, given Nissan's product onslaught. The company's roster of all-new vehicles includes the electric Leaf (a daunting project all on its own), an all-new Quest minivan, the NV full-size commercial van, the Juke hipster hatchback, a Murano crossover convertible and the Infiniti M35 Hybrid -- across its lineup, Nissan has some of the most interesting new products on the market.
So perhaps the QX56 doesn't reinvent the luxury S.U.V. But car buyers vote with their wallets, and at the moment, the voters say that 400 horsepower and a semianiline interior is reinvention enough.
INSIDE TRACK: Gigantic S.U.V.'s are out. Or are they?

HEADLINE: The Ringmaster's Guest Performers

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
I hesitate to describe The Times as a circus, but there is a Ringling Brothers quality to the doings here. Under an expansive tent with the familiar Times ''T'' streaming from the tent pole mast high above, an increasingly eclectic set of news providers performs daily in print and online.
From the cheap seats it is sometimes hard to tell who's who and what's what out there in dusty rings where feats of reporting, analysis and commentary unfold continuously. Yes, we know that most of the bylines belong to Times staffers and freelancers. But there are other content providers whose provenance is more challenging to understand.
The Times was clear when it told us that WikiLeaks was not a content partner; rather, it was a source of raw information and The Times itself produced the stories. On the other hand, I think readers all understand what it means when we see an Associated Press tag on a story: this is a traditional wire service that has provided content for decades. 
These days, though, other providers appear under the lights, names like ProPublica,The Center for Public Integrity,Footnoted.com,Reuters Breakingviews,Greenwire,The Bay Citizen,The Texas Tribune and the Chicago News Cooperative. The Times tries to identify these entities, but readers are less familiar with them and sometimes question them.
For example, Ben Beach, a reader in Bethesda, Md., wrote in with concerns about Reuters Breakingviews, a regular feature in Business Day that offers sharp interpretations of financial information. ''Reuters' history as a wire service inclines many of us to think of it as a 'just the facts, ma'am' operation rather than an opinion provider,'' he said.
And Jonathan Rogers of Baltimore complained about a column by ProPublica's Jesse Eisinger, a recent contributor in Business Day, saying, ''Its style is completely unlike The Times's.''
The Times's inclusion of the new providers, though, makes sense journalistically and economically. Attracting an audience, in print and in the expanding digital universe, requires ever more content and at a manageable cost. But managing this expansion carries risks.
''It is a double-edged sword,'' said Alan D. Mutter, a media consultant who writes the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur. ''On the one hand, third-party content can be more diverse than that which is produced inside the institution. Not to take anything away from The Times, but they can't be everywhere all the time. It is reasonable to assume that other people can be looking into matters that would be of great interest to readers of The New York Times. Having said all that, we just don't know who those people are and what their motivations are.''
Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, acknowledged the risks and said The Times takes pains to manage them. ''The material has to measure up to NYT standards,'' he said in an e-mail message, ''and we don't want to be outsourcing work that is part of The Times's core mission; it should not be supplanting work that we ought to be doing ourselves. Those thoughts are very much on our minds as we explore new ventures. They influence the choices of viable partners, the way we handle outside material and the way we package and label it.''
In a recent example, The Times partnered with Footnoted.com, a finance- oriented Web site founded and edited by the journalist Michelle Leder, to produce a Page 1 story about Goldman Sachs's rich executive compensation plan. The article, published on Jan. 19, was written by the Times staffers Susanne Craig and Eric Dash and drew from a Footnoted study of regulatory filings.
Ms. Leder said her operation, which is now owned by the research firm Morningstar, specializes in the kind of deep-dig document examination that news organizations depend on.
''Reporters don't always have the time to do the nuts and bolts document grind,'' she said. ''For all of the information we dug through for that Page 1 story on Goldman, there is a lot of garbage.''
ProPublica and the Center for Public Integrity, meanwhile, specialize in big investigative pieces that sometimes take months to assemble. The Center for Public Integrity, with a staff of 52, recently partnered with The Times on a strong series, written by The Times's Binyamin Appelbaum, about firms that make loans to plaintiffs in litigation, forwarding them cash -- at high rates -- against the promise of future awards. ProPublica, whose staff numbers 32, partnered notably with The Times in 2009 in a Pulitzer-winning Sunday Magazine opus about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans.
Both of these news organizations are nonprofits, supported by philanthropy and led by journalists with distinguished track records -- ProPublica by Paul Steiger, former managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, and the Center for Public Integrity by Bill Buzenberg, former vice president of news at NPR.
Both organizations see themselves as filling a hole that has opened across American journalism, if not at The Times itself. ''There are fewer people doing this work who are able to spend six or nine months on a story,'' Mr. Buzenberg said. He said his staff includes a lawyer who does nothing but Freedom of Information Act requests and four people doing computer-assisted reporting.
Reuters Breakingviews and Greenwire are yet another kind of news entity -- both for-profit services whose content serves a niche purpose under The Times's big top. Breakingviews, with its concise analytical bent, gives The Times something like The Wall Street Journal's ''Heard on the Street'' feature. Greenwire, online only in The Times, helps build out NYTimes.com's energy section in Business with five stories a day.
Meanwhile, The Bay Citizen, The Texas Tribune and the Chicago News Cooperative are nonprofits producing content for The Times's special regional pages that appear twice weekly in San Francisco, Texas and Chicago.
There's a lot of action in the ring, to be sure. But are readers given sufficient opportunity to know who all these performers really are -- who, for example, are their owners and key staff members, and who finances them? The Times typically provides an explanatory box in print and a link online, but it could do more.
''When you are using third-party journalistic content,'' said Ken Doctor, the author of ''Newsonomics'' and a news industry analyst for the consulting firm Outsell, ''it is so important to be clear with your readers that this is from a partner. Talk to readers, tell them, 'This is a third-party partner, we think it is a good partner, but it is not Times- produced content.' ''
Alan Mutter suggested what I think would be a good step for The Times: create a Times Topics page on NYTimes.com for each content provider, then refer to that page in print and link to it on the Web every time one of its articles runs. The page could include a detailed description of the organization with links to more information, like ownership and donor lists.
Then, at least, everyone in the cheap seats could have a program.

HEADLINE: Lost in Las Vegas

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS. 
MATT GROSS, the former Frugal Traveler, writes the ''Getting Lost'' series for the Travel section.

 BODY:
THE minute I walked into the steakhouse, I knew I was in the wrong place. Or maybe exactly the right place. This was N9ne, at the Palms Casino Resort, a few blocks from the Las Vegas Strip, and it was definitely not my scene. The slick design -- leather in muted colors, steel and aluminum accents, and silly lighting -- was one thing, but I've dealt with worse. No, it was the clientele: big men with vigorous, voluminous hair, a penchant for untucked dress shirts, done-up women at their sides and a kind of frat-boy bluster that terrifies a balding, neurotic little Brooklynite like me.
I came to know the men as the Shays -- a term adopted by my friend Jennifer Cornthwaite, a V.I.P. host at the Palms whom I'd met at a bar a couple of nights before. It derives from an e-mail Jennifer's ex-boss once wrote, in which he spelled ''touche'' as ''too shay.'' Soon, a Vegas type had been profiled: manly at a glance, uninhibited, at ease with cocktail waitresses and expensive cars. 
The Shays were everything I'd never been, and nothing I'd ever wanted to be, and yet, despite my snide superiority, I was fascinated and envious. I took a seat at the bar, ordered a bourbon from the bartender -- a dark, brooding, tattooed, intimidating fellow named A. C .-- and prepared to confront my own fear and loathing.
This reckoning had been a long time coming, and not just because I'd been in Las Vegas for five days already. For most of my life, I'd been puzzled and perplexed by the city's appeal -- that is, when I thought about it at all, which was only when pop culture impressions came flying at me from TV and movie screens. As I understood it, this was the land of Liberace, a neon catwalk for the un-self-conscious preening of the ''Swingers'' crowd, a font of mob nostalgia for ''Casino'' fans.
Then, in the last decade, I watched with disbelief as Sin City became the embodiment of American delusion, a boondoggle of billion-dollar debts and the ''Ocean's'' series of movies, in which nothing was at stake except vast riches and the chance to wear nice clothes as you walked along thick carpet. Las Vegas, it seemed, had been developed specifically not to appeal to cash-poor, overeducated, unconfident introverts (i.e., me). And so, with the exception of a single hourlong layover at the airport in 2004, I avoided it entirely.
Then, about two and a half years ago, as you may recall, the entire American economy collapsed. And with it went Las Vegas: those mega-hotels, where millions of people gambled away money they didn't have, were suddenly empty; so were the newly built, now foreclosed-upon McMansions. Today the city's unemployment rate is 14.9 percent, possibly the highest in the nation. Las Vegas had been humbled.
Well, if the city could show a little humility, so could I. Climbing off my high horse, I booked a flight on JetBlue, planning to spend a week in Las Vegas with no guidebook, contacts or hotel reservations to help me find my way. I would have to rely, as so many have before me, on Lady Luck.
Amazingly enough, the Lady presented herself to me almost right away. I'd landed at McCarran International, picked up my Toyota Matrix rental and driven through the Strip at the bright and early hour of 11 a.m. In the full, clear desert light, it looked forlorn, a graceless jumble of glass and steel. I did not stop, relaxing only when the Strip petered out -- after five interminable miles -- into downtown, a homely zone of small casinos, pawn shops and derelict motels. It wasn't entirely nice (plenty of homeless people), but it wasn't putting on airs either.
As usual, hunger brought me to a stop, this time at a divey Mexican joint called El Sombrero. Gastronomically, I wasn't hoping for much; this was a restaurant where you order by combination (I had the No. 8, an enchilada and a chile relleno) and where the waitress will invariably say: ''Careful! Plate very hot!'' But for atmosphere, this was what I needed: a dark, nearly windowless, low-ceilinged room plastered with black-and-white photos of forgotten performers. In one booth sat a 300-pound man and his elderly mother, both in black bowling shirts advertising a bail-bonds outfit. In another, a guy with an eye patch. These were not tourists.
After lunch, I continued exploring downtown, finally lighting on the Beat, a spacious cafe housed in Emergency Arts, a complex of art galleries, production companies and nonprofits.
At the Beat's counter, I ordered an iced coffee and came face to face with Lady Luck, in the flesh.She was, it turned out, a blond, tattooed 23-year-old regular who calls herself Krissee Danger and worked at the XXX Church. (It provides support for porn and sex addicts.) Raised a Calvinist in Grand Rapids, Mich., she'd moved here from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2008, just as the economy was falling apart, and had in that short span of time become an expert in all the cool, nontouristy things to do in Las Vegas.
All I'd told her was that I'd come to get lost in Las Vegas, and the information began to gush. Why, just across the street, she said, was the El Cortez Hotel, thriving since the 1940s, when Bugsy Siegel owned the place -- I should stay in the new, boutique wing, the Cabana Suites, whose huge postmodern Art Deco rooms were awesome.
At night, she said, I wouldn't need to go far, either: The Beat was right on Fremont Street, a once blighted, now resurgent downtown block that had great bars and a nice kebab shop. Next to the Beat, she said, a video arcade/bar would be opening soon, but until then there was the Pinball Hall of Fame, a warehouse of more than 300 classic pinball machines and video games, on the east side of town.
I'd hit the jackpot. The Cabana Suites? Awesome, indeed: comfortable and colorful, glam (bright green walls, a buttoned-''leather'' headboard) but stately (a bathroom of gray marble). And at $72 a night, I might even have enough money left over to lose in the casinos, an option whose sudden possibility carried with it an unshakeable attraction.
First, however, there was the real Las Vegas to see. Just north of downtown, for example, was the Neon Museum, an open-air repository of electric signs that also happened to be the perfect introduction to Las Vegas history. It began with the construction of the Hoover Dam in 1931, according to Justin Favela, the Las Vegas native who led the tour. (Krissee, a guide in training, followed and took notes.) Electricity transformed what had been a railroad town, making possible the gorgeous signs that gave Las Vegas an identity.
But not a fixed identity. Casino themes shifted, from the Old West to Orientalism to Family-Friendly (one sign looked like King Friday from ''Mr. Rogers''). Other details hinted at the city's unconventionality: the Moulin Rouge, whose elegantly calligraphed sign now rested in this boneyard, had broken ground as the first integrated casino. And it was designed by Betty Willis, the only woman to penetrate the boys' club of neon-makers; she also created the Stardust sign, an Atomic Age icon, and the famous ''Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas'' sign.
What amazed me as much as the neon beauty was the dedication of people like Justin and Krissee to preserving and understanding the city's imperiled past. And they weren't alone. One evening, as I was driving through downtown, I hit the brakes when I spotted Lost Vegas, an antiques shop where every little bit of Las Vegas history was on sale. Commemorative boxing pins, a Marilyn Monroe mannequin, ashtrays from seemingly every casino throughout history -- it was incredible. I bought an unopened deck of cards ($10) from the long-gone Dunes, and went out into the night. I had some gaming to do.
Video gaming, that is. The Pinball Hall of Fame that Krissee had mentioned (and given vague directions to) was my next stop, and an agonizing one. Back in college, I'd quit playing video games entirely. They had devoured my days the way I imagined hard drugs might an addict's, and when Doom, one of the original first-person shooters, came out, I knew I had to stop.
But surely these innocent, lovingly restored pinball games, dating back to 1947's Heavy Hitter, wouldn't be a problem. And they weren't -- not at first. I plunked quarters into games both modern (Avatar; better than the movie) and ancient (the kitschy Impacto), and enjoyed myself immensely.
Then I stumbled on Robotron 2084, a 1982 video game with frantic action and all-encompassing sound design. One quarter vanished into its slot, and then another and another. I could tell I was getting in too deep (I could almost taste the abyss), and I wrenched myself away. My heart was racing with adrenaline and anxiety, but I was proud. I'd shown self-control. Maybe I could even sit down to a wee tiny little bit of blackjack one of these nights.
After dinner, of course. The first couple of days, eating was problematic. The buffets of the Strip did not exactly appeal to me, nor did dining alone at, say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. But one evening, while driving aimlessly, I took a couple of wrong turns, wound up on the west side and realized that every sign bore Chinese characters, Korean letters and Vietnamese diacritical marks. I'd hit Chinatown, entirely by accident.
Over the next few days, I'd eat excellent noodles and pork chops at Pho Kim Long (Krissee's favorite, I later learned), decent Taiwanese at Ay-Chung Cafe and late-night snacks at Fukuburger, a food truck whose Karai burger -- topped with cucumbers, avocado cream, spicy mayo and a habanero-spiked soy sauce -- was the best burger I'd had in years. (And I wasn't even drunk.)
I loved Fuku's scene, too. Within a couple of minutes of arriving, I was talking about hot dogs with two guys, one from Chicago, the other from Washington, and Robert Magsalin, known as Mags, one of Fuku's owners, was fetching us free egg-yolk shooters with pickled daikon. Why was Mags being so friendly? For that matter, why was everyone in Las Vegas? From Krissee and Mags to the El Cortez security guard, people just wanted to chat, and never in a way that felt like a tourist-outreach campaign.
To my surprise, I was really beginning to like this place and, even odder, to respect it. Life here was easy: I could eat Asian food and explore old Las Vegas during the day, and at night I could head downtown for a microbrew at the brick-arched Griffin or a mezcal cocktail at Downtown, a slick bar owned by Jennifer, the Palms V.I.P. host, and her husband, Michael. And if I needed an escape, I could always drive into the desert to catch a corny but fun Old West melodrama at Bonnie Springs Ranch or go hiking in the startling beauty of Red Rock Canyon. Las Vegas, I'd long known, was a party town, but I hadn't realized I was invited.
At the same time, I was hiding. The ''real'' Las Vegas I'd been exploring was a diversion from another, just as real version: the Sin City of the Strip, the crowds, the resorts, the gambling.
And so, with two days left, I checked out of the Cabana Suites and into the Wynn, a 45-story, 2,716-room glass-and-steel arc of luxury and excess. My room, larger than my first New York apartment, was decked out in cream leather and pale fabrics, and the tap of a button spread the curtains to reveal the glowing Strip below. The Wynn was not at all my style, but man, it was comfortable.
That was the night I decided, at Jennifer's behest, to visit the Palms and plunge myself deep into the world of the Shays. For a while, as I sat at the steakhouse bar, I assumed I'd be discovered, and beaten to a nerdy, interloping pulp.
But then I found out that the bartender, A. C., had a daughter a week older than mine; we showed off iPhone photos of our kids, and the thaw began. Next, a man named Glenn Schwartz sat beside me, and as we chatted about the city, I learned that he was a publicist who has represented everyone from Milton Berle to Penn & Teller to Bill Nye the Science Guy. Very cool. Even here, deep in Shays territory, conviviality ruled, stereotypes faltered.
But there was one thing I had to do before leaving Las Vegas. I had to gamble.
This was going to be a problem. Once upon a time, back when I had an office job, I used to spend afternoons playing blackjack with the guys in my department. We'd play only 50 cents or a dollar a hand, but over time, I noticed, I was coming out ahead. And that, I knew, was dangerous. I quit.
Not long afterward I became the Frugal Traveler columnist for The New York Times, and embarked on years of cost-conscious voyages during which throwing money away on card games was out of the question. Though I'm no longer bound by frugality, that sense is still embedded in my consciousness, a frustrating component of my control-issue neuroses.
All of which is to say, this wasn't going to be easy. On my last night in Las Vegas, I strolled along the Strip, taking photos of the garish lights and the poorly dressed tourists, and wishing on some level that I could simply enjoy myself as they were, freely and unironically.
At the Cosmopolitan hotel, I stopped. This was a new multibillion-dollar development, and the style was much closer to my own: urban and contemporary. The hotel's interiors, by David Rockwell, were truly beautiful, particularly the bead-bedecked Chandelier Bar, and its array of restaurants impressive. At Jaleo, a tapas bar run by Jose Andres, I ate excellent pan con tomate and butifarra stew, and discussed food trucks and Buddhist chants with the woman seated next to me, a visiting San Franciscan named Christine.
At last, full of wine and olive oil, I made my way back to the Wynn, having decided I could lose $300 -- no more. Still, I circled the blackjack tables for 10 minutes, unable to sit down. Should I join a game in progress, or find an empty table? What if I do something wrong? I was paralyzed.
And then, suddenly, I wasn't. I picked an empty table, handed $300 to the dealer and placed a $25 chip -- the minimum bet -- on the green felt.
Within five minutes, I was up $150 -- and confounded. I'd spent so much time worrying about how much I could lose that I hadn't considered where to stop if I was winning. A comped bourbon appeared at my side, and, well, it felt rude to leave so early.
Ten minutes later, at 1:59 a.m., I was broke. I took my barely sipped drink to the elevator, but outside my room I paused. On my previous ''Getting Lost'' trip, to China, I'd visited a Buddhist temple and drawn a very lucky fortune: No. 23. Now I had an idea.
Back down at the casino floor, I handed $40 to the roulette dealer, and put all my chips on 23, figuring Buddha or God or Lady Luck might intervene at the last minute. The wheel spun, the little ball bounced ... and then the dealer took my chips away.
The next morning, it was time for penance. I drove west, out past strip malls and neighborhoods of foreclosed homes, to Red Rock Canyon, where for two hours I ran up hills, along sandy trails and across dry riverbeds, inhaling the untainted air and gazing at the infinite variety of colors and textures. The $340 loss stung, even now, and yet I tried to take a Buddhist approach. The money was, like so many things in Las Vegas, an illusion, an unnecessary attachment merely getting in the way. Perhaps, I thought, that's why everyone in Las Vegas, winners and losers alike, is so happy -- because the bond between man and property is so tenuous.
The Buddhist chants Christine had taught me at dinner had, alas, slipped from my memory. And so I just kept running, my feet beating out an endless, unspoken mantra on the cold, dry floor of the desert.
WHERE TO STAY
If you're staying downtown, it's hard to do better than El Cortez Cabana Suites (651 East Ogden Avenue; 800-634-6703, eccabana.com; from $57 a night). But if you really want to save money, nearby is the Gold Spike (217 Las Vegas Boulevard North; 702-384-8444; goldspike.com), whose newly renovated Ikea-style rooms start at $39.99. On the Strip, you can't really go wrong with the Wynn (3121 Las Vegas Boulevard South; 702-770-8000, wynnlasvegas.com) or the Cosmopolitan (3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South; 702-215-5500; cosmopolitanlasvegas.com), but get ready to spend upward of $200 on your room.
WHAT TO DO
The Neon Museum (821 Las Vegas Boulevard North; 702-387-6366; neonmuseum.org; tours, twice daily except Sunday, $15; reservations recommended) should be your first daytime stop in Vegas, followed by a trip to Sam's Town (5111 Boulder Highway; 702-456-7777; samstownlv.com), a hotel-casino whose atrium hosts a laser-light-and-water show with an animatronic bear and beaver. The Pinball Hall of Fame (1610 East Tropicana Avenue; 702-597-2627; pinballmuseum.org) is a wonderful place to rid yourself of excess quarters -- and delve into the history of pinball and video games.
West of Vegas proper is Red Rock Canyon (State Route 159; www.blm.gov/nv; admission $7 per car), a nearly 200,000-acre National Conservation Area where you can go hiking, camping and rock climbing. About five miles farther down Route 159 is Bonnie Springs Ranch (702-875-4191; bonniesprings.com; admission $20 per carload of up to six people), a re-creation of an Old West town with a petting zoo, gift shops, a restaurant-saloon and awesomely corny shows. Don't miss the hanging!
WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK
Downtown Las Vegas is not yet a prime dining destination, but El Sombrero (807 South Main Street; 702-382-9234) is good for a meal or two, and the Beat Coffeehouse and Records (520 Fremont Street; 702- 409-5563; thebeatlv.com) serves food, including the Slap & Tickle sandwich, a peanut butter and jelly with bacon and pickled jalapenos -- delicious. After dark, pop into the Griffin(511 Fremont Street; 702-382-0577) for good beer, Downtown Cocktail Room (111 Las Vegas Boulevard South; 702-880-3696; thedowntownlv.com) for mixed drinks or the Beauty Bar (517 Fremont Street; 702-598-1965; thebeautybar.com) for local bands.
The eating is much better out on Spring Mountain Road, which runs through the heart of Chinatown. Think Korean barbecue, Sichuan noodles, food trucks (follow @fukuburger on Twitter for locations), Hawaiian poke, Vietnamese sandwiches, Filipino bakeries, Malaysian satay, Japanese izakayas .... Stop and indulge at will. After all, this is Las Vegas.

HEADLINE: Housing Bubbles Are Few and Far Between

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
WHAT'S the outlook for home prices over the next decade? It's not easy to tell. We need to confront the basic fact that near the beginning of the 21st century, the market for homes in much of the world suddenly became more speculative than ever.
This enormous housing bubble and burst isn't comparable to any national or international housing cycle in history. Previous bubbles have been smaller and more regional. 
We have to look further afield for parallels. The most useful may be the long trail of booms and crashes in the price of land, particularly of farms, forests and village lots. Those upheavals may give some insights into the present situation, and some guidance for the next decade.
In the 19th century and most of the 20th, speculation in land was a powerful phenomenon. There was little speculative activity around homes, however, which were usually viewed as rapidly depreciating assets whose value was to be found almost entirely in physical buildings, not the land beneath them. Eventually, the buildings were expected to be torn down and replaced, so there was little bubble psychology for housing on any large scale. People generally didn't think about housing as an investment.
But they knew that land was fixed in quantity and would last forever, and many believed that as the economy grew and more people were born, there would be ever-increasing demand. The speculative imagination could be easily fired by reflecting on the huge population that would consume the food from this land or settle on it in future years.
There have been many highly localized land price bubbles in the United States over the last couple of centuries, although bubbles over large areas have been rather rare. Those with the biggest national impact were in the 19th century, when speculators found opportunities that had been created by government land sales and by shifts in land prices set off by construction of canals and railroads. Stories of fortunes in land speculation captured the imagination, and led to bubbles. (That is typically how bubbles form, by titillating the public imagination.)
Two such land bubbles stand out. The first, in the 1830s, was associated with federal distributions to state banks and the loss of fiscal restraint that had been imposed by the short-lived Second Bank of the United States. People began to think farm prices could never fall. As an article in a publication called The Cultivator said in 1836: ''Who ever heard of a man buying and selling a farm at the same or a lessened price? It is so well understood that the seller is to have more than he gave, that it has almost become a settled principle in the purchase of real estate.''
The bubble burst with the Panic of 1837, and was followed by the first great depression in United States history, from 1837 to 1843.
A second bubble, in the 1850s, was encouraged by an 1852 act of Congress making land warrants tradable. It burst with the Panic of 1857. Some historians -- notably James L. Huston of Oklahoma State University -- say they think that the resulting tensions escalated sectional animosities and helped precipitate the Civil War, which ended the depression.
The entire 20th century appears to have had only one farmland bubble of national significance -- it occurred in the 1970s. Its causes were complex, but it seems to have been accompanied by a newly common belief that the human population would soon become excessive. A widely cited Club of Rome report in 1972 predicted famines induced by overpopulation. In any case, that bubble burst after the Federal Reserve clamped down on credit in the United States, effectively producing the recessions of the early 1980s.
So land manias have been rather infrequent, many decades apart. They suggest that the recent housing bubble is a similarly rare event, not to be repeated for many decades.
But, of course, the relevance of this long history isn't entirely clear. In contrast to the 19th century, when the business cycle proceeded without much constraint, we now have the Fed and an active government housing stabilization policy, both of which mitigate the cycle's more extreme effects. And now, the Dodd-Frank law has created a Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is supposed to go even further to prevent instability.
Ultimately, bubbles are impossible without extreme public enthusiasm. Opinions about housing seem to change in rather trendy ways, but investor enthusiasm for housing has now been down for more than five years -- a decline that started well before the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007.
With Karl Case of Wellesley College, who developed the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices with me, I have been surveying opinions of home buyers in the United States on and off since 1988. We have found a fairly steady downtrend since the early-to-mid-2000s in a number of speculative attitudes. On questionnaires, people are less likely to report that they think of housing as an investment, or to express the view that real estate is the ''best investment.''
As an investment, in fact, they are more likely to see housing as risky. Although they still have solid expectations of home price increases over the next 10 years -- a median of 5 percent annually, in nominal terms -- those expectations have been declining and are not nearly as extravagant as they were before the market peak.
IT will take a while for the housing market to recover fully. Still, many people continue to think of housing as an investment, and so it does seem that we are in danger of encountering another whopper bubble someday. Even so, both the history of land bubbles and the slowness of shifts in public opinion suggest that such bubbles will be fairly rare.
Add the new policy restraints, and a new national housing bubble looks even less likely anytime soon.

AMERICAN UPRISING
The Untold Story of America's Largest Slave Revolt
By Daniel Rasmussen
276 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.
Two centuries ago last month, a traveler making his way by boat down the Mississippi toward New Orleans would have come upon a ghastly sight: a severed human head rotting on the end of a pole. And no sooner would it vanish around a bend than another appeared along the levee. Then another, and another -- and so on without respite for 40 long miles down to the city.
What must it have been like to experience this? Did the horror build and build with each successive glimpse of those dreadful trophies? Or how many apparitions did it take -- 10, 20, 100? -- before they began to seem familiar milestones on the journey, ordinary features of the passing landscape?
In a sense, those heads were totems of an all-too-commonplace aspect of the American scene: the landscape of slavery and white supremacy. Each one had been cut from the corpse of a black man killed for fighting to be free. 
Early in January 1811, along the same riverbank, a small army of Louisiana slaves had briefly faced a small army of slaveholders. It was, as described in ''American Uprising,'' Daniel Rasmussen's chilling and suspenseful account, the culmination of a signal episode in the history of American race relations.
On a night just at the beginning of carnival season, black workers belonging to a planter named Manuel Andry broke into their master's house armed with axes, machetes and sugar-cane knives. For Andry, surprised in his bedroom, it must have been the realization of every slaveholder's worst fears. He managed to flee, but not before seeing his son Gilbert being hacked to pieces.
Perhaps, in those awful moments, Andry also registered shock at recognizing the ringleader in the assault: Charles Deslondes, a mixed-race slave driver on his plantation, a favored overseer entrusted with enforcing discipline among the field hands. Deslondes might have seemed the last person to strike back at the system, much less at his own master.
But Louisiana in 1811 was a place almost as different as can be imagined from the stable, tranquil Old South of legend. Newly acquired by the United States, the territory was a frontier in the throes of an economic boom, as sugar cultivation bred fortunes overnight. A weak, unpopular governor, William Claiborne, struggled to impose some measure of federal authority on the suspicious locals. Ambitious, hard-fisted men who had flocked to the Gulf Coast jostled against the established French colonial families in a bruising struggle for land and power.
Moreover, land and power were only two of the crucial ingredients of success. A third -- more essential, in some respects, than the others -- was black labor, preferably young, strong men who could survive the excruciating conditions in the cane fields. And so slaves poured into Louisiana: from Africa, from the Eastern states, from the West Indies.
Louisiana's sugar economy had exploded after the recent collapse of another former French colony: Haiti, originally known as Saint Domingue. With the island convulsed by a successful slave rebellion and a protracted, ultimately failed war of reconquest, its exports plunged, opening the way to competition from the American mainland. But, Rasmussen writes, as planters ''worked to build a new Saint Domingue on the shores of the Mississippi, they did not realize the extent to which they were also creating the conditions that allowed the Haitian revolution to occur.''
For blacks, Haiti meant something different: a hope of success. Caribbean slaves shipped to Louisiana brought with them knowledge of the young republic, founded on ideals of equality. Newcomers from Africa contributed military expertise derived from recent civil wars in the Congo region.
Deslondes's co-conspirators included two West African-born slaves, Kook and Quamana. After the takeover of the Andry plantation, they and dozens of comrades seized weapons, horses and militia uniforms stored on the premises and began marching toward New Orleans, burning houses and killing another white planter. The sources are contradictory about how large an army the blacks ultimately mustered. Depending on who made the accounting, the rebels numbered anywhere from 124 to 500.
Their campaign was short-lived. Within 48 hours, the slave army was routed in a pitched battle by a better armed force of local whites in part under Andry's command. Survivors were massacred. The planters made a particular example of Deslondes, chopping off his hands and breaking his thighs before shooting him and then burning his corpse. In the weeks that followed, as many as a hundred more rebels were captured, killed and beheaded, sometimes after perfunctory trials.
Yet the effects of the 1811 revolt long outlasted the event. Governor Claiborne quickly exploited the planters' unease as a means of consolidating national power over Louisiana.
''American Uprising'' began as Rasmussen's senior thesis at Harvard, where he received his undergraduate degree in 2009. The revolt, he writes, ''has languished in the footnotes of history for 200 years.'' Yet he bases much of his own account on already-published sources, and his research is strangely thin in places.
History teaches that every revolution has its local, immediate causes as well as its broader, ideological ones. But we learn little of Andry except that he was ''known for his cruelty toward his slaves'' and possessed ''untold riches.'' Details gleaned from census records, court documents and newspapers might have shed light on why his plantation became the flashpoint of revolt.
As for the rebels, Rasmussen spins tenuous webs of conjecture from the scant details of their backgrounds and motivations. For instance, he suggests -- reasonably enough -- that Kook and Quamana's names indicate the men may have been Akan, ''children of a warlike African empire at the height of its glory.'' But 80-odd pages later, with no further evidence, they become ''Akan warriors,'' and on the following page, leaders of an entire ''detachment of Akan warriors.''
Although Rasmussen may go too far when he calls the ''massive uprising'' a ''central moment in our nation's past,'' he concludes the book by tracing the white fear of black violence that runs like a scarlet thread through our national history, from the Declaration of Independence (which accused George III of trying to foment ''domestic insurrections'') through the Constitution (which promised federal aid to states facing slave rebellions and Indian attacks) to the coming of the Civil War.
Rasmussen could have revisited the Mississippi levees to bring his story of racial paranoia and retribution full circle. In New Orleans in 2005, amid the nightmare of Hurricane Katrina, white panic over alleged rapes and murders by African-Americans led to a still-uncounted number of civilian shootings by police officers and vigilantes. One man was shot in the back while crossing a bridge through a black neighborhood: the Claiborne Avenue overpass.

HEADLINE: Online Shopping Made Easier

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
CONSUMERS who have practically made a national sport out of hunting down the best price for everything from lipstick to laptops online often fail to comparison-shop for mortgages, finding the Web sites unhelpful or difficult to navigate.
Some of the nation's leading mortgage sites have responded by working to become more consumer-friendly. Their revamped sites, they say, will let borrowers not only browse lender rates and terms, but learn about market trends and read comments from other shoppers.
Keith T. Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH Associates, which tracks mortgage rates and provides rate quotes from lenders, says that while there is plenty of mortgage information out there, much of what has been available on the Web until recently is ''broad but shallow.'' 
''Consumers often can't get some of the more technically oriented stuff,'' he said, citing explanations of when an adjustable-rate mortgage actually adjusts, or prepayment penalties apply.
At LendingTree, an online marketplace that connects borrowers to lenders, consumers can browse not just quotes from various lenders but also a burgeoning array of industry articles, research tools, calculators and consumer-generated ratings and reviews of lenders.
In December, according to Nicole Hall, a spokeswoman for LendingTree, the company created an online feature in which borrowers can post a mortgage-related question to be answered by a LendingTree loan specialist. ''We've been doing a lot of development of information resources for consumers over the past year,'' she said, citing the company's growing list of how-to tips for first-time buyers and those wanting to refinance.
Quicken Loans, an online direct lender, has an expanding number of customer-written reviews -- both positive and negative -- on buying and refinancing. Starting in March, consumers can also download Quicken Loan's iPhone app and track when appraisals come in, closing dates are set, and other time-sensitive hurdles in the home-buying process are reached.
Even major banks are making changes. Bank of America said it was taking a ''dual path'' online, offering one set of articles and tools for first-time buyers, another for the more experienced. For all borrowers, ''we shoot for a ninth-grade reading level for everything we put on the Web,'' said Arturo Perez, a home loans marketing executive at the bank. ''We want simpler language.''
The added educational resources and customer tools arrive amid indications that buyers aren't shopping around for loans nearly as much as they should.
A poll of more than 1,300 homeowners conducted by Harris Interactive, a market research firm, for LendingTree, and published in December, found that while 96 percent of Americans comparison-shopped for ''anything,'' only 61 percent said they did so for mortgages. The remaining 39 percent took out home loans based on just one quote -- even though 9 in 10 of those buyers said they knew that rates varied among lenders.
Mr. Gumbinger believes that consumers, particularly first-time home buyers, simply ''get freaked out'' by the entire process. ''There are so many choices, decisions, time pressures, things to sign,'' he said. Thomas Martin, president of America's Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group, agreed. ''They are trying to educate the consumer,'' he said of the online companies, ''and there's a lot of information out there, but a lot of times, it's overkill.''
Bob Walters, the chief economist at Quicken Loans, says online mortgage companies are generally ''more uniformly educational'' than the bricks-and-mortar lenders. But he agrees about consumers' propensity to feel overwhelmed -- a fact acknowledged on Quicken's Web site with a hint of levity: during the holidays, it posted instructions for turning excess paperwork into Origami.

Q.Can you explain why some Metro-North train cars have two sets of doors and some have three? And why are the middle doors kept closed on many runs?
A. All 813 of Metro-North's electric-train cars have two sets of doors, plus the connecting doors at each end, said Marjorie Anders, a Metro-North spokeswoman. Of the roughly 200 cars that are hauled by diesel locomotives, about half have two doors on each side and half have three. The three-door coaches, she said, are newer, and the center doors were added to speed loading and unloading. Except in emergencies, they are used mainly on the Harlem and Hudson Lines.
The more doors, however, the greater the risk that in winter snow can get into the door motors and cause them to malfunction, she said. A malfunction can cause a door to remain open on a moving train, a danger that was captured in January on YouTube, but that happens ''very infrequently,'' Ms. Anders said. The more common problem is that the door will not open at all. 
Before snowstorms and other severe winter weather events, she said, the center doors are locked for three reasons: ''to prevent slips in the vestibules, to improve customer comfort by keeping the heat in the cars and to minimize the risk of motor burnouts, which are a major cause across the fleet for a car to be taken out of service.''
Plugged-In Ships
Q. Whatever happened to the proposal to wire the Brooklyn cruise ship terminal at Red Hook (right) so that ships in port can get their electric power from Con Edison instead of spewing diesel exhaust over Red Hook?
A. Pretty much everyone says they are for shore-based power -- known as cold ironing in marine language -- since it can remove a major source of pollution the ships produce when they burn bunker fuel. According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the Red Hook piers, electricity from the power grid produces about one-tenth of the emissions produced by a ship's onboard generators. Money for the pier improvements is already in the Port Authority's budget. Shore-based electric power for the cruise ship terminal would be produced by the New York State Power Authority and delivered through the Consolidated Edison Company's electrical distribution system.
But there is a continuing disagreement over the delivery rate Con Edison would charge to use its distribution system, a rate that is set by the state's Public Service Commission. (Con Edison would actually charge the New York Power Authority, which would then charge the terminal operator, a division of the city's Economic Development Corporation, for both energy and delivery. Eventually, the ship owners would pay.)
The Port Authority, the city, the Environmental Protection Agency and some consumer groups favor changing Con Edison's existing rate structure so that the Power Authority's costs would be lowered and the kind of electrical service the ships would use would be much cheaper. According to the Port Authority, ships berthed in the Port of New York and using shore power at the Power Authority's present rates would be paying four times the average cost of using their own oil-fueled generators.
But Con Edison opposes changing the rate structure just to make it cheaper for the ships. The cost to maintain the distribution system remains the same, so that if Con Edison rates are cut for one group, the rates for all other groups (homeowners, for instance) might have to go up. ''How do you come up with a fair rate that doesn't burden other customers?'' Chanoch Lubling, Con Edison's vice president of regulatory services, said in an interview. Shore-based power through feeder connections ''happens to be a great idea,'' he said. ''I think the big debate here is who should pay for their cost.''
Talks among the various interest groups lasted from February to August without agreement. Their final report in September, outlining the disagreements, was filed with the Public Service Commission. It included an opinion by the commission's staff that the way Con Edison's delivery rates are currently structured posed ''neither a barrier to, nor an unwarranted incentive for'' the kind of electrical facilities shore-based power would need.
Line of Duty
Q.The recent killing of a police officer in New Jersey caused me to wonder about the New York Police Department: Aside from 9/11, what year saw the most homicides against New York City police officers? Did fatal shootings of officers rise and fall with the city's overall crime rate?
A. In general, yes. ''With the decline of crime, fewer police officers are being killed in the line of duty,'' Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the police spokesman, said in an e-mail.
Leaving aside the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when 23 New York City police officers died, the department's worst year was 1971, when 15 officers died in the line of duty, 12 by gunfire. ''It was not unusual during the balance of the '70s for six or more police officers to be shot and killed annually,'' Mr. Browne said. In 1980, 10 officers were shot and killed in the line of duty; in 1987 and again in 1988, six were shot and killed.
By contrast, fatal shootings of officers dropped in the 1990s and dropped even further in the past decade. In the past three years, one police officer was shot and killed, and that fatality was a police shooting in 2009 that resulted from mistaken identity.
In the city as a whole, the number of homicides peaked in 1990, with 2,245 killings. The city's violent crime and homicide rates for the past 25 years also peaked in 1990, according to statistics the police reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They dropped sharply in the 1990s and 2000s, and city homicides have annually remained below 600 since 2002. They reached a record low of 471 in 2009, but rose in 2010.
A 9/11 Memorial
Q.In the financial district, a one-block length of Thames Street between Trinity Place and Greenwich Street has signs designating it as Emeric J. Harvey Place. Who was he?
A. Mr. Harvey, 56, was killed on Sept. 11, 2001. A Brooklyn native who lived in Montclair, N.J., he was a trader on the floor of the American Stock Exchange and founder and president of Harvey Young Yurman Inc. The block named in his honor is next to the American Exchange. It was one of dozens that were given honorary street co-namings by the City Council in 2006 and 2007. The one that got the most attention was a stretch of Church Avenue in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, that now honors the reggae star Bob Marley.

HEADLINE: Hackers Gained Access to Nasdaq Systems, but Not Trades

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Reporting was contributed by Charlie Savage, Joseph Goldstein, Riva Richmond and William K. Rashbaum.

 BODY:
Computer hackers have breached the systems of the company that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York but did not penetrate the part of the system that handles trades, Nasdaq said Saturday.
The exchange's operating company, Nasdaq OMX, said in a statement that it had discovered suspicious files on its United States servers, and that it immediately began conducting an investigation in conjunction with outside firms and federal law enforcement agencies.
Government and law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation said it was being handled by the F.B.I.'s cybercrimes branch along with the Justice Department. These officials also said it appeared that the trading platform was not breached. 
An attack on banks and other pillars the financial system has long been a top fear of government officials because of the potential for harm to the economy.
Nasdaq is one of the country's largest stock exchanges, and many of the nation's most important companies use it to list their shares for trading. If there were evidence that hackers could breach the inner trading systems, it could cause jitters among the companies listed on the exchange and the traders and investors who buy and sell millions of shares each day.
But Nasdaq and market experts said there was an important distinction between the parts of the system that are connected to the Web, and thus more vulnerable, and the architecture for the trading platform, which Nasdaq says operates independently.
The company said it had determined that a Web-based application on its servers called Directors Desk, on which corporations can store and share information, might have been affected. Nasdaq said the suspicious files ''were immediately removed and at this point there is no evidence that any Directors Desk customer information was accessed or acquired by hackers.''
''At no point was any of Nasdaq OMX's operated or serviced trading platforms compromised,'' the company said.
The company's Web site says Directors Desk has 5,000 users.
A spokesman for the company said it discovered the suspicious files late last year.
The fact that investigators discovered suspicious files suggests that the breach involved the installation of malicious software, or malware, said Ed Stroz, a former FBI agent who is co-president of Stroz Friedberg, a firm that investigates cyberattacks.
In attacks on companies, Mr. Stroz said, hackers often plant malware that acts as a back door, which allows them to deliver other malicious programs to do other tasks, which could include copying sensitive data and delivering it to the intruder.
Malware could have been installed any number of ways, including with an attack through the Web interface of Directors Desk or by infiltrating an executive's computer by tricking him into opening an attachment or clicking on a link to a malicious Web page in an e-mail.
Nasdaq now handles about 19 percent of stock trading in the United States, compared with 27 percent by the larger New York Stock Exchange and its electronic trading arm.
In a statement, the New York Stock Exchange said: ''We take any potential threat seriously and we continue working at the highest levels of security and integrity.'' The N.Y.S.E. would not say whether there had been any attempts to breach its systems or whether it had been contacted by federal investigators.
News of the breach was originally reported in The Wall Street Journal.
Nasdaq said it had refrained from notifying its customers of the breach at the request of the Justice Department, ''in order to facilitate the continuing investigation,'' but that when the Journal article appeared it consulted with authorities and decided to send out notice.
The Journal article said the investigation showed some evidence pointing toward Russia. One government official said investigators were specifically looking into that possibility, although the official said, ''I don't know what the basis for the belief is.''
The stock exchanges and the trading that takes place on them have become increasingly computerized, potentially making them more vulnerable to manipulation or attack. Like Nasdaq, the N.Y.S.E. has also adopted more electronic trading. And in the last five years or so, other electronic exchanges like Direct Edge and BATS Exchange have arisen, intent on prying trading away from the two bigger markets. Direct Edge and BATS each handle about 10 percent of the market.
A spokesman for the BATS Exchange said it had never had any hacking issue of this kind.
A spokesman for Direct Edge, Rafi Reguer, said it was continually monitoring its systems but was not aware of any serious attempt to penetrate its computers.

HEADLINE: Early America, Ripe for Counterfeiters

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
''THERE is properly no history; only biography,'' Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in 1841. In ''Moneymakers: The Wicked Lives and Surprising Adventures of Three Notorious Counterfeiters'' (Penguin, $27.95), Ben Tarnoff lends ample credence to that notion. He shows how three con men were able to thrive in America's early days because of a weak central government, an often-chaotic banking system, a turbulent economy and an entrepreneurial populace.
Few countries, Mr. Tarnoff writes, ''have had as rich a counterfeiting history as America.'' Creating fake currency, he states, ''gave enterprising Americans from the colonial era onward a chance to get rich quick: to fulfill the promise of the American dream by making money, literally.'' 
Mr. Tarnoff, who graduated from Harvard in 2007 and has worked at Lapham's Quarterly, focuses on the lives of three counterfeiters who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. Taken together, he writes, these three biographies ''tell the story of a country coming of age -- from a patchwork of largely self-governing colonies to a loosely assembled union of states and, finally, to a single nation under firm federal control.''
The first subject of this rollicking good read is Owen Sullivan, an Irish immigrant who was born around 1720 and originally was a silversmith in Boston. In the seven years he was a counterfeiter, he built a loosely organized team called the Dover Money Club.
Like his partners, Sullivan was behind bars several times in the course of his career. Until his final arrest, however, these encounters with the law were small detours on an entrepreneurial journey in pre-industrial crime. When he was hanged in New York City in 1756, he claimed to have forged more than $:25,000 worth of colonial money.
Sullivan capitalized on a number of prevailing conditions in the colonies: the collective thirst for liquidity to fuel a growing economy, the often unruly nature of the financial system, and scanty law enforcement.
Underlying these factors was a deep, abiding ambivalence about paper money. Many early Americans, like Benjamin Franklin, recognized the pressing need for paper money as a medium of exchange and a store of value in a world where specie like that made of gold and silver was in short supply.
At the same time, paper money made the economy more mercurial. Unlike precious metals that could be bought and sold as commodities, paper money had no intrinsic value; it could become worthless overnight. Paper money had other dangers, including a greater vulnerability to inflation. Cognizant of all this, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 voted against giving the federal government explicit authority to print paper notes, coming down squarely ''on the side of a hard currency under national control.''
But the demand for a ready medium of exchange and a recognized measure of value in the burgeoning American economy continued to outstrip the meager supply of precious metals in circulation.
By the early 1800s, paper money in the form of individual bank notes had returned in force. And with it came enterprising counterfeiters like David Lewis (1788-1820), who worked the rural counties of southwestern Pennsylvania forging notes and stirring up populist rage against financial elites.
Lewis became something of a popular hero, known for audacious jailbreaks and sporadic generosity toward strangers. Mr. Tarnoff argues that in the financial panic of 1819, crime acquired a certain status. ''Not only was it a way for the dispossessed to make a living, but compared with the perfectly legal frauds perpetuated by the nation's banks, lawbreaking seemed honest.'' Lewis was apprehended for the last time after being shot in the arm and leg. He died from these injuries in a jail in central Pennsylvania.
Finally, Mr. Tarnoff recounts the story of Samuel Upham (1819-1885), a Philadelphia shopkeeper who, in 1862, began printing $5 Confederate notes, which he sold as ''mementos of the Rebellion'' for a cent each. Along the bottom of each note, he included a strip with the following lettering: ''Fac-Simile Confederate Note -- Sold Wholesale and Retail by S. C. Upham, 403 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.''
Backed by heavy newspaper advertising, Upham's souvenir notes became best sellers, and at some point he must have known that they were no longer being viewed as facsimiles, Mr. Tarnoff says. Borne by Union soldiers, they found their way into the Confederate money supply as counterfeits, and helped fuel rampant inflation and monetary disruption.
As the war progressed, Confederate authorities became convinced that Upham and others were part of a Union campaign to wage economic war on the South. There is no historical evidence that Abraham Lincoln or his administration was involved in such tactics.
But Upham and other moneymakers did play a de facto role in the Union war effort. As Lincoln and his Treasury head, Salmon Chase, understood all too well, the military prospects of either side owed much to the reliability of their respective money supplies. Without a stable, trustworthy form of liquidity, neither combatant could continue to wage war while sustaining its citizens.
Responding to this imperative, Congress in 1862 passed a law that, for the first time since the Revolutionary War, made money printed by the federal government legal tender. A year later, legislation set up federally chartered banks that printed a uniform national currency -- making counterfeiting more difficult, though not impossible.
Mr. Tarnoff is an engaging writer who has a fine eye for detail and the relevance of larger, historical forces. But the book ignores a larger question, raised by its description of early American capitalism as an ''evolving confidence game'' that oscillated ''between manic exuberance and total collapse'': Is there something in the speculative nature of the American character and the nation's economic beginnings that continues to produce people like Bernard Madoff, as well as excessive volatility in the system itself?
Though this and similar questions are unanswered, they do not tarnish the power of the stories that Mr. Tarnoff so delightfully uses to teach us history.

HEADLINE: Ripples? Yes. Waves? Maybe.

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IN 1972, Edward N. Lorenz gave a talk that turned out to be a landmark in the development of chaos theory. Its title was ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?''
Dr. Lorenz said that even a tiny action -- the flapping of a gossamer wing -- could set off a train of events leading to a violent storm in another hemisphere. This is ''deterministic chaos,'' the recognition that the world is so complex that certain outcomes cannot be accurately predicted.
Dr. Lorenz was a meteorologist, but his insights are applicable in many fields -- notably including finance, where obscure local events have periodically been transformed into major storms in distant markets. Last week on Wall Street, there was, at least, the question of whether such a phenomenon was already under way: Is it possible that protests on the streets of Egypt will derail the bull market in the United States?
It isn't very likely that they will. But the risks are being widely assessed. 
Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, the asset management firm, says disturbances in Egypt could conceivably prompt a market correction in New York. ''Since Aug. 26, the stock market has gone up in what was almost a straight line,'' Mr. Doll said. ''As you know, the market never moves in a straight line for very long.''
Concern about Egypt has already caused some hiccups, he said. While he is bullish about the market's long-term prospects, he said, ''sooner or later, we are going to have a real correction. Could this be it? I don't know. It could be.''
He says Egypt is not the most likely source of problems for global markets. Although its geopolitical importance is indisputable -- it has about 80 million people, and the Suez Canal is an indispensable link in trade routes between Europe and Asia -- its weight in the world economy is negligible.
Audrey Kaplan, co-head of international equity at Federated Investors and manager of the Federated InterContinental fund, says her fund owns no Egyptian shares. ''We've considered it too risky to hold,'' she said. ''We've viewed it that way for quite a while.''
And Kevin Gardiner, the head of global investment strategy for Barclays Wealth, said that while ''the human implications of what is going on in Egypt are very important,'' so far, at least, the financial implications are not.
In a survey of the world economy, Mr. Gardiner said the overall outlook was positive, but he started his discussion with a description of the disturbing ripples emanating from Egypt. ''Last month, I'm sure I wouldn't even have mentioned Egypt,'' he said.
Are investors merely reacting prudently to the latest news headlines? Quite possibly. But it isn't hard to envision Egypt's unrest morphing into a global nightmare.
The most unsettling scenarios include a major war and terrorism spreading from the Middle East and South Asia, accompanied by an oil shock and a depression. Even if such developments are extremely unlikely, investors may worry about them if demonstrations intensify and governments topple.
Because financial markets are barometers of investors' moods, worries can be pernicious. On Jan. 28, for example, riot police in Cairo fired tear gas and rubber bullets on crowds challenging President Hosni Mubarak. Global stock markets fell sharply -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.8 percent -- while the dollar, Treasuries and gold rose. The markets have been intermittently jumpy since then.
Short of violence, rising oil prices may be the most obvious way to transmit contagion from Egypt, even though it isn't an important oil producer. But about 4.5 percent of global oil supplies flow through the Suez Canal and the Sumed pipeline connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, and 14 percent of global liquefied natural gas moves through the canal. No serious disruptions have occurred, but the markets have reacted anyway, perhaps factoring in the possible risk of blockages or, far worse, of turmoil spreading to a crucial producer like Saudi Arabia.
In the United States, there could be serious repercussions. If oil prices rise, every 25-cent-a-gallon increase in the price of gasoline -- which is equivalent to a $10.70-a-barrel increase in crude oil -- would result in a decline of 0.25 percent in annual gross domestic product and in the loss of 270,00 jobs, according to a study by IHS Global Insight. Nariman Behravesh, the research firm's chief economist, says that he does not expect current unrest to cause a sustained spike. ''That would be a low-probability event,'' he said.
He says he expects that the United States economy will grow 3.2 percent this year -- and that demand in the United States and abroad is likely to cause oil prices to rise gradually. ''That wouldn't be unhealthy,'' he said.
Food price inflation could be a carrier of contagion. In developing countries like Egypt, where food accounts for a major slice of average income, such inflation is becoming a major problem. Hoarding, exacerbated by civic unrest in Egypt and elsewhere, could lead to greater price spikes, Mr. Behravesh said.
While that isn't likely to be much of a problem for consumers in the United States, indirect effects are possible. Investors could become skittish about emerging markets, and highly leveraged bets on local currencies or indexes could go awry, with consequences that are impossible to predict. That may be unlikely, but not far-fetched.
Recall the events of 1997: a currency plunge in Thailand turned out to be the impetus for a broader crisis. It led to a Russian debt default and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund in Connecticut that, for a time, threatened the stability of the global financial system.
BUT there is no evidence of such a threat now. Should investors bother to protect themselves against improbable but potentially serious events emerging from the crisis in Egypt?
Most people should ''just sit tight,'' Mr. Gardiner said, as ''we haven't seen anything that looks like systemic risk for a portfolio.''
Still, he said, it depends on how nervous you are. If your main concern is oil prices, for example, you can buy call options on oil futures. And there are plenty of exchange-traded funds and other vehicles for making bets.
Of course, there are countless other spots on the planet to worry about, many of them still well below the radar of the financial markets. What should an investor do? Exercise too much caution, and you will miss many opportunities. Ignore all danger, and you are likely to suffer.
There is no simple answer, alas. Butterflies can cause tornadoes, but those storms can't be predicted.

HEADLINE: A Special on His Menu

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
LATE in 2009, not long after finishing construction work on Saraghina, his carefully considered pizzeria-restaurant that occupies a street corner in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Massimiliano Nanni bought a '65 Ford Econoline pickup.
''All my life, I dreamed about such a truck,'' he said. ''My wife said, 'O.K., you can buy it.' You know, the wife makes all the decisions.''
Mr. Nanni, 43, is from Rimini, a seaside town in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, where his mother worked as a restaurant manager. His upbringing was modest.
''We didn't need money,'' he said. ''Just a moped. In the summer, the people would come to the beach.'' 
He wanted Saraghina, named for a Fellini character, to have a similarly laid-back vibe. With whitewashed walls built of reclaimed wood and mismatched everything, the restaurant, designed by his wife, Paola Citerrio, has the comfortable aura of a rustic country house.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Nanni sat across from Ms. Citerrio at a long table; a crisp white light flooded through a wall of windows. He told the story of a trip they took with their son, Ercole, now 3 years old, and 7-year-old daughter, Amelia, to Provincetown, Mass., for some whale watching.
The others saw several whales. Mr. Nanni saw one. ''I get seasick,'' he said, explaining that he had retired below deck. ''And I was a fisherman. I used to get seasick in Italy when I fished for clams.''
Mr. Nanni looked ready to shove off to sea, wearing a striped T-shirt, a blue shirt over it, a red shirt over that and a deep blue Patagonia parka. He had tan corduroy pants and shoes, and a white apron hung from his waist.
Instead, he was headed across Brooklyn to pick up his son from preschool.
He slung a bag over his shoulders, said goodbye to his wife and trundled off into the bitter cold. Parked on the street, the Econoline was marginally fenced in by fresh snow. Mr. Nanni tossed his bag behind the driver's seat and hopped in. The truck started right up.
''I didn't drive it for a couple of weeks,'' he said, recalling an earlier demonstration of the old Ford's reliability. ''It's the winter. I turned the key -- it starts right up.''
Inside, the truck has two seats, and that's pretty much it. Everything is metal, with no visible frills other than the upholstery on the seats. The steering wheel, as big as one in a bus, and the gearshift, which pokes out from a slot on the floor, seem to be the only controls.
The truck, which is dark blue beneath a thick layer of filth composed of snow, salt and sand, fit the vision that he and his wife hold for Saraghina -- and for a new Mediterranean bistro, Celestino, that he plans to open in the same neighborhood this year. When people see the vintage truck, Mr. Nanni said, ''They understand the restaurant.''
Mr. Nanni bought the Econoline on eBay, from a seller in Texas, for $5,000. There have been no problems with it, though he admits that the sagging rear suspension needs some attention -- while hauling a refrigerator for Celestino, the rear tires rubbed against the wheel wells.
In many ways, the Econoline of the 1960s was built more to capture a spirit of the times than to provide sturdy utility. (That's what the F-Series pickups were for.) Introducing the Econoline as a 1961 model, Ford was seen as chasing the success that Volkswagen was enjoying with its quirky Type 2 Microbus.
Based on the compact Falcon economy car, the Econoline model range also included a passenger van and a delivery van. The design featured a forward driving position, with the front wheels almost directly under the front seats -- the only seats in the pickup version -- and the in-line 6-cylinder engine positioned between the seats.
General Motors and Chrysler came out with similar vehicles around the same time, naturally, and this wave of compact vans ostensibly planted the seeds of a craze that reached its full shag-carpet bloom in the 1970s.
Chevrolet based its van on the Corvair platform and called it the Corvair 95. Dodge had the A100, which became extremely popular after a racer named Bill Golden converted one into the Little Red Wagon, a Hemi-powered exhibitionist known for its improbable wheelies on the dragstrip.
Mr. Nanni, who is also a co-owner of Piadina, a restaurant in Greenwich Village, said his garrulous nature has been a secret to his success. ''The trick is, I like my job,'' he said. ''I like to meet other people. I like talking a lot.''
His conversations center on restaurants: what it takes to succeed, how much luck is involved and most of all, how lucky he has been.
''All my life I was very lucky,'' he said. ''My mother was very young when I was born. She watched her money. We worked all the time. I grew up in the restaurant.''
Mr. Nanni's mother, who now owns two takeout restaurants in Rimini, taught him how to make the specialty of the region, piadina, a flatbread used for sandwiches; friends called him Kiko Piadina. Although he leaves the cooking at Saraghina to his business partner, Edoardo Mantelli, Mr. Nanni said he would be the chef at Celestino.
''I think we are very lucky,'' Mr. Nanni said, explaining the immediate success of Saraghina; it has been highly praised in reviews. ''We are very happy -- people like what we are doing. We are very lucky -- nothing has gone wrong.''
As he parked the pickup in front of an espresso bar in Greenpoint, his iPhone rang -- or exploded, rather -- in a Beastie Boys song, ''No Sleep Till Brooklyn.'' It was his vegetable supplier, and Mr. Nanni switched to speakerphone. The spare cabin exploded into a clamor of Italian voices that gave the 46-year-old Ford engine a run for its money.
A few minutes later, Mr. Nanni was perched at the end of the espresso bar with a cappuccino. He clarified the point about his good fortune.
''Why lucky?'' he said. ''Because if I say I work hard, well, many people work hard and do not have success.''
The same could be said of his life in Brooklyn, which he tried to explain.
''Even if I'm not in Italy, I try to make it the best I can,'' he said. ''I grew up in the job and I'm still working at it -- and I like it.''
To further illustrate his point, Mr. Nanni told a story about a family of Italian meat purveyors in the city.
''I remember the father, he wasn't able to work because he was too old,'' he said. ''He had five sons. All the brothers worked over there. We're talking about 55- to 65-year-old Italian men. Even if the father wasn't able to work, he would always sit in the line with the customer, talking with the people, because he didn't have anything else to do. He spent all his life in that store. And this is what I want to do. I want to maybe be in a chair one day.''
But now it was 3 p.m., and Ercole was waiting to be picked up. Mr. Nanni got in the truck, drove a few blocks, found parking next to a snow bank and disappeared inside the preschool.

HEADLINE: Blood on the Nile

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If the United States is, as so many presidents have said in so many speeches, the world's pre-eminent champion of democracy, then why does the drama unfolding in Cairo seem so familiar?
A Washington-friendly dictator, propped up for decades by lavish American aid as he oversees a regime noted for brutality, corruption and stagnation, finally faces the wrath of his people. An American administration struggles over what to say, what to do and what to expect if the strongman is toppled.
The agony of Hosni Mubarak's Egypt raises again the question of whether such a pattern can ever be broken. More than mere misjudgment or duplicity is behind it; the embrace of dictators has been so frequent over the last half-century that it obviously results from hard-headed calculation.
Every country has both values and interests. Sometimes they coincide -- for example, promoting human rights can help combat terrorism -- and sometimes they conflict. What makes the United States stand out, perhaps, is how frequently American officials proclaim their values to the world, setting themselves up for charges of hypocrisy when a policy is expedient rather than idealistic. 
Supporting Egypt's military-led regime over four decades, first under Anwar el-Sadat and then Mr. Mubarak, offered strategic benefits to seven American presidents. They got a staunch ally against Soviet expansionism, a critical peace with Israel, a bulwark against Islamic radicalism, and a trade- and tourist-friendly Egypt. What they did not get was a functioning Egyptian democracy. The apocryphal comment about a foreign strongman often attributed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt sums it up nicely: he may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
History is rich with precedents. In 1959, there was Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, darling of American corporations and organized crime, fleeing with an ill-gotten fortune of $300 million as Fidel Castro's troops reached Havana.
In 1979, it was Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, abandoning the throne in the face of a revolt two years after President Jimmy Carter toasted his country as ''an island of stability.''
In 1986, the turn came for Ferdinand Marcos, ousted by the Philippines' People Power movement five years after Vice President George H. W. Bush told him at a luncheon: ''We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process.''
The list could be extended. Since World War II, the White House, under the management of both parties, has smiled on at least a couple of dozen despots. (''Friendly Dictators Trading Cards,'' marketed by a California publisher in the 1990s, featured ''36 of America's most embarrassing allies.'')
''It used to be anti-Communism,'' said David F. Schmitz, a historian at Whitman College and author of two books on the American attachment to dictators. ''Now it's most often moderates who stand against radicalism in the world of Islam.''
Mr. Schmitz deplores the phenomenon, which he believes has too often bought an ersatz stability at a very high price. By backing an autocrat, he said, America often ensures that ''the political center gets destroyed, giving credence to extremists' arguments and discrediting the U.S.''
After all, the man who felled Batista, the virulently anti-American Mr. Castro, is still in power more than 50 years later. Cuban-American relations produced a brush with thermonuclear war in 1962, a permanently crippled Cuban economy and -- well, generations of successful anti-Castro politicians in Miami and beyond.
Iran, too, got mired in a new brand of undemocratic rule after the shah. The United States still faces a hostile regime ruled by ayatollahs and protected by a brutal, profiteering Revolutionary Guard -- tough enough to have weathered its own Egyptian-style uprising in 2009.
The Philippines are a less dispiriting example. With a belated but definitive push from Washington, the dictator there gave way to democracy; however imperfect, that outcome suggests that American-backed strongmen are not inevitably succeeded by America-hating strongmen.
But Mr. Schmitz watches diplomacy from the tranquil distance of the academy. Ask a onetime practitioner, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser at the time of the shah's fall, and you get a very different view. No administration, he noted, starts with an ideal set of international partners.
''To conduct foreign policy,'' he said, ''we have to deal with the governments that exist. And some of those are dictatorships.''
When Mr. Brzezinski and his boss encountered the shah's dictatorship, the only other power centers in Iran were the Communists of the Tudeh Party and the mullahs of the mosques, he said. As the popular revolt against the shah grew, he said, the Carter administration was divided. Some officials thought Ayatollah Khomeini, returning from exile, might provide a reasonable alternative. Mr. Brzezinski disagreed.
''My view was that the shah should crack down and then begin aggressive reforms,'' he recalled. He lost the argument. Three decades later, the United States is trying to prevent the theocracy that followed from getting nuclear weapons. It is at least an arguable position that Mr. Brzezinski's formula of crackdown and reform, if it had worked, would have produced better long-term results for the rights of Iranians, as well as for international security.
Mr. Brzezinski says Egypt's prospects if Mr. Mubarak is toppled are brighter than Iran's in 1979: ''The army is respected and has a lot of support across the country. There is a middle class of sorts. And the Muslim Brotherhood is still under control,'' reducing the risk that a theocratic regime would emerge.
Mr. Brzezinski was Mr. Carter's adviser when Mr. Sadat signed the historic peace treaty with Israel's Menachem Begin, and while he now says Mr. Mubarak's time has passed, he by no means considers American support for him to have been a tragic mistake. ''I would say it was a good deal for the U.S. and for Egypt,'' he said. Mr. Mubarak consolidated peace in the region and was a ''modernizer'' at home, he said. ''Historic change outpaced the modernizer, as often occurs.''
Rashid Khalidi, professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia and a former adviser to Palestinian peace negotiators, rejects this brand of realpolitik. The ostensible benefits the United States has derived from its backing of Mr. Mubarak are illusory, he said: the peace between Egypt and Israel has not yet brought a peace between Israel and the Palestinians; oppression in Egypt has actually fueled terrorism, even if some of its Egyptian practitioners, like Ayman al-Zawahiri, the deputy leader of Al Qaeda, have fled Egypt proper; and as is self-evident today, stability did not last.
Other cooperation has left a stain on America's reputation. The Bush administration sent some terrorist suspects to Egypt, where they later said they were tortured. Today, protesters in Cairo hold up spent tear gas canisters with American labels. Such policies were ''bankrupt morally and stupid politically,'' Mr. Khalidi said.
''I know it's easy to talk about American being true to its values,'' he said. ''But you know, sometimes it makes sense.''
The evolving statements from the Obama administration show officials feeling their way through the tricky intersection of morality and pragmatism, as they separate from an ally of 30 years. Every statement from the White House and State Department is parsed for nuance in Egypt, in Israel and at home.
When Mr. Obama said on Tuesday that an ''orderly transition'' in Egypt ''must begin now,'' for instance, Mr. Brzezinski winced. ''I wish he'd said 'should begin now.' ''
''It sounds like an order,'' he said. ''Egypt is a proud country, and Egyptians aren't going to listen to orders. They might listen to suggestions.''

HEADLINE: West Backs Gradual Egyptian Transition: Ally's Stability Hinges on a Secretive Military

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Reporting was contributed by Scott Shane, Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker from Washington, and Andrew W. Lehren from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A classified cable sent to Washington from the United States Embassy in Cairo in 2008 reported that a disgruntled midlevel Egyptian officer corps referred to the country's powerful defense minister, Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, as ''Mubarak's poodle'' -- incompetent and archaic but intensely loyal to his now-besieged president.
Another of the secret embassy cables obtained by WikiLeaks leveled even harsher criticism at Field Marshal Tantawi, telling Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the head of United States Central Command, that under the field marshal's leadership, ''The tactical and operational readiness of the Egyptian Armed Forces has decayed.'' Nonetheless, the December 2008 cable concluded, he ''retains Mubarak's support, and could easily remain in place for years to come.''
As a 12-day-old revolution rocks the foundations of Egypt, the Obama administration is now embracing a transition process backed by Field Marshal Tantawi and other top military leaders that would ease their longtime benefactor, President Hosni Mubarak, from power. But whoever becomes the new president after elections in September, American officials say that the rich and secretive Egyptian military holds the key to the governing of Egypt, the country's future and by extension to the stability of the Arab world. 
Administration officials nonetheless concede there is much they do not know about an institution that is hardly a monolith and that operates as a parallel economy, a kind of ''Military Inc.,'' involved in the production of electronics, household appliances, clothing and food.
Although the Pentagon has long promoted its close ties to the Egyptian military, which receives $1.3 billion annually in United States aid, top officials concede that neither Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates nor Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have especially deep relationships with their Egyptian counterparts.
In an effort to ensure that the military kept enough peace on the streets so that talks with opposition leaders could begin, Mr. Gates made four calls to Field Marshal Tantawi in the past week; Admiral Mullen made two to the chief of staff of the Egyptian Army, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan. ''But this is not a situation where you have, 'Hey, Hamid, it's Bob,' '' said one official familiar with the situation. American officials are also unsure about the thinking of the midlevel military leadership, which is considered sympathetic to the protesters, and whether it could split with the generals tied to Mr. Mubarak. Specialists think that for now, the chances of a split are slim.
But a September 2008 cable from the United States Embassy in Cairo to officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon recounts a midlevel officer corps disaffected by what it considered an encrusted military leadership. The cable reports on conversations with Egyptian academics and civilian analysts who describe midlevel officers as ''harshly critical of a defense minister they perceive as incompetent and valuing loyalty above skill in his subordinates.''
Although the Egyptian military has been widely described in news media reports this past week as commanding the respect of the population, the cable says that among the elite its influence has ebbed.
''Recently, academics and civilian analysts painted a portrait of an Egyptian military in intellectual and social decline, whose officers have largely fallen out of society's elite ranks,'' the cable reports.
The cable quotes a retired general who says that military salaries have fallen far below those in the private sector and that ''a military career is no longer an attractive option for ambitious young people who aspire to join the new business elite instead.''
The cable says that the military nonetheless remains powerful through its wide commercial network, and that military-owned companies, often run by retired generals, are active in the water, olive oil, cement, construction, hotel and gasoline industries. The military also produces televisions -- and milk and bread. In a move that made the military ever more popular, during food shortages in 2008, Mr. Mubarak called on the army to use its bakeries to bake bread for the civilian population.
Robert Springborg, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., and an expert on the Egyptian military, said that the army had continued to cultivate its image as protector of the nation since the protests began in Egypt, as it held back from cracking down on hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir Square in Cairo who called for Mr. Mubarak's ouster. But Mr. Springborg said that he believed that the military's leadership was orchestrating events, and had been involved in allowing attacks against the protesters by pro-Mubarak forces on horseback and camels -- but not by the army, so as not to taint it in the public eye.
''Behind the scenes, the military is making possible the various forms of assault on the protesters,'' Mr. Springborg said. ''It's trying to secure a transition for itself. There's lots of evidence that the military is complicit, but for the most part Egyptians don't even want to admit that to themselves.''
Western reporters on the ground in Tahrir Square say that it is hard to be so certain about the military leadership's actions and motives, but that over all, the army rank-and-file has shown sympathy with the protesters and the leadership has been either unwilling or unable to order its troops to fire on the demonstrators.
As of this weekend, it appeared clear that Field Marshal Tantawi and the small circle of military men had weighed their personal loyalty to Mr. Mubarak against the threat to the military from the crisis -- and chosen their own survival. The Egyptian government announced that the most important member of the circle, Omar Suleiman, the new vice president and a former military officer, would lead the military-backed transition to the elections in September. Political analysts on Friday said that he already appeared to be governing in Mr. Mubarak's place.
Ragui Assaad, an Egyptian and a professor at the University of Minnesota, had predicted Friday that the military would make a cold-blooded decision about Mr. Mubarak. ''They are a rational, calculating institution,'' he said. ''The moment they see it is not in their interest to retain him, they will usher him out.''
But Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired head of Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East, said that the senior military leadership would treat Mr. Mubarak, who once led the air force, with more respect.
''I think they want him to go with dignity,'' he said. ''There's a realization this isn't going to work. As that becomes more evident, they're going to insist that it be done in a dignified way.''

HEADLINE: The Easy Cuts Are Behind Us

BYLINE: By JACOB LEW. 
Jacob Lew is the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

 BODY:
Washington
IN a little over a week, President Obama will send Congress his budget for the 2012 fiscal year. The budget is not just a collection of numbers, but an expression of our values and aspirations. As the president said in his State of the Union address, now that the country is back from the brink of a potential economic collapse, our goal is to win the future by out-educating, out-building and out-innovating our rivals so that we can return to robust economic and job growth. But to make room for the investments we need to foster growth, we have to cut what we cannot afford. We have to reduce the burden placed on our economy by years of deficits and debt.
When I left the Office of Management and Budget in January 2001, the country had a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next decade. When I returned last November, decisions to make two large tax cuts without offsetting them and to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit without paying for it, combined with the effects of the recession, meant that the nation faced projected deficits of $10.4 trillion over the next decade. 
We cannot win the future, expand the economy and spur job creation if we are saddled with increasingly growing deficits. That is why the president's budget is a comprehensive and responsible plan that will put us on a path toward fiscal sustainability in the next few years -- a down payment toward tackling our challenges in the long term.
This starts with doing what families and businesses have been doing during this downturn: tightening our belts. In the budget, the president will call for a five-year freeze on discretionary spending other than for national security. This will reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade and bring this category of spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president.
Make no mistake: this will not be easy. It will require tough choices since every decision to invest in one program will necessitate a cut somewhere else. In each of the past two years, the administration has put forward about $20 billion in savings from ending some programs and reducing funds for others. This entailed finding programs that were duplicative, outdated and ineffective. But to achieve the deeper cuts needed to support this spending freeze, we have had to look beyond the obvious and cut spending for purposes we support. We had to choose programs that, absent the fiscal situation, we would not cut.
Since they were instituted, community service block grants have helped to support community action organizations in cities and towns across the country. These are grassroots groups working in poor communities, dedicated to empowering those living there and helping them with some of life's basic necessities. These are the kinds of programs that President Obama worked with when he was a community organizer, so this cut is not easy for him.
Yet for the past 30 years, these grants have been allocated using a formula that does not consider how good a job the recipients are doing. The president is proposing to cut financing for this grant program in half, saving $350 million, and to reform the remaining half into a competitive grant program, so that funds are spent to give communities the most effective help.
Another difficult cut is a reduction of $125 million, or about a quarter of current financing, to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which supports environmental cleanup and protection. And a third is a reduction in the Community Development Block Grant program. These flexible grants help cities and counties across the nation finance projects in areas like housing, sewers and streets, and economic development in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
While we know from mayors and county leaders how important these grants are for their communities, and are very aware of the financial difficulties many of them face, the sacrifices needed to begin putting our fiscal house in order must be broadly shared, and we are proposing to cut this program by 7.5 percent, or $300 million.
These three examples alone, of course, represent only a small fraction of the scores of cuts the president had to choose, but they reflect the tough calls he had to make. And as he made them, his administration tried to make sure that there was no undue burden on any one program or area. We also asked agencies outside the freeze to do their part as well. The Department of Defense, for instance, will have its financing plan cut by $78 billion over the next five years, bringing spending down to zero real growth after a decade of healthy increases, and we are eliminating programs like the C-17 transport plane that have broad support but that we do not need and cannot afford.
Discretionary spending not related to security represents just a little more than one-tenth of the entire federal budget, so cutting solely in this area will never be enough to address our long-term fiscal challenges. That is why President Obama made clear in the State of the Union that he wants to work with Congress to reform and simplify our tax code. He also called for serious bipartisan cooperation to strengthen and protect Social Security as we face the retirement of the baby boom generation.
We must take care to avoid indiscriminate cuts in areas critical to long-term growth like education, innovation and infrastructure -- cuts that would stifle the economy just as it begins to recover. That, in turn, would deprive us of one of the most powerful drivers of deficit reduction, a growing economy.
Next week, a debate will begin in Washington and throughout our country about the best way forward. The Obama administration will come to these discussions with a responsible, sensible and achievable plan to put the country on a fiscally sustainable path. The plan will incorporate many tough choices and deep cuts -- as well as smart investments -- to broaden our recovery, spur job creation and prepare the United States to win in the world economy.

HEADLINE: Bankers and Their Bonuses

 BODY:
Bankers are done with contrition. Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, paid himself a $12.6 million stock bonus for 2010, 40 percent more than in 2009, despite plummeting profits. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America got $9 million in restricted stock despite the bank's $2.2 billion loss. 
An analysis by The Wall Street Journal found that pay and benefits at the top 25 publicly traded banks and security firms on Wall Street hit a record of $135.5 billion.
This return of outsize self-remuneration suggests more needs to be done to tame bankers' appetite for high-risk financial strategies that shower them with profit in good times and leave the taxpayers holding the bag when their bets go bad.
That's why bankers almost never have as bad a year as the rest of us. In 2009, during the worst of the financial crisis, average pay in finance in New York City fell 18 percent, about twice as much as pay in other industries. But that average pay was still about 2.5 times as much as workers made in other businesses and is bouncing back much faster.
Not all of the news on financiers' pay is bad. Banks are using more deferred compensation, to encourage top bankers to think of the long term. Barclays Bank took this one step further, rolling out a plan to pay 2010 bonuses for its senior bankers with contingent convertible bonds, or ''cocos''-- which could give bankers even more of an incentive to make prudent decisions.
Cocos are long-term bonds that convert into equity if the bank hits a crisis. The idea is that paying bankers in bonds encourages them to keep the business solvent. This is even more so if a crisis triggers their conversion into shares that would become worthless in bankruptcy.
Financial regulators particularly like cocos because conversion would automatically reduce the debt ratios of troubled banks. Many banks are paying close attention to the Barclays experiment, wondering whether these instruments might provide a model for the industry or whether it will lead Barclays' top bankers to bail.
The new restrictions imposed on financial firms by the Dodd-Frank Act are also supposed to limit risk and head off another implosion. Some risky derivatives have been pushed onto regulated exchanges. New capital rules will force banks to keep a bigger cushion of money in case bets go bad. But we would be foolish to believe that any of these steps will be enough.
Bankers and their banks need to be made more risk averse. That means banks must be made smaller and less profitable. Bankers' eagerness to recapture the lavish paydays suggests how far we still need to go.

THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING
Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do
By Eduardo Porter
296 pp. Portfolio/Penguin. $27.95.
In 1992, Lawrence Summers, then the chief economist of the World Bank, caused a minor uproar when it was reported that he had signed a memo arguing that poor countries should lease out land to house waste produced by rich countries. To many, Eduardo Porter writes in ''The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do,'' the memo demonstrated that the World Bank ''believed poor countries were dumps.'' While Summers backpedaled, calling the argument an exercise in ''sardonic counterpoint,'' it nevertheless cost him a lot of political capital in Washington. 
In this judicious book, Porter, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times, says that while the Summers memo was impolitic, it wasn't ''totally insane,'' as one critic termed it. ''By evaluating opportunity costs, we organize our lives,'' Porter writes. A poor country could have used revenue from a landfill to satisfy an important public need, like school construction, and the investment may very well have turned out to be worth the risk. The Summers kerfuffle is one example among the scores that Porter weaves together to prove his worthy point: ''Prices -- how they are set, how people react to them -- can tell us who people really are.''
Back in the 18th century, Adam Smith propounded a very different idea: products had an unshakable value equal to the cost of the labor put into them. Much of Porter's book can be seen as a vehicle for the author to explain to Smith just how wrong he was. Porter marshals an impressive array of research to show all the ways consumers can be shortsighted, self-indulgent, oblivious and inconsistent -- not to mention hugely vulnerable to profit-eyed marketers. The information age has further scrambled the relationship between labor and value. How would Smith explain the existence of an iPhone app called ''I Am Rich,'' which did nothing but flash a red gem on the screen and retailed for $999? Or the computer users who routinely buy new cartridges rather than refills for their printers, effectively laying out $4,731 per gallon of ink?
It's hardly news that people spend money on stupid things. Thankfully, Porter is interested in more than factoids. Most of his attention is devoted to teasing out the rationale underlying the ''cold accounting'' that determines the value of things people think are priceless, like human life and national security. What he relates has unmistakable urgency. How much should we spend today to address environmental problems that may be more cheaply tackled by future generations, especially given the number of development projects that clamor for financing now? Should we even attempt to protect against risks that would be more costly to prevent than the damage they would cause?
Most of Porter's evidence is culled from sources like the National Bureau of Economic Research and The Journal of Economic Perspectives -- outlets that routinely publish fascinating research cloaked in jargon. His main feat lies in scouring, translating and synthesizing the latest findings of social science into something that the curious layperson would actually enjoy reading. If anything, he is a dollop too diligent: every so often an observation comes off as banal, while other insights contain a waft of the dubious. (Even if the Second Vatican Council did cost the church some believers because it attenuated the rigors of faith, the decline of Roman Catholicism seems much more complicated.)
At a time of seemingly proliferating risks, though, Porter's searching book is a welcome reminder of the necessity of prudent decision making. ''The truth is,'' he writes, ''we can't afford it all.''

HEADLINE: 'Tough' Budget Calls Outlined

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The budget that President Obama will release next week reflects scores of ''tough calls'' that cut deeply into programs that the president supports, in keeping with his proposed five-year freeze on a broad category of domestic spending, according to the administration's budget director.
In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Sunday, the director, Jacob J. Lew, gives three examples of those calls: proposed cuts for programs that support community organizers, a job the president once held; that clean the Great Lakes; and that finance community development. Together, they would save $775 million. 
That sum would not be a major reduction in an annual deficit that is projected to exceed $1 trillion in the fiscal year 2012, which starts on Oct. 1. Mr. Lew did not disclose the total savings for the cuts Mr. Obama intended to propose in the budget, which he is scheduled to send to Congress on Feb. 14.
Mr. Obama's opening bid will not satisfy Congressional Republicans, who are having trouble fulfilling their own campaign promise to slash spending. Yet even the reductions that Mr. Lew revealed are likely to provoke opposition from heavily Democratic constituencies like antipoverty groups and environmentalists, which underscores the difficulty that both parties face as they seek to balance the public's desire for both smaller deficits and a continued range of government services.
Mr. Obama is under pressure to shrink programs not only to reduce the deficit but also to offset the still-unspecified increases in government spending that he has proposed as investments in innovation, education, infrastructure, technology and research, and which are intended to foster long-term economic growth.
''Make no mistake: this will not be easy,'' Mr. Lew said of Mr. Obama's proposed five-year freeze, which he said would save an estimated $400 billion over a decade. ''It will require tough choices since every decision to invest in one program will necessitate a cut somewhere else.''
''We have had to look beyond the obvious,'' Mr. Lew added, ''and cut spending for purposes we support. We had to choose programs that, absent the fiscal situation, we would not cut.''
He said Mr. Obama would offer a 50 percent cut in community service block grants that go to grassroots groups in poor areas, a savings of $350 million, and to require those groups to compete for the remaining money.
''These are the kinds of programs that President Obama worked with when he was a community organizer, so this cut is not easy for him,'' Mr. Lew wrote.
Mr. Obama's budget would save $300 million by cutting 7.5 percent from the Community Development Block Grant program, which helps local governments pay for housing and sewer and road systems. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an environmental protection program, would lose about a quarter of its funding, a savings of $125 million.
Both Mr. Obama's proposed freeze and the effort by House Republicans to reduce spending would cut from domestic discretionary spending, which is roughly one-tenth of the budget and which covers most federal agencies and programs like air-traffic control, education, law enforcement and transportation. It is separate from the much bigger and faster-growing share of the budget for entitlement programs, the largest of which are Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
In his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama, acknowledged the limits of using domestic discretionary spending to reduce the deficit. ''We have to stop pretending,'' he said, ''that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.''
''That is why,'' Mr. Lew wrote, that Mr. Obama also said in that speech that he wants to work with Congress to simplify the tax code and ''to strengthen and protect Social Security.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Droughts, Floods And Food

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
We're in the midst of a global food crisis -- the second in three years. World food prices hit a record in January, driven by huge increases in the prices of wheat, corn, sugar and oils. These soaring prices have had only a modest effect on U.S. inflation, which is still low by historical standards, but they're having a brutal impact on the world's poor, who spend much if not most of their income on basic foodstuffs.
The consequences of this food crisis go far beyond economics. After all, the big question about uprisings against corrupt and oppressive regimes in the Middle East isn't so much why they're happening as why they're happening now. And there's little question that sky-high food prices have been an important trigger for popular rage. 
So what's behind the price spike? American right-wingers (and the Chinese) blame easy-money policies at the Federal Reserve, with at least one commentator declaring that there is ''blood on Bernanke's hands.'' Meanwhile, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France blames speculators, accusing them of ''extortion and pillaging.''
But the evidence tells a different, much more ominous story. While several factors have contributed to soaring food prices, what really stands out is the extent to which severe weather events have disrupted agricultural production. And these severe weather events are exactly the kind of thing we'd expect to see as rising concentrations of greenhouse gases change our climate -- which means that the current food price surge may be just the beginning.
Now, to some extent soaring food prices are part of a general commodity boom: the prices of many raw materials, running the gamut from aluminum to zinc, have been rising rapidly since early 2009, mainly thanks to rapid industrial growth in emerging markets.
But the link between industrial growth and demand is a lot clearer for, say, copper than it is for food. Except in very poor countries, rising incomes don't have much effect on how much people eat.
It's true that growth in emerging nations like China leads to rising meat consumption, and hence rising demand for animal feed. It's also true that agricultural raw materials, especially cotton, compete for land and other resources with food crops -- as does the subsidized production of ethanol, which consumes a lot of corn. So both economic growth and bad energy policy have played some role in the food price surge.
Still, food prices lagged behind the prices of other commodities until last summer. Then the weather struck.
Consider the case of wheat, whose price has almost doubled since the summer. The immediate cause of the wheat price spike is obvious: world production is down sharply. The bulk of that production decline, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, reflects a sharp plunge in the former Soviet Union. And we know what that's about: a record heat wave and drought, which pushed Moscow temperatures above 100 degrees for the first time ever.
The Russian heat wave was only one of many recent extreme weather events, from dry weather in Brazil to biblical-proportion flooding in Australia, that have damaged world food production.
The question then becomes, what's behind all this extreme weather?
To some extent we're seeing the results of a natural phenomenon, La Nina -- a periodic event in which water in the equatorial Pacific becomes cooler than normal. And La Nina events have historically been associated with global food crises, including the crisis of 2007-8.
But that's not the whole story. Don't let the snow fool you: globally, 2010 was tied with 2005 for warmest year on record, even though we were at a solar minimum and La Nina was a cooling factor in the second half of the year. Temperature records were set not just in Russia but in no fewer than 19 countries, covering a fifth of the world's land area. And both droughts and floods are natural consequences of a warming world: droughts because it's hotter, floods because warm oceans release more water vapor.
As always, you can't attribute any one weather event to greenhouse gases. But the pattern we're seeing, with extreme highs and extreme weather in general becoming much more common, is just what you'd expect from climate change.
The usual suspects will, of course, go wild over suggestions that global warming has something to do with the food crisis; those who insist that Ben Bernanke has blood on his hands tend to be more or less the same people who insist that the scientific consensus on climate reflects a vast leftist conspiracy.
But the evidence does, in fact, suggest that what we're getting now is a first taste of the disruption, economic and political, that we'll face in a warming world. And given our failure to act on greenhouse gases, there will be much more, and much worse, to come.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. to Propose Expanding Broadband Service to Rural Areas

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday will propose the first steps toward converting the $8 billion fund that subsidizes rural telephone service into one for helping pay to provide broadband Internet service to underserved areas, according to commission officials.
The F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, is expected to outline the proposal in a speech on Monday, the officials said. 
Most of the money under discussion involves a longstanding subsidy known as the Universal Service Fund, which is paid for through fees tacked onto most consumers' phone bills and distributed among telephone companies to subsidize the high costs of providing service to rural areas.
Mr. Genachowski will propose phasing out the payments between phone companies, which he says create ''inefficiencies and perverse incentives'' that result in waste in the fund. The F.C.C. will also propose consolidating existing methods of paying for rural phone service into a new pool to be called the Connect America Fund, to be used for helping pay for making broadband available to underserved areas.
The current Universal Service Fund and its spending methods are ''unsustainable,'' according to a draft of Mr. Genachowski's remarks prepared for Monday. ''It was designed for a world with separate local and long-distance telephone companies, a world of traditional landline telephones before cellphones or Skype, a world without the Internet -- a world that no longer exists.''
''At the end of this transition, we would no longer subsidize telephone networks; instead we would support broadband,'' which then could be used for phone service, Mr. Genachowski plans to say. He will make the remarks in a speech to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington.
In some cases, the Universal Service Fund pays more than $20,000 a year just to connect a single rural household to telephone service. But in some local markets that still receive such subsidies, four or more companies are competing to provide service -- indicating that it would be economically feasible to serve those areas without tapping the fund. Mr. Genachowski says that more than $100 million a year from the fund now goes to such areas.
Still, in an interview last Thursday, Mr. Genachowski said he rejected the idea, supported by some members of Congress, that the fund should simply be eliminated. Doing so, he said, would let the broadband revolution bypass a substantial portion of the 24 million Americans who the commission says lack access to high-speed Internet connections.
The F.C.C.'s proposed changes would deal with one portion of the Universal Service Fund known as the high-cost program, which typically accounts for about 55 percent of the fund's annual disbursements, which totaled an estimated $8 billion last year.
Some other portions of the program already have been partially updated, including the E-Rate program, which helps provide faster Internet connections to schools and libraries, and the rural health program, which provides high-speed Internet connections to rural clinics so they can establish remote consultations with medical specialists.
Next month, the commission is expected to recommend changes to the Lifeline and Link-Up programs, which provide assistance to low-income households to help them pay for installation and monthly charges for telephone service.
But the F.C.C. is several months away from addressing what could be one of the toughest aspects of the fund to revamp -- its financing. The program currently is paid for by telecommunications companies, which are required to contribute a percentage of their long-distance revenues to the fund. Telephone companies have long passed on to customers the cost of those mandatory contributions.
The contribution rates have risen sharply in recent years, as long-distance prices and therefore revenues -- which are the benchmark measure for determining contribution rates -- have fallen.
The contribution factor, as the rate is known, has increased to 15.5 percent, up from 7.3 percent at the beginning of 2003. Trying to thwart misuse of the funds, Congress has introduced bills in the last two sessions to overhaul the program -- some of which would expand universal service and others that would limit its growth. Those efforts are expected to be revived in the current session.
So far, the F.C.C. has outlined efforts to expand broadband availability only though wired connections. But commission officials say that they will almost certainly look at whether it makes sense to try to use the growth of wireless Internet service as a spur to expand high-speed Internet access for underserved areas.

HEADLINE: WITHIN OUR MEANS: Their Real Agenda

 BODY:
As states groan and stumble through the recession, some politicians are trying to exploit their financial crises for ideological purposes. Many Republicans want to use hard times to fundamentally reduce the role of states and public employee unions, in the same way federal tax cuts forced a debate on how to cut the deficit. 
Some want to cut back severely on federal aid to the states, no matter how much new joblessness that may cause, while others want to ensure that Washington will never bail out a state close to defaulting on its bonds.
The latest pernicious idea, pushed by Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush and several members of Congress, would allow the states to declare bankruptcy, for the principal purpose of tearing up union contracts and negating pension obligations.
It is true that many public employee unions have done well during a time of hardship for most Americans. The problem, though, isn't the existence of those unions; it is the generous contracts willingly given to them by lawmakers because of their lobbying power and bloc-voting ability. In New York, unionized state employees have had a 14 percent raise over four years, and now make an average of nearly $67,000. Iowa's state workers last year won a 6 percent raise over two years.
Dozens of states give pension and health benefits far more generous than in the private sector. Their costs have resulted in significant cutbacks to basic state services for the poor and middle class.
But bankruptcy would fight fire with gasoline, spreading instability to the bond markets, scaring off investors who might think they would never get repaid, and making it much harder and more expensive for states to raise desperately needed capital. Some bond experts say even talk of allowing states to declare bankruptcy has rattled markets.
Magic-bullet ideas like this one are no substitute for the hard work of governing responsibly. Union contracts and benefits need to be changed at the bargaining table, and budget-cutting governors have all kinds of leverage. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York got the attention of state unions last week by threatening to lay off 9,800 workers if the unions don't give up at least $450 million in payroll cuts and other givebacks. Other governors are talking about changing collective bargaining laws.
Governors also have a huge megaphone at their disposal, and should not hesitate to remind both the public and union members that financial emergencies require sacrifice. Government employees accept a special civic responsibility when they go to work for the taxpayers that is not always shared by their private counterparts -- they are working to serve their state's needs, not just themselves. (That point would be easier to sell if the sacrifice were universal. Giving tax cuts to billionaires and asking middle-class employees for givebacks makes little financial or moral sense.)
Though the bankruptcy proposal has not caught fire in Washington, it demonstrates that some conservatives are serious about experimenting with volatile new ideas. To contain the damage, lawmakers and unions need to get equally serious about dealing with costs that are beginning to infuriate the people who pay the bills.
This is part of a series of editorials about the fiscal crisis in New York State and in other states around the country.

HEADLINE: How Democracy Became Halal

BYLINE: By REUEL MARC GERECHT. 
Reuel Marc Gerecht, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former Middle Eastern specialist in the C.I.A.'s clandestine service, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Wave: Man, God and the Ballot Box in the Middle East.''

 BODY:
Tel Aviv
IN the Western study of medieval Islamic history, the institution of iqta -- land grants from the sovereign to his soldiers -- once loomed large, because scholars searched for reasons behind the Muslim failure to develop feudalism, and with it the contractual relationships that eventually led to constitutional government. But looking for parallels between the West and Islam -- especially the classical Islamic heartland from North Africa to Iran -- has always been politically a sad endeavor, since the region seemed so resistant to the ideas and institutions that made representative government possible.
President George W. Bush's decision to build democracy in Iraq seemed so lame to many people because it appeared, at best, to be another example of American idealism run amok -- the forceful implantation of a complex Western idea into infertile authoritarian soil. But Mr. Bush, whose faith in self-government mirrors that of a frontiersman in Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America,'' saw truths that more worldly men missed: the idea of democracy had become a potent force among Muslims, and authoritarianism had become the midwife to Islamic extremism. 
One of the great under-reported stories of the end of the 20th century was the enormous penetration of the West's better political ideas -- democracy and individual liberty -- into the Muslim consciousness. For those of us who speak and read Persian, the startling evolution was easier to see. Theocracy-versus-democracy has been a defining theme of the Islamic Republic of Iran since the revolution, which harnessed both Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's religious charisma and the secular intelligentsia's democratic aspirations. Over the last three decades, clerical Iran has nurtured an intense intellectual discourse about the duties that man owes to God.
When the legitimacy of theocracy started to unravel amid the regime's corruption and brutality in the late 1980s, democratic ideas, including powerful democratic interpretations of the Islamic faith, roared forth. The explosion on the streets after the fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009 was just the most visible eruption of the enormous democratic pressures that had built up underneath the republic's autocracy. More regime-threatening moments are surely coming.
Today's Arab societies -- less intellectually vibrant than Iran, in great part because their regimes have been more effective in shutting down internal debate -- have become increasingly schizophrenic. Long before the tumult in Tunisia and Egypt, Arab liberal secular intellectuals had divided. Except for the fearless, who went to prison, liberals who didn't flee their homelands usually became ''court liberals,'' whose views never seriously challenged the rulers.
Aware of the dismal fates of their kind in Iran under Ayatollah Khomeini, they faithfully echoed the anti-Islamist, apres-moi-le-deluge fears that the region's autocrats used in Washington whenever American officials objected to tyranny. Democracy remained for them a cherished ideal, attainable at some future date when the Islamists had lost their appeal and the despots their power.
The secular intellectuals in exile, however, more forcefully embraced the democratic cause -- their newspapers, books, magazines, Web sites and, increasingly, appearances on Al Jazeera -- delivered their views back home. Intellectuals of such diverse viewpoints as Kanan Makiya, Edward Said, Saad Eddin Ibrahim and Burhan Ghalioun opened up an ever-increasing liberal, democratic space in foreign and Arabic publications. Yes, some mixed their message of liberty with other ''Arab'' priorities: anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism. But their support of democracy was clear, and became more acute after the 9/11 attacks.
Understandably, the Western foreign ministries and press paid a lot more attention to the court liberals. A revulsion against the Iraq war and a distaste for President Bush helped to blind people to the spread of democratic sentiments in the region. It blinded them to the fact that among Middle Easterners, democracy, not dictatorship, was now seen as a better vehicle for economic growth and social justice.
Most important, Mr. Bush's distastefulness helped to blind Westerners to the momentous marriage of Islamism and democratic ideas. Men and women of devout faith, who cherish (if not always rigorously follow) Shariah law increasingly embraced the convulsive idea that only elected political leadership was legitimate. Islam puts extraordinary emphasis upon the idea of justice -- the earthbound quid pro quo that a man can expect in a righteous life.
This sense of justice, which Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani expressed so forcefully in 2004 against an American occupation fearful of letting Iraqis vote, has been irreversibly welded to the ballot box. Democracy for the faithful has become a means for society to affirm its most cherished Islamic values.
The Egyptian revolt against President Hosni Mubarak and his regime has caused many in the West to foresee a calamitous, unstoppable rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, the mother ship of Sunni fundamentalism. The Brotherhood is frightening. Prominent members have sanctified suicide-bombing against Israeli women and children, espoused the vilest anti-Semitism and affirmed the holiness of killing those who would slight the Prophet Muhammad.
But the Brotherhood, like everyone else, is evolving. It would be a serious error to believe that it has not sincerely wrestled with the seductive challenge of democracy, with the fact that the Egyptian faithful like the idea of voting for their leaders.
In 2007, members of the Brotherhood released, withdrew and unofficially re-released a political platform -- the first ever for the organization -- in which an outsider can see the Brothers' philosophical struggle with the idea of parliamentary supremacy and the certainty that faithful Muslims may legislatively transgress Holy Law. The Brothers themselves didn't know how much free rein to give to their compatriots -- they, like everyone else, are moving in uncharted waters.
The Brotherhood is trying to come to terms with the idea of hurriya, ''freedom.'' In the past, for the Muslim devout, hurriya had denoted the freedom of a believer to worship God; for the Arab nationalist, the word was the battle cry against European imperialism. Today, in Egypt and elsewhere, hurriya cannot be understood without reference to free men and women voting. The Brothers are trying to figure out how to integrate two civilizations and thereby revive their own. This evolution isn't pretty. But it is real.
For the Egyptian people, the Brothers are not an enigma -- they have been around since 1928. Unlike the revolutionary mullahs of Iran, who wrote books that almost no one outside the clergy read, the Brotherhood has spread its word to the Egyptian public for decades.
It's also important that Egyptian Muslims are Sunnis. Unlike Iran's Shiites, whose history revolves around charismatic men, Egyptians have no Ayatollah Khomeini. The Brotherhood is an organization of laymen. It has always had a tense relationship with Al Azhar, the great Sunni seminary of Cairo.
Although Hosni Mubarak has done his best to suck the life out of Egyptian society, the shadows of once great parties, like the Wafds of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and nearly forgotten forces like the Liberal Constitutionalist Party will try to resurrect themselves in fairly short order. Ayman Nour and his liberal Ghad Party are already established.
Once President Mubarak is gone, and if his minions don't try to maintain the military dictatorship, a quick transition to democracy is likely to produce a plethora of parties, with a few in position to form a coalition.
The Brotherhood will undoubtedly be one of the big players, but it will have to compete for votes. And, as the Brotherhood's aborted platform clearly reveals, the organization is going to have to do better than chanting, ''Islam has all the answers,'' the easy retort of men who know they don't have to compete for power.
What we are likely to see in Egypt is not a repeat of Iran, where fundamentalists took undisputed power, but a repeat of Iraq, where Sunni religious parties did well initially but started to fade, divide and evolve as the powerful Sunni preference for laymen of no particular religious distinction comes to the foreground. Sunni Islam has no clerical hierarchy of the holy -- it's tailor-made for nasty arguments among men who dispute one another's authority to know the righteous path. If the Brotherhood can be corralled by a democratic system, the global effect may not be insignificant.
We have a chance in Egypt to be lucky. Democratization there, like democratization of Iran, could thwart the ideologies and fear that move poor countries to spend fortunes on nuclear weapons. The United States is not without influence. We can push hard for a quick transition to democratic rule. The Egyptian Army, historically no friend of democracy or civil liberties, is now dependent on American money and advanced weaponry. If it continues to stand behind Mr. Mubarak, if Egyptians start to die in large numbers, Washington shouldn't hesitate to play hardball.
Elections should not be at the end of some long, undefined democratic transition, which Mr. Mubarak or his minions would surely use to abort democracy. Egypt needs elections sooner, not later. More convincingly than any president before him, Barack Obama can say, ''We are not scared of Muslims voting.'' He can put an end to the West's deleterious habit of treating the Middle East's potentates respectfully and the Muslim citizenry like children.

HEADLINE: The Debate Over Tenure for Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''G.O.P. Governors Take Aim at Teacher Tenure'' (front page, Feb. 1):
One can hardly dispute that teacher tenure may, in some cases, harm students. In this tough economy, districts may also be willing to engage in a practice that was common before unions. Cash-strapped municipalities would routinely dismiss excellent teachers for no reason other than that they were becoming expensive as they climbed the salary scale.
I worked in such a district 35 years ago in rural New Hampshire where unions often did not exist. I saw top-notch, enthusiastic teachers dismissed before they reached the next salary step or their tenure year. This may have kept the costs down, but it also kept the quality of the teaching staff questionable. 
Let's face it; experience does matter in a profession that may be a passion as well as an art. Let's hope that reform of the tenure system works for promising educators as well as for students.
Susan R. Donovan Bristol, R.I., Feb. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
A good education system and a balanced budget are not mutually exclusive. If states are forced to make teacher layoffs, they should be based on merit rather than on tenure.
At a time when America is struggling to retain its competitive advantage over countries like China and India, the caliber of America's teachers must be first-rate. Take a lesson from Singapore.
The country consistently scores near the top of most international standardized tests in math and science, while spending less per child on education than almost any other developed nation. It's no surprise that the country invests heavily in teacher training programs and recruits top graduates to be teachers.
Being shackled by union bureaucracy stifles new ideas and a better standard of education. If the United States is to achieve President Obama's ''Sputnik moment,'' the country will need the finest teachers to spark young minds and nurture them in science, math and technology.
Twenty-first-century trade will be defined by who makes things better, and new ideas are essential. This means graduating more scientists and engineers -- whose paths start with inspiring educators, new and old.

To the Editor:
As the movement to eliminate tenure takes hold, it's worth asking advocates for dismissal of incompetent teachers whether they think that teachers are the only underperforming public-sector workers. Do they also favor more dismissals of subpar police officers and firefighters?
Evaluating job performance objectively and assessing accountability for results driven by many factors beyond the individual teacher's control are genuinely difficult. As a public school parent, I favor getting rid of incompetent teachers. But until we are ready to define and consistently apply fair standards for individual accountability for all kinds of public-sector outcomes, teachers will have some reason to feel they are being singled out for political purposes.
Mark Rosenman Montclair, N.J., Feb. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Teacher quality is clearly a pressing concern for our nation. A host of research-based professional development strategies could certainly help with this challenge. Instead, many policy makers seem to believe that it can be addressed by greater managerial flexibility.
You repeat the party line that it is ''expensive and time-consuming to fire teachers considered ineffective.'' I would argue that in most cases, this is an entirely untested hypothesis.
Research finds that most teacher evaluation systems are inadequate and only peripherally related to instruction. In addition, in many states close to 100 percent of teachers receive ratings of satisfactory or better from their principals, meaning that most teachers are never given any indication that they are ineffective. This evidence would suggest that if there are in fact poor teachers in classrooms, it is largely a result of poor evaluation practices as opposed to cumbersome dismissal processes.

To the Editor:
Re ''Bloomberg Presses Cuomo on Teacher Seniority Rule'' (news article, Jan. 31):
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's desire to have Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo change the teacher seniority rule in the event of layoffs cleverly overlooks an important element of his argument. He claims that merit should be the determining factor in any layoff decision, yet he knows that determining merit is difficult and open to negotiation.
More important, he knows that teachers with seniority are higher up in the pay scale, and this opens up the possibility that decisions will be made more on economics than on merit. Mr. Bloomberg is also overlooking a fact that is self-evident to all teachers: experience increases an educator's merit in most cases.

HEADLINE: Five Prized Myths About Mortgages

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
America's mortgage market almost sank the world economy. But rather than rushing to fix it, the government has blown two deadlines for proposals. The ideas are finally due as early as this week from the Treasury, and those recommendations will frame the debate. But the danger is they will be based on dogma that should in fact be seriously questioned.
Proposals have been circulating ever since the previous administration seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008. Most agree that both entities should be wound down, one way or another. But whether government should still have a role subsidizing housing finance is still up for grabs -- or rather, few seem able to resist the idea that it should, even if it is a smaller one. The trouble is that financial types have become accustomed to a government safety net, and few of the constituencies involved are willing to challenge America's core housing myths. 
MYTH 1 Significant reform will kill the housing market. Many fear any major overhaul of housing finance will slam a still tottering housing market.
THE REALITY If America scraps its current system tomorrow, that's what will happen. At a minimum, removing the government subsidy should nudge mortgage interest rates higher, potentially knocking home prices down further. But Britain took more than a decade to phase out tax deductions on mortgage interest. Homeowners, would-be homeowners and mortgage lenders can adapt to even a potentially wrenching change if there's a five- or 10-year transition period. The United States needs to get started on a plan.
MYTH 2 The American mortgage market is too big for the private sector to handle alone.
THE REALITY The $10.6 trillion mortgage market is huge, and Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee roughly half of it. But the size of the market -- and the secondary market in securitized mortgages, and so on -- was part of the problem in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis. The market is already down from its $11 trillion peak, but it is still nearly twice as big as in 2001. With the national average home price down more than 30 percent from its highs and millions of homeowners in danger of foreclosure, it's clear only a smaller mortgage market is really sustainable.
Fully private-sector mortgages would be more expensive, but at the right price banks will lend. Studies conducted before the financial crisis suggested that government backing saved homeowners only 0.15 to 0.4 percentage point on their mortgage interest rates.
MYTH 3 Investors would stop buying mortgage bonds without government guarantees. Bill Gross, bond guru and co-head of Pimco, certainly has said he wouldn't want to buy mortgages. Mr. Gross and others in his industry have grown used to the government guarantee. It reduces volatility and saves them some time-consuming analysis.
THE REALITY There are plenty of deep-pocketed investors looking for good investments and with the capacity to figure out their value. Again, interest rates would have to be a bit higher, and the securitization market would probably be a good bit smaller. But what existed before the crisis was unsustainable.
MYTH 4 The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is part of the American dream.
THE REALITY It's true that the current standard American mortgage -- one with a relatively low rate of interest fixed for 30 years that can be refinanced at almost no cost -- would probably be harder to get. Yet high home ownership rates in other countries prove this structure isn't necessary to enable people to buy homes. A longish transition period would allow mortgage borrowers to get used to less generous home financing. And that's preferable to having them pay much more down the line through their tax bills if investors need bailing out.
MYTH 5 Government subsidies promote homeownership.
THE REALITY This doesn't seem to be the case at all. Homeownership rates in the United States from 1998 to 2008 averaged 67.8 percent, just ninth highest out of 17 developed nations, according to a study from the University of California, Berkeley. Moreover, the study found that American homeowners paid significantly higher mortgage rates, roughly 1.5 percentage points more, than those in Europe. That means that even if homeownership is a worthy policy goal, subsidizing mortgages is not the way to do it.

HEADLINE: A Crisis of Faith in Britain's Central Banker

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- A central banker need not be loved, but at the least he should command respect -- and in Britain these days Mervyn King cannot count on either.
Mr. King, the donnish governor of the Bank of England, has been accused of presiding over the worst stagflation -- a dreaded combination of stagnant economic activity and rising inflation -- happening in any major developed economy. He has been condemned for flouting the bank's independence by publicly supporting the British government's deficit-cutting strategy.
As for the issue on which he may have most closely staked his reputation -- that Britain's large banks must increase capital levels well beyond international standards -- he so far has been ignored.
Doubts over Mr. King's inflation strategy come as European leaders are working to devise a unified strategy for dealing with sovereign debt woes in the region. Germany and France are pressing for concrete steps to harmonize fiscal spending by focusing on tax and pension issues, while weaker nations are struggling to bring down their deficits. 
But with inflationary pressure picking up everywhere, the main topic of debate is expected to be how much longer the European Central Bank, like its counterpart in Britain, can resist the pressure to raise interest rates.
Not long ago, central bankers in the United States, the European Union and fast-growing emerging countries like Turkey and Brazil were being hailed. They were seen as having salvaged their economies by flooding their banking systems with enough money to help prevent a depression.
But now many of them are confronting the prospect that their powers are on the wane, as inflation begins to creep up and as growth in advanced industrial countries is hampered by high levels of government debt.
For a group accustomed to being influential -- the Federal Reserve's Ben S. Bernanke and Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank are facing challenges similar to Mr. King's, if less acute -- such diminution can come as a rude awakening. In a speech last month, Mr. King acknowledged his limited ability to combat the high levels of unemployment and increased inflation bedeviling Britain.
With food and energy prices increasing and the weakness of the British pound making imports more expensive, he said, monetary policy could not ''alter the fact that, one way or another, the squeeze in living standards is the inevitable price to pay for the financial crisis and the subsequent rebalancing of the world and U.K. economies.''
It sounded a bit like the last cry of the ''incredible shrinking central banker.''
''It was a defensive speech, and there is a degree of frustration in the forces that are beyond his control,'' said DeAnne S. Julius, the chairman of Chatham House, a research and analysis organization in London, and a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.
Ms. Julius is a critic and argues not only that Mr. King is underestimating the inflationary winds but also that he is too extreme in urging that British banks take on more capital. ''The pressure is on -- both in terms of banking reform and inflation,'' she said. ''I do not think he has an easy life.''
And then there is the issue of fiscal policy.
The British public could be in for an even rougher ride this year when the government's $:80 billion austerity program really starts to bite. That prospect looms even larger after recent indications that the economy, instead of continuing to grow, shrank by 0.5 percent in the last quarter.
Consumer prices rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate in December, reaching the highest level in two years and, for a 13th consecutive month, missing the Bank of England's target of 2 percent.
Mr. King declined to be interviewed. But people who have worked with him paint a picture of an innovative thinker who has an agreeable charm but can also be pugnacious and confrontational when challenged intellectually.
''Mervyn is not blessed with any doubts about his abilities,'' said Michael Foot, chairman of the Promontory Financial Group consulting company in London and a former Bank of England executive.
But the accumulation of pressures seems to be having its effect. His January speech, while carrying all the quirky earmarks of a King address -- he began and ended with quotes from ''Anna Karenina'' -- came across to many analysts as unusually prickly rather than as a measured analysis of the British economy.
''There is a misapprehension in some quarters that the monetary policy committee could have prevented the squeeze in living standards by raising interest rates over the past year to bring inflation below its present level,'' Mr. King said in the speech. ''That view is a misunderstanding of how monetary policy works.''
Two members of the bank's policy making committee recently expressed public disagreement with Mr. King's insistence that Britain's current inflation rate had been driven by outside shock factors and that interest rates should not be increased. He has also been accused by another board member, Adam Posen, of jeopardizing the bank's independence by talking up the Conservative-led government's deficit-cutting strategy.
Since the Bank of England was made independent from the Treasury in 1997, its governors have been appointed by the government but have been viewed as apolitical, with a focus on ensuring price stability -- and with no business sharing their views on fiscal policy. Mr. King, whose second and final term will end in 2013, appeared to have moved beyond that understanding when he endorsed the coalition government's plan to cut the deficit faster than the opposition Labour Party had suggested when it was still in power.
The fear, some economists said, is that his endorsement creates expectations that he would be willing to neglect inflation for a while in order to let the government's spending cuts work.
To Mr. King's defenders, however, those who raise such fears do not know the heavy burden of running the Bank of England from its palace-like base on Threadneedle Street at the heart of the City, as London's financial district is known. Indeed, Mr. King has plenty of fans who praise him for the power of his convictions -- unpopular as they may be.
On the subject of being too close to the Tories on cutting the deficit, his defenders point to leaked cables in which Mr. King raised doubts about the experience of the Conservative leader, David Cameron, and his chief economic adviser, George Osborne.
''He is a king, a monarch in the classic sense, and he is fulfilling his duty to advise, consider and warn,'' said Michael Fallon, a Conservative member of Parliament who has questioned Mr. King numerous times as a member of the Treasury select committee. ''Our public finances were in a deeper mess than others, and he has helped shape that debate.''
Mr. King has also attracted a strong following -- largely outside British banking circles -- for his aggressive campaign to reduce the leverage of Britain's banks. He laid out his case in a hard-hitting address late last year in New York.
As Mr. King pointed out in that speech, Britain's banks pose unusual risks because they have assets 4.5 times the size of the British economy. How to scale that back is the subject of a much anticipated independent inquiry here, led by John Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist and head of the Office of Fair Trading.
Mr. King has been careful to not prejudge the result. He has made clear, though, that his view is that radical changes must come, saying in his speech that of the systems one might use to organize banks, ''the worst is the one we have today.''

CAMBODIAN PRIME MINISTER
Asks U.N. to Intervene
Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia asked the United Nations Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to ''stop Thailand's aggression'' after a third day of cross-border shelling by both sides. The Cambodian government said the shelling had damaged part of an 11th-century Hindu temple, Preah Vihear, that is claimed by both nations and has been the focus of tension and periodic military clashes since 2008. Tensions between the two sides were set off in July 2008 when Unesco named the temple a World Heritage site and placed it inside Cambodia.

ACCUSED SPIES ENTER PLEAS 
Not-guilty pleas were entered on behalf of the three American hikers accused of espionage and illegally entering Iran, their lawyer, Masoud Shafiee, said. No decisions were rendered in the case, and the trial will continue at a date to be determined, Mr. Shafiee said. All three Americans have denied that they knowingly entered Iranian territory or that they were involved in espionage. Page A4
LIFTING UP CONGO'S WOMEN
For years, diplomats, aid workers, academics and government officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been vexed almost to the point of paralysis about how to attack the country's staggering problem of sexual violence. One outsider, the playwright Eve Ensler, has built a compound where small groups of Congolese women, most of them rape victims, will be groomed to become leaders in their community so they can eventually rise up and, Ms. Ensler hopes, change Congo's politics.

For Hmong Leader
Vang Pao was no plain Hmong elder, and his death last month in Fresno, Calif., at age 81 has brought forth no ordinary grief. He is known to his people as the general, the hero of the Central Intelligence Agency's long-ago secret war in the jungles of Laos, a man who was leaving behind 25 children, 68 grandchildren and an uprooted nation of Hmong refugees who regard him as something near a king. So his funeral, spanning six days and nights, has become a send-off for the ages. Page A11

PROTESTS IN MIDDLE EAST
Bolster Al Jazeera Network
The satellite news network Al Jazeera stands to benefit greatly from its coverage of the protests that have disrupted the Middle East, a fact not lost on the network, which has been placing advertisements in major American newspapers. The live reports have strengthened the network's already tight grip on its Arabic-language viewing public, while bolstering its argument that cable and satellite distributors in the United States should make the English version available to American viewers.

GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE
Three years into his job as eBay's chief executive, John Donahoe has made only modest progress in improving growth at the online retailer. Mr. Donahoe said he planned to tell Wall Street securities analysts at the company's analyst day that eBay can now ''go on the offensive'' by building on its early momentum with mobile shoppers.

SMALLER SITES TRY Q. AND A.'S
An older idea in Internet circles is enjoying a renaissance: sites where users ask and answer questions. The genre has long been dominated by high-traffic incumbents like WikiAnswers and Yahoo Answers, but a flurry of start-ups in this field are gathering speed and attracting the eyes and wallets of venture capitalists. The entrepreneurs behind the newer sites say there is a big opportunity to be captured in revamping the question-and-answer model, and each is taking a slightly different approach. Page B3

EXCELLING AS A COLLEGE COACH
Far From the Bright Lights
Dave Bike, Sacred Heart University men's basketball coach, has carved his niche in college sports away from the iron-hot glare of the marquee conferences and the large arenas, building a legacy that now includes more than 500 victories, an N.C.A.A. title and numerous young lives touched. His 504 victories rank 20th on the career list for active N.C.A.A. Division I coaches, although his first 21 seasons were in Division II. Page D3

The New York Knicks avenged a painful loss last week to Philadelphia by defeating the 76ers, 117-103, to move to 26-24 over all.

Five of the nine games on Saturday in the English Premier League were won or tied by teams that were, at one point during the game, at least a goal down.

At Chicago's Good and Bad
''The Chicago Code,'' a new show beginning Monday on Fox, is a drama about good cops and bad politicians, the gung-ho efforts of driven law enforcers to plug the drain of the city's cash-for-favors economy. Bribes, kickbacks, suspiciously well-compensated construction companies, organized-crime alliances -- this is the stockpot in which the series stirs its wooden spoon.

HEADLINE: Yahoo Is Said to Move Toward Personalized Content

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
For Yahoo, it is getting personal.
Confronted by declining revenue and a steady stream of prominent departures, Yahoo plans to announce that it is developing a publishing platform for applications that would let users get personalized content on their phones and other mobile devices.
Carol A. Bartz, Yahoo's chief executive, is expected to unveil the plans for the project in an address this month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak about it. 
A spokeswoman for Yahoo declined to comment.
The move is part of a larger trend toward custom content. As news streams and Twitter feeds multiply on the Web, there is a flurry of new programs trying to help users cut through the noise. For instance, the iPad app Flipboard finds content from a user's social networking feeds and displays it in a magazine-like layout of photos and text blocks that can be flipped through. AOL recently announced that it would release Editions, its own personalized iPad magazine application. The tagline is ''The magazine that reads you.''
The Yahoo platform aims to draw from a user's declared preferences, search items, social media and other sources to find and highlight the most relevant content, according to the people familiar with the matter. It will be available on Yahoo's Web site, but is optimized to work as an app on tablets and smartphones, and especially on Google Android and Apple devices, they said. The project, initially named ''Deadeye,'' has been the focus of a team of more than 50 engineers for the last several months. The company is also planning to work with outside publishers, like Hearst, to create third-party apps powered by the same software engine, they said.
Yahoo is no a stranger to personalized content. In recent years, its home page has showcased many of its best efforts, said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Capital. The home page lets users add favorite links and apps and change the layout, and it delivers some content based on a user's activity.
Meanwhile, mobile is increasingly important to Yahoo's portfolio, as it is for other companies, since users are logging more hours on tablet devices and smartphones. Tablet sales alone are expected to more than double this year, to 24.1 million units, according to a recent report by Forrester Research.
In Yahoo's last earnings call, in late January, Ms. Bartz told investors to brace for a new wave of mobile apps. The company is focusing, she said, on reaching users ''no matter what device or operating system they're on.''
''If Yahoo wants to be a key, global player, it needs to have a compelling mobile strategy,'' said Aggarwal Sandeep, a Caris & Company analyst. ''In our view, in the next three to five years, mobile activity will grow three to four times faster than PC-based internet activity.''
Yahoo is struggling to change the perception that it is an empire in decline. Yahoo's online properties still attract 600 million to 650 million unique visitors a month, Mr. Sandeep said, ''but their metrics are deteriorating.''
In the last quarter, Yahoo's revenue slipped 12 percent. The company is also shedding employees through layoffs and prominent departures.
In December, Yahoo cut 600 employees, or 4 percent of its work force. Then, in January, the company cut an additional 1 percent, or 135 people. Meanwhile, several crucial members of the mobile team have left in the last six months, including one of the company's top mobile executives, David Ko (who went on to lead mobile efforts at Zynga) and the former vice president of mobile, North America, David Katz.
The hope is that the tide will change with this latest offering, but skeptics persist.
''We're glad to see that Yahoo views mobile as a priority,'' Mr. Sandeep said, ''but Yahoo is still losing its audience, it's unclear how they will reignite interest.''

HEADLINE: EBay Says Big Growth Is Not Over

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- EBay was growing so fast early in its history that Meg Whitman, its former chief executive, liked to joke that ''a monkey could drive this train.''
John Donahoe, her successor, still has the company on the track, but eBay's competitors are moving a whole lot faster.
Three years into the job, Mr. Donahoe has made only modest progress in improving growth at the online retailer. He has given the Web site a cosmetic makeover and recast it as an outlet mall where retailers can unload last season's merchandise, instead of being an all-encompassing auction house. ''I think we're turning a corner,'' Mr. Donahoe said in an interview last week. 
But while eBay's marketplace revenue grew just 8 percent to $5.7 billion last year, eBay is still losing market share to its rivals, as global e-commerce sales increased 18.9 percent in 2010. Amazon.com widened its lead last year, while Groupon, the daily deal service, and a number of specialty retailing sites like Etsy began nipping at eBay's heels.
Mr. Donahoe says he plans to tell Wall Street securities analysts on Thursday at the company's analyst day that eBay can now ''go on the offensive'' by building on its early momentum with mobile shoppers and that it will better integrate sister products like PayPal, the online payment service. But he is not expected to announce any major new products or services.
Analysts and eBay's investors have continued to pressure him to deliver on an earlier promise to match the growth of overall global e-commerce this year. But being able to achieve that goal -- J.P. Morgan forecasts e-commerce will grow 18.9 percent again this year -- is hardly guaranteed.
''While they've made some nice initial progress, there are quite a number of problems left to address,'' said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard & Poor's.
EBay's troubles were a long time coming. It managed to annoy many of the people who sold goods on eBay and those who bought them. Buyers complained of clutter, irrelevant search results and fraud. Sellers grumbled about what they saw as excessive fees and eBay's favoritism of big retailers over small merchants.
Growth in sales volume, the value of merchandise that changed hands on the site, excluding automobiles, started to flatten in 2006. After the recession began, the volume declined -- even though eBay used to brag that it thrived in tough times because users emptied their closets and attics for extra cash.
Kristin Brandt, a soap maker from Ogden, Utah, is among the many sellers who left eBay for other sites. Making a profit on ''Feebay,'' as she and others sometimes refer to the site, was impossible because of the money eBay extracted for listing products, posting photos and making a sale.
''You end up paying more than you intended to sell something that wasn't worth it in the first place,'' Ms. Brandt said. She now prefers to sell on Etsy, where there is less traffic but the fees are lower.
Mr. Donahoe has been shifting eBay from its roots as an online flea market. He recruited big retailers that needed to sell out-of-season, refurbished and liquidated merchandise. He pressed for more fixed-price sales so that impatient users -- eBay had 94.5 million active users at the end of last year -- could buy products without having to bid and wait to see if they won.
It was part of a broader strategy to make the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., more competitive with Amazon, a one-stop shop for nearly everything. Amazon's reliability, discounted prices and growing mall of third-party retailers have given it a big edge in the rivalry. Amazon reported a 40 percent gain in revenue, to $32.4 billion, last year.
After countless tweaks, eBay's marketplace Web site now has a noticeably cleaner design to keep buyers focused on the merchandise. Mr. Donahoe also invested in improving eBay's search engine so users could better sort through its more than 200 million products.
Giving various product categories a custom look, rather than a generic design, is another way eBay is trying to compete. EBay thinks users shop differently depending on the kind of product they are looking for, and catering to that translates into more sales.
In the fashion area, users can browse images rather than text. A shopper who finds a black purse she likes, for example, can click on ''see more like this'' to reveal others in similar style and color. More custom looks are planned for later this year in the auto parts and home and garden categories.
Despite all the effort going into sprucing up eBay's marketplace, half a dozen buyers and sellers interviewed recently did not notice any cosmetic changes. But they cited a few other upgrades that they said made buying and selling easier.
James Chen, owner of Audio Images, an audio equipment store in San Francisco, said he stopped selling on eBay because of excessive fees around three years ago and instead set up shop on Amazon. But in December, he returned to selling on eBay and discovered that eBay automatically suggested product descriptions -- a feature introduced last year -- so that he did not have to write them himself. ''I'm very happy with things,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Buyers are just buying.''
Mr. Donahoe lavishes praise on eBay's efforts in mobile shopping, which have shown early success. This year, eBay expects its customers will buy at least $4 billion in merchandise using smartphones, twice the amount spent in 2010.
EBay's RedLaser app, a bar-code scanning service it acquired last year, lets users compare prices for a product on a store shelf with those online. Another acquisition from last year, Milo, helps users find local stores that have a particular product in stock.
''We are absolutely on our front toes and going after this,'' Mr. Donahoe.

HEADLINE: In Lake George, a Race To, Um, a Seat of Fame

BYLINE: By LIZ LEYDEN

 BODY:
LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. -- Along Canada Street, this village's main commercial drag, scenes of a sleepy winter were everywhere. Icicles glittered from the rooftops of silent storefronts like the Candy Jar and the Lobster Pot, closed for the season.
But then a sign clearly to the contrary appeared: a truck carrying the Leaki Tiki, an aqua-colored outhouse festooned with fronds and torches, an exuberant entrant in the Lake George Winter Carnival's annual outhouse race. 
The 50-year-old carnival kicked off a monthlong celebration on Saturday, and hundreds of people gathered for the festivities despite an approaching snowstorm.
For the opening ceremonies, a helicopter dropped a skydiver onto the frozen lake. Events like kite flying and demonstrations of scuba diving under the ice were designed to lure spectators out in the single-digit temperatures, but perhaps none did so with as much good cheer as the outhouse race.
''It's so original,'' said Laura Viner, a 36-year-old nurse from Hinsdale, Mass. ''How many people can say they're going to an outhouse race? We actually have a chalkboard in the house where we count down the days.''
The nine competing houses weighed a minimum of 200 pounds, and each was fitted with a signature seat. Teams were all composed of two pushers, two pullers and one ''sitter,'' and each had to lose two heats before it was eliminated from the overall competition.
Clustered around the starting line, the houses included a shrink-wrapped aluminum structure on freshly waxed skis, the tiki hut and a structure designed to look like a wooden battering ram.
Adirondack Studios, a design and fabrication company in Argyle, N.Y., entered three teams. Curtis Condon, 47, works in the studios' paint shop and built two of its outhouses: a classic design seemingly bent backwards in the wind and another he dubbed Outhouse Fever, a Batmobile-shaped house that included a toilet made from the body of a guitar, and a horseshoe (''for good luck,'' Mr. Condon said).
At the Leaki Tiki, the focus was on ''glitz and glamour.'' Handing out leis before the race began, the team wore grass skirts and coconut bikinis over snow gear.
''Our goal is always to not be last,'' said Colin Buckhurst, 37, a technical director at Adirondack Studios in his fifth year of racing.
He paused, possibly for comedic effect.
''You don't ever want to be No. 1 or No. 2 in an outhouse race,'' he said.
As the crowd hooted, the races began, a frenzied sprint of outhouses skidding through the snow. The team to beat, based on past results, was the one from L. P. Adams, a lumber company in Pittsfield, Mass., that was making its 20th appearance in the race. The team had racked up more than a dozen wins over the years, and on Saturday, it stuck with what had worked: runners dressed in shorts and cleats, with ropes tied around their waists.
At the end of each heat, everyone looked the same: red-cheeked, hands on knees, breathless. With the double-elimination structure, some teams hauled their houses in half a dozen heats.
''I give these guys a lot of credit,'' said Linda Duffy, a carnival organizer in charge of the race. ''Pushing those houses back and forth through this snow, it's tough.''
The goal of the carnival is the same as when it began in 1961: to lift the economy of a lakeside town that grows quiet when summer ends. Relief from cabin fever in a winter strewn with storms is a much-needed bonus.
As the races unfolded, the event took on the air of a small-town ice cream social, with talk of impending births, memorable feats and local politics.
Mishaps, which in past years have included chipped teeth and pulled hamstrings, were few. Somersaults and several toppled outhouses left runners with minor scrapes and frozen skin.
In an early heat, Tyler Needham ran straight out of his boots and barefoot into the snow. Mr. Needham, a 20-year-old welder from nearby Warrensburg, did not miss a step, sticking with his team, Outhouse Fever, until it crossed the finish line.
''Heart of a champion,'' Mr. Needham said. ''You got to keep going.''
The effort -- or maybe the lucky horseshoe toilet seat -- made a difference. Outhouse Fever clinched the 2011 victory in a head-to-head battle against L. P. Adams. The race ended a few feet before the finish line when the longtime champion team's outhouse tumbled over in the snow.
In the warmth of Duffy's Tavern on the shore, racers would later admire the Seat of Fame -- the toilet seat plaque mounted on the wall, celebrating past winners -- as they rehashed the day's excitement:
''Did you see our team tip over?''
''Did you see me get run over?''
Awards were given and glasses raised. Only then did the snow begin to fall, coating the sky with huge heavy flakes until the lake outside disappeared from sight.

HEADLINE: Nassau County Has Everything (Even Debt)

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Like ''Ishtar II,'' it seems an unlikely and unwanted sequel.
But there it is, Nassau County, which gave the world Gatsby and Levittown, where the modern suburban good life was more or less first mass-produced, back under the control of a state oversight board, like one of those Rust Belt basket cases or dead-end school districts too far gone to pay its bills.
On some level, it's nuts. If Nassau can't pay its bills, none of us can. Which, come to think of it, is why this sequel makes plenty of sense after all. In a country now hard wired to avoid hard choices, where everyone lives beyond his means, where politics is, weirdly, both a dirty word and our second-favorite spectator sport, what could be more logical than another fiscal train wreck in a place that has everything, except, it seems, much interest in paying for it. 
The simple story is that Nassau is being crushed by exorbitant payroll costs. This, after all, is a county where roughly one-third of the 10,000 employees had annual salaries over $100,000 in 2010, and where the average base salary for police officers was $107,000.
It is not just the police. This, it must be said, is kind of the Nassau way. As Newsday reported last month, 9 of the 29 full-time employees of the Hempstead Animal Shelter, in the county's center of power and the nation's largest town, were paid more than $100,000 last year. Eight of them were Republican Party insiders, including six who were elected to seats on the county Republican committee. Only 3 of 130 employees with comparable shelter jobs in New York City were paid six figures.
Yet the situation extends far beyond cushy salaries and perks.
There are structural problems, like Nassau's broken tax grievance process, in which county taxes account for only 16 percent of the local tax bills, but the county is responsible for the entire bill when residents successfully challenge their assessments.
There are political problems, like the electoral poison that is taxes in a county that always ranks near the top nationally in property taxes, most of which go to the schools. More than any other single issue, County Executive Edward P. Mangano, a Republican, owes his upset victory over his Democratic predecessor, Thomas R. Suozzi, to his promise to repeal Nassau's energy tax enacted by Mr. Suozzi. (Mr. Suozzi, it should be added, found various ways to help dig his own grave.) A similar tax exists in Suffolk and Westchester Counties. It cost each household about $80 a year. Its repeal helped blow a $40 million hole in the budget that was not repaired.
And there are economic problems. Nassau, for all its affluence, is now one of those inner-ring suburbs, growing slowly older and poorer, pretty much tapped out for available land and growth, and seemingly eternally gridlocked -- witness the perpetual stalemate over the Lighthouse Project and the other ideas for redeveloping the Nassau Coliseum site.
Nassau is now falling ever further behind Suffolk, once Long Island's version of the boonies, now where the action is.
You might think a crisis would clarify the mind, particularly given that the Nassau Interim Finance Authority a week ago voted 6 to 0 to take over the county's finances, saying the county had failed to balance its $2.7 billion budget. The board, formed in 2000 during Nassau's last fiscal crisis, estimated that the 2011 budget was as much as $176 million in the red.
But, of course, the reaction has been just the opposite. Mr. Mangano has sued the review board, throwing the business, in time-tested Nassau fashion, to his old law firm. His most respected economic development aide, Patrick Foye, quit in protest, saying the advice Mr. Mangano was listening to was ''irresponsible and wrong.''
Peter J. Schmitt, the presiding officer of the County Legislature, launched into remarkably personal attacks on the members of the review board and threatened retribution.
IN a year when control of the Legislature -- and the ability to draw its lines -- is up for grabs, maybe it is unrealistic to expect otherwise. Yet at a time when the last thing Nassau needs is to rebrand itself as the most dysfunctional government in a dysfunctional state, the logic of the county's working with the board and the state, not going to war with them, seems overwhelming.
Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic-leaning political consultant and an adjunct professor of political science at the State University at Albany, compared Nassau's situation to the fiscal crisis in New York City in the 1970s, when outside oversight proved humiliating, painful and, in the end, the city's salvation, by achieving results politics as normal never could.
''There are times when governmental challenges are so profound that the best politics is good government,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On Patrol in Pothole City

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Jose Antonio Cruz carries the tools of roadside salvation, but few would describe him as popular.
With melting snow, road salt and snowplows teaming up to assault the roadways since late December, many street surfaces are crumbling and becoming pockmarked with potholes. As fast as the city fills them, new ones open up -- little roadside craters that can cause untold damage to vehicles.
And if those vehicles happen to be in the East Bronx, their drivers may encounter Mr. Cruz, a tow truck driver who patrols that territory. 
''New York is Pothole City right now,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''Everyone is driving through an obstacle course. These streets will take your car away in a heartbeat.''
Mr. Cruz, 52, looks the part of grizzled tow truck driver, with his wraparound sunglasses and a baseball hat pulled over a bandanna fastened around his head. He patrols several local parkways, looking for disabled cars and listening to his two-way radio for rescue calls.
When asked to explain the origin of a pothole, he leans heavily on allegory.
''It's a little like when you're eating oatmeal in the morning,'' he said, deftly weaving between cars on the Throgs Neck Expressway. ''You start in one spot and start to work your way in, till the hole keeps expanding.''
He had just picked up a silver 2010 Mercedes sedan with damaged tires and rims on the driver's side after a slam into a pothole on Bruckner Boulevard at White Plains Road, a spot so bad that the police were called numerous times there on Sunday morning by drivers needing help with flat tires inflicted by potholes.
The owner of the Mercedes, Carmelo Ramirez, watched glumly as mechanics removed his wheels and rims at a repair shop on Bronx River Road.
The rims, reduced to mottled metal, were stacked on a pile of similarly damaged rims, and the tires, which looked like Swiss cheese, were tossed in the trash. Mr. Ramirez, 50, an off-duty chauffeur from the Bronx, was told he had about $1,000 worth of damage.
Nearby on the southbound Bronx River Parkway, near 233rd Street, the police were called to a large pothole blocking two lanes of traffic.
''Before this,'' Mr. Cruz said, ''I just picked up a lady on the Sheridan whose Volvo bottomed out on the Sheridan Expressway, and she got suspension damage.''
The city's Department of Transportation has filled more than 135,000 potholes since July 1, more than 45,000 of them since the first snowstorm in December. Last month, 1,781 pothole-related complaints came through 311, officials said, and on Sunday, the department sent out a dozen crews to fill the holes on city highways.
Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner, said: ''Mother Nature has thrown everything at us this winter and we're striking back with up to 40 crews filling some 2,000 potholes every day. This work will continue throughout the winter to keep our roads in good condition and keep the local economy moving.''
Mr. Cruz, who drives a flatbed truck for Universe Towing in the Bronx, was skeptical about whether the city could fix the holes in time to keep roadways safe.
''Some of these holes are so large, I don't think the city can keep up with the growth of the hole,'' he said. ''You think it's a little puddle, but it's a deep hole and you've wiped out your whole car.''
On the northbound Hutchinson River Parkway, he passed the Westchester Avenue exit, where the road turned waffle-like.
''You hit that -- boom! It's over,'' he said. ''Next thing you know, I'm towing your car away.''
Then on the right lane of the northbound Major Deegan Expressway, he pointed out the deep trenches running along the right lane.
Soon he was heading south on the New England Thruway, pointing out potholes that exposed steel support rods in the concrete layer below. He pointed and said, ''You can see the rebar.''
''A hole of that depth,'' he added, ''a car's shock absorbers just can't handle it -- they're the length of my forearm.''
He gleefully steered his truck into some of the holes, and said, ''This truck has shocks as big as an elephant's leg.''
He stopped the truck at one point and gaped down at a pothole that was so deep, it exposed a layer of Belgian block.
''Down to the cobblestones,'' he exclaimed. ''That pothole reaches down to the 1800s.''
On Allerton Avenue, he pointed out a hole on the left edge of the left lane and said, ''That's a tire gone, right there.'' And when passing a crater on the eastbound East Fordham Road near the Bronx Zoo, he said, ''That will swallow whole cars up.''
He was sent to Jerome Avenue to pick up a minivan with a flat tire that had been dealt by a dandy of a pothole.
The minivan's driver said, ''I think it's part of a conspiracy by my wife -- she didn't want me going out today to watch the Super Bowl.''
Few people seem to hold prolonged grudges against Mr. Cruz, even though it is easy to view him as an unapologetic cog in the whole miserable pothole experience. In that way, he is like a blackjack dealer, a witness and a party to your going bust, but ultimately, blameless.

For Bruce Josten, the feisty top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it got personal last fall on a Sunday talk show when President Obama's spokesman invoked his name.
''They called me out'' during a White House attack on the chamber's midterm campaign efforts, Mr. Josten recalled. Mr. Obama had his own reason to take things personally; his policies were on the receiving end of a $50 million ''voter education'' barrage by the chamber, the signature lobby for American business.
For the moment, both sides have sheathed their weapons. Mr. Obama will address the chamber on Monday as part of a postelection effort to improve relations with business and, he hopes, accelerate economic recovery. 
Mr. Josten sees positive signs. The chamber cheered the bipartisan tax cut compromise that Mr. Obama reached with Republicans in the lame-duck session of Congress, the completion of a United States-South Korea trade deal and the recent appointment of William M. Daley, a former business executive, as White House chief of staff.
''The White House does deserve credit,'' Mr. Josten acknowledged. But he is not yet convinced that such steps will tame what he called the ''regulatory tsunami,'' among other problems, enough to stir the investment and the new hiring the administration seeks.
''That's all up in the air,'' Mr. Josten concluded. ''You've got to walk the talk.''
Narrowed Differences
Relations between corporate leaders and any Democratic president are necessarily fraught. They have different constituencies and worldviews - on the role of government, the distribution of tax burdens and the proper balance between business and labor.
In Mr. Obama's first two years, business saw costly new health care and financial regulations and a president who denounced the ''obscene'' bonuses of Wall Street ''fat cats.'' Mr. Obama's fellow Democrats saw an administration that eschewed bank nationalization and single-payer health care and usually chose cool pragmatism over hot populism.
Corporate leaders ''feared truly punishing legislation and behavior, and in fact they never got it,'' said a Democratic strategist, Jim Jordan. They complain loudly anyway, Mr. Jordan added, for the same reason that top basketball coaches like Mike Krzyzewski of Duke yell at referees: to seek advantage on the next close call.
The new political alignment of 2011 has narrowed their differences. Having achieved his principal goals on health care and financial regulation (while failing on capping carbon emissions), Mr. Obama has moved toward less polarizing priorities. And Republicans' new strength on Capitol Hill requires that any substantive action have bipartisan support.
''Let's set aside ideology,'' said Bernadette Budde, senior vice president at the Business Industry Political Action Committee. ''That's not even the arena in which we're going to play for the next two years.''
Export promotion, infrastructure development and support for innovation through improvements in research and education all represent goals that business shares with an administration hungry to spur investment and job creation. That agenda may also be appealing to political independents, whose impatience for results drove the swing elections of 2006, 2008 and 2010.
Pressure from those ''fix-it voters,'' Ms. Budde said, helps elevate the component of Mr. Obama's leadership style that values compromise and inclusiveness.
''I think I can work with that Obama,'' she concluded. ''If you're in the room, you're going to get something.''
Wary Partners
The president of the U.S. Chamber, Thomas J. Donohue, was among the first people Gene Sperling called after Mr. Obama named him last month to head the National Economic Council. Among his goals, Mr. Sperling said, is to be ''an honest broker'' who makes sure ''more people are included'' in policy deliberations.
So far, signals like that have had their intended effect. Corporate leaders ''now feel they have a partner,'' said Johanna Schneider, who directs external relations at the Business Roundtable,, an association of nearly 200 leading chief executives.
That has not wiped away differences of interest or mutual suspicions. ''I have no idea,'' Mr. Josten said, what Mr. Obama will tell the chamber on Monday, but he pointed to several specifics that business would like to hear.
Those include a commitment to complete additional trade deals with Colombia and Panama; steps toward a fundamental overhaul of the tax code; curbs on politically delicate entitlement programs that are needed to close long-term deficits and new financing sources for Mr. Obama's infrastructure goals. Unlike the chamber, the White House has shied away from supporting a gas tax increase.
Mr. Josten dismissed Mr. Obama's recently announced regulatory strategy, ostensibly intended to reduce unnecessary burdens on business. ''It's a rehash of Clinton's, which was a rehash of Carter's,'' Mr. Josten said.
Such skepticism underscores the limits of rapprochement between Mr. Obama and business organizations in Washington. Nonetheless, they must cope with one another for at least two more years, and maybe six.
''It's their field,'' Mr. Josten said of the administration. But ''we're going to be on the field.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Prideful and Prizing Status Quo, Mubarak Resists Pressure

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARK MAZZETTI; Reporting was contributed by Elisabeth Bumiller, Scott Shane and Sheryl Gay Stolberg in Washington; David D. Kirkpatrick in Cairo; and Michael Slackman in Berlin.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- He walks several yards to his office from his living quarters at the presidential palace every day, dressed in his trademark black business suit and tie. On Saturday, he conducted a meeting of his new government's economic team. And on Sunday, he received an envoy from Oman, who delivered a letter from the sultan.
Egyptian, Arab and Western officials who have dealt with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt say that for the past week, he has veered between anger, a sense of betrayal and stoicism. Known for a fierce conservatism that prizes stability above all else, Mr. Mubarak has reacted to the calls for his resignation -- some from Western officials who he thought were, if not friends, at least allies -- with his usual change-resistant manner. One Arab official called it ''his reflex adherence to the status quo.''
That deep-seated aversion to change, along with Mr. Mubarak's fierce pride and absolute certainty that he is the only person who can provide his country with the stability he so prizes, now occupies center stage in the Egyptian crisis, a psychological drama to rival the clash on the streets. 
At his news conference on Friday, President Obama said he thought Mr. Mubarak had made a ''psychological break'' from his hold on office by announcing that he would not run again.
The question of whether Mr. Mubarak will yield power willingly -- and how and under what timetable he might do so -- are driving the Obama administration's national security team to assess and reassess their strategy in dealing with him. It is being watched intently by the antigovernment protesters in Cairo, much of the Arab world and even by members of his own government.
The protesters, along with American and Western officials, are unsure to what degree Mr. Mubarak still calls the shots. There is speculation here and in Cairo that Omar Suleiman, whom Mr. Mubarak named as vice president eight days ago, is in charge now. Since a tense 30-minute phone call between Mr. Obama and Mr. Mubarak last Tuesday night ended with Mr. Mubarak balking at American suggestions that he leave power, most of the Obama administration's negotiations have been with Mr. Suleiman, according to American officials.
Still, Mr. Suleiman and other Egyptian officials have taken pains to show that their actions are at their boss's behest, even if he does not appear to be publicly managing the country's crisis.
American and Egyptian officials say that such considerations are all part of a carefully calibrated process aimed at avoiding a direct challenge to Mr. Mubarak's unwavering belief that if you make concessions -- like tendering a resignation -- in the face of pressure, you invite more demands. Concessions must be made on the Mubarak stopwatch, say those who have worked with him. They describe a man who often refuses to accept an idea when it is first presented, but weeks later, embraces it as his own.
Mr. Mubarak, 82, has survived three wars, an Islamic uprising and multiple assassination attempts. Two years ago, an aneurism caused the sudden death of his 12-year-old grandson, Muhammad, a deep personal blow. Through all of that, Egyptian and American officials said, he continues to believe that his country can succeed only if he is at the helm to protect it from being taken over by Islamists (He deplores the Muslim Brotherhood, who he has long believed had a hand in the assassination of his predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat).
''He kept the peace for 30 years, and it is tragic that his tenure in office ends this way,'' said an Egyptian official who worked closely with Mr. Mubarak. But, the official added, ''There came a point beyond which President Mubarak became out of touch with a significant portion of the Egyptian people.''
The traits that define Mr. Mubarak today have been on display for decades. In 1981, Bruce O. Riedel, then a young Egypt analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, wrote a briefing paper that, he said, concluded that Mr. Mubarak's rise to power would be beneficial to Washington because he was ''cautious, conservative, predictable and pro-American.''
Witnessing Mr. Sadat being gunned down in a hail of gunfire was a searing experience for him, and he lives a cloistered life in the secure confines of the palace in Cairo or his residence in the seaside community of Sharm el Sheik.
But Mr. Mubarak also turned his risk-aversion into a virtue, portraying himself as heroic for being canny enough not to be lured into rash decisions. In 1970, as chief of the Egyptian Air Force, Mr. Mubarak famously resisted intense pressure from the Soviet Union to test Israel's air defenses by flying combat missions over the Sinai Peninsula. The Soviets carried out the missions themselves, and in July of that year the Israeli military shot down five Soviet MiG-21s.
''This is indicative of a guy who takes his victories not from doing things, but from avoiding doing things,'' Mr. Riedel said .
Now, that conservatism has run smack into the demands for change from the people in the street. Marwan Muasher, a former foreign minister and former deputy prime minister of Jordan, said he thought that Mr. Suleiman would take the lead in easing Mr. Mubarak out. ''I think Suleiman will try to do it in a soft way, if you want,'' said Mr. Muasher, now a Middle East specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''If that doesn't work, I think there will come a time when he will be told bluntly.''
The success of such an approach remains uncertain. Current and former American officials who have met with Mr. Mubarak regularly over two decades describe a man who is imperious, inscrutable and reluctant to betray emotion. He rarely confides in anyone beyond his tight inner circle, and uses public appearances to cultivate a regal image. He began dying his hair at a relatively early age, a move that American observers interpreted as an effort to appear ageless to the Egyptian public.
American diplomatic cables provided by WikiLeaks, an organization devoted to revealing secret government documents, depict Mr. Mubarak as occasionally expansive during visits by American leaders and Congressional representatives. During such a meeting in January 2008 with Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, Mr. Mubarak chatted easily and ''engaged the visitors extensively on the topic of food,'' the cable said, saying that his favorites were Egyptian breakfast dishes like tamiya (falafel) and beans. ''He ordered up a huge tray of freshly made tamiya sandwiches for lunch, and lustily consumed several,'' the cable said.
During that meeting, Mr. Mubarak also talked about his younger son and presumed successor, Gamal, whom he described as a perfectionist from childhood. ''As a schoolboy, if I gave him a notebook with one line that was not straight, he would throw a fit and demand a new one,'' the cable recounted Mr. Mubarak as saying, laughing. Mr. Mubarak said Gamal is ''idealistic'' and ''punctual.'' He added, ''If he (Gamal) says 'meet me for lunch at 2:00,' he means 2:00. Set your watch by it.''
The cable also notes that Mr. Mubarak had ''more than his usual difficulty in hearing,'' but that ''nonetheless he initiated several phone calls.''
Several cables describe a ''warm relationship'' between Mr. Mubarak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in which they often discuss, and agree on, the threat from Iran. A 2009 cable describes Mr. Mubarak as telling another visitor from Washington, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, that he had warned President George W. Bush not to attack Iraq. Iran, he said, only started to ''breathe'' once the United States removed Saddam Hussein from the scene. ''Removing Saddam from power was the biggest mistake ever committed,'' Mr. Mubarak told Mr. McConnell, according to the cable.
Another diplomatic cable describes Mr. Mubarak as ''a classic Egyptian secularist who hates religious extremism and interference in politics.''
''The Muslim Brothers represent the worst, as they challenge not only Mubarak's power, but his view of Egyptian interests,'' the cable continues. ''As with regional issues, Mubarak seeks to avoid conflict and spare his people from the violence he predicts would emerge from unleashed personal and civil liberties.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Patron, With Few Frills, Lifts a Lowly English Soccer Club

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
BEDLINGTON, England -- The phone first rang a year ago in January. The caller identified himself as Bob Rich, a billionaire American businessman and sports team owner. He had English royals among his ancestors. For Christmas, his wife had bought him the title Lord of Bedlington. And he wanted to do something, well, lordly.
In particular, he wanted to sponsor the Bedlington Terriers soccer club. This had to be a joke. A guy named Rich wanted to help finance a team that played at a stadium called Welfare Park? Right.
Americans invested in English soccer teams, but they opened their wallets for big clubs in the Premier League: Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Aston Villa. Who would possibly be interested in the Bedlington Terriers? 
This was about as far below the Premier League as one could get. Bedlington was a ninth-tier team from the northeast of England, near the Scottish border. Its players were semiprofessional. Matches drew 60 to 100 fans. The team's video department consisted of a guy who stood behind the goal and captured highlights on his iPhone.
''I thought someone was winding me up,'' said David Holmes, the team's chairman.
But Mr. Rich was serious. He was a frozen-food mogul from Buffalo, the chairman of Rich Products Corporation, ranked 488th on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, with an estimated wealth of $2 billion. A former athlete, he had tried out for the 1964 Olympic hockey team. And he knew a thing or two about sports marketing, since he already owned three minor league baseball teams, including the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' top minor league affiliate.
Mr. Rich felt a Rust Belt kinship with Bedlington, situated in what had been a center of England's coal-mining industry. The mines were long closed. Trains no longer stopped at the local station. This was now a bedroom community of about 15,000, with many people commuting to work in nearby Newcastle.
''There were a lot of similarities to Buffalo,'' Mr. Rich, 70, said in a telephone interview. ''They had lost their mining and we had lost our steel milling.''
That affinity led to one of the more improbable alliances in the world of international sports.
Mr. Rich's company now has its name across the jerseys of Bedlington's soccer team. It will soon install a scoreboard, the only one in the 22-team first division of the Northern League. And it will probably resod Welfare Park, where the field is in such fragile shape after a harsh fall and early winter that the Terriers could not play for 54 consecutive days between November and January.
There are no heating coils beneath Northern League fields, as there are at some stadiums in the Premier League, to melt the snow and frost, ''only an old guy with a hair dryer,'' said Mark Clennell, 28, a fan of the rival Whitley Bay.
From the beginning, Mr. Rich made it clear that he did not want to buy the Bedlington team. American owners of English soccer clubs have been met with great skepticism after frequently incurring mounds of debt. Instead, Mr. Rich bought a jersey sponsorship for about $16,000 a season and a new scoreboard costing ''well north'' of $50,000, but he never promised to ''splash the cash,'' as they say around here.
He intends to foster a kind of mentor-student relationship, lending his company's expertise in promotions, groundskeeping and customer relations in hopes of creating a cultish buzz about the Bedlington Terriers as plucky underdogs.
The new scoreboard will flash advertising and be capable of showing video highlights. Mr. Rich plans to sell Bedlington jerseys at his minor league ballparks in the United States. He also hopes to persuade members of Bedlington terrier dog clubs in the United States to buy jerseys, shirts, jackets, scarves and hats featuring the woolly pooch on the official team crest. Proceeds from merchandise sales will go to the soccer team.
The aims are to attract more sponsors, boost finances and sign better players. Bedlington wants to move up a division or two, incrementally. It won the Northern League five years in a row from 1998 to 2002 but nearly disbanded five years ago because of financial distress. Now the club is run on a shoestring annual budget of about $128,000. Some stars in the Premier League make twice that in a week.
Club officials volunteer their time. The players are teachers, plasterers, carpenters, electricians and bricklayers. Expense money pays them $95 to $195 a week. At a match last Wednesday, which drew 63 paying customers, the team's accountant operated the public-address system and handed out sofa cushions to supporters in the tiny grandstand.
A halftime raffle awarded a bottle of wine to one winner and a box of chocolates to the other. About the only connection to big-time soccer at Welfare Park was a sign at the box office that warned, ''No vuvuzelas allowed.''
''We want to help them help themselves,'' Mr. Rich said. ''We can't get into an arms race, but we can help them improve amenities and help them with their field so a guy won't turn his ankle in a mud patch and help them so they're not scrapping to make a payroll.''
Twice, Mr. Rich has seen the Terriers play, once last March and again in late January for his 70th birthday. He shares a birthday with the 18th century Scottish poet Robert Burns, and joined club officials for a supper in Burns's honor that included a poetry reading and ceremonial stabbing of the haggis.
Mr. Rich, whose father, Robert Sr., built the family fortune on nondairy whipped topping and creamer, was researching his genealogical history last year when he found an ancestor called the Lord of Bedlington.
''I didn't even know where it was,'' he said. ''So I checked a map.''
Then he jokingly told his wife, Mindy, ''I should be a lord.''
She replied, ''I'll buy one for you.'' Lord of Bedlington happened to be available. These titles can be bought for as little as about $325, and his was on the low end, Mr. Rich said. For the billionaire who has everything, it amounted to a Christmas stocking stuffer.
''You can't question the legality of it, though you can probably question the taste of it,'' the drolly self-deprecating Mr. Rich said. ''Mine came with a plaque and a decoder ring. My fishing buddies call me Lord Bubba.''
Early word spread, incorrectly, that Mr. Rich would spend millions on the Terriers, just as Russian oligarchs and oil-rich sheiks did in the Premier League. Even a more modest infusion of money and visibility seems appreciated, though, in a village stung by the global recession.
''I've never seen it so bad before that the pubs shut,'' said Robert Watson, 52, whose family has owned a newsstand here for nearly a century. ''Anything would help. We've lost everything.''
There is some wariness, too, along with the gratitude. Stuart Elliott, 33, the Bedlington captain who has played on bigger clubs just below the Premier League, noted that soccer was littered with owners and sponsors who threw lots of money at teams and then grew bored and walked away.
''That can cripple a club,'' he said. But, referring to Mr. Rich, the captain added: ''So far he's done what he said he would do. And he spent his 70th birthday watching us. He could have been on an island somewhere. We appreciate that.''
This season Bedlington ranks seventh in league play, not great but encouraging enough for locals to believe that better times may be ahead.
''The town lost its identity,'' said John Garbutt, the Terriers' vice chairman. ''The team has been languishing. All of a sudden, we're on the up and up. We're giving the community back its heart is the way I see it.''

HEADLINE: Data on New York's Graduates Show Most Aren't College-Ready

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
New York State education officials released a new set of graduation statistics on Monday that show less than half of students in the state are leaving high school prepared for college and well-paying careers.
The new statistics, part of a push to realign state standards with college performance, show that only 23 percent of students in New York City graduated ready for college or careers in 2009, not counting special-education students. That is well under half the current graduation rate of 64 percent, a number often promoted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as evidence that his education policies are working.
But New York City is still doing better than the state's other large urban districts. In Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers, less than 17 percent of students met the proposed standards, including just 5 percent in Rochester.
The Board of Regents, which sets the state's education policies, met on Monday to begin discussing what to do with this data, and will most likely issue a decision in March. One option is to make schools and districts place an asterisk next to the current graduation rate, or have them report both the current graduation rate and the college ready rate, said Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the Board of Regents. 
The move parallels a decision by the Regents last year to make standardized tests for third through eighth graders more difficult to pass, saying that the old passing rates did not correlate to high school success.
''With three through eight, we ripped the Band-Aid off,'' Dr. Tisch said in an interview last week. ''The thing we said then, in looking at the business world, is that if you sit on this, you become the Enron of test scores, the Enron of graduation rates. We need to indicate exactly what it all means, especially since we've already said that college-ready should be the indicator of high school completion.''
State and city education officials have known for years that graduating from a public high school does not indicate that a student is ready for college, and have been slowly moving to raise standards. But the political will to acknowledge openly the chasm between graduation requirements and college or job needs is new, Dr. Tisch; David M. Steiner, the state education commissioner; and John King, the deputy state education commissioner, said in interviews last week.
With President Obama making college readiness and international competitiveness a top national goal, and federal and philanthropic money pouring into finding ways to raise national education standards, that equation is changing, they said. ''It is a national crisis,'' Dr. Steiner said.
Statewide, 77 percent of students graduate from high school. Currently, a student needs to score a 65 on four of the state's five required Regents exams to graduate, and beginning next year, they will need a 65 on all five.
Using data collected by state and community colleges, testing experts on a state committee determined last year that a 75 on the English Regents and a 80 on the math Regents roughly predicted that students would get at least a C in a college-level course in the same subject. Scores below that meant students had to often take remediation classes before they could do college-level work. Only 41 percent of New York State graduates in 2009 achieved those scores.
In the wealthier districts across the state, the news is better: 72 percent of students in ''low need'' districts are graduating ready for college or careers. But even that is well under the 95 percent of students in those districts who are now graduating.
The data also cast new doubt on the ability of charter schools to outperform their traditional school peers. Statewide, only 10 percent of students at charters graduated in 2009 at college-ready standards, though 49 percent received diplomas. The state has not yet calculated results for every district and school.
State officials have also begun a series of meetings in local districts to introduce this data and ask local officials what they want to do about it. A common reaction, Dr. Tisch said, is shock and hesitancy. There are fears of plummeting real estate values, as well as disagreement, particularly in rural areas, with the idea that all students need to be prepared for college.
Jean-Claude Brizard, the schools superintendent in Rochester for the past three years, said that while he was surprised by the data, he welcomed the effort to move the conversation away from simply graduating. In an effort to improve, Rochester has closed half its high schools and opened new schools, including its first high school that allows students to earn credits at several local colleges.
''We are behind the eight-ball a bit, but we are pushing,'' he said. ''It's shocking, I know. It's low. But for me, it is going to support my initiatives.''
In New York City, roughly 75 percent of public high school students who enroll in community colleges need to take remedial math or English courses before they can begin college-level work. City education officials said the 23 percent college-ready rate was not a fair measure of how the city would do if graduation requirements were raised to a higher standard, because students would work harder to meet that new bar.
While it has not gone so far as to calculate an alternative to graduation rates, the city has already begun tracking how each high school's students fare in college, and in 2012 it will begin holding principals accountable for it. ''Last year, well before the state announced this plan, we told schools we would begin including robust college readiness metrics in school progress reports,'' said Shael Polakow-Suransky, the chief academic officer.
One thing that is helping districts get over their shock, Dr. Tisch said, is the opening of a broad discussion about how to improve things. On their tour, which has visited Albany, Buffalo and Rochester and will visit New York City, Westchester County and Long Island in the coming weeks, officials are presenting a menu of options.
One idea is to simply report a college-ready graduation rate as an aspirational standard and leave it at that. Another is to impose tougher graduation standards -- like requiring that all students in the state take four years of math and science, or permanently raising the passing score on high school Regents exams to 75 in English and 80 in math.
But they are also discussing increased flexibility for districts and students, so that they can spend more time on the subjects they are interested in. For example, students might be permitted to choose at least one of the Regents exams they must pass to graduate -- currently all students have to pass math, English, science, global history and American history. Students might be able to substitute foreign language, economics or art for one of the five. Or students could replace one Regents with a vocational skills test in an area like carpentry or plumbing.
Alternatively, the state could grant flexibility to districts to give credits based not on how many hours students sit in a classroom -- currently 54 hours per semester per credit -- but on whether students show competency, based on examination or online course work.
To press their case, state officials said they hoped to get political support from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The political environment was particularly challenging now, because the state will roll out a new system in July to evaluate teachers that has the potential of strong opposition from teachers' unions.
''I would consider it irresponsible, quite frankly, to hold back information at this point, considering that we have already moved in that direction on the three through eight,'' Dr. Tisch said, adding, ''The obligation at the end of the day is to make sure that when youngsters graduate, that graduation means something from New York State.''

To the Editor:
''Teacher, My Dad Lost His Job. Do We Have to Move?,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, Jan. 31), about one Ohio community in crisis, was a heartbreaking snapshot of the eroding prospects of children in middle-class families. 
A report our organization released recently confirmed that this pattern is repeating across the country -- and is one that began even before the recession hit.
Between 2000 and 2008, children in middle-class families saw their real family income drop by more than $4,000 compared with high-income families, whose fortunes dipped by just $139. The income gap between children in middle-income and high-income families is now nearly as large as the gap that separated low-income and high-income groups in 1985.
As the article notes, children feel the brunt of this decline acutely -- even as they ''can't verbalize what's wrong.'' That's why it's on us as adults to voice our support in the coming budget debates for health care and for education policies beginning with prekindergarten that protect the youngest Americans through this recession and beyond.

HEADLINE: EGYPT'S LEADERS SEEK TO PROJECT AIR OF NORMALCY

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; Reporting was contributed by David D. Kirkpatrick, Kareem Fahim, Mona El-Naggar, Roger Cohen, Thanassis Cambanis and Liam Stack.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- As Egypt's revolt entered its third week the government of President Hosni Mubarak sought to seize the initiative from protesters still crowding Tahrir Square on Monday, offering a pay raise for government employees, announcing a date for opening the stock market and projecting an air of normalcy in a city reeling just days ago.
The confident tone, echoed by state-controlled news media that have begun acknowledging the protests after days of the crudest propaganda, suggested that both sides believed the uprising's vitality might depend on their ability to sway a population still deeply divided over events that represent the most fundamental realignment of politics here in nearly three decades.
''Now it feels like Hosni Mubarak is playing a game of who has the longest breath,'' said Amur el-Etrebi, who joined tens of thousands in Tahrir Square on Monday. 
Momentum has seemed to shift by the day in a climactic struggle over what kind of change Egypt will undergo and whether Egyptian officials are sincere about delivering it. In a sign of the tension, American officials described as ''unacceptable'' statements by Vice President Omar Suleiman that the country was not ready for democracy, but showed no sign that they had shifted away from supporting Mr. Suleiman, a man widely viewed here as an heir to Mr. Mubarak.
After demonstrating an ability to bring hundreds of thousands to downtown Cairo, protest organizers have sought to broaden their movement this week, acknowledging that simple numbers are not enough to force Mr. Mubarak's departure. The government -- by trying to divide the opposition, offering limited concessions and remaining patient -- appears to believe it can weather the biggest challenge to its rule.
Underlining the government's perspective that it has already offered what the protesters demanded, Naguib Sawiris, a wealthy businessman who has sought to act as a mediator, said: ''Tahrir is underestimating their victory. They should declare victory.''
Cairo's chronic traffic jams returned Monday as the city began to adapt to both the sprawling protests in Tahrir Square, a landmark of downtown Cairo, and the tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers who continued to block some streets. Banks again opened their doors, as people lined up outside, and some shops took newspapers down from windows, occasionally near burnt-out vehicles still littering some streets.
The government has sought to cultivate that image of the ordinary, mobilizing its newspapers and television to insist that it was re-exerting control over the capital after its police force utterly collapsed on Jan. 28. The cabinet on Monday held its first formal meeting since Mr. Mubarak reorganized it after the protests.
Officials announced that the stock market, whose index fell nearly 20 percent in two days of protests, would reopen Sunday and that six million government employees would receive a 15 percent raise, which the new finance minister, Samir Radwan, said would take effect in April.
The raise mirrored moves in Kuwait and Jordan to raise salaries or provide grants to stanch anger over rising prices across the Middle East, shaken with the repercussions of Egypt's uprising and the earlier revolt in Tunisia. In Iraq, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said Friday he would cut in half his salary, believed to be $350,000, amid anger there over dreary government services.
As in the past the government here has swerved between crackdown and modest moves of conciliation. In harrowing raids it arrested 30 human rights activists, but released them by Sunday morning. Wael Ghonim, a Google marketing executive and an organizer of the revolt, was freed Monday after disappearing nearly two weeks ago.
In past years the government has managed to at least make its version of events the dominant narrative, but in the outpouring of dissent here that is no longer the case. Fighting still flared in the Sinai Peninsula, where Bedouins, long treated as second-class citizens, have fought Egyptian security forces for weeks.
In scenes Monday that were most remarkable for having become so familiar, tens of thousands returned to Tahrir Square, where a small army of vendors sold cigarettes, coffee and even sweet potatoes wrapped in lists of the demonstrators' demands. Festive drummers arrived to celebrate a wedding just a little way from the scene of tumultuous street battles last week, and a dozen horse-drawn carts, bereft of their usual trade, waited for fares at the end of the Kasr el-Nil Bridge, which leads to the square.
''There are no tourists now, so what are we going to do?'' asked Mohammed Adel, a 38-year-old driver, parked near the square. ''I'm hoping to make a little money here.''
The very joviality has seemed to worry some organizers, who have sought to recapture the initiative from a government determined to wait them out. Protest leaders have called for a general strike on Tuesday as part of a ''Week of Steadfastness.'' They have also considered trying to organize more large-scale demonstrations in other Egyptian cities and acts of civil disobedience like surrounding the state television headquarters, reviled by many protesters for its blatantly misleading portrayal of them.
''The means for escalation are still there,'' said Zyad el-Alawi, a 30-year-old coordinator of the protests. ''The means for driving our movement are still there.''
Some protesters have contended that their very presence in Tahrir Square, where crowds have surged past 100,000 several times, is enough. As long as they remain, the argument goes, the government will have to keep offering them concessions. Others, though, have worried that the tide may be turning against them in the rest of Cairo, punctuated as it is by complaints over a reeling economy and unease over the current uncertainty.
The worry has made even more poignant a song by a late Egyptian icon, Abdel Halim Hafez, that has become an anthem of the protests. ''Oh time, take a picture of us,'' go the lyrics, blaring from speakers set up in Tahrir Square. ''We will grow even closer to each other, and whoever drifts away from the square will never appear in the picture.''
''For a while the tide of fear had turned, but it's started to come back,'' said Mona Rabie, a 28-year-old human rights worker. ''The government has too much muscle. I think the people are going to turn against the protesters. They've already started.''
One activist catalogued in a small notebook the rumors that he had heard about the square when he went beyond the concertina wire: that the protesters had tables piled with free hashish and marijuana; that Islamists had separated the men and women; and that demonstrators were paid by foreigners (50 euros and a meal, goes the story). His favorite was that protesters were distributing poisoned flowers that could kill if touched.
State television has also suggested that protesters had received free fast food.
''Where is my Kentucky Fried Chicken?'' has become a rallying cry in the square.
But to the chagrin of protesters, the rumors have managed to become part of the conversation in Cairo. Though Al Jazeera may be the flagship station of the tumult in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere, Egyptian television remains a powerful instrument of the state, and while it has begun recognizing the protests, it still frames them as seeds of chaos.
''They're still out there!'' said Said Ahmed, a driver stuck in snarled downtown traffic. ''All this time, and I haven't made a penny, not enough for a bite to eat.''
He pulled out 3 Egyptian pounds, nearly 50 cents.
''That's all I've got left in my pocket,'' he declared.
A surge in resentment of foreigners still courses through Cairo, fanned by the Egyptian news media and officials who accused them of being behind the rebellion. While there is an overwhelming consensus on the corruption and ineptitude of the government, along with loathing for the brutality of the Interior Ministry's forces and the ubiquitous police, Mr. Mubarak touched a nerve among some in insisting that he would die in Egypt.
Often heard is the idea that the protesters' demands have been met.
''At this point, the guys in Tahrir Square are talking to themselves and that's it,'' said Mohammed Ahmed, a 32-year-old shop owner. ''It's over. If they stay for 100 years or for one million years, they won't bring any more value to either themselves or to us.''
Not everyone agreed, and even those angry at the scene in Tahrir Square often expressed sympathy with the earlier protests. The uprising itself still generates pride.
''If someone asked me when I was born, I would say Jan. 25,'' Shafei Mahmoud, another storekeeper, said of the first protest. ''Their demands are our demand. If I had money, I would give it to them. They deserve everything good that comes to them.''

HEADLINE: A Seer on Banks Raises a Furor on Bonds

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
If one stock-picker emerged intact from the wreckage of the financial crisis, it was Meredith Whitney. With a prescient warning about bank stocks in 2007 -- as well as a gift for the perfect sound bite -- she became a media darling, celebrated in a Fortune cover article and in frequent television appearances as a market seer.
Until now, that is. These days, Ms. Whitney, 41, finds herself pilloried in the news media and by colleagues for predicting a calamity in municipal bonds. Critics say the call is overstated, but it has alarmed investors in that usually sleepy market.
Ms. Whitney is also drawing scrutiny from Washington, where a Congressional panel will meet on Wednesday to examine the turmoil in the muni bond market, including whether Ms. Whitney's call has fed the volatility and allowed some investors to profit unfairly. 
Citing scheduling conflicts, Ms. Whitney has declined an invitation to appear before the panel of the House Oversight and Government Reform. But the subcommittee's chairman, Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, said that would not dissuade him from investigating her record.
''This isn't a gotcha thing, but she's going to be part of the hearing, whether or not she participates,'' he said. ''If she doesn't want to come forward in a venue like this, that makes a statement.''
Ms. Whitney has not been shy about making statements in the past, whether it was delivering bold predictions about unemployment or dressing up as Paris Hilton for her firm's Halloween party.
But her scathing report on deteriorating state finances in September, followed by an appearance on ''60 Minutes'' in December, has been catnip to her critics.
''There's not a doubt in my mind that you will see a spate of municipal bond defaults,'' she said in the ''60 Minutes'' interview. ''You could see 50 sizable defaults, 50 to 100 sizable defaults, more. This will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of defaults.''
Normally, Wall Street analysts are loath to criticize one another, at least on the record. But since then, even fellow analysts are calling her out for stepping beyond what she knows, bank stocks, into less familiar territory. Others, especially municipal bond market players, have gone on the warpath.
''I've seen a copy of the report, and frankly, I've seen better papers from graduate students in finance,'' said Richard P. Larkin, director of credit analysis at Herbert J. Sims & Company, a municipal bond broker and underwriter. ''It's ludicrous, reckless and irresponsible, and it's being done without any regard for the consequences.''
Investors were pulling money out of municipal bond funds even before Ms. Whitney's appearance on Dec. 19, but in the weeks since, the pace of withdrawals has accelerated, with more than $14 billion coming out between Dec. 22 and Feb. 2.
Ms. Whitney declined to comment for this article. But a number of academics and others who have studied pension, health care and other obligations of states and municipalities say bigger problems loom than just short-term budget deficits that stem from the recession. They see structural problems that may require decisive, painful action in the most indebted places.
But it is Ms. Whitney's contention that hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of defaults could come to pass that has aroused a firestorm.
''Meredith's analysis highlighted problems in the muni market that have been known for years,'' said Josh Rosner, a structured finance analyst at Graham Fisher & Company.
Still, she has gone too far in his view. ''She drove a rush to the exits,'' he said, ''which wasn't about the fundamentals, but about a momentum trade.''
To be sure, few market oracles have been able to repeat the brilliance of their first call. A timely warning shortly before the crash of 1987 made Elaine Garzarelli into a guru, but her star faded after she left her Wall Street perch and started her own firm in 1995. The technology bull Henry Blodget became famous when the tech bubble inflated and infamous after it burst.
Indeed, some fund managers say Ms. Whitney's recent stock picks have not been money-makers. ''She missed the huge recovery in financial stocks after correctly calling the downturn,'' said Michael Scanlon, senior investment analyst at John Hancock Asset Management. ''The history of Wall Street is littered with people who got one big call right.''
Ms. Whitney's latest call has left observers like him puzzled: ''She has no experience in the municipal bond market, so she's got an uphill battle to establish credibility with the experts.''
Plenty of critics howled when she warned of the coming flood in 2007 and told clients to stay away from stocks like Citigroup.
This time, people are listening again, but the critics are also going further, questioning her timing -- and motivation. That is because even as she roils the muni bond market, Ms. Whitney is trying to expand her firm, the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group, and get into the business of rating municipal debt.
''I think it was self-interest to go on prime time to pump up her future business,'' said Matthew McCall, president of the Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm that holds muni bonds. ''We know municipalities are in trouble. To say they will go belly up is uncalled for. She did this purely to market her firm.''
Ms. Whitney has refused to release her September report or provide it to Congressional staff.
Copies have leaked out, however, and as Bloomberg News and Charles Gasparino of Fox Business Network have pointed out, the tone of the report is much more measured than Ms. Whitney herself was in the ''60 Minutes'' appearance.
Not that Ms. Whitney was shy about drawing comparisons between financial problems in the states and the financial collapse that made her famous.
''We believe the financial challenges facing states could be the next systemic risk within the U.S. financial markets,'' she wrote in the report, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. Ms. Whitney also draws comparisons between the risk-taking on Wall Street and the budget practices at many state governments.
In fact, there are important differences between the problems facing states and municipal governments, bad as they may be, and those the banks encountered during the financial crisis.
For starters, states have the power to raise taxes -- something private companies with a shortfall cannot do, Mr. Rosner of Graham Fisher said. They can also try to force concessions from their workers in terms of reduced pay and benefits, in some cases.
Even if municipal issuers run into distress, a financial control board can shield bondholders from a default, as happened recently in Nassau County. These boards usually create a so-called intercept, or a structure that can grab new tax dollars as they come in, before they can go into the locality's general fund. The money goes into a special fund to pay the bondholders their interest and principal, a system that prevents elected officials from spending it on other things.
In cases where financial control boards cannot prevent a default, the bondholders may not notice because the bonds are insured. When Vallejo, Calif., went into Chapter 9 bankruptcy a few years ago, for instance, the bondholders continued to be paid, at least at first, by an insurance company.
Ms. Whitney's defenders say she is doing what she has always done -- provoking investors into asking uncomfortable questions.
''Like you or hate you, if you force investors to think, then you've done your job as an analyst,'' said Richard X. Bove, a banking analyst at Rochdale Securities. ''She's separated herself from the pack and made herself distinctive and unique.''

HEADLINE: DISPARITIES: A Growing Gender Gap in Doctors' Pay

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Starting salaries for women who become physicians are significantly lower than men's, and the pay gap has grown over the past decade, a study reports. 
The pay differential, which was 12.5 percent in 1999, increased to nearly 17 percent by 2008, according to the report, published Thursday in Health Affairs.
The growing gap could not be explained by women's preferences, the authors said. While women on average do choose lower-paying specialties and shorter workweeks than men, those disparities were less pronounced in 2008 than in 1999. Yet the pay differential has widened.
''That was the part that surprised and puzzled us,'' said one author, Anthony T. Lo Sasso, a professor of health policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''As you start moving forward in time closer to the present day, your ability to explain away that difference between men's and women's salaries essentially evaporates.''
The research looked at more than 8,000 new physicians in New York State. In 1999, the women earned $151,600 on average, compared with $173,400 for men; by 2008, the figures were $174,000 for women and $209,300 for men. (The study adjusted for inflation.) After accounting for differences in their practices, the study concluded, the pay gap had increased to $16,819 in 2008, from $3,600 in 1999.

HEADLINE: Social Scientist Sees Bias Within

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
SAN ANTONIO -- Some of the world's pre-eminent experts on bias discovered an unexpected form of it at their annual meeting.
Discrimination is always high on the agenda at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's conference, where psychologists discuss their research on racial prejudice, homophobia, sexism, stereotype threat and unconscious bias against minorities. But the most talked-about speech at this year's meeting, which ended Jan. 30, involved a new ''outgroup.''
It was identified by Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at the University of Virginia who studies the intuitive foundations of morality and ideology. He polled his audience at the San Antonio Convention Center, starting by asking how many considered themselves politically liberal. A sea of hands appeared, and Dr. Haidt estimated that liberals made up 80 percent of the 1,000 psychologists in the ballroom. When he asked for centrists and libertarians, he spotted fewer than three dozen hands. And then, when he asked for conservatives, he counted a grand total of three. 
''This is a statistically impossible lack of diversity,'' Dr. Haidt concluded, noting polls showing that 40 percent of Americans are conservative and 20 percent are liberal. In his speech and in an interview, Dr. Haidt argued that social psychologists are a ''tribal-moral community'' united by ''sacred values'' that hinder research and damage their credibility -- and blind them to the hostile climate they've created for non-liberals.
''Anywhere in the world that social psychologists see women or minorities underrepresented by a factor of two or three, our minds jump to discrimination as the explanation,'' said Dr. Haidt, who called himself a longtime liberal turned centrist. ''But when we find out that conservatives are underrepresented among us by a factor of more than 100, suddenly everyone finds it quite easy to generate alternate explanations.''
Dr. Haidt (pronounced height) told the audience that he had been corresponding with a couple of non-liberal graduate students in social psychology whose experiences reminded him of closeted gay students in the 1980s. He quoted -- anonymously -- from their e-mails describing how they hid their feelings when colleagues made political small talk and jokes predicated on the assumption that everyone was a liberal.
''I consider myself very middle-of-the-road politically: a social liberal but fiscal conservative. Nonetheless, I avoid the topic of politics around work,'' one student wrote. ''Given what I've read of the literature, I am certain any research I conducted in political psychology would provide contrary findings and, therefore, go unpublished. Although I think I could make a substantial contribution to the knowledge base, and would be excited to do so, I will not.''
The politics of the professoriate has been studied by the economists Christopher Cardiff and Daniel Klein and the sociologists Neil Gross and Solon Simmons. They've independently found that Democrats typically outnumber Republicans at elite universities by at least six to one among the general faculty, and by higher ratios in the humanities and social sciences. In a 2007 study of both elite and non-elite universities, Dr. Gross and Dr. Simmons reported that nearly 80 percent of psychology professors are Democrats, outnumbering Republicans by nearly 12 to 1.
The fields of psychology, sociology and anthropology have long attracted liberals, but they became more exclusive after the 1960s, according to Dr. Haidt. ''The fight for civil rights and against racism became the sacred cause unifying the left throughout American society, and within the academy,'' he said, arguing that this shared morality both ''binds and blinds.''
''If a group circles around sacred values, they will evolve into a tribal-moral community,'' he said. ''They'll embrace science whenever it supports their sacred values, but they'll ditch it or distort it as soon as it threatens a sacred value.'' It's easy for social scientists to observe this process in other communities, like the fundamentalist Christians who embrace ''intelligent design'' while rejecting Darwinism. But academics can be selective, too, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan found in 1965 when he warned about the rise of unmarried parenthood and welfare dependency among blacks -- violating the taboo against criticizing victims of racism.
''Moynihan was shunned by many of his colleagues at Harvard as racist,'' Dr. Haidt said. ''Open-minded inquiry into the problems of the black family was shut down for decades, precisely the decades in which it was most urgently needed. Only in the last few years have liberal sociologists begun to acknowledge that Moynihan was right all along.''
Similarly, Larry Summers, then president of Harvard, was ostracized in 2005 for wondering publicly whether the preponderance of male professors in some top math and science departments might be due partly to the larger variance in I.Q. scores among men (meaning there are more men at the very high and very low ends). ''This was not a permissible hypothesis,'' Dr. Haidt said. ''It blamed the victims rather than the powerful. The outrage ultimately led to his resignation. We psychologists should have been outraged by the outrage. We should have defended his right to think freely.''
Instead, the taboo against discussing sex differences was reinforced, so universities and the National Science Foundation went on spending tens of millions of dollars on research and programs based on the assumption that female scientists faced discrimination and various forms of unconscious bias. But that assumption has been repeatedly contradicted, most recently in a study published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by two Cornell psychologists, Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams. After reviewing two decades of research, they report that a woman in academic science typically fares as well as, if not better than, a comparable man when it comes to being interviewed, hired, promoted, financed and published.
''Thus,'' they conclude, ''the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort. Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past.'' Instead of presuming discrimination in science or expecting the sexes to show equal interest in every discipline, the Cornell researchers say, universities should make it easier for women in any field to combine scholarship with family responsibilities.
Can social scientists open up to outsiders' ideas? Dr. Haidt was optimistic enough to title his speech ''The Bright Future of Post-Partisan Social Psychology,'' urging his colleagues to focus on shared science rather than shared moral values. To overcome taboos, he advised them to subscribe to National Review and to read Thomas Sowell's ''A Conflict of Visions.''
For a tribal-moral community, the social psychologists in Dr. Haidt's audience seemed refreshingly receptive to his argument. Some said he overstated how liberal the field is, but many agreed it should welcome more ideological diversity. A few even endorsed his call for a new affirmative-action goal: a membership that's 10 percent conservative by 2020. The society's executive committee didn't endorse Dr. Haidt's numerical goal, but it did vote to put a statement on the group's home page welcoming psychologists with ''diverse perspectives.'' It also made a change on the ''Diversity Initiatives'' page -- a two-letter correction of what it called a grammatical glitch, although others might see it as more of a Freudian slip.
In the old version, the society announced that special funds to pay for travel to the annual meeting were available to students belonging to ''underrepresented groups (i.e., ethnic or racial minorities, first-generation college students, individuals with a physical disability, and/or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered students).''
As Dr. Haidt noted in his speech, the ''i.e.'' implied that this was the exclusive, sacred list of ''underrepresented groups.'' The society took his suggestion to substitute ''e.g.'' -- a change that leaves it open to other groups, too. Maybe, someday, even to conservatives.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the Findings column on Tuesday, about political bias among social scientists, omitted the last four words of a sentence that countered the notion that female scientists face discrimination and various forms of unconscious bias. The sentence should have read: But that assumption has been repeatedly contradicted, most recently in a study published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by two Cornell psychologists, Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams.

HEADLINE: On Health Care, Justice Will Prevail

BYLINE: By LAURENCE H. TRIBE. 
Laurence H. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, is the author of ''The Invisible Constitution.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
THE lawsuits challenging the individual mandate in the health care law, including one in which a federal district judge last week called the law unconstitutional, will ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court, and pundits are already making bets on how the justices will vote.
But the predictions of a partisan 5-4 split rest on a misunderstanding of the court and the Constitution. The constitutionality of the health care law is not one of those novel, one-off issues, like the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, that have at times created the impression of Supreme Court justices as political actors rather than legal analysts. 
Since the New Deal, the court has consistently held that Congress has broad constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. This includes authority over not just goods moving across state lines, but also the economic choices of individuals within states that have significant effects on interstate markets. By that standard, this law's constitutionality is open and shut. Does anyone doubt that the multitrillion-dollar health insurance industry is an interstate market that Congress has the power to regulate?
Many new provisions in the law, like the ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, are also undeniably permissible. But they would be undermined if healthy or risk-prone individuals could opt out of insurance, which could lead to unacceptably high premiums for those remaining in the pool. For the system to work, all individuals -- healthy and sick, risk-prone and risk-averse -- must participate to the extent of their economic ability.
In this regard, the health care law is little different from Social Security. The court unanimously recognized in 1982 that it would be ''difficult, if not impossible'' to maintain the financial soundness of a Social Security system from which people could opt out. The same analysis holds here: by restricting certain economic choices of individuals, we ensure the vitality of a regulatory regime clearly within Congress's power to establish.
The justices aren't likely to be misled by the reasoning that prompted two of the four federal courts that have ruled on this legislation to invalidate it on the theory that Congress is entitled to regulate only economic ''activity,'' not ''inactivity,'' like the decision not to purchase insurance. This distinction is illusory. Individuals who don't purchase insurance they can afford have made a choice to take a free ride on the health care system. They know that if they need emergency-room care that they can't pay for, the public will pick up the tab. This conscious choice carries serious economic consequences for the national health care market, which makes it a proper subject for federal regulation.
Even if the interstate commerce clause did not suffice to uphold mandatory insurance, the even broader power of Congress to impose taxes would surely do so. After all, the individual mandate is enforced through taxation, even if supporters have been reluctant to point that out.
Given the clear case for the law's constitutionality, it's distressing that many assume its fate will be decided by a partisan, closely divided Supreme Court. Justice Antonin Scalia, whom some count as a certain vote against the law, upheld in 2005 Congress's power to punish those growing marijuana for their own medical use; a ban on homegrown marijuana, he reasoned, might be deemed ''necessary and proper'' to effectively enforce broader federal regulation of nationwide drug markets. To imagine Justice Scalia would abandon that fundamental understanding of the Constitution's necessary and proper clause because he was appointed by a Republican president is to insult both his intellect and his integrity.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom many unfairly caricature as the ''swing vote,'' deserves better as well. Yes, his opinion in the 5-4 decision invalidating the federal ban on possession of guns near schools is frequently cited by opponents of the health care law. But that decision in 1995 drew a bright line between commercial choices, all of which Congress has presumptive power to regulate, and conduct like gun possession that is not in itself ''commercial'' or ''economic,'' however likely it might be to set off a cascade of economic effects. The decision about how to pay for health care is a quintessentially commercial choice in itself, not merely a decision that might have economic consequences.
Only a crude prediction that justices will vote based on politics rather than principle would lead anybody to imagine that Chief Justice John Roberts or Justice Samuel Alito would agree with the judges in Florida and Virginia who have ruled against the health care law. Those judges made the confused assertion that what is at stake here is a matter of personal liberty -- the right not to purchase what one wishes not to purchase -- rather than the reach of national legislative power in a world where no man is an island.
It would be asking a lot to expect conservative jurists to smuggle into the commerce clause an unenumerated federal ''right'' to opt out of the social contract. If Justice Clarence Thomas can be counted a nearly sure vote against the health care law, the only reason is that he alone has publicly and repeatedly stressed his principled disagreement with the whole line of post-1937 cases that interpret Congress's commerce power broadly.
There is every reason to believe that a strong, nonpartisan majority of justices will do their constitutional duty, set aside how they might have voted had they been members of Congress and treat this constitutional challenge for what it is -- a political objection in legal garb.

HEADLINE: Expensive Prisons

 BODY:
In the last decade, crime rates and the prison population have declined significantly in New York State. Yet prison costs have soared. As part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's search for ways to cut spending, his new budget proposes two sensible steps toward the long overdue goal of closing down unnecessary prisons. 
First, he promises to create a task force to identify which prisons could most efficiently be shut down. If the commission fails to act -- and it will certainly come under strong political pressure not to from local politicians and unions -- the decision would fall to the commissioner of corrections.
Second, he asks the Legislature to repeal a law that requires the state to provide a 12-month notice before closing a prison. Until that happens, the state will be required to keep empty prisons staffed for as long as a year before shuttering them.
The case for closures is clearly laid out in the governor's executive budget. It notes that the inmate population has dropped from a peak of about 71,600 in 1999 to about 56,000 today. Nevertheless, the corrections budget has risen from $2.3 billion in 2000 to $2.8 billion today.
Given the decline in the number of inmates, the state should find it easy to close or downsize several of its 67 prison units without compromising its ability to handle an unanticipated increase in the population.
An analysis by the corrections department shows a particularly large number of vacancies in minimum- and medium-security prisons for women, with occupancy rates of 57 percent and 66 percent, respectively. These prisons, too, could be expeditiously consolidated, saving hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the decade.
The state should also look closely at maximum-security prisons, which tend to be larger, more intensively staffed and, thus, more expensive. Though some of these facilities have high-occupancy rates, the evidence suggests that low-risk offenders who were assigned to them could be safely and less-expensively housed in lower-security institutions.
Local lawmakers traditionally have opposed closing or downsizing prisons because they fear a loss of jobs. To ease those fears, Mr. Cuomo proposes a $100 million economic redevelopment fund that, among other things, could be invested in retrofitting empty prisons for commercial use. The administration will face resistance from the prison workers' unions that have great power in the State Legislature. Mr. Cuomo's goals are worthy, but he'll have to press hard to reach them.

HEADLINE: A Terrible Divide

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The Ronald Reagan crowd loved to talk about morning in America. For millions of individuals and families, perhaps the majority, it's more like twilight -- with nighttime coming on fast.
Look out the window. More and more Americans are being left behind in an economy that is being divided ever more starkly between the haves and the have-nots. Not only are millions of people jobless and millions more underemployed, but more and more of the so-called fringe benefits and public services that help make life livable, or even bearable, in a modern society are being put to the torch.
Employer-based pensions, paid vacations, health benefits and the like are going the way of phone booths and VCRs. As poverty increases and reliable employment becomes less and less the norm, the dwindling number of workers with any sort of job security or guaranteed pensions (think teachers and other modestly compensated public employees) are being viewed with increasing contempt. How dare they enjoy a modicum of economic comfort? 
It turns out that a lot of those jobs were never so secure, after all. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tells us:
''At least 44 states and the District of Columbia have reduced overall wages paid to state workers by laying off workers, requiring them to take unpaid leave (furloughs), freezing hew hires, or similar actions. State and local governments have eliminated 407,000 jobs since August 2008, federal data show.''
We have not faced up to the scale of the economic crisis that still confronts the United States.
Standards of living for the people on the wrong side of the economic divide are being ratcheted lower and will remain that way for many years to come. Forget the fairy tales being spun by politicians in both parties -- that somehow they can impose service cuts that are drastic enough to bring federal and local budgets into balance while at the same time developing economic growth strong enough to support a robust middle class. It would take a Bernie Madoff to do that.
In the real world, schools and libraries are being closed and other educational services are being curtailed. Police officers are being fired. Access to health services for poor families is being restricted. ''At least 29 states and the District of Columbia,'' according to the budget center, ''are cutting medical, rehabilitative, home care, or other services needed by low-income people who are elderly or have disabilities, or are significantly increasing the cost of these services.''
For a variety of reasons, there are not enough tax revenues being generated to pay for the basic public services that one would expect in an advanced country like the United States. The rich are not shouldering their fair share of the tax burden. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue to consume an insane amount of revenue. And there are not enough jobs available at decent enough pay to ease some of the demand for public services while at the same time increasing the amount of taxes paid by ordinary workers.
The U.S. cannot cut its way out of this crisis. Instead of trying to figure out how to keep 4-year-olds out of pre-kindergarten classes, or how to withhold life-saving treatments from Medicaid recipients, or how to cheat the elderly out of their Social Security, the nation's leaders should be trying seriously to figure out what to do about the future of the American work force.
Enormous numbers of workers are in grave danger of being left behind permanently. Businesses have figured out how to prosper without putting the unemployed back to work in jobs that pay well and offer decent benefits.
Corporate profits and the stock markets are way up. Businesses are sitting atop mountains of cash. Put people back to work? Forget about it. Has anyone bothered to notice that much of those profits are the result of aggressive payroll-cutting -- companies making do with fewer, less well-paid and harder-working employees?
For American corporations, the action is increasingly elsewhere. Their interests are not the same as those of workers, or the country as a whole. As Harold Meyerson put it in The American Prospect: ''Our corporations don't need us anymore. Half their revenues come from abroad. Their products, increasingly, come from abroad as well.''
American workers are in a world of hurt. Anyone who thinks that politicians can improve this sorry state of affairs by hacking away at Social Security, Medicare and the public schools are great candidates for involuntary commitment.
New ideas on a grand scale are needed. The United States can't thrive with so many of its citizens condemned to shrunken standards of living because they can't find adequate employment. Long-term joblessness is a recipe for societal destabilization. It should not be tolerated in a country with as much wealth as the United States. It's destructive, and it's wrong.

HEADLINE: The Apollo, Uptown's Showbiz Incubator

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The exhibition ''Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,'' which opens on Tuesday at the Museum of the City of New York, really ain't anything like the real thing, but that is not really its fault. The ''real thing'' in this case is almost beyond the reach of a museum show. It is to be found not in Louis Armstrong's trumpet or Miles Davis's flugelhorn, or James Brown's black jumpsuit studded with rhinestones spelling ''Sex,'' or Ella Fitzgerald's orange dress or Michael Jackson's fedora (all of which are on display here), but in the music those performers made while wearing these clothes and playing these instruments.
The real thing is suggested in the exhibition's subtitle -- ''How the Apollo Theater Shaped American Entertainment'' -- because the music that was made at that relatively nondescript 1,500-seat theater on 125th Street in Harlem really did transform American popular-music culture in the 20th century. A habitat and an incubator, the Apollo has also been one of the few institutions in which black American musical culture was consistently nurtured over the course of 75 years. 
Carnegie Hall achieved its stature through architectural beauty; its warm, revealing acoustics; and a growing heritage of magnificent performances. The Apollo achieved its stature because of where it is -- on the edge of one of America's great black urban neighborhoods -- and because of who appeared there during an era that went from vaudeville to hip-hop, from racial segregation to economic gentrification.
The Apollo heritage is evident even in simple lists, one of which appears at this exhibition: the stars who began their careers as winners of Amateur Night, one of the Apollo's traditions that continues to this day. They include Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, Sarah Vaughan, the Chantels, the Isley Brothers, Leslie Uggams, Jimi Hendrix, the Jackson 5, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, and Stephanie Mills.
It is also evident in the roster of performers who appeared at the Apollo, which, apart from those already mentioned, includes Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Pearl Bailey, Dizzy Gillespie, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, the Supremes and comedians like Richard Pryor, all of whom are celebrated in a rich pictorial catalog published in conjunction with the show.
Or perhaps too in a list of musical styles associated with Apollo performances that appears on the walls of the gallery: swing, jazz, bebop, salsa, gospel, rock 'n' roll, Motown, funk, soul, reggae, rap ... and on.
No wonder that the Smithsonian's nascent National Museum of African American History and Culture chose this subject for this show, one of its first traveling exhibitions, offering, in cooperation with the Apollo, an anticipatory prelude to the kind of material the museum itself will incorporate after the exhibition's scheduled opening in Washington in 2015. This show -- its curators are Tuliza Fleming of the new museum's staff, and Guthrie P. Ramsey Jr., a professor at the University of Pennsylvania -- walks us through the history of Harlem, the Apollo and these entertainments.
The artifacts -- mostly the outer trappings of stars -- are at the exhibition's center, while wall panels tell the story. It begins during the Harlem Renaissance, continues through the theater's glory years when it was owned and managed by members of the Schiffman family and extends to the present when the theater is run by a nonprofit foundation.
So much is encompassed, though, that you can easily feel that the real thing is slipping away. One problem is that concerts at the Apollo were not systematically recorded, and while the exhibition offers a decade-by-decade film survey of performers, each contains just a few examples that are neither long enough nor deep enough to communicate much.
It can be enticing to read descriptions of the variety shows of the 1930s. (''Milton Berle came so often,'' Ralph Cooper, one of the theater's mainstays, is quoted as saying, ''he started to bring his secretary along to take notes on what we were doing.'') And the catalog cites Lionel Hampton in the 1940s: ''If you were a black entertainer of any kind -- musician, singer, comedian -- being a headliner at the Apollo was your proudest achievement.'' But the media offerings don't give us enough of a sense of those achievements.
There are particular objects that do bring home aspects of the Apollo heritage. We see black-face minstrel makeup and a tight-fitting wig of nappy hair used not only in vaudeville but also by black performers into the 1950s -- a sad indication of how long and deep the traditions of racial caricature ran. Seeing the tap shoes Sammy Davis Jr. wore as a child or Pearl Bailey's travel trunk also gives us a sense of the physical life of these performers during the years when black culture was gradually merging into the American mainstream.
There is a sampling of index cards on which the theater's owner, Frank Schiffman, tersely kept records of artist fees along with comments on the acts. (The cards are part of the Smithsonian American History collection.) He writes about Fats Domino in 1958 (the fee was $10,000): ''Business poor. He is undoubtedly one of the great figures in R&B.'' Two years later the fee being the same: ''Well received. Overpaid.'' Or on a card for Bailey in 1965 (fee of $15,000): ''Has audience in her hands from start to finish. Excellent!!!''
Schiffman's management and, later, that of his sons, Bobby and Jack, preserved a delicate balance, keeping fees low so ticket prices could be low and the Apollo could thrive as a neighborhood theater. Racial divisions on one side of the theater doors may have encouraged a sense of pride and interdependence on the other, leading to excellent performances. The Apollo's long tradition of Amateur Nights in which the crowd cheered or jeered various aspirants may have even led to a sense of audience proprietorship.
There is surprisingly little notice taken of a crisis in the Apollo tradition beginning in the late 1960s, but the catalog is clearer. Race riots hobbled 125th Street's night life; black artists began to be booked in larger mainstream theaters; costs and fees rose; a catalog essay by Amiri Baraka recalls objections raised to a ''white-owned theater in Harlem.'' By the mid-'70s the theater could not continue. In the '80s, after Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough president, had taken it over, along with other investors, the theater was losing about $2 million a year.
Run by a nonprofit foundation since 1991, the Apollo remains a neighborhood symbol. After Michael Jackson's death in 2009, a spontaneous tribute to him developed outside the theater. After James Brown's death in 2006 his body lay in state on the Apollo stage.
So where is the real thing?
Try this: After seeing the exhibition, go to Amateur Night one Wednesday at the Apollo. The audience is part of the show. ''You have the power,'' the sound system proclaims, urging listeners to cheer and boo each performance. ''Be good or be gone!'' is the message the audience is told to give. Booing can call forth the Executioner -- a theater jester who dances the awful act offstage -- while cheering ultimately chooses the winners.
In some ways the evening has to be a shadow of earlier eras' competitions. The amplification is so exaggerated it would have blown half the performers from the theater's golden age off the stage (and overshadowed any of the nuances familiar on recordings). On the night I went the claques were so fervent that verdicts were distorted. A woman who managed a decent invocation of Aretha Franklin justifiably won, but an oddly interesting ventriloquist was nearly howled off, and a few talentless performers won ecstatic plaudits.
But that's the point, isn't it? Populism is the dominant force here, and for decades it went hand in hand with excellence. Racial prejudice and insularity combined with genius to shape an unusually powerful tradition of musical and theatrical innovation. That tradition has weakened, but the spirit is still infectious. (And a small-scale Apollo Music Cafe is to open Friday in the theater's building.) So while I wanted more from the exhibition, I'll be returning to the Apollo, hoping next time to hear the real thing.
''Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing'' is on view through May 1 at the Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street; mcny.org.

HEADLINE: Obama's Remarks at the Chamber of Commerce

 BODY:
Following is a text of President Obama's speech given to members of the Chamber of Commerce on Monday, as released by the White House:
Thank you very much. Please, have a seat. Thank you very much, Tom, for the gracious introduction. I want to make a few other acknowledgments. To Tom Bell, the Chamber Board President, thank you for helping to organize this. There are some members of my administration I want to make sure are introduced. My Chief of Staff, Bill Daley, is here. (Applause.) Senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, who is interfacing with many of you and has gotten terrific advice from many of you, is here as well. Secretary Ray LaHood, our Transportation Secretary. Ambassador Ron Kirk, who is working hard to get trade deals around the world. Our Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills. My director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, is here. And I also want to make mention, Fred Hochberg, our Export-Import Bank Chairman; Elizabeth Littlefield, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation President. And I also want to acknowledge a good friend, Paul Volcker, the outgoing chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.) 
Now, Tom, it is good to be here today at the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here in the interest of being more neighborly. (Laughter.) I strolled over from across the street, and look, maybe if we had brought over a fruitcake when I first moved in, we would have gotten off to a better start. (Laughter.) But I'm going to make up for it.
The truth is, this isn't the first time I've been to the Chamber, or the first time that we've exchanged ideas. Over the last two years, I've sought advice from many of you as we were grappling with the worst recession most of us have ever known. It's a recession that led to some very difficult decisions. For many of you, that meant restructuring and branch closings and layoffs that I know were very painful to make. For my administration, it meant a series of emergency measures that I would not have undertaken under normal circumstances, but that were necessary to stop our economy from falling off a cliff.
Now, on some issues, like the Recovery Act, we've found common cause. On other issues, we've had some pretty strong disagreements. But I'm here today because I am convinced, as Tom mentioned in his introduction, that we can and we must work together. Whatever differences we may have, I know that all of us share a deep, abiding belief in this country, a belief in our people, a belief in the principles that have made America's economy the envy of the world.
America's success didn't happen overnight, and it didn't happen by accident. It happened because [of] the freedom that has allowed good ideas to flourish, that has allowed capitalism to thrive; it happened because of the conviction that in this country hard work should be rewarded and that opportunity should be there for anybody who's willing to reach for it. And because it happened at every juncture in our history -- not just once, not just twice, but over and over again -- we came together to remake ourselves; we came together as one nation and did what was necessary to win the future. That is why I am so confident that we will win the future again.
That's the challenge that we face today. We still have, by far, the world's largest and most vibrant economy. We have the most productive workers, the finest universities and the freest markets. The men and women in this room are living testimony that American industry is still the source of the most dynamic companies, and the most ingenious entrepreneurs.
But we also know that with the march of technology over the last few decades, the competition for jobs and businesses has grown fierce. The globalization of our economy means that businesses can now open up a shop, employ workers and produce their goods wherever an Internet connection exists. Tasks that were once done by 1,000 workers can now be done by 100 or in some cases even 10. And the truth is, as countries like China and India and Brazil grow and develop larger middle classes, it's profitable for global companies to aggressively pursue these markets and, at times, to set up facilities in these countries.
These forces are as unstoppable as they are powerful. But combined with a brutal and devastating recession, these forces have also shaken the faith of the American people -- in the institutions of business and government. They see a widening chasm of wealth and opportunity in this country, and they wonder if the American Dream is slipping away.
They wonder if the middle class, rather than expanding as it has through our lifetimes, is in the midst of an inexorable contraction. And we can't ignore these concerns. We have to renew people's faith in the promise of this country - that this is a place where you can make it if you try. And we have to do this together: business and government; workers and CEOs; Democrats and Republicans.
We know what it will take for America to win the future. We need to out-innovate, we need to out-educate, we need to out-build our competitors. We need an economy that's based not on what we consume and borrow from other nations, but what we make and what we sell around the world. We need to make America the best place on Earth to do business.
And this is a job for all of us. As a government, we will help lay the foundation for you to grow and innovate and succeed. We will upgrade our transportation and communication networks so you can move goods and information more quickly and more cheaply. We'll invest in education so that you can hire the most skilled, talented workers in the world. And we'll work to knock down barriers that make it harder for you to compete, from the tax code to the regulatory system.
But I want to be clear: Even as we make America the best place on Earth to do business, businesses also have a responsibility to America.
I understand the challenges you face. I understand you are under incredible pressure to cut costs and keep your margins up. I understand the significance of your obligations to your shareholders and the pressures that are created by quarterly reports. I get it.
But as we work with you to make America a better place to do business, I'm hoping that all of you are thinking what you can do for America. Ask yourselves what you can do to hire more American workers, what you can do to support the American economy and invest in this nation. That's what I want to talk about today - the responsibilities we all have -- the mutual responsibilities we have -- to secure the future that we all share.
Now, as a country, we have a responsibility to encourage American innovation. I talked about this quite a bit at my State of the Union.
Companies like yours have always driven the discovery of new products and new ideas. You do it better than anybody. But what you also know is that it's not always profitable to -- in the short-term, at least -- for you to invest in basic research. It's very expensive, and the payoffs are not always clear and they're not always localized. And that's why government has traditionally helped invest in this kind of science, planting the seeds that ultimately grew into technologies from the computer chips to the Internet.
That's why we're making investments today in the next generation of big ideas - in biotechnology, in information technology and in clean energy technology. We're reforming our patent system so innovations can move more quickly to market. Steve Case is heading up a new partnership called Startup America to help entrepreneurs turn new ideas into new businesses and new jobs. And I've also proposed a bigger, permanent tax credit for all the research and development your companies do in this country. I believe that is a priority.
We also have a responsibility as a nation to provide our people with -- and our businesses -- with the fastest, most reliable way to move goods and information. The costs to business from outdated and inadequate infrastructure is enormous. And that's what we have right now -- outdated, inadequate infrastructure.
And any of you that have been traveling to other countries, you know it, you see it, and it affects your bottom lines. That's why I want to put more people to work rebuilding crumbling roads, rebuilding our bridges. That's why I've proposed connecting 80 percent of the country with high-speed -- to high-speed rail, and making it possible for companies to put high-speed Internet coverage in the reach of virtually all Americans.
You understand the importance of this. The fact is, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO don't agree on a whole lot. Tom Donohue and Richard Trumka are not Facebook friends. (Laughter.) Well, maybe -- I don't think you are anyway. (Laughter.) I didn't check on this, but -- but they agree on the need to build a 21st-century infrastructure. And I want to thank the Chamber for pushing Congress to make more infrastructure investments, and to do so in the most cost-effective way possible: with tax dollars that leverage private capital, and with projects that are determined not by politics, but by what's best for our economy.
Third responsibility that we have as a nation is to invest in the skills and education of our young people. If we expect companies to do business and hire in America, America needs a pool of trained, talented workers that can out-compete anybody in the world. And that's why we're reforming K-12 education; that's why we're training 100,000 new math and science teachers; that's why we're making college more affordable, and revitalizing our community college system.
Recently I visited GE in Schenectady, which has partnered with a local community college. And while students train for jobs available at the nearby GE plant, they earn a paycheck and they've got their tuition covered. And as a result, young people can find work, GE can fill high-skill positions, and the entire region has become more attractive to businesses. It's a win-win for everybody, and it's something we're trying to duplicate across the country.
Now, to make room for these investments in education, in innovation, in infrastructure, government also has a responsibility to cut spending that we just can't afford. That's why I've promised to veto any bill that's larded up with earmarks. That's why I've proposed that we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. Understand what this means. This would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and bring this spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- down to the lowest share of our economy since Eisenhower was president. That was a long time ago.
Now, it's not going to be enough. We're going to have to do more. Because the driving force on our deficits are entitlements spending. And that's going to require both parties to work together, because those are some tough problems that we're going to have to solve. And I am eager to work with both parties and with the Chamber to take additional steps across the budget to put our nation on a sounder fiscal footing.
By stopping spending on things we don't need, we can make investments in the things that we do need, the same way families do. If they've got a fiscal problem, if they've got to tighten their belt, they don't stop paying for Johnny to go to college. They cut out things they don't need, but they still make investments in the thing that are going to make sure we win the future. And that's what we have to do as a country: make some smart choices -- tough choices, but smart ones.
Now, in addition to making government more affordable, we're also making it more effective and more consumer-friendly. We're trying to run the government a little bit more like you run your business -- with better technology and faster services. So in the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. And we want to start with the 12 different agencies that deal with America's exports. If we hope to help our businesses sell more goods around the world, we should ensure we're all pulling in the same direction. And frankly, with 12 different agencies in charge, nobody is in charge. So we're going to fix that as an example of how we can make a government that's more responsive to the American people and to American businesses.
Which brings me to the final responsibility of government: breaking down some of the barriers that stand in the way of your success. As far as exports are concerned, that means seeking new opportunities and opening new markets for your goods. And I will tell you I will go anywhere anytime to be a booster for American businesses, American workers and American products. We recently signed -- (applause) -- and I don't charge a commission. (Laughter.)
We recently signed export deals with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. We finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. And by the way, it's a deal that has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans. That's the kind of deal that I will be looking for as we pursue trade agreements with Panama and Colombia, as we work to bring Russia into the international trading system. Those are going to be our top priorities because we believe Americans have the best products and the best businesses, and if we're out there selling and we're out there hustling, there's no reason why we can't do a lot better than we're doing right now when it comes to our exports.
Now, another barrier government can remove -- and I hear a lot about this from many of you -- is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world. You know how it goes: because of various loopholes and carve-outs that have built up over the years, some industries pay an average rate that is four or five times higher than others. Companies are taxed heavily for making investments with equity, yet the tax code actually pays companies to invest using leverage. As a result, you've got too many companies ending up making decisions based on what their tax director says instead of what their engineer designs or what their factories produce. And that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage. We need something smarter, something simpler, something fairer. That's why I want to lower the corporate rate and eliminate these loopholes to pay for it, so that it doesn't add a dime to our deficit. And I'm asking for your help in this fight. I think it can be done.
Which brings me to the last barriers we're trying to remove, and those are outdated and unnecessary regulations. I've ordered a government-wide review, and if there are rules on the books that are needlessly stifling job creation and economic growth, we will fix them.
Already we're dramatically cutting down on the paperwork that saddles businesses with huge administrative costs. We're improving the way FDA evaluates things like medical devices, to get innovative and lifesaving treatments to market faster. And the EPA, based on the need for further scientific analysis, delayed the greenhouse gas permitting rules for biomass.
I've also ordered agencies to find ways to make regulations more flexible for small businesses. And we've turned a tangle of fuel economy regulations and pending lawsuits into a single standard that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, save consumers money at the pump and give car companies the certainty that they need -- all negotiated by the various stakeholders without the need for congressional legislation.
But ultimately, winning the future is not just about what the government can do for you to succeed. It's also about what you can do to help America succeed.
So we were just talking about regulations. Even as we eliminate burdensome regulations, America's businesses have a responsibility as well to recognize that there are some basic safeguards, some basic standards that are necessary to protect the American people from harm or exploitation. Not every regulation is bad. Not every regulation is burdensome on business. A lot of the regulations that are out there are things that all of us welcome in our lives.
Few of us would want to live in a society without rules that keep our air and water clean; that give consumers the confidence to do everything from investing in financial markets to buying groceries. And the fact is, when standards like these have been proposed in the past, opponents have often warned that they would be an assault on business and free enterprise. We can look at the history in this country. Early drug companies argued the bill creating the FDA would ''practically destroy the sale of remedies in the United States.'' That didn't happen. Auto executives predicted that having to install seatbelts would bring the downfall of their industry. It didn't happen. The President of the American Bar Association denounced child labor laws as ''a communistic effort to nationalize children.'' That's a quote.
None of these things came to pass. In fact, companies adapt and standards often spark competition and innovation. I was travelling when I went up to Penn State to look at some clean energy hubs that have been set up. I was with Steve Chu, my Secretary of Energy. And he won a Nobel Prize in physics, so when you're in conversations with him you catch about one out of every four things he says. (Laughter.)
But he started talking about energy efficiency and about refrigerators, and he pointed out that the government set modest targets a couple decades ago to start increasing efficiency over time. They were well thought through; they weren't radical. Companies competed to hit these markers. And they hit them every time, and then exceeded them. And as a result, a typical fridge now costs half as much and uses a quarter of the energy that it once did -- and you don't have to defrost, chipping at that stuff -- (laughter) -- and then putting the warm water inside the freezer and all that stuff. It saves families and businesses billions of dollars.
So regulations didn't destroy the industry; it enhanced it and it made our lives better -- if they're smart, if they're well designed. And that's our goal, is to work with you to think through how do we design necessary regulations in a smart way and get rid of regulations that have outlived their usefulness, or don't work.
I also have to point out the perils of too much regulation are also matched by the dangers of too little. And we saw that in the financial crisis, where the absence of sound rules of the road, that wasn't good for business. Even if you weren't in the financial sector it wasn't good for business. And that's why, with the help of Paul Volcker, who is here today, we passed a set of common-sense reforms.
The same can be said of health insurance reform. We simply could not continue to accept a status quo that's made our entire economy less competitive, as we've paid more per person for health care than any other nation on Earth. Nobody is even close. And we couldn't accept a broken system where insurance companies could drop people because they got sick, or families went into bankruptcy because of medical bills.
I know that folks here have concerns about this law. And I understand it. If you're running a business right now and you're seeing these escalating health care costs, your instinct is if I've got even more laws on top of me, that's going to increase my costs even more. I understand that suspicion, that skepticism.
But the non-partisan congressional watchdogs at the CBO estimate that health care tax credits will be worth nearly $40 billion for small businesses over the next decade -- $40 billion, directly to small businesses who are doing the right thing by their employees.
And experts - not just from the government, but also those commissioned by the Business Roundtable - suggest that health insurance reform could ultimately save large employers anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 per family -- your employees and your bottom line.
I've said in the State of the Union and I'll repeat here today: I am willing and happy to look at other ideas to improve the law, including incentives to improve patient safety and medical malpractice reforms. And I want to correct a flaw that's already placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on too many small businesses, and I appreciate the Chamber's help in doing that.
But we have to recognize that some common-sense regulations often will make sense for your businesses, as well as your families, as well as your neighbors, as well as your coworkers. Of course, your responsibility goes beyond recognizing the need for certain standards and safeguards. If we're fighting to reform the tax code and increase exports to help you compete, the benefits can't just translate into greater profits and bonuses for those at the top. They have to be shared by American workers, who need to know that expanding trade and opening markets will lift their standards of living as well as your bottom line.
We can't go back to the kind of economy and culture that we saw in the years leading up to the recession, where growth and gains in productivity just didn't translate into rising incomes and opportunity for the middle class. That's not something necessarily we can legislate, but it's something that all of us have to take responsibility for thinking about. How do we make sure that everybody's got a stake in trade, everybody's got a stake in increasing exports, everybody's got a stake in rising productivity? Because ordinary folks end up seeing their standards of living rise as well. That's always been the American promise. That's what JFK meant when he said, ''A rising tide lifts all boats.'' Too many boats have been left behind, stuck in the mud.
And if we as a nation are going to invest in innovation, that innovation should lead to new jobs and manufacturing on our shores. The end result of tax breaks and investments can't simply be that new breakthroughs and technologies are discovered here in America, but then the manufacturing takes place overseas. That, too, breaks the social compact. It makes people feel as if the game is fixed and they're not benefiting from the extraordinary discoveries that take place here.
So the key to our success has never been just developing new ideas; it's also been making new products. So Intel pioneers the microchip, then puts thousands to work building them in Silicon Valley. Henry Ford perfects the assembly line, and then puts a generation to work in the factories of Detroit. That's how we built the largest middle class in the world. Those folks working in those plants, they go out and they buy a Ford. They buy a personal computer. And the economy grows for everyone. And that's how we'll create the base of knowledge and skills that propel the next inventions and the next ideas.
Right now, businesses across this country are proving that America can compete. Caterpillar is opening a new plant to build excavators in Texas that used to be shipped from Japan. In Tennessee, Whirlpool is opening their first new U.S. factory in more than a decade. Dow is building a new plant in Michigan to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. A company called Geomagic, a software maker, decided to close down its overseas centers in China and Europe and move their R&D here to the United States. These companies are bringing jobs back to our shores. And that's good for everybody.
So if I've got one message, my message is now is the time to invest in America. Now is the time to invest in America. (Applause.) Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets. And I know that many of you have told me that you're waiting for demand to rise before you get off the sidelines and expand, and that with millions of Americans out of work, demand has risen more slowly than any of us would like.
We're in this together, but many of your own economists and salespeople are now forecasting a healthy increase in demand. So I just want to encourage you to get in the game. As part of the bipartisan tax deal we negotiated, with the support of the Chamber, businesses can immediately expense 100 percent of their capital investments. And as all of you know, it's investments made now that will pay off as the economy rebounds. And as you hire, you know that more Americans working will mean more sales for your companies. It will mean more demand for your products and services. It will mean higher profits for your companies. We can create a virtuous circle.
And if there's a reason you don't share my confidence, if there's a reason you don't believe that this is the time to get off the sidelines - to hire and to invest - I want to know about it. I want to fix it. That's why I've asked Jeff Immelt of GE to lead a new council of business leaders and outside experts so that we're getting the best advice on what you're facing out there - and we'll be holding our first meeting two weeks from now, on the 24th. So you can get your emails in early, with your ideas, with your thoughts about how we keep moving forward to create this virtuous cycle.
Together, I am confident we can win the competition for new jobs and industries. And I know you share my enthusiasm. Here's one thing I know. For all the disagreements, Tom, that we may have sometimes on issues, I know you love this country. I know you want America to succeed just as badly as I do.
So, yes, we'll have some disagreements; and, yes, we'll see things differently at times. But we're all Americans. And that spirit of patriotism, and that sense of mutual regard and common obligation, that has carried us through far harder times than the ones we've just been through.
And I'm reminded, toward the end of the 1930s, amidst the Depression, the looming prospect of war, FDR, President Roosevelt, realized he would need to form a new partnership with business if we were going to become what he would later call the ''arsenal of democracy.'' And as you can imagine, the relationship between the President and business leaders during the course of the Depression had been rocky at times. They'd grown somewhat fractured by the New Deal.
So Roosevelt reached out to businesses, and business leaders answered the call to serve their country. After years of working at cross purposes, the result was one of the most productive collaborations between the public and private sectors in American history.
Some, like the head of GM, hadn't previously known the President, and if anything had seen him as an adversary. But he gathered his family and he explained that he was going to head up what would become the War Production Board. And he said to his family, ''This country has been good to me, and I want to pay it back.'' I want to pay it back.
And in the years that followed, automobile factories converted to making planes and tanks. And corset factories made grenade belts. A toy company made compasses. A pinball machine maker turned out shells. 1941 would see the greatest expansion of manufacturing in the history of America. And not only did this help us win the war; it led to millions of new jobs and helped produce the great American middle class.
So we have faced hard times before. We have faced moments of tumult and moments of change. And we know what to do. We know how to succeed. We are Americans, and as we have done throughout our history, I have every confidence that once again we will rise to this occasion; that we can come together, we can adapt and we can thrive in this changing economy. And we need to look no further than the innovative companies in this room. If we can harness your potential and the potential of your people across this country, I think there's no stopping us.
So thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: If Mubarak Leaves, What's Next?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''West Backs Gradual Egyptian Transition'' (front page, Feb. 6):
The Obama administration is trying to ease President Hosni Mubarak out of power, but without disturbing the existing authoritarian structure of the Egyptian government. This policy makes a mockery of the just demands of the Egyptian people.
The Egyptians could not be clearer about their collective desire for substantive democratic change, and it is a fool's errand for our leaders to be standing in the way of popular revolt in the Arab world. 
Once again, the United States is proving to be on the wrong side of history.
John Sanbonmatsu Worcester, Mass., Feb. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''West Backs Gradual Egyptian Transition'' and ''Blood on the Nile'' (Week in Review, Feb. 6):
The United States government, which sends $1.5 billion annually to Egypt, refuses to learn that supporting vicious dictators is counterproductive.
Washington is backing Vice President Omar Suleiman, who is fiercely loyal to President Hosni Mubarak, to lead the transition team. But the vast majority of Egyptians who have taken to the streets to demand Mr. Mubarak's ouster would not likely accept a Suleiman-led government.
The former intelligence chief worked with the Central Intelligence Agency when it rendered terrorism suspects to Egypt for torture. As your reporters who were interrogated by Egypt's secret police, Souad Mekhennet and Nicholas Kulish, vividly point out, torture is commonplace in Egyptian prisons. Mr. Suleiman is closely identified with the government's longstanding policy of torture.
What happens next in Egypt is up to the people there, not the United States government. Until we stop backing tyrants and torturers, we and our allies will suffer the consequences.
Marjorie Cohn San Diego, Feb. 6, 2011
The writer, a law professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, is editor of ''The United States and Torture: Interrogation, Incarceration and Abuse.''
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 6 front-page and Week in Review articles about Egypt helpfully dissect the doubtful choices and compromised hopes with which American administrations have tried to influence brutal dictatorships like Egypt's in positive ways.
The United States should speak clearly for freedom and democracy, and leave behind any imperial conceits that we can simply order outcomes favorable to our interests. It matters less when President Hosni Mubarak will step down than that repression by his police end as quickly as possible. Supporting it -- as with the Central Intelligence Agency's renditions -- is a losing strategy.
Victor Chen New York, Feb. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
There has been much talk that the United States should cut military and economic aid to Egypt in response to the protests. The logic, of course, is to put pressure on President Hosni Mubarak to leave office.
I believe that this is exactly the wrong approach, for two reasons.
First, the military appears to be a stable force in the country and would be an important player in the success of democracy in the country. It is at least passively supportive of the protest. Why in the world would we want to punish it by cutting aid?
Second, instead of cutting economic aid we should be increasing it. At the same time we should make sure the aid gets to the right people -- those in the streets who are frustrated by economic oppression and unemployment. Cutting aid would hurt the very people we are trying to support.
There has to be a means of putting pressure on Mr. Mubarak to leave with grace and dignity, and supporting an orderly transition to democracy. That's where I believe we should be spending our money.
Joyce Rudowski Cincinnati, Feb. 5, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Militants, Women and Tahrir Square,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Feb. 6): Yes, ''it would be tragic if we let our anxieties'' about whether a democratic Egypt might end up a more repressive country ''impede our embrace of freedom and democracy.''
It would also be tragic if we failed to realize that the Muslim Brotherhood likely won't deliver the democracy that the Egyptians (and we, on their behalf) crave.
Without some countervailing force, the Muslim Brotherhood is likely to use the democratic process to come to power, but to rule using fundamentalist Shariah law.
Because the Muslim Brotherhood is better organized than the many people on the street whom Mr. Kristof has interviewed, the masses' good intentions and dreams for a vibrant democracy may prove irrelevant if the Brotherhood comes to power.

HEADLINE: The Splendor Of Cities

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Chicago
The people who run the federal government spend almost no time outdoors. They get driven from home to work and move through corridors from meeting to meeting. So it was a little odd after all those times interviewing Rahm Emanuel when he was the White House chief of staff to be chasing him, outside, down an icy Chicago street.
He was underdressed for the weather, as all politicians feel compelled to be, in a leather jacket and jeans, and he was knocking on doors as part of a campaign for mayor. Emanuel was a colorful figure in Washington, but back home he's off the leash. 
He's clearly a much happier person -- glowing, bouncing, reminiscing and hugging. Gone are all the death-grip battles with Republicans and the Washington interest groups. Now startled people in sweatpants greet him when he shows up at their doorway, sometimes wrapping him in an embrace and sometimes bringing their kids out to pose for pictures. Nearly every single person he meets gets an ebullient high-five, though the cause for each celebration is not always clear.
I was struck by how many voters wanted to talk to him about education. Chicagoans have clearly internalized the fact that their city can't prosper so long as so many public school students are dropping out. So Emanuel rips through his school reform agenda, which is like Obama's national agenda, except on steroids.
He's got a Chicago version of the Race to the Top in which schools that reform the fastest get a pot of money. He's for school performance contracts in which school leaders vow to meet certain goals or risk losing control of their schools. He's for sending school report cards out to parents so they can measure how well their own schools are performing.
As people come and talk to him, everything has a marvelous concreteness. In Washington, it's sometimes hard to connect the abstract laws that are being passed to the actual effects on neighborhoods or families. But in a mayoral race, people talk about this specific playground or that recycling center or the police precinct over there. Many of us are drawn to the big power politics of Washington, but city politics is better than national politics because the problems are more tangible and the communication is more face to face.
This is a point Edward Glaeser fleshes out in his terrific new book, ''Triumph of the City.'' Glaeser points out that far from withering in the age of instant global information flows, cities have only become more important.
That's because humans communicate best when they are physically brought together. Two University of Michigan researchers brought groups of people together face to face and asked them to play a difficult cooperation game. Then they organized other groups and had them communicate electronically. The face-to-face groups thrived. The electronic groups fractured and struggled.
Cities magnify people's strengths, Glaeser argues, because ideas spread more easily in dense environments. If you want to compete in a global marketplace it really helps to be near a downtown. Companies that are near the geographic center of their industry are more productive. Year by year, workers in cities see their wages grow faster than workers outside of cities because their skills grow faster. Inventors disproportionately cite ideas from others who live physically close to them.
For years, cities like Detroit built fancy towers and development projects in the hopes that this would revive the downtown core. But cities thrive because they host quality conversations, not because they have new buildings and convention centers.
The cities that have thrived over the past few decades tend to have high median temperatures in January (people like warm winters and other amenities). But even cold cities like Chicago can thrive if they attract college grads. As the number of college graduates in a metropolitan area increases by 10 percent, individuals' earnings increase by 7.7. This applies even to the high school grads in the city because their productivity rises, too.
When you clump together different sorts of skilled people and force them to rub against one another, they create friction and instability, which leads to tension and creativity, which leads to small business growth. As Glaeser notes, cities that rely on big businesses wither. Those that incubate small ones grow.
Recently, Emanuel visited Valois: See Your Food, a South Side institution that gives new meaning to the phrase ''greasy spoon.'' As he made his way from table to table -- from cops to middle-class families, graduate students, the unemployed and single moms -- he fell into a dozen intense and divergent conversations.
Chicago has its problems: it suffers under one of the biggest debt loads in the country. But it has thrived because it has had good leadership, a constantly updated housing stock, a good business environment and an ethos that attracts talent and celebrates blunt conversation.

HEADLINE: Parrying the Big Cuts

 BODY:
After months in a defensive crouch, Democrats are arising to challenge the severe budget cuts planned by House Republicans, which would almost certainly make unemployment worse. And it is not a moment too soon because when the stopgap resolution that is financing the government expires on March 4, the House will have significant leverage to get its way. Without a new spending bill, the government will shut down -- a prospect that seems to delight many newly elected Republicans.
A few days ago, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee began running radio ads criticizing members of the Republican Study Committee, a group of House members that wants to cut $2.5 trillion out of the budget in the next decade, including $100 billion from now through September. In case voters don't know what the actual impact of these drastic reductions would be, the ads are there to remind them: 
''Congresswoman Ann Marie Buerkle supports a plan in Congress that would cut education by 40 percent,'' said one of the ads, directed against a newly elected Republican from upstate New York. ''And her plan would cut science and technology research by 40 percent, too. Research and development is how we get the new products that create new jobs. How does cutting that help us compete with China and India? It doesn't make sense.'' Ms. Buerkle, like other subjects of ads, represents a district won by President Obama in 2008.
The ads seem to be having some effect. Robert Hurt, a Republican freshman from Virginia featured in one, protested that he didn't necessarily support all the cuts proposed by the committee, which is made up of some of the most conservative House members, even though he joined up immediately after being elected.
But even those House leaders who are trying to position themselves as more moderate in comparison with the Study Committee are proposing extreme cuts. Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, released the leadership's official budget targets last week, which would have the effect of cutting $41 billion below current levels of nonsecurity spending through September.
That means unimaginably steep reductions of 26 percent to transportation and housing, 14 percent to the environment and interior, and 13 percent to diplomatic and foreign operations.
Even the United States Chamber of Commerce applauded Monday when President Obama proposed greater investment in the nation's infrastructure. But Republican lawmakers, many of whom were elected with the help of the chamber, consider the word ''investment'' a euphemism for the spending they want to cut.
The details and the debate on these proposals probably won't happen for another two weeks, leaving only a few short days for the House and Senate to reach agreement before the money runs out on March 4.
House Republican leaders have refused to rule out a government shutdown if they do not get their way, and Senate Democrats were explicit in a recent news conference about how dangerous a game they are playing. As Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said, that possibly is highly unsettling to the bond market, not to mention the elderly recipients of government checks or veterans in need of health benefits.
There will be some kind of compromise on cuts, and the White House may have to step in to negotiate it. But to get there, Republicans should do a nervous country a favor and take the threat of a shutdown off the table.
Correction: February 9, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An editorial on Tuesday about the Democratic response to proposed Republican budget cuts misstated the amount the Republican Study Committee wants trimmed from the budget through September. It is $100 billion, not $100 million.

AMID TURMOIL IN EGYPT,
More Clashes in Sinai

COPPER PRICES ARE RISING,
And So Are Copper Thefts
Near-record prices for copper, platinum, aluminum and other metals have spurred a resurgence in the past several months in the theft of commonplace items that in better economic times might be overlooked -- among them, catalytic converters and copper wiring stripped from overhead power lines -- which thieves sell to scrap yards.

BLOOMBERG ASKS STATE
To Ease Mandates
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg lobbied lawmakers to ease a wide range of state mandates that he said had the effect of making a bad fiscal situation worse. He also said he believed the governor had significantly understated the extent to which his budget would reduce money for the city. The mayor put the cut in funds at more than three times the $659 million that the Cuomo administration cites. PAGE A20

BUYING HUFFINGTON POST,
AOL Bets on a Makeover
In the latest iteration of its attempt to remake itself, AOL is paying $315 million to buy the liberal news commentary site The Huffington Post, not long after paying $25 million to buy TechCrunch, the Silicon Valley technology news blog. But skepticism runs deep that this effort will be any more successful than the many other makeovers it has tried in the last decade. PAGE B1

HEADLINE: Down and Out on Rodeo Drive

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Just how widespread is the budget crisis in California? Even on Rodeo Drive, whose retail strip is synonymous with luxury, this city has taken a hit. 
For the last decade, Gregg Donovan has served as ''Beverly Hills ambassador,'' an actual job in which he greeted tourists in his signature top hat and red tailcoat shouting ''Welcome to Beverly Hills!'' in dozens of languages.
But last month, the Beverly Hills Conference and Tourism Board eliminated the position, and Mr. Donovan found himself added to California's still-swollen unemployment rolls.
''They said it was part of budget cuts,'' said Mr. Donovan, 51. ''But I brought in so much more money to this city than they paid me.''
Mr. Donovan, who had previously worked as a personal valet to Bob Hope, was originally hired in 2002 to help combat so-called ''Pretty Woman'' syndrome, which left some shoppers hesitant to enter upscale stores, afraid of being humiliated by snooty sales clerks like the Julia Roberts character was in that film.
Jennifer Brandenburg, who was visiting Rodeo Drive on Monday for the first time, said she was embarrassed to go inside the stores.
''I'm just window-shopping,'' said Ms. Brandenburg, 23. ''Clearly, I'm not dressed to go shopping.''
Mr. Donovan had tried to make shoppers like Ms. Brandenburg feel welcome, and guided them into the designer shops or onto tour buses.
''He would bring clients to us who were looking for watches or gifts,'' said Korosh Soltani, manager of the jeweler David Orgell on Rodeo Drive. ''People would take pictures with him. He was almost like a sightseeing attraction.''
Indeed, Mr. Donovan has come to represent the city so thoroughly that there is now a debate over the rights to his likeness.
As part of the separation agreement sent to Mr. Donovan, the Conference and Tourism Board sought the right to continue to use his image on promotional materials. Mr. Donovan has refused to sign the agreement, his lawyer said.
The Conference and Visitors Board declined to comment on Mr. Donovan's termination, as did members of the Beverly Hills City Council.
Mr. Donovan now hopes to find similar work for another city -- perhaps Hollywood, or even New York.
On Monday, Rodeo Drive was quiet until Mr. Donovan arrived, shouting hello to Brazilian tourists in hopes of drumming up support to get his job back.
''I love it there,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''I consider it home. But if they say they can't afford me, what else can I do?''

HEADLINE: In Europe, a Growing Effort to Shed More Light on Short-Selling

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
The hedge fund manager David Einhorn does not seem to mind revealing his bets against a company, at least on his own terms.
Over the years, Mr. Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, has announced several major short positions, most notably in 2008 when he publicly derided Lehman Brothers just months before the investment bank collapsed.
But now Mr. Einhorn and other large investors do not have a choice in France, where regulators started requiring money managers to disclose on a daily basis the stocks they bet against in the country. On Feb. 3, Greenlight Capital reported it was short more than 1 percent of the shares in Neopost, a French mailroom equipment supplier. 
While hedge funds have long had to report their long positions on a quarterly basis, the decision by French authorities brings a new level of transparency to some of the most closely guarded investment moves in the hedge fund world. In February, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, the French financial markets regulator, began requiring hedge funds and other investment managers to disclose their short positions when they reached 0.5 percent of a company's outstanding stock.
The initiative mirrors a plan by European Union regulators who, in the wake of the financial crisis, want to monitor the potential risks of short-selling. The European Commission is considering a proposal that would require all member countries to publish details on investors' short holdings. Authorities are expected to vote on the measure this year.
''It's definitely a step in the right direction in terms of providing transparency,'' said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has studied hedge funds for more than a decade. ''While it is good for the public, there is a potential for unintended consequences.''
The action in Europe goes well beyond the efforts of regulators and policy makers in the United States. As part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, the Securities and Exchange Commission is drafting rules that would require hedge funds to disclose greater detail about their positions, leverage and performance - although the information would not be public.
Investors short stocks for many reasons. They may think a company's shares are overvalued and headed for a fall. Or they want to cut risk in their portfolio.
But the practice has long been contentious. The defenders say such bets provide liquidity to the market and improve price efficiency. Critics contend it accelerates stock losses, adding unnecessary volatility in times of market stress.
There is scant information on short-selling. Limited details are often published on a delayed schedule or in aggregate form, making it hard to know the size and scope of such positions.
Companies have long complained that short-selling can lead to stock manipulation. In the financial crisis, managers at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers accused large investors of spreading rumors that sent their prices plummeting and created liquidity problems for the investment banks.
At the time, several countries - including the United States, Britain, Germany and France - banned the practice for shares in certain companies. Since then, the bans have largely been lifted.
As lawmakers across Europe search for ways to prevent another crisis, countries in the region have adopted their own policies around the investment strategy, with the French rules sitting on the more stringent end of the regulatory continuum. German officials voted on Jan. 31 to extend a rule requiring the disclosure of short positions in the stocks of 10 companies, including Deutsche Bank. Unlike in France, the information is disclosed on an aggregated basis, showing the collective short positions of money managers on a single stock. Since 2008, Britain's Financial Services Authority has forced firms to report short positions for 30 financial companies, including the investment bank Barclays Capital.
The European Union is moving to create a uniform policy for its 27 member countries. The plan, issued last September, would require firms with short positions of 0.5 percent of an available stock to publicly disclose it. The proposed legislation, which could change as it wends its way through the system, is expected to come up for a vote this year.
The patchwork of regulation - and the looming threat of comprehensive rules in the euro zone - have prompted hedge funds to beef up their lobbying efforts. The industry's main trade group in the United States, the Managed Funds Association, said it planned to open an office in Brussels, the headquarters of the European Commission. The trade group has also sent letters asking European authorities to maintain the records privately, or post them anonymously or in aggregate.
The industry argues that such disclosures could spawn copycats, unsophisticated investors who see the moves of respected hedge funds like Greenlight and decide to follow suit. Such piling on could lead to unfair downward pressure on a company's stock.
A spokesman for Greenlight Capital declined to comment.
Others say that if market participants stop shorting to avoid the regulatory disclosures, liquidity will dry up and the market will be less efficient. A study by the British financial regulator in the aftermath of the crisis found that liquidity and pricing suffered for those stocks that investors were banned from shorting.
But there isn't a lot of research on how disclosing individual short positions will affect the market. Two industry-financed studies suggest that investors will be at risk if the proposed legislation passes. One study, commissioned by the Managed Funds Association, found that trade volume dropped 13 percent in those stocks subject to disclosure rules in Britain and the gap between the buy and sell offers on a stock increased 45 percent.
The research, however, is hardly definitive, experts say. Indeed, many feel the rules would be a good way to balance what is good for the markets with what is good for the public.
''It's going to affect just large hedge funds who are putting on fundamental shorts,'' said Charles Jones, a finance and economics professor at the Columbia Business School. ''It might discourage them from doing that, and it might mean that prices take longer to adjust to negative information. But it won't destroy market quality in the same way the ban did.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Among Nation's Youngest, Analysis Finds Fewer Whites

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Whites continued to decline as a share of the American population in 2009, and they now represent less than half of all 3-year-olds, according to a Brookings Institution analysis of census data released Monday. 
The country's young population is more diverse than ever, with whites now in the minority in nursery schools, preschools and kindergartens in eight states -- Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas -- and the District of Columbia, according to William H. Frey, a demographer at Brookings. That was up from six states in 2000.
''We are on our way to having a majority of minority students in U.S. schools,'' Mr. Frey said.
Nationally, whites accounted for 58.8 percent of all school enrollment in 2009, Mr. Frey said, citing the new data, which measured enrollment from preschool to graduate school as of October 2009. That was down from 64.6 percent in 2000, a decline that came with falling birthrates as the white population aged.
Population growth has come instead from Hispanics, blacks and Asians, whose children represent ever larger shares of the school population. Twenty-three percent of children in kindergarten were Hispanic in 2009, up from 18 percent in 2000 and 10 percent in 1989. Hispanics now account for nearly a fifth of all enrollment from nursery school through college, Mr. Frey said.
The United States has been experiencing the biggest surge of immigrants since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European immigrants considerably expanded the population.
And while immigrants have long taken to cities, more recently they have spread throughout the nation, creating diverse student populations in places that had been overwhelmingly white.
The states whose white children dipped to below 50 percent of nursery school and kindergarten enrollment most recently were Arizona, Florida and Nevada, Mr. Frey said. Next in line are Georgia, Louisiana and Maryland, he said.
The gap between the country's diverse young population and its older white one is raising difficult issues for policy makers, who are trying to balance the growing costs associated with the aging white population with the need for financing to educate an increasingly diverse youth.
Education experts who have studied the issue say the United States is lagging behind in educating minority students. The past big wave of immigrants took more than a generation to integrate into the economy through education, they say, a delay the country can ill afford in today's age of global competitiveness.
''These students will be an important source of our labor-force growth as baby boomers begin retiring,'' Mr. Frey said.
