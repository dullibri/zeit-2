HEADLINE: For Health Care Choice

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Nov. 27 front-page article "Employees Facing Steep Increases in Health Costs" raises the deeper issue of whether employers are useful intermediaries in buying health insurance for workers. If they cannot control costs, what value do they add? 
 Employers continue to call all the shots in health care, often to workers' economic disadvantage. Employees should have the right to decide where they buy their medical insurance, what health plan they buy and how much they want to pay for it, not what the employer decides to cost-shift to them.
What the American worker needs is a tax credit for health insurance expenses. And what the American health care system needs is competition, by allowing people to shop for their own health insurance from multiple and competing health stores, just as we do for every other product and service in the American economy.

HEADLINE: Yes, It's Love, But It's Always Business, Too;
Roger Berlind, Theater Producer, May Be an Endangered Species

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
On Dec. 13, Roger Berlind will put on a tuxedo for his 33d opening night in the 22 years since he left investment banking and became a theatrical producer, and then he will take his aisle seat for "The Blue Room," starring Nicole Kidman, which he helped import from London.
It isn't excitement or nervousness Mr. Berlind feels in those moments when the lights dim and the curtain rises. It is relief. He knows there is nothing more he can do. "I don't get carried away with opening night magic," he said. "This is a business." 
 As businesses go, producing on Broadway is increasingly risky. Shows are more expensive than ever to mount: musicals can cost as much as $10 million, and investors rarely recoup their investment, much less make a profit. Mr. Berlind is just one of many who risk fortunes on shows that are statistically more likely to fail than succeed.
Theatrical producers come and go, particularly after confronting the reality of a show's punishing losses. Yet Mr. Berlind, 68, has hung in there year after year, taking chances on plays because he believes in them and because he can afford to lose as often as he wins. And these days on Broadway, with the influx of large corporations like Disney and Livent transforming the business, that kind of individual risk-taking is increasingly rare.
"I don't think you're going to see the money that was lost by a Roger Berlind in the future," said John F. Breglio, an entertainment lawyer and chairman of the Theater Development Fund. "Who is going to lose the big money and really throw the dice?"
Yesterday in Princeton, N.J., the McCarter Theater Center for the Performing Arts and Princeton University announced construction of the Roger S. Berlind Theater, a 350-seat expansion of the McCarter made possible with a $3.5 million gift from Mr. Berlind.
"I'm doing this because I enjoy it," he said in a recent interview. "There is not an activity I can think of that wouldn't be more remunerative. I know it's not worth it economically, but I love theater. It is addictive."
With labor costs and ad rates increasing faster than inflation and ticket prices, Mr. Berlind said, as well as rising costs of theater rentals and lighting and sound equipment, the prospect of producing has become considerably more daunting.
While Mr. Berlind's first show, the Richard Rodgers musical "Rex," cost $800,000 in 1976, the producer said it would cost $10 million today. "It's dicier and dicier," Mr. Berlind said. "I think we really need to address the fundamental cost structure in a way that incorporates unions and guilds and makes everybody realize this is a golden age that's turning rotten."
Mr. Berlind is a wealthy man, but he would have been far wealthier had he not altered his course so drastically 23 years ago. He was one of the founders of the brokerage firm Carter, Berlind & Weill, which eventually was bought by American Express. Among his former partners are Sanford I. Weill, now the co-chairman of Citigroup; Arthur L. Carter, owner of The New York Observer, and Marshall S. Cogan, a businessman and art collector who once owned the restaurant "21."
 
Starting Over After Heartbreak
On June 24, 1975, everything changed. Mr. Berlind went to the airport with his 2-year-old son to pick up the rest of his family -- his wife and three other children -- and the plane crashed, killing all of them. Mr. Berlind felt he had no choice but to start over.
"The whole idea of building a business and making money didn't make sense anymore," he said. "There was no more economic motivation."
Since then his many projects have included hits: "Amadeus," "City of Angels," the revival of "Guys and Dolls"; and about as many misses: "Precious Sons," "Getting Away With Murder," "Elliot Loves." Mr. Berlind's co-producers often include Scott Rudin, the Shubert Organization, Robert Fox and ABC, although sometimes, as in the case of "Getting Away With Murder" by Stephen Sondheim, he goes it alone.
"If it's unlikely to be a success, I won't raise money," Mr. Berlind said. "It's too much of a fiduciary obligation."
Last year two big musicals he took to Broadway failed to recoup their investment: "The Life," which ran for just over a year, and "Steel Pier," which closed after about three months, including previews.
To trawl for material, Mr. Berlind sees about 100 shows a year in New York, around the country and in London. He goes to auditions for investors, meets with other producers, reads scripts. Sometimes he just writes a check, but he prefers a more active role, helping writers shape the material and directors come up with a concept and taking part in the mechanics like advertising and ticket sales.
"It's not as much fun when you have your nose pressed against the pane," Mr. Berlind said, "and all the fun is happening on the other side."
He likes to see auditions and rehearsals and to work with creative people who welcome his views. Some say Mr. Berlind is appropriately respectful of the limits of his role. "He gives his opinions but lets the authors decide," said Mr. Sondheim, "and that seems to me the best kind of producer you can have."
Others, like Jerome Robbins, apparently found him more intrusive. "Jerome Robbins, when you hired him, you knew your involvement would be minimal," said Mr. Berlind, who produced "Jerome Robbins's Broadway" in 1989. "He was hard to talk to and didn't take suggestions well."
Mr. Berlind said he finally wrote Robbins a seven-page, single-spaced typed letter containing all his ideas for the show, and Robbins wrote him back saying simply: "Thank you for your thoughts. I will take them into consideration."
Mr. Berlind, who remarried 19 years ago, seems well liked in the theater world. People often refer to him as a gentleman and describe him as kind. They're also grateful that he has been willing to gamble so much of his own fortune on producing.
"Roger is an example of someone who came from another industry and didn't carpetbag on the theater," said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization. "He came and he stayed."
 
Playing It Safe With Imports
Mr. Berlind's choice in plays, however, is not universally respected. Because his background is in finance and not the arts, some theater veterans say, Mr. Berlind does not have as reliable a gut feeling as, say, producers with more theatrical flair, like Cameron Mackintosh. They also say Mr. Berlind plays it safe by importing shows from London and does not take chances on new work.
Mr. Berlind seems confident in his instinct but acknowledges some major mistakes. "When I fall in love," he said, "sometimes I let my judgment suffer."
Despite his buttoned-down appearance and banker's reserve, he describes producing with passion. "It's like life or death," he said. "You're with a group of people so intensely that you tend to lose sight of what's important to the world. Everything comes down to making this show work. That's what makes it an amazing experience, and it's also what allows you to get in serious trouble. It's a very emotional product. You wouldn't feel that way if you were manufacturing shoes."
At the same time, he is no philanthropist. He is in this to make money, and the bottom line is his top priority. "Each production is designed to return a profit," he said. "I never do anything when I think, 'I'm only doing this for love.' "
 
Adding Up The Cost Factors
Plays, particularly musicals, can be years in the making, Mr. Berlind said. First he obtains the production rights, which can entail long negotiations. Then he hires his creative team: director, designers, choreographer. Finally, he moves on to auditions.
"At each of these steps you have to mentally -- in fact, rather specifically -- determine the cost factor: How is it going to impact your production budget as well as your operating budget?" Mr. Berlind said. "And the hope is that you can break even at a low enough number so that what you earn above that is sufficient to pay back the cost of a production and be running long enough after that to give a profit to the investors."
It is the lack of this kind of watchfulness, Mr. Berlind said, that led to the trouble facing Livent Inc., the production company founded by Garth H. Drabinsky, which is now in bankruptcy. "I think it's a good case study in the need to control costs," Mr. Berlind said. "While I admire Garth Drabinksy's creativity and passion very much, I think he didn't pay sufficient attention to the production costs and the operating costs."
When he raises money from other sources -- people, Mr. Berlind said, "in a position to lose 100 percent of their investment" -- he always keeps those investors in mind.
But ultimately, he said, because of the subjective, mysterious quality of what makes a hit, the result is out of his hands.
"It's a little bit like wildcatting for oil: you can always hit a gusher and then not get paid for six dry holes," he said. "Gushers are harder and harder to come by because the economics of the business have deteriorated so much."
Even Tony Awards do not guarantee financial success, said Mr. Berlind, who has won nine of them. Last spring, for example, "A View From the Bridge," for which he was a co-producer, won the Tony for best revival but never made its money back and closed after five months. "It should have worked," Mr. Berlind said. "There is no explanation for that."
While he often sees the logic of the critics, Mr. Berlind said, there are some shows whose failure continues to mystify him, like "Steel Pier," which he nurtured from the beginning. In a review in The New York Times, Ben Brantley said of the show, set in the world of marathon dancing in Atlantic City in 1933, "The entire effort feels soft at the edges, and it never really finds its motor."
Mr. Berlind said: "There was a miscalculation which we still can't identify -- why it didn't work. So you put a lot of your emotions into a project like that over a two-year or longer period and it all comes down to opening night, which makes it absurd."
 
His Schedule Remains Full
More and more, the absurdity of producing on Broadway makes Mr. Berlind ask how long he'll stick with it. "It's something I ask myself all the time," he said. "How joyous is it and is there any objective reason to continue doing this as being an independent producer becomes less and less rewarding?"
But ultimately, Mr. Berlind says, his heart wins out over his head. So his schedule remains full. This spring he is bringing two straight plays to Broadway from London, Patrick Marber's "Closer" and David Hare's "Amy's View." And next season he plans to produce two musicals, a revival of "Kiss Me Kate" and the new Stephen Sondheim musical, "Wise Guys."
"I've been saying for 10 years, 'This is it,' " Mr. Berlind said. "And then I get seduced by a script or a production I see. And I want to do it."

HEADLINE: Government Made Easy

BYLINE: By William F. Weld; William F. Weld was Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
There are four main slices in the American political pie today.
The first is the liberal Democrats. They don't get it. This is the Dick Gephardt, unions-all-the-way crowd, which has yet to absorb the lessons of the last 20 years regarding the size and reach of government, the free movement of goods and people across borders and the fatal weaknesses of bureaucracy. 
 Then there are the Bill Clinton-Al Gore-Bob Kerrey-Bill Bradley Democrats, who by and large do get it, though they would do well to move to the right on tax cuts, tort reform and school choice.
Next there are the George W. Bush-Lamar Alexander-George Pataki Republicans, who also by and large do get it, though some of them should move to the left on abortion rights and affirmative action.
Finally there are the Gary Bauer Republicans of the far right, who really don't get it.
So, what is "it"?
"It" is the recognition that government is good when it does some things and bad when it does other things.
Government is good when it restrains citizens from killing or injuring each other. That is why we need to be tough-minded about criminal justice and not give ourselves over to generalized weeping about due process.
Government is bad when it takes more than 30 percent of a taxpayer's income in taxes. Proudhon was wrong when he said property is theft; it's our Federal budget that is institutionalized theft.
Government is good when it safeguards our livelihoods from predatory business practices. We need antitrust laws; Economic Man will take the whole pie for himself every time, if you let him.
Government is bad when it tries to micromanage anything. Nationalized health care, wage and price controls, and teachers' and school custodians' collective bargaining contracts come to mind.
Government is good when it helps citizens pursue happiness in God's great green earth. Individuals and businesses simply will not protect the environment for our descendants; we need vigorous government enforcement and conservation measures. Backers of so-called property rights should think of this as a proper government response to a market failure.
Government is bad when it tries to manage people's sex lives. Government should stay out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom.
Government is good when it redresses wrongs. Slavery was wrong. Second-class citizenship for women was wrong. Second-class educational and employment opportunity for members of racial minorities was and is wrong. Affirmative action is abundantly justified.
Government is bad when it obstructs the free flow of ideas, material goods, services or people. Censorship, tariffs and unduly restrictive immigration policies all injure our society.
Government is good when it appeals to the better angels of our nature, when it contributes to a sense of community, both at home and abroad. It is best for government to guide with a light touch here, to be evocative as opposed to prescriptive. This is a point that divides official Washington: many Congressional Republicans seem to have intentionally forsworn this power of government, while both Bill and Hillary Clinton have long embraced it.
Finally, government is bad when its representatives tell people, "We understand more fully than you what's good for you." This is a common failing of the Democratic left, in hock to unions and trial lawyers, and of the so-called Republican cultural right, in thrall to homophobia and xenophobia.
That's "it."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Volvo to Cut5,300 Workers by Mid-1999

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Volvo A.B., the Swedish maker of cars, buses, trucks and construction equipment, said today that it would lay off more than 7 percent of its work force, or 5,300 workers, by the middle of next year as part of plans to increase productivity and increase profits.
The cuts will be divided between Europe, where Volvo is the last of the small, high-volume independent auto makers, and the rest of the world, including 1,000 jobs in the United States. Volvo hopes to save $367 million a year with the cuts, which are the latest in the European auto industry as it braces for slower sales in emerging markets and reduced growth in Europe and the United States. Volvo, which backed out of a merger with the French car maker Renault in 1994, faces tough conditions as it seeks to expand its international reach, particularly by moving into developing markets. 
 "It's quite aggressive," said John Lawson, an auto industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
He said the cuts were intended to insure growth in operating profits as Volvo completes an overhaul of global operations it began in 1997. "But the scale is a bit bigger than foreseen," he added.
About 1,900 job cuts are foreseen in Volvo's car division, and 900 to 1,000 in each of the truck, bus and construction-equipment divisions. The remaining jobs will be cut at various small units, like marine engines.
Stefan Lorentson, Volvo's spokesman, said United States management would have to decide "how, when and where" to make cuts there. Volvo has several plants in the United States, including a truck factory in New River Valley, Va., and one for marine engines in Lexington, Ky.
The cutbacks announced today heartened investors. Volvo's shares rose 7.5 Swedish kronor, to 195 kronor, after the announcement.
Volvo has had to act aggressively to resist growing pressures from reshuffling in the global industry, exemplified by Daimler-Benz's recent takeover of Chrysler, forming DaimlerChrylser. Earlier, Germany's BMW swallowed Britain's Rover, and Volkswagen assembled a stable of brands, including Italy's Lamborghini; thanks to acquisitions, Fiat now controls the sports car brands Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati.
Volvo has decided to close three bus factories in Western Europe and concentrate production at a new plant in Poland. In October, Volvo said it would close a car assembly plant in Halifax, Nova Scotia, eliminating 195 jobs. The cuts announced today are in addition to the job losses in Canada. Last month, Volvo paid $150 million to buy Mexico's second-largest bus maker, Mexicana de Autobuses, and equip it to build buses and cars for the North American Free Trade Agreement region.
With a 1.7 percent market share, Volvo is Europe's seventh-largest producer, not including the European units of Ford Motor and General Motors, and is dwarfed by market leaders like Volkswagen, the leader, which has an 18 percent market share. And competition grows increasingly bitter.
This year, European car sales are expected to rise 4.6 percent, to 14 million cars, then drop next year, to 13.7 million, as European economies slow, according to the latest forecast by Standard & Poor's DRI. Earlier this month, BMW said it would cut 2,500 jobs at a Rover factory in Britain, and Ford announced it would cut 2,300 jobs in Belgium. Fiat has said it will run factories slow for several weeks in the holiday season to trim inventories.
Despite Volvo's recent efforts at reorganization, results have been disappointing. In the first nine months of this year, net profit dropped to $679.9 million from $1.1 billion in the period a year earlier, despite a 15 percent increase in sales, to $18.3 billion. At the start of reorganization, Volvo set itself the goal of 5 percent operating margin, or operating profit as a percentage of revenue. At the end of nine months, the margin had slipped to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent in the period a year earlier.
"There is still much work remaining in order for us to be able to attain our profitability goal," said Leif Johansson, Volvo's president and chief executive. He said Volvo would determine in December how large a reserve to set aside for the reorganization.
Volvo attributes the weakness in profitability to the cost of introducing new models, like the Volvo S80, a new flagship sedan that entered the market this fall, and to the slowness of cost-cutting to offset the drag of an aging product line.
Announcing the disappointing nine-month results, Mr. Johansson said that sales this year had increased "according to plan" and that turmoil in Asia, where Volvo sells 6 percent of its cars, was offset by increased sales elsewhere. But he acknowledged that the emerging-market turbulence of recent months had not figured into Volvo's original strategy. If it continued, he said, Volvo would be forced to take measures to adjust cost levels to smaller volume growth.

Troubles Grow at Astra
 JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 30 (Bloomberg News) -- PT Astra International, Indonesia's largest car maker, said its third-quarter loss widened to 122 billion rupiah, or $16.7 million, as the country slid into its first recession in more than three decades, taking sales with it.
Third-quarter numbers for the company were derived by subtracting results in the first half from nine-month results. In the period a year earlier, Astra posted a loss of 23 billion rupiah.
In the first nine months, Astra lost 487.2 billion rupiah, or $66.7 million, compared with a profit of 326 billion rupiah, or $44.6 million, in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Other Nations Plan More Aid for Palestinians

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The United States today pledged an extra $400 million in aid to the Palestinians, which is expected to nearly double the amount of their economic assistance from the United States over the next five years.
The announcement was made by President Clinton at the start of a one-day international donor conference sponsored by the State Department, which brought an estimated total of more than $3 billion in new pledges of aid for the Palestinians. 
 In a speech to open the conference here, Mr. Clinton said the United States had decided to increase aid in hopes of convincing the Palestinians to stick to the peace accord with Israel.
"We must convince those who have invested so much in this process that it was a sound investment," he said. "For too long, too many young people have turned to terrorism and old hatreds partly because they had nothing better to do. We must give them a different future to believe in."
Appealing for generous contributions from other wealthy nations, he said that the peace efforts had so far brought "too little tangible improvement in the life of the Palestinian people."
At the last major international donors conference in October 1993, shortly after completion of the Oslo peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel, the United States made a five-year pledge to the Palestinians of $500 million.
Clinton Administration officials said that before the announcement today, the United States had expected to continue to provide about $100 million a year in aid to the Palestinians. But with Mr. Clinton's addition of $400 million, the total package of American economic assistance should total about $900 million over the next five years.
The additional aid reflects a promise made by Mr. Clinton to pay for steps needed to carry out the latest land-for-peace deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis, which was hammered out in a summit meeting in October in Wye, Md., with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
Mr. Clinton said that despite large aid grants in the past, the Palestinian economy had continued to falter. "Per capita income is down, unemployment is too high, living conditions are extremely difficult," he said. "An honest assessment would lead us to the conclusion that we have not realized all our intentions."
The United States is particularly eager to see improvement in the Palestinian economy to help Mr. Arafat blunt the influence of the militant Islamic group Hamas, which has sought public support through sponsorship of medical clinics, schools and sports clubs in the West Bank and Gaza.
After meeting with Mr. Clinton in the White House, Mr. Arafat appeared at the conference to make a plea for pledges, warning that "the Palestinian economy has witnessed a continuous decline."
He accused Israel of undermining the Palestinian economy through its repeated closing of the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories in response to what Israel has described as terrorist threats.
"The Israeli closure policy is the primary and direct cause for the dangerous decline in the performance of the Palestinian economy over the past five years," he said.
At a news conference to announce the results of the donors' conference, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said: "We do not have exact pledges, but it appears that delegations pledged more than $3 billion today, well above the $2.3 billion pledged at the 1993 donor conference, and that by itself is a substantial achievement."
She said the pledges "are evidence of the international community's firm commitment to help the Palestinian people build lives that are better, freer and safer, and to do our part in laying the foundations for a secure and prosperous Middle East."
American officials said that other large donations of aid had been pledged by the European Union, $480 million; Japan, $200 million; Norway, which organized the secret talks that led to the 1993 Oslo peace accords, $175 million; Saudi Arabia, $100 million; Kuwait, $80 million, and Canada, $30 million.
American officials and Mr. Arafat brushed aside questions today about news reports last weekend suggesting that millions of dollars in British aid earmarked for housing projects in the West Bank and Gaza had been diverted to build luxury apartments for key deputies to Mr. Arafat.
"That's an issue for the British," said a senior American official, noting that the United States aid to the Palestinians goes directly to contractors and private groups involved in development projects, not to Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority. "This is not an issue for the United States."
Ms. Albright said at her news conference that in the distribution of American aid to the Palestinians, "every dollar is accounted for and it's completely transparent."

HEADLINE: San Fransiscans Tire of the Life of the Party

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 30

 BODY:
No one denies Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr.'s ability to stir an audience. The other day he spoke at the 20th-anniversary commemoration of the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, and his simple words on this "tragedy of tragedies" brought louder applause than the star attraction, Joan Baez.
Mr. Brown knows how to make people laugh, too. Always impeccably dressed in one of his classic $3,000 Brioni suits, he wisecracks, makes goofy faces and generally hams it up at every festival, groundbreaking and public announcement, instilling in spectators the disarming effect of watching the coolest kid in class become the class clown. In fact, voters in a recent poll said his charisma was his greatest asset. 
 But after three years, those voters seem tired of a Mayor most notable for talking a crowd into his vest pocket. For all his charm, Mr. Brown, a Democrat who is one of only two or three mayors in the country with widespread name recognition, is in trouble. The man whose political clout and social savvy single-handedly put San Francisco back on the national political map is getting his worst approval ratings ever. Only 3 of every 10 voters surveyed in a recent poll by The San Francisco Chronicle said they were inclined to back him for a second term. That amounts to a radical decline for a Mayor who breezed into office with the support of two-thirds of the electorate.
And for a master politician with 34 years in public office -- 15 of them as Assembly Speaker, holder of the second-most-important elective office in the nation's most populous state -- the low approval ratings are especially perplexing now. This, after all, is an ideal time to be a mayor, when mayors all over the country are riding high, taking and getting credit for national trends like falling crime rates, low unemployment and sound fiscal health. And Mr. Brown's San Francisco fits all those patterns: crime and unemployment are down, and the city's budget, which showed a $65 million deficit when he took office, now has a projected surplus of $145 million.
Still, San Franciscans are obviously upset. They are upset, the poll found, with Mr. Brown's seeming inability to make the buses and trains run on time or to get the homeless off the streets. And they are upset at downtown traffic jams, a lack of public parking, litter, mediocre schools and the Mayor's "arrogance." In short, they are upset at a lot of things.
For Mr. Brown, who left the Assembly (where he nicknamed himself the Ayatollah) only after term limits had forced him out, the nearly unthinkable is happening: the looming possibility of life as a civilian. Politicians presumed dead, like Mr. Brown's predecessor, Frank Jordan, are resurrecting themselves, talking of a possible challenge in 1999.
After a first year in which he all but walked on water, there was really nowhere for Mr. Brown to go but down. But just why he is so far down depends on whom you ask.
The Mayor's press secretary, Kandace Bender, says the latest poll was worded so that the responses specifically regarding him would be negative. "I think the important figure to remember is that 56 percent of the voters approve of the direction the city is going," she said. "Three years ago that figure was 35 percent."
But others are inclined to say that the very qualities that enthralled voters in the first place, Mr. Brown's glamour and glitz, have begun to grate on a city where homelessness is so prevalent and two-thirds of the residents are renters who may never be able to afford to buy in San Francisco's exorbitant housing market. (Some people are still smarting over the lavish parties, closed to the public, that the Mayor gave when the city was host to the United States Conference of Mayors last year.)
Then there are those who are disenchanted with the machine-style politics Mr. Brown brought with him from the Assembly, where back-room wheeling and dealing was the norm.
"One thing we've realized since Brown is that the Supervisors are irrelevant," said Ted Gullicksen, manager of the San Francisco Tenants Union, which won a ballot measure in the election on Nov. 3 that helped protect tenants from evictions. Mr. Brown had endorsed the ballot measure and asked the Board of Supervisors to resurrect 1996 legislation that would further strengthen tenants' protections, but Mr. Gullicksen said the Mayor had simply been trying to bolster his position for his coming election.
"Brown made his reputation as someone who plays hardball politics," Mr. Gullicksen said. "His No. 1 goal is keeping himself in office, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. If there was another progressive candidate on the horizon, we would endorse them over Brown."
Of course, it is never easy being mayor of San Francisco. Each of Mr. Brown's immediate two predecessors survived only one term. The people of this city are so politically active that the free weeklies run listings of coming protests. It is probably safe to say that if Mr. Brown had declared war on the kind of quality-of-life irritations to which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani devoted so much energy in New York, the squeegee men, the strip clubs and the panhandlers would not have gone quietly. Indeed, not long after he had announced aggressive moves to clear encampments put up by the homeless, protesters bombarded Mr. Brown with three pies in the face.
"This is probably the most politically active city in the country," said Phillip Matier, a political columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle. "It's a very expensive place to live, and people want to believe they're getting their money's worth. You also have all these competing interests all the time. It's not an accident that so many of the state's high offices are occupied by San Franciscans: this city is very tough on politicians, and only the strongest survive."
If so, then the Mayor should manage to weather the political doldrums. Willie Lewis Brown Jr., born dirt-poor in segregated Mineola, Tex., in 1934, was Slick Willie long before anyone had even heard of Bill Clinton. He has, for example, managed to duck many accusations over the years that he rewards political friends with important contracts and development deals.
Those charges of patronage and cronyism have followed him back to San Francisco: just recently a mayoral committee looking over proposals for the redevelopment of a former naval base marina called Treasure Island recommended that the deal go to a group of investors with close political ties to the Mayor, in an arrangement that critics say would net the city far less money than other proposals.
The Mayor shrugs off the accusations of cronyism, saying that after 34 years in government, there are few people he does not know.
Anticipating criticism over the homeless and the city's bus and rail system, called Muni, Mr. Brown devoted over half of his state-of-the-city speech last month to those two issues, explaining what he had tried to do and what he would do in the coming year. Ms. Bender, his press secretary, said the voters' view of how he handles Muni would change when they became aware of what he was doing to improve it.
"We've ordered about 280 new buses, 250 new electric trolleys and 136 light rail vehicles," she said. "We've slotted $23 million over last year's base-line budget for Muni. We've cleared all of the backlog of customer complaints."
In addition, she said, the Mayor has reduced crime in the system, ordered that tracks on the rail line be replaced and shortened commuting time by assigning traffic officers to make sure buses can pass through intersections.
"Given all that," she said, "if you ask voters, 'Do you approve or disapprove of what the Mayor has done with Muni,' what do you think the answer will be?"
Ms. Bender said the Mayor was also working on homelessness, although the city strongly disputes figures, from advocates for the homeless, showing 16,000 people on the streets. "Our figures are between 4,000 and 6,000," Ms. Bender said.
For his part, the Mayor denies that he is worried about his poll numbers. His position, political observers say, is strengthened by the fact that no one on the progressive end of the city's political spectrum -- which runs from the moderately liberal Democratic to the very liberal -- has stepped forward to run against him.
"In order for someone to be very threatened, they have to face challenges from the left and right," said Mr. Matier, the Chronicle columnist. "That hasn't happened here."
By Mr. Brown's account, the reason is that he is one of a kind. "There's never been a mayor who opens up City Hall on Saturdays and gives everyone 10 minutes," he said at a recent press briefing, adding that his phone number was still listed.
"It's going to be hard for anybody who suddenly decides he's going to take Willie Brown out," he said. "I really work at this job. Every day of my life I work at this job. No one is going to be as prepared as I am."

HEADLINE: Aid and Corruption in the Mideast

 BODY:
President Clinton's call yesterday for a new multibillion-dollar international aid package for the Palestinians is a necessary complement to the peace agreement he helped put together in Maryland earlier this fall. That diplomatic deal remains wobbly. It can be reinforced by showing that peace delivers tangible economic and social gains to ordinary Palestinians. But outside financial assistance will be effective only if the Palestinians can curtail corrupt practices in administering the aid.
The additional $400 million in American aid that Mr. Clinton endorsed can also be a means of dissuading Yasir Arafat from following through on his threats to proclaim an independent Palestinian state when the original timetable of the Oslo peace agreement expires next May. 
 About $2 billion in international aid has been provided to the Palestinians since 1993. Most has gone into specific projects, supervised and monitored by the donor nations. The $500 million already provided by Washington has been used to produce better water access for Palestinian towns, loans for local businesses and financing for Palestinian elections. Mr. Clinton now wants Congress to supply additional money for the industrial zones, airport and seaport agreed to in Maryland.
Through careful supervision, Washington and other donor nations can minimize the improper diversion of this assistance. But corruption poses a potentially serious problem in other areas. For example, the Palestinian Authority needs outside funding for community social welfare projects to keep up with those now offered by organizations like Hamas. But such money, much of it flowing through the hands of Palestinian political appointees, is especially vulnerable to misuse by corrupt officials.
An internal Palestinian audit last summer found instances of serious fraud and mismanagement within the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Arafat has not addressed the problem. That cannot be the end of the issue. Palestinian legislators and aid-giving nations must insist that he crack down on corruption. The Palestinian Authority will forfeit both domestic legitimacy and world respect unless it deals firmly with those who steal money meant to improve the lot of the Palestinian people.

HEADLINE: Pataki Leaves Room for Deal on Lawmakers' Quest for Raise

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 30

 BODY:
As the Democratic leaders of the State Assembly proposed a 38 percent salary increase for the state's elected officials, Gov. George E. Pataki reiterated today that he did not think legislators deserved higher pay, but left open the possibility of a deal.
Legislators are returning here this week, ostensibly for the routine business of electing their leaders for next year, but the question on most of their minds is whether they will be able to secure their first raise in 10 years. There is overwhelming support for it in both houses of the Legislature. 
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had a bill printed over the weekend that would raise the base salary for members of the Assembly and the Senate to $79,500 a year from $57,500, starting in January. With stipends for leadership and committee positions, legislators would earn more than $91,000 on average, making them the second-highest-paid state legislators, after California's.
The same bill would increase the annual salaries for the lieutenant governor, the attorney general and the comptroller to $151,500 from $110,000. In a separate resolution, the Assembly Democrats proposed raising the governor's pay to $179,000 from $130,000. (A separate resolution is required because the Governor cannot sign a bill on the topic of his own salary.)
Mr. Pataki has signaled for months that he did not favor a raise, but that he would allow one to become law if he got some legislation he valued in return. The most commonly mentioned candidate is a law allowing charter schools, specialized or privately run schools within the public school system. But the Governor and legislative leaders have had only tentative talks on such a trade.
"I don't think a pay raise for legislators, standing alone, is justified," Mr. Pataki said today. He would not say which factors, when combined with a raise, might justify it.
When asked whether he would veto an increase, he said, "I'm not saying that."
The issue has produced some intricate courting. Legislators badly want a raise, but do not want to be seen as clamoring for it, which they fear would anger their constituents. Many lawmakers do not want to vote on the matter unless they are assured that the Governor will allow it to become law, but he has remained resolutely vague on the subject. And legislative leaders do not want to be blamed if they fail to win a raise.
The majority Republicans in the Senate have not printed a bill, but they left no doubt today that they endorsed the Assembly proposal.
Senator Joseph L. Bruno of Brunswick, the majority leader, said today that the raises in the Assembly bill merely kept up with the level of inflation since the previous raise. "They are a cost-of-living adjustment, not an increase in compensation," he said. "Do I think a cost-of-living adjustment makes some sense? If we're going to vote on anything, then I think that would make some sense."
Legislators' pay has not changed in 10 years. Salaries for statewide officeholders have not changed in 12 years.
The Assembly bill would raise salaries for judges, whose pay last rose six years ago, by 21 percent. The pay for a justice of the Supreme Court, the state's principal trial court, would rise to $136,700, from $113,000.
The bill would also give a 38 percent raise to the commissioners of state departments, many of whom now earn $90,000 to $105,000 and have not had a pay increase in 10 years. The salaries of the Governor's own staff members are not set by statute and have been raised regularly, so that many of the aides now earn well over $100,000 a year.
Mr. Pataki said he favored a pay increase for judges and commissioners but considered being a legislator a part-time job. Legislators protest that the work is full time, even if the Legislature is only in session six months a year, and that most of them do not have outside employment.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Slump As Traders Take Profits

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks had their worst trading session in two months yesterday, as waves of profit taking swept through the market.
The declines were broad based, from computer and drug makers to banks and financial service companies and highly speculative Internet-related stocks. 
 And it occurred on a day when a sharp drop in commodity prices sent bond prices soaring and interest rates sharply lower. By late in the day, yields on the Government's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 5.07 percent.
By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 9,116.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 28.70 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,163.63. And the Nasdaq Composite index, which is loaded with computer-related shares, including a number of Internet companies, fell 66.90 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,949.54. Nearly twice as many stocks fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts had been expecting a correction in the market averages, which had risen almost without pause since early October.
"It's been a wonderful run and prices have risen a lot," said Jack Shaughnessy, the chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston. "For people who have made a lot of money in the last few weeks, it's time to take some profits. But in my judgment, the bull market still has very powerful legs."
Analysts at the ISI Group, a New York research and consulting firm, put the case for a continued run in stocks into historical perspective yesterday. In a weekly letter to clients, ISI noted that the Dow's 23 percent gain since early October, to a record 9,374.27 on Nov. 23, has been matched just four times in the last 30 years.
Following those four prior surges -- which occurred in 1975, 1982, 1986 and 1991 -- the Dow continued to rally over the next three months by an average of 9 percent.
"What is most striking is that the prior surges were all in economic environments similar to today's," the analysts wrote. "Namely, all were financial crisis environments with weakening global activity, declining profits, Fed easings, accelerating money growth and slowing inflation. Judging by the four prior rallies, the current rally will continue until the Fed tightens" monetary policy.
But computer manufacturers, whose stocks have been among the year's biggest gainers, were smacked lower. Dell Computer, which is up more than 175 percent this year, fell 3, to 60 13/16 . Apple Computer, which has gained more than 150 percent since the start of January, slumped 3 1/8, to 31 15/16 . And I.B.M., which is up more than 50 percent, fell 4 7/8, to 165 1/8.
Drug companies, another group that has enjoyed good gains in the last two months, also suffered. Merck fell 3 3/4, to 155 1/8. Pfizer dropped 2 1/16 , to 111 15/16 , and Bristol-Myers Squibb lost 1 3/8, to 122.
Financial stocks, big gainers since early October, also lost ground. J. P. Morgan, a Dow component, fell 4 9/16 , to 106 7/8. Chase Manhattan lost 2, to 63 7/16 , and Merrill Lynch dropped 5, to 75.
Among financial stocks, Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Deutsche Bank for $93 a share, was an exception with its shares rising 1 7/16 , to 87, after boards from both companies approved the deal.
But it was the sharp drop in Internet-related stocks that was perhaps the session's most eye-catching development.
Among analysts and traders, these stocks have been a source of wonder -- and fear -- in recent weeks, because their rapid ascent has been based on little more than hope. According to many, a sharp correction among these stocks has been long overdue.
Profit taking doubtless caused some selling of these stocks yesterday. But reports and rumors that a number of brokerage houses and clearing agents were raising their margin requirements on some of the hottest Internet stocks may also have played a role.
Salomon Smith Barney told clients yesterday that it had raised its margin requirements on a number of Internet stocks, including Ebay, Books-A-Million and Audio Book Club. And DLJ Direct, the on-line stock brokerage owned by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, also increased margin requirements on a number of Internet issues, making speculation more expensive.
"Raising the margin requirements is a prudent thing to do," said one trader who specializes in Nasdaq stocks and asked not to be identified.
Among the Internet stocks, Egg head.com, which operates three retail World Wide Web sites and had more than doubled in the last three trading sessions, fell 6 1/8, to 25 1/2. Amazon.com, the biggest seller of books and music over the Internet, fell 24 5/8, to 192. America Online dropped 7 5/16 , to 87 9/16 . Onsale Inc., a Web auctioneer, fell 36 1/8, to 61 1/2, and Yahoo slumped 24 15/16 , to 192.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News) -- United States bonds posted their biggest gain in three weeks yesterday, as slumping stocks and expectations for benign inflation increased the allure of Treasuries.
The benchmark 30-year bond rose 1 13/32 , to 102 25/32 . Its yield fell 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.07 percent, the lowest since Oct. 21.
Declining stocks from New York to Hong Kong helped bolster the appeal of less risky bonds, traders said.
Following are the results of the auction for three- and six-month bills and 14-day cash-management bills:

Oil and Natural Gas Lead Drop in Commodity Prices
Commodity prices, led by a plunge in oil and natural gas, dropped sharply, pushing one key index to the lowest in 26 years. The Goldman Sachs index of 22 commodities fell 3.97 points, to 133.55. 
 The persistent weakness of commodity prices continues to hobble many emerging-market countries -- from Russia and Indonesia to Mexico and Chile -- that depend on such exports for economic growth and Government financing. Analysts don't expect a turnaround until mid-1999. Page C11.
 
Shell and Texaco End Venture Talks
Royal Dutch/Shell announced that it had broken off talks with Texaco about combining their refining and marketing businesses in Europe because a joint venture would not produce the savings they had sought. The breakdown in that negotiation came as a person close to the merger talks between Exxon and Mobil said that the two companies were still working to complete a deal, which could be announced as early as today.

Volvo to Lay Off 5,300 Workers
Volvo, the Swedish maker of cars, buses, trucks and construction equipment, said that it would lay off more than 7 percent of its work force, or 5,300 workers, by the middle of next year as part of plans to increase productivity and increase profits. The cuts will include 1,000 jobs in the United States. C2.
 
More Sparring in Microsoft Trial

Eisner Friend Comes to Livent's Aid
An investment firm run by a good friend of Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney, agreed to lend more than $23 million to Livent, the Broadway theater company headed by Michael Ovitz. Mr. Ovitz was forced out by his boss and former friend, Mr. Eisner, as president of Disney in 1995. C2.
 
Met Life Executives Face Windfall
As Metropolitan Life Insurance reorganizes so that it can issue stock, the big winners are likely to be the company's executives. The 12 million policyholders are to share a one-time payout of $14 billion. But the executives will be perpetually in line for stock options, bonuses and higher salaries. Market Place. C10.

HEADLINE: For More Textbooks, a Shift From Printed Page to Screen

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
At Virginia Commonwealth University, sociology students use a "textbook" that exists only on line. It sends them to related Web sites, has recorded lectures that they can rewind and offers discussion areas that supplement and enliven their classroom discussions.
At Kent State University next spring, a few dozen students will receive devices called electronic books, loaded with course texts. They will read the works directly from what look like latter-day Etch-a-Sketches. 
 And in Texas, the State Board of Education is planning a pilot program to distribute electronic books and laptop computers next fall to thousands of high school students for use in place of textbooks.
With futurologists having mistakenly predicted the end of the printed page for several decades now, no one is preparing a eulogy for the traditional book. Television did not doom radio, video did not kill film, and electronic publishing will not be likely to end print.
But with two electronic book devices on the market and an exponential increase in reference and scholarly material available on line, many experts say that the shift from page to screen, once a Jetson-like fantasy, is now approaching reality.
And there are those, like Jeff Rothenberg, a senior computer scientist at the Rand Corporation, who say they can see the day when bound books printed on paper will be viewed "more as objets d'art than things we use all the time."
Valerie Raymond, an editor at McGraw-Hill, said: "I am a book person and I never believed I would want to give up the books I carry around with me. But I'm starting to think of myself more as a content provider. I look at my 11-year-old son's school backpack, which I worry is ruining his spine, and I can see advantages to electronic books. We know we are standing on the edge of a precipice."
The notion that a shift is imminent comes because of several parallel developments.
First, electronic book technology is advancing rapidly, with better screen resolution and longer battery life. The cost of such devices is dropping; two kinds of electronic books are on the market for $300 to $500 each, and another, for $1,000 to $1,500, is due early next year. All allow downloading of whole books from the Internet into their memories, permitting students to carry many books in one lightweight device. The devices allow word searches and have built-in dictionary functions.
Second, the amount of material available for downloading is enormous. And third, a generation is coming of age for whom absorbing digital information seems easy and natural. Even if not many young people seem ready to curl up with a hand-held screen for reading a novel, the idea of reading textbook or reference material from screens is increasingly common.
"Ten years ago, anything electronic was exotic," said Paul Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "Today, computers are an integral part of higher education. You can see where electronic books would fit into the shape of academic life. I see this as a key time for this technology, probably still one of interesting failures but ones we can really learn from."
One important change in the last few years is the growing use of the Internet for reference works. Texts for physicians, lawyers and other professionals are being put on line, where they can be updated with greater ease and at lower cost than with printed texts.
In addition, a growing number of textbooks have on-line supplements for graphics, pictures and, increasingly, video and audio supplements. Some think it will not be long before the entire books are transferred into digital format.
John Wiley & Sons, which publishes many texts for professionals in technical fields, says that in the coming months two of its standard reference works -- the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, and the Wiley Encyclopedia of Electrical and Electronics Engineering -- will be available on line.
Like most other reference works on the Internet, those books will be accessible for a fee. That is also the case with an Internet publishing site called Online Originals, (www.onlineoriginals.com) which publishes works of fiction that can be bought for $7 each.
There is also a small trend toward placing texts on the Web that are free, with the publishers relying on contributions or advertising for revenue. Project Gutenberg (www.promo.net/pg/), for example, has placed thousands of classics on line.
And Emedicine.com offers, at no charge, a new encyclopedia for emergency-room physicians. Members of the military in far-flung places and a missionary in Haiti are among those who have told the organizers, Dr. Scott Plantz, a research director at the Chicago Medical School, and Dr. Jonathan N. Adler of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, that they found the site helpful. The site has been financed primarily by Dr. Plantz and Dr. Adler, who hope that advertising by drug companies will ultimately allow the site to pay for itself.
"We have up to 400,000 hits a day," Dr. Plantz said. "A big advantage is that we will be able to update it constantly and embed in it new pictures and even video clips. Our book is two-and-a-half times bigger than any textbook in the field ever published. And a typical textbook is $200."
The market for educational texts was more than $5.5 billion last year, and the Internet has only expanded that market, which has grown more than 8 percent so far in 1998.
And if textbooks really do move further, from the printed page into the digital realm, the potential for profits is likely to be greater still, because that change could reduce the need for warehouses, trucks, returns and, even more significant, the used-book market.
Lynn D. Nelson, a sociology professor at Virginia Commonwealth who wrote an on-line textbook (www.sociologyonline.com) that he now uses, said he found much more "active learning" from his on-line book than from customary books.
"I have two classes right now, and they are both using the Web intensively," Professor Nelson said. "One class has 300 students, and the other has 40. In the large class, the students each write 12 essays and pose questions to each other on the Web. They interact with each other every week, and they can do it on their own time. The level of their activity is inconceivable in a normal class. I see a big difference from before this technology was introduced."
At Kent State, Roger Fidler, director of the information design laboratory, said he planned to test electronic books in classes next spring and fall. The hand-held devices can store 10 to 15 books downloaded from the Internet. He plans to give half of each class the new devices and the other half the usual textbooks.
In Japan, Mr. Fidler says, a company is developing a kind of A.T.M. for train stations, which will distribute digital magazines that a customer could download onto a cassette and then install on a hand-held device for reading. That could prove to be a model for magazines and newspapers in the United States, he said.
Ira H. Fuchs, vice president for computing and information technology at Princeton University, said the key for the future of electronic books was increased screen clarity and lower prices. "People say they love bookstores, but they are buying from Amazon.com," he said. "Give them convenience, and the next thing you know you will be telling your grandchild about this thing you once had called a book."

HEADLINE: BANK GIANT: THE OVERVIEW;
Deutsche Gets Bankers Trust for $10 Billion

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank A.G. formally announced today its plan for a $10.1 billion takeover of the Bankers Trust Corporation and said that the acquisition would result in the elimination of 5,500 jobs, mostly in New York and London.
Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, said the job cuts, which would come from a combined work force of more than 20,000 in the two cities, would not all be at Bankers Trust. 
 Still, the cuts would come at a time of Wall Street retrenchment, as Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and others have recently announced layoffs. About half of Bankers Trust's 20,000 employees work in New York.
The purchase of Bankers Trust would be the largest foreign takeover of an American bank and would vault Deutsche Bank over UBS A.G. of Switzerland and the new Citigroup as the world's biggest bank in assets. The deal is the most vivid illustration yet of how banking has become more global, and it may be a precursor for cross-border deals by others.
In the announcement of the deal here today, there were no platitudes about a "merger of equals" or about the need for deference to cultural and institutional differences. Mr. Breuer made it clear he would shape the new enterprise.
"We don't believe in autonomy as an instrument of management and leadership," he said at a news conference. "As far as it goes, we want a centralized management of the business."
With that approach, Deutsche Bank is trying to avoid repeating past mistakes. During the last decade, it has spent freely to build up its investment banking business -- with largely disappointing results.
Deutsche Bank acquired the British investment bank Morgan Grenfell in 1989, and paid billions of dollars to acquire star bankers and to expand operations in London and New York, giving the bankers wide freedom. When costs began to soar, Mr. Breuer reasserted control, and top American executives defected.
By concentrating power in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank created waves in New York and London. But today, Mr. Breuer seemed to be trying to straddle the desire to maintain central control and the need to retain key executives on Wall Street.
The company has committed some $400 million in bonus payments to retain top Bankers Trust managers, including Frank N. Newman, the chairman and chief executive of Bankers Trust, who will be the only executive receiving a seat on Deutsche Bank's management board. Some Bankers Trust executives will each receive $10 million or more to stay on.
The boards of both companies approved the acquisition deal, which had been expected for more than a week, on Sunday. In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2.2 percent, to 104.65 marks ($61.77), as some analysts expressed skepticism about the proposal.
The goals Deutsche Bank has set for itself -- including an increase in per-share earnings of 10 to 15 percent by 2001 -- are "incredibly ambitious," said Diane Glossman, a banking analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings. "The greatest challenge will be consolidating the cultures in a way that allows them to increase their earnings. That's crucial, and it's an area where Deutsche Bank has dropped the ball before."
On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Bankers Trust rose 1.7 percent, to $87, still shy of the $93 a share offered by Deutsche Bank. The stock has risen 21 percent since speculation of a deal emerged on Nov. 20.
The agreement comes amid a wave of big international mergers by German companies. Daimler-Benz has just completed its merger with the Chrysler Corporation. Bertelsmann A.G., the publishing and media conglomerate, is buying the publisher Random House.
Indeed, Deutsche Bank's agreement with Bankers Trust is only one of three current big German deals. Hoechst A.G., the chemicals giant, has reached an agreement to merge its pharmaceutical and agricultural businesses with those of Rhone-Poulenc of France. And Viag A.G., an industrial conglomerate in Munich, will merge with Algroup of Switzerland in a deal worth $8.5 billion.
In some cases, the mergers reflect a new-found strength and assertiveness in European corporations. But analysts say that many deals are a sign of weakness, reflecting a need to shore up competitive weak spots that companies cannot mend solely through domestic operations.
"Much of this is a corporate response to the difficulties at growing earnings in a low-growth, low-inflation environment," said George Hodgson, head of equity research at ABN-Amro. Collectively, he noted, companies involved in this year's 10 largest European mergers have underperformed the overall European stock market by about 4 percent.
The Bankers Trust deal is expected to draw attention to several lawsuits in the United States against the German bank concerning issues of slave labor during World War II. Though Deutsche Bank did not itself employ slave labor, it has been named in the suits along with industrial giants like Siemens and Daimler-Benz. Lawsuits against Swiss banks about wealth plundered by the Nazis led to a $1.25 billion settlement last summer, largely because New York State regulators insisted on an agreement before allowing a merged Swiss bank to operate in New York.
The New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, is considering filing a lawsuit seeking to block the bank deal because of Holocaust issues, people who had been briefed on the plans said today. Mr. Hevesi's office declined to comment.
The acquisition is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve, but that is not expected to be a major obstacle. Deutsche Bank does own a 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler, and while common in Germany, bank ownership in industrial companies is prohibited under United States banking laws. But Deutsche Bank, which said last week that it was not planning to sell its stake, has an exemption to this prohibition under legislation passed by Congress in 1978.
Deutsche Bank's desire for a big American institution has been no secret. The bank's dominance at home has been eroded by increasing competition, and big Wall Street investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs have been winning lucrative work advising big European companies on mergers and acquisitions.
Deutsche Bank, which had been courting Bankers Trust since the summer, is believed to have also actively looked at possible deals with J. P. Morgan, Credit Suisse Group, Hambrecht & Quist and others.
Bankers Trust would give Deutsche Bank a middle-rank investment banking firm. A subsidiary, BT Alex. Brown, continues to have a strong franchise in taking young companies public, and Bankers Trust itself has a sizable business in underwriting high-yield junk bonds. Though junk bonds are still scarce in Europe, they are attracting new interest as more companies undergo management buyouts.
Both companies have a substantial business in trading fixed-income securities, one of the few areas in investment banking where Deutsche Bank has had real success. And both companies have a big business in the obscure but lucrative area of custodial services, acting as a guardian for securities.
But the takeover of Bankers Trust will not catapult Deutsche Bank into the top ranks of American investment banks, a goal Mr. Breuer has long held.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Breuer contended today that Bankers Trust was Deutsche Bank's ideal partner. The combined company would become the fourth-biggest money manager in the world, after UBS; Fidelity Investments, the American mutual fund giant, and the Japanese postal system's life insurance fund.
To the surprise of many analysts today, Mr. Breuer insisted that he had never wanted to take over a top Wall Street firm and disputed widespread speculation that Deutsche Bank had settled on Bankers Trust simply because it was available.
"This is not a response of the fox to sour grapes," Mr. Breuer said, adding that his bank had never looked at so-called bulge-bracket investment banks at the top ranks of Wall Street.
"The bulge-bracket banks are not universal banks like we are," he said. "Deutsche Bank would have in the end had to become a completely different kind of bank."
The acquisition will force Deutsche Bank to raise new capital to shore up its balance sheet because the $10.1 billion purchase price is far higher than Bankers Trust's tangible value, which is about $5.7 billion.
Mr. Breuer said the bank would organize a new stock offering of 4 billion marks, or $2.35 billion. Without elaborating, he said the bank would raise additional money by issuing hybrid securities, like convertible bonds.
"I now look forward to this next truly major step," said Mr. Newman, who engineered much of Bankers Trust's expansion by orchestrating the acquisition of Alex. Brown and other firms. "I don't speak German, at least not yet," Mr. Newman told a news conference here this morning. "I will take lessons."
But the organizational lineup leaves little doubt that Deutsche Bank executives will be in charge. Mr. Breuer placed himself in charge of the five-member transition team, and Mr. Newman is the only person from Bankers Trust included.
Though Mr. Breuer said he had no interest in additional American acquisitions, he is still on the prowl in Europe. "Expansion in Europe is still in the offing," Mr. Breuer said. Despite the $10 billion being paid for Bankers Trust, he added, money would not be a problem. "Our shareholders, if the story is right, will be more than ready to furnish more money," he said.

Chart: "How Bankers Trust Lost Its Way"

HEADLINE: From Sinatra and Swing, a Station May Segue to Disney

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
WQEW, New York City's only round-the-clock radio outpost of swing, Sinatra, Broadway and big bands, is about to trade in its format of American popular standards for all-day children's programming from the Walt Disney Company as part of a proposed marketing deal, executives close to the negotiations say.
They say The New York Times Company, which owns the station, and ABC Inc., which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, are close to a deal that would pave the way for the formatting change. In effect, it would add WQEW, at 1560 on the AM band, to Disney's national children's radio network, called Radio Disney, which features music, games and stories for the under-12 set. One executive said the target date for the agreement was Dec. 10. 
 The price and terms of the deal -- most likely a so-called local marketing agreement between the companies that would not involve a sale -- have not been announced, and officials at ABC and The Times Company declined to discuss them.
In a marketing agreement, the owner of a radio or television station leases a block of time -- sometimes all its broadcast time -- to another operator. The buyer of the time then arranges the programming and, depending on the agreement, reaps all or part of the advertising revenues.
Employees at WQEW said they had not been told of any coming change, although one said yesterday that a meeting with Times Company management had been called for this morning at the station's headquarters at 122 Fifth Avenue. The station has a staff of about 20, divided among various unions, including the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Questions about their future have not yet been publicly answered. Rumors of a possible sale or business deal have been circulating for weeks, and The Daily News reported on Thursday that talks were under way.
The last Arbitron ratings gave WQEW a weekly cumulative listenership of 649,000, or 2 percent of the radio audience, a "very respectable" share, said Thom Mocarsky, an Arbitron spokesman. He said this ranked 20th out of about 70 stations in the metropolitan area. Half the station's listeners are over 65; the prime age group for radio audiences is considered 25 to 54, but older listeners may have special appeal for some advertisers, like retirement funds.
Stan Martin, the station manager and music host, said the ratings had been "trending upward."
Mr. Mocarsky said that Arbitron counted 391 stations devoted to popular standards as against 38 featuring children's programming, out of the 12,840 stations in the country.
In addition to WQEW, there are four stations in the metropolitan area that emphasize American popular standards, all operating outside New York City with signals that can be heard only intermittently in small parts of the city itself.
If the WQEW deal goes through, it will be the second time in less than seven years that New York City's lone American standards format has lost its home. That type of music reigned on WNEW-AM for many years until 1992, when the station was sold to Michael Bloomberg L.P., which switched to financial news.
The format was then adopted by WQXR-AM, which switched from classical music. The Times Company, with Federal Communications Commission approval, changed the call letters to WQEW. The company continues a classical music format on its other station, WQXR-FM (96.3), which is not involved in the negotiations, executives said.
Where, when and whether show tunes and big bands might find another all-day home on the radio is not clear. Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, said he had heard reports of the possible changeover and had already been talking to parties who might be interested in relocating the format, although he would not say whether they controlled radio stations.
"As just someone who lives this music," he said, "it would be a tragedy if there's not an outlet for it." He said that he was not taking a position on any format change at WQEW and was speaking personally, not as an official of Lincoln Center.
As it happens, Lincoln Center is about to inaugurate a series called "American Popular Standards" under the artistic direction of Jonathan Schwartz, the author and disk jockey who is host of a weekend Frank Sinatra show on WQEW. Asked last week about the reported changeover at the station, Mr. Schwartz said he could not comment.
If the deal goes through, WQEW will become Radio Disney's 36th broadcasting outlet in the nation and its first in New York City.
Radio Disney entered the field aggressively in 1996, after a contentious relationship with a partner, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, a company based in Minnesota that operated 25 stations as Radio AAHS. Children's Broadcasting later sued Disney and ABC Radio Networks, claiming that in violation of their agreement Disney and ABC set up their own competing network, Radio Disney.
Children's Broadcasting won a $30 million judgment in the case this fall from a Federal jury in California. A hearing on motions from both sides is scheduled for Thursday, after which appeals are likely.

HEADLINE: Separatist Premier Keeps Control In Quebec's Provincial Election

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: QUEBEC, Tuesday, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province, possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.
With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday night, the separatist party had 42.8 percent of the vote, compared with 43.6 percent for the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and 12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action. The separatists were expected to win 77 of the provincial assembly's 125 seats, the Liberals 46 and Democratic Action 1, with one seat unfilled because of a death during the campaign. 
 Mr. Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to separate.
The separatists looked like they were going to win the same number of districts in the provincial assembly as in 1994, with roughly the same percentage of the overall vote as in the last election. Mr. Bouchard had been counting on a gain of several seats to solidify his support.
The separatists fell short of the votes they had said they needed to launch a winable third referendum over the next few years to take Quebec out of Canada and form an independent nation of roughly seven million people on the northern border of the United States.
The separatists have lost two previous referendums, one decisively in 1980, the other narrowly in 1995.
Mr. Bouchard's support is strongest among French-speaking voters, who are more evenly spread throughout the province than English speakers, who are concentrated in and around the city of Montreal and who traditionally vote for the Liberals and against separation.
Mr. Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if "winning conditions" existed. While he never defined those conditions, it was widely believed that one of them was a level of popular support above 46 percent.
Voters sided with Mr. Bouchard even though the support for separation has declined. Recent polls indicate that only 43 percent of Quebecers would vote yes in another referendum on independence, a drop of 4 percentage points during the course of the campaign.
"For the past few weeks, I have had the feeling that were it not for the issue of sovereignty, a greater number of English speaking Quebecers would have supported our program," Mr. Bouchard said in a restrained victory speech before supporters here in Quebec.
He mentioned sovereignty only once, repeating his pledge to create the "winning conditions" under which a referendum could be won. But he also acknowledged that the lower-than-expected level of support for his party reflected a dissatisfaction among voters that he could not ignore.
"I respect the signal you sent by choosing candidates who reflect your attachment to Canada," he said. "We have decided to stay the course no matter what political decisions the people of Quebec make for themselves."
What appeared to be taking place, analysts said, is that Quebecers saw this election as a vote on government, not on independence, so separatist emotions were in check. But voters want Mr. Bouchard to keep alive the possibility of another referendum on separation as a way of increasing the province's leverage with Ottawa in upcoming discussions about changes in the shape of Canadian federalism.
Even without a referendum, Mr. Bouchard's re-election would increase tensions and uncertainty in Canada. During the campaign, he said he would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation, forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not just to Quebec but to all 10 provinces.
In one stroke, he silenced the critics in his own party who suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central government, and he undercut the position of Mr. Charest, who equated a vote for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation.
"We don't want, and Quebecers don't want, to be divided during the next four years," Mr. Charest said in a concession speech in his home district of Sherbrooke, where he narrowly regained his seat in the provincial assembly. He said he would not resign, but would fight as leader of the opposition to bring Quebec together.
"The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has," Mr. Charest said.
When Mr. Charest announced last spring that he would challenge Mr. Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little chance of retaining power. Many in English Canada believed that if Mr. Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has been diluted by immigration and demographic change.
But Mr. Charest's campaign never caught on. It is expected that there will now be calls for his resignation, and that of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is against changes to the Canadian federation.
The failure of Mr. Charest to win support in his home province was just one surprise among many in this election that seemed to settle very little except Mr. Bouchard's reputation as one of Quebec's most popular and adept political leaders.
"It's been the strangest election I have ever seen in my life," said Pierre Roy, 61, a retired businessman from Lac Beauport, near Quebec city. "Bouchard's posters said 'Have confidence,' but people are afraid about what's going to happen." Mr. Roy voted just after polls opened at 10 A.M. on a gray day marked with freezing rain and snow in many parts of the province.
While Quebec's future is still uncertain, the outcome of the election was predicted by public opinion polls weeks ago. Unlike past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial markets spiraling downward, the projected results appeared to have been discounted already.
The Canadian dollar actually strengthened slightly , closing at a value of 65 United States cents. The Toronto Stock Exchange declined just under 2 percent on a day when most markets around the world were also down for reasons that had nothing to do with the election here.
The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated fairly by English speaking Canada. Most popular among young voters, the movement seeks to preserve and strengthen Quebecois culture.
The most radical wing of the party pushes for outright independence, but more moderate members say they want to negotiate something less than a separate nation, perhaps an economic relationship with the rest of Canada that allows them to keep their Canadian passports and their Canadian currency but have control over language, culture and many other social considerations.
Separatists have often tried to portray the process of secession as straightforward and relatively painless. But that does not take into account such issues as dividing the national debt, compensation for federal property and Quebec's place in international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The rest of Canada would not vote in a referendum, but would have to negotiate the terms of secession, a difficult process at best. In addition, the Cree Indians who live in northern Quebec and roughly 700,000 English speakers in the Montreal area who want to stay in Canada would be likely to insist on the partition of the province.
The 33-day election campaign -- the shortest in Quebec history -- was marked by a frantic pace of speeches and rallies, and one debate on Nov. 17 that was seen by many viewers as a virtual tie between Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Charest. A third candidate, Mario Dumont, of the Democratic Action Party, also appeared in the debate, and his strong performance was believed to have hurt Mr. Charest.
Overall, the campaign generated little real emotion, despite expectations that it would be a clash of titans. However, the results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction between Mr. Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to holding a third referendum on separation.
Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through another referendum, but that they believe the threat of separation is useful to bringing about changes in Canada.
"There were no people yelling slogans in the street or things like that," said Gilles Paquet, director of the Center on Governance at the University of Ottawa.
"Instead, what you saw today," he said, "is the rational vote by a group that feels it can do better in the Canadian federation by electing a separatist government."
What appears certain is that the results of today's election will set all of Canada on another painful round of introspection and soul-searching about the identity and nature of the country.
This period could be different, however, because Mr. Bouchard -- an experienced negotiator -- has introduced a new element that substantially changes the picture.
In one of the many major shifts in the positions that he took during the campaign, Mr. Bouchard hinted that before calling a referendum on independence, he would push Ottawa for a freer hand in spending on social issues, especially health.
By imposing the requirement of "winning conditions" on another referendum, and by raising the question of negotiating changes in Canadian federalism with Ottawa, Mr. Bouchard has left himself so many options that there is no way to know his exact plans.

HEADLINE: Scientists Seek a New Movie Role: Hero, Not Villain

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"N.Y.P.D. Blue" is a hit. But can an "N.Y.Ph.D. Blue" be one too?
David Milch, the executive producer of the "N.Y.P.D. Blue" television series, is working on a pilot for a similar series about scientists. But compared with cops, he said at a recent conference of scientists and film makers, scientists are a tough sell. 
 "Frankenstein gets a lot of business, 'Nova' doesn't," he said. "Science is out of reach as perceived by the vast, vast, vast majority of people. There are deep misgivings in the public consciousness about the devil's bargain science has made."
Apparently many in Hollywood agree. From Dr. Frankenstein to Dr. Strangelove, from the grave robbers of yesteryear to the cloners of today, scientists in movies are almost invariably mad, evil, antisocial, clumsy or eccentric. And science and technology themselves are usually seen as forces of destruction rather than of good.
In television dramas, scientists barely appear at all, unless one counts "The X Files." Only 2 percent of the characters in prime-time dramas from 1994 to 1997 were scientists, well behind businessmen, entertainers, police officers, doctors and lawyers, according to a survey directed by George Gerbner at Temple University.
Some scientists think Hollywood is guilty of poor casting. "Very few scientists I know are anywhere close to being loony bins," said Dr. James D. Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering the structure of DNA. "A lot of us are more like Michael Douglas -- slightly evil, highly competitive," he added, referring to roles often played by the actor.
Indeed, Hollywood's treatment of scientists is out of synch with that of the press, which generally presents scientists as articulate people making important discoveries. Silicon Valley engineers have become role models in the new economy and cover boys for national magazines. And surveys by the National Science Foundation show that Americans on the whole are more optimistic about science and technology than people in other developed countries.
So now, a few efforts are being mounted to get Hollywood to portray scientists in a more realistic light, as people with more complex drives and emotions. These efforts also aim at getting Hollywood to portray the process of scientific inquiry itself.
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has spent $2 million on a program to encourage more thoughtful treatment of science. It gave a grant to Mr. Milch, for example, to develop his pilot. To influence the next generation of film makers, the foundation, which is based in New York, also offers prizes of up to $25,000 to students at six film schools who make movies about science or engineering.
"There's a basis for the stereotype but there's more than the stereotype," said Doron Weber, an author and former scriptwriter who heads the Sloan project. "Science and technology offer a potential gold mine for screenwriters and film makers -- wonderful, diverse characters and great stories that have largely gone untold."
A group of scientists affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science has been trying to sell the networks on a science drama. And the American Institute of Engineers, a group that aims to improve the image of its profession, is hoping to interest networks in creating an annual black-tie awards show for technology and a series called "L.A. Engineer."
" 'L.A. Law' did marvelous things for the legal profession," said Martin Gottlieb, president of the engineering group.
More than just a desire to feel appreciated, however, is behind such efforts. A better image of scientists and engineers could lead more people into those fields and to greater public support for projects ranging from space exploration to particle accelerators.
"To raise the level of public understanding of science is the work of the Lord," said Dr. Leon M. Lederman, director emeritus of the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory who is spearheading the Advancement of Science effort. Society needs to make complex decisions about technology rationally, he added.
But the gap between scientists and entertainers remains wide. This became clear when the Sloan Foundation brought some eminent scientists here two weeks ago for a series of panel discussions with Hollywood directors and producers. One of the discussions degenerated into a raucous name-calling exchange.
"I don't meet as many scientists who can meet my eyes in conversation as I do people who pump gas," Mr. Milch said. Dr. Watson shot back that Mr. Milch was a "misfit from the Yale English department" who was afraid of science.
Mr. Milch, who was also the co-creator of "Hill Street Blues," said it would be a challenge to get viewers to sympathize with scientists. The drama he is working on will do that by using a "surrogate villain," like a research administrator who treats scientists badly.
Another challenge, he said, is that the scientific method, with its emphasis on repetition of experiments, might by its very nature be "antithetical to the art of story-telling." The top-rated drama "E.R." has lots of medical content in its emergency rooms but is really about the doctors, nurses and patients involved.
But some of the scientists did not see it that way. "The natural world is fascinating in its own right," said Dr. Richard Dawkins, an Oxford University biologist and author of "The Selfish Gene" and other books. "It really doesn't need human drama to be fascinating." In an interview after the meeting, he wondered why "Jurassic Park" had to have any people in it at all when it had dinosaurs.
Carolyn Porco, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona, said that too many movies with science themes were about space battles in the future. "It's always the physical confrontation that TV and movies seem to harp on, when science is the confrontation of ideas," she said. "There's drama just in the quest for the truth."
Dr. Porco was an adviser on the movie "Contact," which starred Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, an astronomer searching for life on other planets. Dr. Porco said the movie presented a fairly realistic portrait of a scientist, but she wondered why the scriptwriters insisted Ellie have a love affair. She said an early script had Ellie sleeping with her thesis adviser. "I know no one who has done that who is a successful female scientist," she said. The panelists seemed to agree that some movies combined scientific inquiry with emotion. One example was "The Race for the Double Helix," the story of Dr. Watson and Francis Crick's competition with other scientists to decipher the structure of DNA. Starring Jeff Goldblum as the young James Watson, it aired on cable television in the United States.
But such examples are rare. Dr. Anne Eisenberg, former head of the humanities department at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, surveyed 100 science-related movies made between 1984 and 1994 and found almost none that portrayed scientists and their accomplishments in a positive light. The most positive, she said, was "Awakenings," in which Robin Williams played a neurological researcher who helped revive nearly catatonic patients.
Steven L. Goldman, a professor of philosophy at Lehigh University, found overwhelmingly negative depictions of science and technology in 100 films made before the mid-1980's, starting with Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" in 1926 and Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" in 1936. Even "Star Wars," which is full of gee-whiz technology, ends with Luke Skywalker defeating the Death Star by turning off his computers and trusting the spiritual "Force," Dr. Goldman said.
One of the most common themes, in movies from "Frankenstein" to "Jurassic Park," is that of scientists trying to play God or technology running amok, with deadly consequences. The premise of the "Terminator" movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is that three billion human beings are destroyed in the future by the computers created using a powerful microprocessor.
In other movies there are heartless scientists, like the ones that wanted to dissect E.T. There are pawns of big corporations, like those in "The China Syndrome." There are demented criminals, like Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy in "Batman and Robin." And there are absent-minded or clumsy nerds, as in "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and "Back to the Future."
Even some laudatory movies show scientists as somewhat emotionally detached. In "Madame Curie," made in 1943, the famous scientist does not react when her husband is killed. "We know from a letter that when they brought her husband's corpse in she hurled herself at it and kissed it and cried," said Spencer Weart, director of the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Md.
To some extent scientists are mistrusted as witches once were, as people possessing secret knowledge or power, Mr. Weart said. But the negative portrayals also reflect more concrete fears of the possible consequences of science, particularly the atom bomb.
"It was perceived in pop culture that science let the atom out of the box and it was a scary thing," said John Copeland, the producer of the television series "Babylon 5." But Mr. Copeland said he thought the portrayal of scientists was becoming somewhat more favorable. "We grew up watching the space program," he said. "We grew up inspired by a type of science."
Next year the Fox network will air "Killer App," the pilot about Silicon Valley created by the Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau and the film maker Robert Altman.
But other efforts still have a long way to go. Dr. Lederman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988 for his work with Fermilab, was able to gain audiences with the heads of some television networks a few years ago, but his project has gone nowhere since. "We're ready to track down the first cousin of Steven Spielberg's cleaning lady," he said.
The American Institute of Engineers sent a proposal to David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul, that was returned unopened, Mr. Gottlieb said.
The Sloan Foundation hopes to have a script for the pilot within a year, but Mr. Milch is still not sure he will be able to produce a workable one. And of the first three student films awarded prizes by Sloan, two portrayed tormented, antisocial scientists, the very stereotype the foundation is trying to fight. In the third film, the student removed the scientific content from the screenplay to make the picture more interesting.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 5, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about science and the movies misidentified the place where the particle physicist Leon Lederman did his Nobel-prize winning research. Dr. Lederman and his colleagues discovered that an elusive subatomic particle known as the neutrino had a cousin, dubbed the "muon neutrino," during experiments in the early 1960's in Upton, N.Y., at the Brookhaven National Laboratory -- not in Batavia, Ill., at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab.

HEADLINE: Governor-Elect Gets Set, Hopes High, Profile Low

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1

 BODY:
For months, Gray Davis was mocked as California's slow but steady gubernatorial candidate. So it was perhaps fitting that he made one of his first full-dress appearances as Governor-elect, at a news conference this week in the children's department of the Los Angeles Central Library, in front of a display copy of "The Hare and the Tortoise."
But since his 20-point victory over State Attorney General Dan Lungren a month ago, Mr. Davis has behaved more like a groundhog, burrowing down in private and reviewing his options as he prepares to take over from Gov. Pete Wilson in January. He surfaced at the library on Monday only to announce his first staff appointment -- that of his Education Secretary, in keeping with his campaign pledge to revitalize the state's sagging public schools. 
 And just as Mr. Davis's calm caution served him well in a campaign that many pundits initially said he could not win, so his low profile seems to be helping him now as he moves to step up from lieutenant governor, put together a new administration and cope with a flood of pent-up demands from Democrats, who have not had a governor from their party since Edmund G. Brown Jr. 16 years ago, and from state employees, most of whom have not had raises since 1995.
Ten days ago the State Legislature's chief fiscal adviser said the new Governor could face a $1.2 billion shortfall in the state budget of about $75 billion that he will be required to outline just a week after taking office on Jan. 4, and other officials have said the gap may be even larger. Mr. Davis, who enjoyed major support from the state's powerful teachers union and has plans for new programs like $10,000 merit raises for teachers who agree to stay in the field, sounded a cautionary note this week about any across-the-board raises.
"I think we'll be looking at very limited" flexibility, said the Governor-elect, who was generally careful during his campaign not to promise much in the way of specific spending.
State economic experts said they did not believe that the projected shortfall, driven by higher-than-expected Medicaid costs and a slowing in economic growth, marked any major downturn in the California economy, which continues to outpace the nation significantly in job growth. Instead, they said, it amounts to a fairly routine dip that could be made up by a strong Christmas retail season and greater-than-expected income tax receipts next spring, by the time the real budget is put together beginning in May.
"I think California is substantially stronger than the nation, so much so that we may be the engine that is preventing a national recession," said Philip J. Romero, Governor Wilson's chief economist. "Much has been made, and quite appropriately, of California exporters' exposure to the Asian downturn. But they're only about 40 to 50 percent of exports, and the next-largest is Europe, which is holding strong. And a couple of mainstay industries, like entertainment and multimedia, have remained strong."
Last summer, with revenue running about $2 billion ahead of projections, pressure grew for election-year tax cuts, and the Legislature and Mr. Wilson agreed to a vehicle fee reduction that will trim about $1 billion in revenue from Mr. Davis's first full fiscal year in office, which starts on July 1. So the wary budget projections give Mr. Davis some welcome political running room.
"You don't have to be a genius" to know that "surpluses are a rare occurrence, and they should be disposed of on a one-time basis," Mr. Davis said. "In my 25 years in public service, there may have been three or four surpluses over that entire time of any consequence."
And Mr. Romero added, "Having some reason to take some time before making major fiscal decisions has the added advantage of being a good idea, given that there'll be a lot of good information available in April and May."
For the moment, Mr. Davis is concentrating on education, the issue that polls showed ranked No. 1 among voter concerns. At his news conference this week, he broke with incoming governors' usual practice of introducing a chief of staff or a finance director as the first appointee and instead named former State Senator Gary Hart, a friend and fraternity brother from their days at Stanford University, as his chief education adviser.
Mr. Hart, former chairman of the State Senate's Education Committee and most recently co-director of the California State University Institute for Education Reform, has long been an advocate of class-size reduction and charter schools.
The Education Secretary's post, which Mr. Wilson created in 1991 to gain greater control over education policy, is only a quasi-Cabinet position, since the Democratic-controlled Legislature has declined to grant formal status to it. The school system is overseen by an independently elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction.
But Mr. Davis said that whatever the title, Mr. Hart would be his chief education policy adviser as he begins his term with a special legislative session intended to focus on improving school accountability, increasing teacher preparation and assuring that every child learns to read by the end of the third grade.
"I am convinced," Mr. Davis said, "that a back-to-basics, high-expectation approach to education will greatly enhance the future prospects" of California's schoolchildren.

HEADLINE: W. F. Baxter, 69, Ex-Antitrust Chief, Is Dead

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
William F. Baxter, who as head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan brought the sharp edge of economic analysis to bear on enforcement decisions, died on Friday at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 69.
The cause was complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Carol Cairns Baxter. 
 Mr. Baxter was the head of the antitrust division from 1981 through 1983. Despite intense objections of lawyers at the Justice Department, he dismissed the 13-year-old suit against I.B.M., concluding that the Government's case made no sense long after I.B.M. had lost dominance in the computer industry. Mr. Baxter also aggressively pressed AT&T to settle its antitrust battle by splitting off the parent company that operated in the long-distance market from the regional companies that monopolized local phone service. That decision was opposed by powerful members of Mr. Reagan's Cabinet.
Paul Joskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, credited the breakup of AT&T with not only transforming the telecommunications industry but also creating the "intellectual template against which other sectors -- like electric power and natural gas -- would later be reformed."
Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and chief economist at the antitrust division under Mr. Baxter, also credits Mr. Baxter with vigorous prosecution of price-fixing, including prosecuting Robert Crandall, the president of American Airlines, for inviting the chairman of Braniff Airways to join forces to raise air fares. The suit was novel because Braniff had rejected Mr. Crandall's invitation, leaving no price-fixing for Mr. Baxter to prosecute. But Mr. Baxter convinced an appeals court that even an offer to fix prices represented an illegal attempt to monopolize.
Mr. Baxter's colleagues said that merger guidelines issued by his division in 1982 were his most enduring achievement. Professor Joskow said that they set a foundation for analyzing mergers both in the United States and other industrialized countries. The guidelines provided a blueprint for antitrust action. No longer would the Government oppose a merger out of a vague sense that a combined company lacked competitors or was too large and would squash smaller concerns. The guidelines established clear questions, focusing on the effect of the merger on consumer prices, that the antitrust authorities would need to answer with state-of-the-art economic analysis.
Mr. Baxter's decisions on I.B.M. and AT&T were widely applauded within the economics profession. But some experts criticized Mr. Baxter for refusing to challenge vertical mergers -- mergers between companies and their suppliers or distributors -- and so-called vertical restraints like resale price maintenance -- the practice of dictating a price below which manufacturers would not allow wholesalers or retailers to charge. Mr. Baxter thought that such practices rarely harmed consumers because they could turn to products of other manufacturers. Yet, he said, resale price maintenance could benefit consumers. For example, it could prevent discounters from driving out of the market those retailers that provided extra service, the cost of which could be passed into their prices.
But even F. Michael Scherer of Harvard University, a critic of Mr. Baxter's attitude toward vertical restraints, said that they were rarely a significant threat to consumers.
Mr. Baxter was born in New York City and spent most of his academic career at Stanford, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1951, a law degree in 1956 and joined the faculty of the law school in 1960. He served in the Navy between 1951 and 1954. He served as a consultant to Citibank and helped write an acclaimed 1977 book on the economic and regulatory issues emerging from the growth of credit cards.
Mr. Baxter did not back away from controversy. He filed a brief before the Supreme Court calling on it to give more leeway to manufacturers to engage in practices like resale price maintenance despite the fact that at least one member of Congress was calling for his resignation over the issue. He declared that the Supreme Court had based opinions on "wacko economic propositions" and that there was "no respectable academic support for the outmoded, jerry-built, amateur, pseudo-economic propositions that underlies some antitrust options."
Peter Temin, an economic historian at M.I.T. who interviewed Mr. Baxter extensively for a 1987 book about AT&T, said that Mr. Baxter was "very convinced of his point of view -- not someone troubled by doubts or introspection."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Baxter is survived by a stepson, Bernard Treanor; three children by a previous marriage to Barbara Metzger Baxter, William F. Baxter 3d, Marcia Baxter Bearman and Stuart C. Baxter; three grandchildren; a brother, Donald J. Baxter, and a sister, Janice Adams.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Sell New Zealand Planes It Denied to Pakistan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The United States has finally found a customer for fighter planes that it sold to Pakistan but never delivered. The incident created a longstanding irritation between the two countries, senior American officials said today.
With Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arriving to meet President Clinton at the White House on Wednesday, New Zealand agreed today to acquire the 28 F-16 fighters on a 10-year lease-buy arrangement for about $105 million, New Zealand officials said. 
 American officials confirmed the arrangement but not the price, and said many details remained to be worked out, including how much money would go to reimburse Pakistan. The deal, with payments spread out over 10 years, will give the Pakistanis something back, but nothing like their original outlay.
Pakistan originally ordered 60 F-16 fighters and had paid some $650 million for 28 of them when a Congressional amendment in 1990 cut off all direct economic aid and military sales to Pakistan. The cutoff was required when President Bush said he could no longer certify that Pakistan was not developing nuclear weapons.
But Washington refused to reimburse Pakistan, since the money had already been spent to build the planes. Since then the United States has been searching intermittently to find another customer, while the planes remain in storage in the Arizona desert.
In 1995 President Clinton said that the situation was unfair and that he would try to rectify it. But an effort in 1996 to sell nine of the planes to Indonesia for $200 million was abandoned because of Congressional objections to that country's human rights record under President Suharto. Although Mr. Suharto resigned this year, Indonesia's economic collapse made it an unlikely purchaser.
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, which has been almost entirely dependent on Chinese expertise and aid, was undertaken in response to India's nuclear program. In May, after India tested nuclear warheads, Pakistan did so as well.
The tests brought down further economic sanctions against both countries, which Pakistan could ill afford.
Today Mr. Clinton waived some of those sanctions, allowing lending to resume by the United States Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and Development Agency.
American officials said last month that the sanctions would be waived as a reward to both countries for agreeing to stop testing and as an incentive for further steps to control the spread of nuclear weapons.
The American and allied effort to defuse a nuclear arms race in South Asia continues, officials said, and will be a prime topic of discussion between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Sharif.

HEADLINE: Universities Again Involved In Joint Ventures in China

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Few nations, if any, have had a more turbulent relationship with the United States in this century than China. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, when roving bands of Chinese slaughtered hundreds of American missionaries, the two nations gradually pulled together and became allies in World War II. But soon after, American and Chinese troops were shooting at each other in Korea, which led to some of the most intense days of the cold war.
The two nations resumed diplomatic relations in 1979, and American educators returned to China, only to pack their bags and depart a decade later, after the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
 Today, despite tensions recently provoked by the Chinese Government's continuing crackdown on democracy advocates, the relationship between venturesome American colleges and universities and China is warming up -- some say sizzling.
The University of Buffalo's M.B.A. program based in Beijing that was terminated in the aftermath of Tiananmen Square will be restarted in January.
Next spring, Temple University will inaugurate a two-year master's of law for some 50 Chinese law graduates and judges in Beijing.
The Yale China Association, originally a missionary organization founded in 1901 and that now supports teachers and medical personnel in China, is being deluged with requests from Chinese institutions seeking partnerships with American schools.
Nancy Chapman, executive director of the Yale China Association, which is an independent affiliate of Yale University, said many of the requests she received came about because her organization was "a known quantity in China."
"The growing interest is mutual," Ms. Chapman said. "The deans of most of the professional schools at Yale -- from the Music School to the School of Public Health -- have visited China recently with the aim of establishing academic ties. That's new."
All told, there are hundreds (not even the Chinese know exactly how many) of academic programs in China resulting from collaborations between Chinese and American colleges and universities, and more are on the way.
Marjorie Peace Lenn, executive director of the Global Alliance for Transnational Education, a nonprofit accrediting agency, said, "It's a growth industry with dramatic numbers even taking into consideration the recent economic downturn in Asia."
Ezra F. Vogel, director of Harvard University's Asia Center, an academic research institution focused on China, confirmed this view. "There's great intellectual ferment and excitement in China about opening what was for so long a closed society," he said. Last spring, Professor Vogel accompanied Neil Rudenstine, president of Harvard, on two visits to China, preliminaries for closer ties in the future.
"China did more than $260 billion in foreign trade in each of the last two years, and with that kind of contact the Chinese need to train a whole generation that's been closed off from affairs outside their country," Professor Vogel said. "China has made more than 100 contacts just with Harvard. They need everything -- information about pollution control, health and medicine, an insurance system, finance, how to get alumni to support a university. There's no end to it."
Wary of overdependence on the West, Chinese officials in the United States speak guardedly about the joint ventures. Dunhuang Xu, chief of the education section of the Chinese Consulate in New York, who spoke through an interpreter, insisted that China had its own highly developed educational system and that all contacts with American colleges and universities must be made in partnership with Chinese schools.
Nevertheless, Mr. Xu acknowledged: "We need to train specialists. Our graduates in these fields must know what to do both inside of China and outside of China."
Despite all of this activity, the internationalization of China is not without difficulties.
"When you first offer your faculty a chance to teach in China, they jump," said Dean Mandell of the University of Buffalo. "But after they've been there once, and discovered that the air in Beijing is pretty dirty and that January in Beijing is not like April in Paris, they aren't so eager to go back. It's a real problem to find faculty who will return year after year."
Given the obstacles, why the rush?
The foremost reason for American interest in teaching in China goes by the name of globalism. In a world that appears to be shrinking with rapidity, almost no one in American higher education wants to be thought of as provincial.
Stephen Trachtenberg, president of George Washington University, sounded the trend in a speech last month: "Internationalism has moved from being an academic ideal to becoming, increasingly, an academic reality." The world, he concluded, is in the process of developing "a planetary education system."
The University of Buffalo has other motives for setting up a joint venture in Beijing, according to Lewis Mandell, dean of the university's School of Management. "We're only 30 percent supported by tax revenues today, and in five years we project that will be down to 15 or 20 percent," Mr. Mandell said. "So we have to run ourselves like a for-profit business. Our China program can bring in a couple of hundred thousand a year. That's a strong reason for doing the program."
In addition, there is the hope the program will add panache to an institution's profile. After the University of Buffalo set up its China program in the 1980's, Business Week ranked the school among the top 40 business schools in the nation, but after the United States State Department cut off financing following the Tiananmen Square massacre and the program was terminated, the School of Management declined in the Business Week rankings.
"We aspire to be among the top 40 once again," Dean Mandell said.
Sometimes even the most high-minded pursuits in China pay off with hard cash. Last year, Oberlin College received an anonymous gift of $6 million in memory of the late H. H. Kung who had been educated at the Oberlin branch in Shanxi Province and gone on to serve as Chiang Kai-shek's chief financier and premier of Nationalist China.
A similar gift was received by Yale University where Mr. Kung had earned an M.A. in economics.
Finally, most experts agree, the old missionary zeal is still alive in the United States, even if disguised in secular dress. Among the best known of the college-affiliated survivors from the China-missionary era are Princeton-in-Asia, the Yale China Association and the Oberlin Shanxi Memorial Association.
"Although we send teachers rather than missionaries to China today, our mission statement written in 1911 hasn't changed," said Carrie Gordon, executive director of Princeton-in-Asia, which is an independent affiliate of Princeton University. "We seek to promote goodwill and understanding and to facilitate in every way the free exchange of the best ideals in the civilizations of both the East and the West."

HEADLINE: Law Easing Property Tax Is Unfair, Study Asserts

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
A New York City law to ease property taxes on co-ops and condominiums has caused new disparities, giving the least relief to the most overtaxed owners while handsomely rewarding wealthy areas that already have relatively low taxes, a government study concludes.
The program is wasting $29 million a year by "giving tax breaks on apartments that don't deserve them," especially in Manhattan's wealthier neighborhoods, while shortchanging other New York neighborhoods, the report said. 
 The report, issued yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office, comes as state authorization for the tax abatements is nearing expiration.
While conceding that the program needs improvement, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has asked Gov. George E. Pataki to place its renewal on the agenda of a special session of the State Legislature this week. But an aide to the Governor said the Legislature has time to address the issue in its regular session next month.
The program was first approved by the Legislature and the Council in 1996 to narrow the gap between the relatively low property taxes on one-, two- and three-family homes, and the generally higher taxes levied on co-ops and condominiums. The comparisons are based on the taxes as a percentage of the market value of the properties.
"Unfortunately, the co-op/condo abatement as currently implemented has seriously worsened the already significant inequities in tax burdens in different areas of the city," the budget office report said. The areas receiving the smallest abatements are those that are the most overtaxed and have "the greatest need for relief," the report said.
The abatements now total $156 million a year for the city's 278,554 co-op and condo owners, with an average savings of $560 per dwelling, the study said.
But the amounts vary widely by borough and neighborhood. Among the boroughs, the Bronx has the lowest average abatement, $265, while Manhattan has the highest, $762. Within Manhattan, the neighborhood averages range from a low of $339 in the East Village to a high of $1,203 in TriBeCa.
Although the tax burden was already lower for some co-ops and condos than for typical one-, two- and three-family homes, the study said the tax abatements were still paid across the board, without regard to need.
For equalizing the tax burden, "an abatement is a particularly ineffective tool," the report said. The director of the budget office, Douglas A. Criscitello, said that "the methods used in many cases compounded the unfairness of the system."
One impetus for the law was the financial turmoil that many co-ops and condos, especially those outside Manhattan, suffered in the recession. "However, three-fourths of all tax abatement dollars flow to Manhattan," the report said.
The biggest concentration of beneficiaries is on the Upper East Side between 59th and 96th Streets, where the co-ops and condos captured 30 percent of the abatements citywide, averaging more than $1,000 per dwelling, the report said.
The budget office, which is independent of the Mayor and the Council, recommended as a short-term fix that abatements be curbed for properties that already have relatively low tax burdens. But over the long term, the report called for a basic overhaul of the city's system of assessing and taxing co-ops and condos.
Under the law, the Giuliani administration was supposed to have submitted a report on a permanent solution to the Legislature in 1996. But the city failed to do so, citing a lack of information, and still has not filed a report.
Speaker Vallone defended the program as a way of retaining the city's middle class. "We have to renew it," he said. But he added, "We'll do whatever we can to make it better."
The director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, Mary Ann Rothman, voiced hope that the budget report "will not throw out the baby with the bath water." She said the disparities are "a small problem compared to all the good the abatement does."

HEADLINE: Strong Auto Sales in November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Unabated growth in demand for sport utility vehicles and pickups, driven by a healthy economy and low gasoline prices, helped bolster DaimlerChrysler's vehicle sales in the United States by 7 percent in November, setting a record for the month.
Demand for light trucks also helped the Toyota Motor Corporation post a November sales record with a 21 percent improvement compared with November 1997. The Honda Motor Company reported today that it had a nearly 5 percent gain. 
 "This year is shaping up as one of the industry's best ever, thanks to sustained strong sales through the fourth quarter," said Yale Gieszl, a Toyota vice president. "The key factors of high consumer confidence and low interest rates should hold steady well into '99."
November's sales report for DaimlerChrysler A.G. was the first since the former Chrysler Corporation and Germany's Daimler-Benz A.G. merged. The results do not include its Mercedes-Benz unit, which will continue to report its United States sales separately.
The auto maker is on track to break its United States sales record set in 1996.
The Nissan Motor Corporation posted another down month, with sales off nearly 13 percent from a year ago. Nissan's only bright spot was its Infiniti luxury division, which posted a 21 percent gain thanks to record demand for its QX4 sport utility.
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company plan to report their November sales Thursday. A General Motors official told Dow Jones today that the company's sales declined by "mid-single digits" in November because of "inventory shortages and a very competitive market."
Among other auto makers that reported sales today, Subaru said it had its best November in 11 years. Its 7 percent increase was due in large part to rising sales of its Forester sports utility vehicle. The Volvo Car Corporation posted a 23 percent gain, Land Rover, a unit of BMW, was up 17 percent, while the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation was down 12 percent and the Kia Motors Corporation declined 11 percent.

HEADLINE: 3 Gauges Put Economy on Different Tracks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The manufacturing sector slowed for the sixth straight month in November as industrial companies felt the effect of the global financial crisis. But a separate measure suggested the economy would improve by mid-1999, while the Government reported a modest rise in construction spending.
The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks the manufacturing sector through a survey of corporate purchasing executives, said new orders, exports and imports declined at many of the nation's factories last month. The group's index of economic activity registered at 46.8 percent, down 1.5 percent from October. Any reading under 50 percent is a sign that the industrial sector is contracting. 
 The index also inched closer to the association's benchmark of 43.6 percent, which it says is the point at which the broader economy is in recession. The economy has grown 91 straight months, though the rate has slowed, the report said.
In a separate report yesterday, the Conference Board, a private research group, reported its index of leading economic indicators rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October, to 105.6. The gain followed two months of flat results.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said United States construction spending rose a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent in October, the fifth consecutive increase.
The purchasing managers survey is closely watched because it is the freshest evidence of how the economy fared in the previous month. The leading indicators are widely viewed as a forecast of how the economy will fare six to nine months ahead.
The leading indicators index advanced less than anticipated, and four of its components posted fairly steep declines, led by unemployment insurance claims.
Vendor deliveries, manufacturers' new orders and consumer expectations also slipped. Six of the index's 10 components rose in October, led by money supply. Others that improved were building permits, the average factory workweek, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, stock prices and the interest-rate spread.
The Conference Board attributed the overall improved outlook to the rebounding stock market and the Federal Reserve's decisions to trim interest rates three times this fall.

HEADLINE: Testimony on Microsoft's League of Its Own

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
At an industry meeting in February 1997, an official of the Microsoft Corporation vowed that his company "wouldn't be cowboys" by altering the Java programming language on its own, an executive of Sun Microsystems Inc. said in testimony released today. Seven months later, he testified, Microsoft did just that, in an effort to eliminate "the threat posed by Java technology to Microsoft's operating system monopoly."
In direct written testimony made public today, Dr. James A. Gosling, a vice president of Sun and the chief scientist of its Java software division, opened a new line of attack by the Justice Department in its antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft: the company's move to tailor its version of Java for its Windows operating system, making it incompatible with the standard Java language developed by Sun. 
 Microsoft's changes to Java are also the subject of a private contract suit in California in which a Federal judge two weeks ago ordered Microsoft to make its version of Java compatible with Sun's version within 90 days.
In the antitrust trial, the Government contends that Microsoft's Java strategy is part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices that the company took to stifle competition and maintain its dominance in the market for personal computer software. The Government asserts that the combination of Java, an Internet programming language, and the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web, which was pioneered by the Netscape Communications Corporation, posed a potent threat to Microsoft.
The essence of that threat was the promise that programs written in Java could run on any operating system. Traditional software runs on only one operating system, and because on more than 90 percent of personal computers that operating system is Microsoft's Windows, software developers have long written mainly for Windows. That tends to lock in the company's dominance.
In his 35 pages of testimony, Dr. Gosling said that he created the Java programming language in 1991 to free programmers from the limitation of "platform-specific software." But in September 1997, Dr. Gosling said, Microsoft introduced an upgraded version of its browser software, Internet Explorer 4.0, that was linked to Windows "in ways to undermine the cross-platform promise of Java technology."
An expert programmer whose resume includes a dozen patents, Dr. Gosling testified that what Microsoft had done to the Java programming language was "analogous to adding to the English language words and phrases that cannot be understood by anyone else."
Microsoft says that the Government and Sun are misrepresenting both its actions and its motives. Its changes, Microsoft says, were introduced to overcome the shortcomings of standard Java and make it run better on Windows. Sun's motto for Java, "Write Once, Run Anywhere," has proved a wonderful marketing slogan but not a real-world description of the language's capabilities, Microsoft insists.
Indeed, many programs written in Java today do have to call directly on a specific operating system to work properly. But Sun has one way of enabling these "native" calls on the operating system, while Microsoft has another. That difference is the crux of Sun's California case and of the Government's claim that Microsoft has tried to "pollute" Java.
In the courtroom today, Microsoft's pricing practices also became a focus of debate as Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, an economist, used an internal Microsoft document to analyze the prices the company has charged personal computer makers from 1990 to 1996.
In terms of both antitrust and economics, two key indicators that a company has monopoly power are its ability to raise prices and its ability to exclude competition. The Microsoft document showed that the average price computer makers paid for its operating system rose from $19.03 in 1990 to $49.40 in 1996. Over the same period, the operating system's share of the total cost of a personal computer rose fivefold, from five-tenths of a percent to 2.5 percent.
Mr. Warren-Boulton pointed to the pricing trend as proof that "Microsoft's monopoly power is increasing, or the extent to which it is exerting that power is increasing."
Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said that the operating system had improved over the years, adding many new functions and capabilities. In 1990, many computer makers loaded new computers with Microsoft's basic DOS operating system, while by 1996 the industry had shifted to Windows 95, which is both more expensive and richer in features.
Besides, Mr. Murray added, "The Microsoft operating system remains a relatively small percentage of the total cost of a personal computer."

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE ADVISER;
J. P. Morgan'sRole in a Changing Oil Industry

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
When it comes to merger advice, J. P. Morgan isn't the brand name that first comes to mind. Unless you're rooting around in the oil patch.
The company's energy bankers were in the executive suite with the Exxon Corporation's chairman, Lee Raymond, advising him on yesterday's announced $80 billion takeover of the Mobil Corporation. They were at the table with British Petroleum executives when it agreed to buy Amoco Corporation for $42.8 billion last August. And in their spare time, they advised the Belgian oil concern Petrofina S.A. in its $13 billion sale to Total S.A. of France, which was announced yesterday, too. 
 With a possible $100 million fee to be divvied up between lawyers and bankers, champagne corks are popping at Morgan. Especially for Rod Peacock, the banker who co-heads Morgan's global natural resources and power investment banking group. Mr. Peacock is clearly enjoying his role at the center of Morgan's energy effort, where he not only led the teams which worked for both Exxon and British Petroleum, but also represented Mobil in its $5 billion European joint venture with British Petroleum in August 1996.
After a brief stint as an analyst at British Petroleum right out of college -- he graduated with a degree in engineering science and economics from Oxford's Magdalen College in 1970 -- he was hired by Morgan as an energy analyst. But in 1982, eight years later, Mr. Peacock traded in his spreadsheet for pin stripes and has since worked as an investment banker specializing in the oil and gas industries, with offices in both New York and London. "It's interesting to witness the complete restructuring of this industry at this time," he said.
Of course, knowing the right people helps insure a seat at the table. Mr. Raymond, Exxon's chairman, sits on Morgan's board, for one thing. Ferrell McClean, who co-heads the group with Mr. Peacock, said Mr. Raymond had discussed the idea of an Exxon deal with Morgan's chairman, Douglas A. (Sandy) Warner 3d last summer. Then, she said, Mr. Warner and Mr. Peacock met with Mr. Raymond to discuss where the oil and gas industry was headed.
Since then Mr. Peacock has been quite busy. He concedes he has few hobbies, having quit coaching his son's soccer team a few years ago because he couldn't commit the time he wanted to. But he still finds time to run. And he is demure about his age -- "something in the late 40's" is all he'll say -- and jokes that he never met the Beatles even though he grew up in Liverpool, England.
Mr. Peacock is clearly uncomfortable talking about himself: he answers questions in short sentences and stresses the team effort at Morgan. He mentioned, among others, Jeremy Wilson, a senior member of his group, and Ms. McClean, who said she was good friends with Mr. Peacock's wife and had helped plan the Peacock's wedding reception. When asked about his favorite deals, he mentioned, not surprisingly, the last three deals he has worked on. That could be, in part, because of the huge fees that are likely to be earned by Morgan for its effort.
Morgan and Goldman, Sachs & Company, which advised Mobil, are mum about how much money they are likely to earn. But industry executives say all of the advisers -- including lawyers and bankers -- could earn $100 million in total. About half that, some industry executives estimate, could go to Goldman and Morgan. Exxon was advised by lawyers at Davis Polk & Wardwell, and Mobil hired lawyers from Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. By contrast, investment banks earned $115 million in fees when Chrysler merged with Germany's Daimler-Benz earlier this year, according to the Securities Data Company.
But clearly, if recent events are any indicator, talent in the once sleepy industrial sector is premium. Mac Heller, head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman, Sachs and who has a background in the oil and gas sector, was the lead banker on the team for Mobil. And Goldman recently offered partnerships to two recruits in the industrial sector: Michael J. Carr, who co-headed the mergers and acquisitions team at Salomon Smith Barney, and more recently Gordon E. Dyal, who sat across the table from Mr. Peacock when Mr. Dyal represented Amoco while an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

HEADLINE: Gates Giving $100 Million To Fight Childhood Disease

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, and his wife, Melinda, will announce a gift of $100 million today to speed the delivery of vaccines against four childhood diseases to developing countries.
The gift is believed to be among the largest single private donations for health care. It will go to a nonprofit health organization in Seattle to find better ways to distribute recently developed vaccines. 
 The donation, to be announced in New York City, is Mr. Gates's second largest, and it comes as he is battling Government antitrust charges in Federal District Court in Washington. But Mr. Gates said in an interview that the donation was part of his expanding philanthropic effort, and that its timing with the trial was coincidental.
Mr. Gates is the world's wealthiest person, with an estimated net worth of at least $60 billion. Mr. Gates, who has been criticized for not being more generous, said he and his wife had given $2 billion to create two foundations. A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said $164 million had been distributed. Mr. Gates has also said he would eventually give away about 95 percent of his fortune.
Asked why he waited to make such gifts, the 43-year-old Mr. Gates said in the interview: "You can always look back and say, 'Hey, I could have sold all my Microsoft stock when I was 30 years old,' but that would have been worth a small fraction of what it is now, and that would have been all my philanthropy."
The donation today comes from one of his foundations, the $1.8 billion William H. Gates Foundation, and is being made to the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, or PATH, an organization based in Seattle. The group plans to focus on four recently developed or about to be marketed vaccines against respiratory, intestinal and liver diseases.
Two vaccines prevent respiratory ailments caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib, and streptococcus pneumoniae. The other two vaccines prevent rotavirus infection, which causes severe diarrhea, and hepatitis B, a viral liver disease.
The foundation said the four diseases account for 2.5 million childhood deaths a year, or about one-third of the World Bank's estimate of annual childhood deaths from infectious diseases worldwide.
In the United States, illnesses caused by Hib bacteria, which include ear infections and meningitis, have nearly disappeared as a result of vaccinations that begin at 2 months. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for routine infant immunization.
Earlier this year the Food and Drug Administration approved an oral vaccine against rotavirus. It is recommended for infants beginning at the age of 6 weeks. Approval for an improved vaccine for use in infants under 2 years against streptococcus pneumonia is expected soon, a spokesman for Mr. Gates said.
Vaccines of this type generally must be given more than once, at intervals, to be effective.
None of the money will be used to buy the vaccines, however. Mr. Gates and PATH officials said the money, at least in the early stages, would be spent finding ways to make the vaccines widely available to children in developing countries.
In recent years pharmaceutical companies have used genetic engineering and other techniques to make more technologically complex but more expensive, vaccines. Although such vaccines usually become widely available for children in developed countries, they are out of reach in poor countries.
Without intervention, Mr. Gates said, it might be years before children in poor countries receive these vaccines.
PATH was founded to improve the health of women and children in the United States and abroad. Dr. James Maynard, a PATH official, said the organization received $750,000 from Mr. Gates's foundation in 1995 and an additional $2.1 million this year to support family planning and related activities.
A Web site (www.rho.org) is designed to keep the staff at family planning clinics, particularly those with few financial resources, current about AIDS, reproductive tract infections, female genital mutilation and other public health issues.
PATH has also focused on providing hepatitis B immunization and says it has grown increasingly concerned about the cost, distribution and other problems that developing countries face in buying the newer vaccines, Dr. Maynard said. Donor fatigue is setting in, he added, and there is a growing concern that in some countries the money spent on costlier vaccines has been taken from funds earmarked for paying immunization workers and supporting health systems.
Dr. Maynard said PATH intends to improve vaccine administration in as many as 18 countries in the next 10 years by developing partnerships with the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and other international groups. Aided by the Gates donation, PATH intends to try to lower the cost of vaccines and maintain a steady supply of them through cooperative efforts of pharmaceutical companies, scientists, the World Bank, W.H.O., Unicef and international health organizations.
Among the things that PATH said it intended to do were these:
*Conduct international meetings to develop agreements on the appropriate storage conditions for and uses of vaccines.
*Develop model immunization programs to establish the cheapest and most efficient ways to introduce new vaccines and to prove that they can be delivered as effectively as in developed countries.
*Determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccine programs.
*Create Web sites, publications, videos and other educational programs to speed up introduction and acceptance of new vaccines.
*Explore the use of vaccines on a regional basis to combat other conditions like Japanese B encephalitis in parts of Asia and yellow fever in Africa and South America.
The four vaccines will complement six others already financed through a global program directed at curbing diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus and tuberculosis. The program, organized through United Nations agencies, has raised the level of protection of the world's children to 80 percent from 5 percent in the early 1970's.
Mr. Gates said he and his wife would focus their philanthropy on a widespread distribution of the latest advances in medicine and information technology. Last year Mr. Gates's library foundation, Libraries Online!, gave $200 million to establish a five-year program to bring new computers and the Internet into the nation's public libraries.

HEADLINE: Boeing Sees Big Job Cuts Over 2 Years

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that the economic downturn in Asia was forcing it to scale back production of many passenger jets beginning next year and to cut more jobs over the next two years -- perhaps as many as 20,000 -- than it had indicated in June.
As a result, Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the nation's largest exporter, also said that its 1999 earnings would be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, lower than the already greatly reduced estimate of $2 billion it gave investors last summer. Operating margins in 2000 would be even lower than 1999, the company predicted. 
 The announcement came as Boeing is still struggling to recover from a disastrous decision in 1996 to raise airplane production to record levels in order to meet booming demand from the world's airlines. The company ended up taking $4 billion in accounting charges and posting its first annual loss in 50 years in 1997 after its factories buckled under the strain.
Boeing is still committed to delivering 550 planes this year and a record 620 in 1999. Workers toiled through the Thanksgiving holiday to finish jets even as the company has been desperately trying to reduce its staffing from a June high of 238,000 in order to bolster profits.
Boeing had previously estimated that it would eliminate as many as 28,000 jobs by the end of next year. Yesterday it said that it would increase that estimate to as high as 38,000 and for the first time added that it expected to cut as many as 10,000 additional positions by the end of 2000.
Lawrence McCracken, a Boeing spokesman, said that the company had not yet worked out the specific details of which jobs will be eliminated. But he said that the reductions would come from all over the Seattle-based company, from the factory floor to the headquarters suites.
"Some of the cuts will be handled through attrition," he said, "but at those levels not all of them." Boeing currently loses about 5 percent of its employees each year due to attrition, he added.
The International Association of Machinists, which represents 40,000 Boeing workers and will begin contract negotiations next summer, lashed out at the company yesterday.
"If this is what we have going into negotiations, then we're in for some trouble," said Bill Johnson, president of the Boeing local.
Some analysts said the job cuts were overdue and should go deeper because Boeing, which had been slow to modernize its production methods, produced less revenue per employee than its main competitor, the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
But others were disappointed that Boeing was trimming its profit forecasts for 1999 and 2000 after shocking investors in July, when it announced estimates that were one-third lower than the forecasts of most analysts at that time.
"I thought the basic goal was to move the numbers down last summer so you could give people a positive surprise," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York.
Mr. Heymann had been a leading bear on Boeing stock until the last few months, when he began recommending it in the belief that the company was turning itself around.
"It sounded like they were slowly getting it wired back together," he said. "It ain't quite working the way we thought it was."
Peter S. Jacobs, an aerospace analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, Inc., a brokerage firm in Seattle, said he was heartened that Boeing finally seemed to be making a realistic assessment of the damage caused by the recession in Asia.
Boeing said that it would cut production of its 747 jumbo jet to two a month from 3.5 a month in late 1999 and might even cut production to one a month in early 2000 if demand does not pick up.
The 747, the largest commercial airplane on the market, is most popular on Asian routes and is also Boeing's most profitable model because after 30 years in production its development costs have long since been written off.
Boeing also said that in early 2000 it would cut production of the single-aisle 757 to four airplanes a month from five a month and production of the wide-body 767 to 3.5 a month from four a month. Production of the wide-body 777, which had been scheduled to be reduced to five a month from seven a month late next year and then return to seven a month in 2000, will stay at five a month, the company said.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE SCENE;
Penitents Called by G.O.P. Speak on Perils of Perjury

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The way the Judiciary Committee billboarded the day's hearing -- "The Consequences of Perjury" -- had the ring of the pulpit to it, much as the sermon topic "The Wages of Sin" has generated countless spiritual revivals across American history.
Revival was most definitely the Republicans' hope, with their attempt to impeach President Clinton still failing to win over the American public. But instead of fire and brimstone, the Republican majority presented two penitent miscreants -- two ordinary American women who were convicted and seriously punished by the Government for having lied under oath about their sex lives. 
 As the two told their tales today, the impeachment inquiry, for all the rush toward the New Year's deadline, took a poignant tangent. The inquiry devoted its second public hearing to the Republicans' effort to stoke popular concern about the President's sex-and-mendacity scandal in the face of perjury crime and punishment. Expert lawyers and retired military officers were called and spoke from constitutional theory, while the women spoke from bitter experience.
One woman told of doing jail time and losing her career in coaching women's basketball when she filed a libel suit and lied about visiting a gay bar. The other, freed from home detention to testify, sadly told of being furtively tape-recorded and demolishing her career as a Government psychiatrist in April by lying about a single act of sex in the workplace.
"Thank God I could finally say 'I'm guilty,' " Pam Parsons, the former coach, told the lawmakers as she described her "spiraling journey through hell" in trying to keep the truth from public notice. "When you're in a leadership position, no matter what it is you must tell the truth about, you've got to search your soul and recognize what it means if you don't."
Republicans beamed at this and even more when her fellow felon, Dr. Barbara Battalino, drove the point home: "Because a President is not a king, he or she must abide by the same laws as the rest of us."
Democrats shied from any hostile questioning of the two obviously sympathetic witnesses, and Bob Inglis, South Carolina Republican, exulted. "You have done what nobody else has been able to do," he told them. "You have just thrown a wrench in the White House spin machine."
But on closer hearing, the committee excursion touched on some of the same basic predicaments the nation has sensed. For -- the disgraced coach finally warned -- every team needs a coach.
"We were ranked second in the nation, 7 and 0, kind of like the economy -- doing very well," said Ms. Parsons to gentle laughter in recalling how her team at the University of South Carolina suffered its own downfall after her departure. "I sense that one thing we don't need right now is to not have a leader, in a world where leadership matters."
The committee's delving into the consequences of perjury took a midday detour when the Republicans opened a second front into an old Capitol Hill scandal topic, the wages of campaign financing. Democrats fumed as subpoenas were voted along party lines for confidential Justice Department memorandums that argue for an independent counsel to look into Clinton campaign financing -- a topic that fully frustrated Republicans in two earlier Congressional investigations.
"It's justifiable that we take a look," said Henry J. Hyde, the committee chairman, as Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, dismissed the action as the "wild goose chase of the week."
"This is the last desperate gasp of a group of people who were determined to impeach the President and haven't yet gotten their way," Mr. Frank complained as the Republicans won the vote.
The perjury topic was tackled by a panel of legal scholars and retired military officers who spanned a familiar spectrum. "The initial wrongdoing was not criminal and did not, in contrast to that of Richard Nixon, entail the abuse of power," said Elliot L. Richardson, who resigned as Attorney General when President Nixon tried to thwart the Watergate inquiry. But Adm. Leon A. Edney, who is retired from the Navy, said the President's leadership of the military "must be based on principle, not litigious double talk."
The hearing room was far from filled, with louder outcries over impeachment in the corridors and in the offices of members openly wondering how the Congress might resolve such a firmly unpopular issue.
"Take control of this runaway train before we go over a cliff," pleaded Senator-elect Charles E. Schumer of New York, finally voicing before the hearing the Hill's growing Democratic chorus that the incoming Speaker, Robert L. Livingston, must step into a momentous inquiry he has assiduously avoided.
But Representative Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, countered: "I am now asking the President of the United States to help us." Come forward before the American people, Mr. Graham pleaded. "Do what these two ladies have done," he continued as the two women sat mutely, as they had to through most of the day's partisan speechifying. As they were finally allowed to go, Mr. Graham saluted the two as "real people who've suffered real consequences for something that we're all wrestling with."

HEADLINE: Hartford Area Can Afford Stadium Without Charging Taxpayers, Study Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Hartford area has enough residents, wealthy people and big corporations to pay for a $350 million football stadium for the New England Patriots without taxpayer support, a financial analysis released today showed.
The state would do a little bit better than break even, gaining $3.4 million over the 30 years of the bonds issued to pay for the stadium, road improvements and other amenities, according to the analysis by KPMG Peat Marwick. 
 The report, which cost $57,000, was commissioned by Gov. John G. Rowland's budget office and a regional economic development group.
"The Governor has been very clear -- he's been emphatic -- that this stadium can be paid for by something that would not be a burden on the taxpayers of Connecticut," said Brendan Fox, the chief legal counsel for Governor Rowland. "What this report proves is that the stadium does in fact pay for itself."
Many questions remained unanswered, however, including how much it would cost the state to move a steam plant and clean up pollution on the site proposed for the stadium. The state also needs to find out whether costs can be cut by using tax surpluses to pay for some of the stadium in cash.
Legislative leaders said they had not read the report in detail and would not comment on it.
The analysis found the Hartford area's financial resources comparable to those of many new National Football League cities, including Jacksonville, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C., and Nashville.
The stadium is estimated to cost $350 million, or $375 million when inflation is considered. If the state pays for the stadium by issuing 30-year bonds, it would run deficits of several million dollars for the first 10 years and would break even and eventually turn a modest profit after that, according to the report.
Most of the state's revenue would come from a 10 percent surcharge on ticket sales. The report also predicted that the state would gain millions through income taxes, sales taxes and other related business taxes. The proposed 68,000-seat Patriots stadium includes 6,000 luxury club seats and 125 to 150 luxury boxes for corporations to buy.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE BIG DEALS OF EUROPE;
Some Mergers Are Made in Weakness

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The idea behind any merger is that bigger is better. But the wave of giant mergers in Europe this week reflects something else as well: weakness.
Some of Europe's mightiest enterprises face significant competitive weaknesses. Germany's biggest banks have lost ground in their own market to Wall Street investment banks, while intense competition has squeezed profits out of commercial lending. 
 Rock-bottom oil prices have sent the world's biggest petrochemical companies flying into each other's arms. And in the pharmaceutical industry, plans by Hoechst A.G. and Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France to merge their drug and agricultural chemicals businesses mark a union between two companies with an abundance of problems.
"It's clear that neither Rhone-Poulenc nor Hoechst compare well yet in terms of operating profits," admitted Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, just before the companies announced their plans here.
And when asked why neither company had sought a stronger American partner, executives suggested that they did not have much choice.
"Which American companies?" asked Jurgen Dormann, the chairman of Hoechst, based in Frankfurt. "Merck? Monsanto? Would they have been interested?"
But industry analysts argue that broader pressures are behind Europe's urge to merge. Inflation has sunk so low here that few companies have any room to raise prices and some are being forced to cut them. That has made it harder to deliver the kinds of growth in profit that entice shareholders.
The introduction of the euro as a single currency for 11 countries in January adds to the competition and price pressures.
"These are companies basically on the defensive," said Bryan Allworthy, a European equity strategist with Merrill Lynch. "They have no pricing power. They are seeing challenges to their market shares or their business lines. They know they have to do something."
But in their race to do something, corporate executives are running into a wall of skepticism from investors. Rhone-Poulenc's stock dropped 6 percent in early trading today, even though the elements of today's deal had been well known for more than a week. Deutsche Bank stock has declined amid a torrent of criticism from analysts about its $10.1 billion takeover of Bankers Trust.
And when news was heard today that Total, the French oil company, was about to take over Petrofina of Belgium, its stock plunged nearly 10 percent in early trading.
Europe has never seen so many billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions in one year, and nowhere near so many big deals announced in one week. Viag A.G., the Munich-based industrial conglomerate, reached an agreement to merge with a Swiss packaging company. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, announced its $10.1 agreement on Monday to buy Bankers Trust. Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc will pool their drug and agricultural sciences businesses to create a company with $20 billion in sales.
Executives in both the oil and chemical industries predict more big deals in the months ahead, as both industries struggle with slumping demand and falling prices.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE REACTION;
Experts Hail a Giant Deal, But Motorists Are Dubious

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
With oil supplies abundant and gasoline cheaper than bottled water, industry executives and even some consumer groups contended yesterday that consumers are unlikely to feel any immediate impact from a merger of Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two biggest oil companies.
They do, however, expect antitrust regulators to insist that the combined company sell some operations to keep it from using its considerably increased bulk to raise prices. 
 "The combination in and of itself won't have any impact," said Robert I. Hanfling, a Washington consultant and former Energy Department official. In fact, he and others said, the deal may ultimately prove beneficial to consumers if it leads to stronger exploration efforts that insure a plentiful supply of oil for years to come.
But at the gasoline pump, some people were skeptical. "They'll put their marketing skills together and get as much for their gasoline as the market will bear," Carl Fischer, a Dallas motorist, said.
Aaron Manning, a New York cab driver, saw dire consequences as he bought gas at an Exxon station at 23d Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan.
"It's going to be a monopoly and it's going to drive the price up," he insisted. "We will have to pay whatever they put here." And if gasoline prices rise, he said, he wants cab fares to follow -- though he doubts that they will.
The divergent views reflect the suspicions some consumers have of enlarging companies that are already giants, and the ambivalence that even some in the industry have. But oil executives argue that a bigger, more efficient oil giant should benefit consumers.
Charles J. DiBona, former head of the American Petroleum Institute, the main trade association for large oil companies, said the Exxon-Mobil deal would give the combined company more muscle to negotiate with foreign governments for drilling rights or to build offshore platforms costing $1 billion or more. That, in turn, should help keep prices under control when demand picks up.
C. Paul Hilliard, president of a small oil company in Louisiana, agreed. The Exxon-Mobil deal is "good for consumers, at least in the short term," he said, partly because he expected the combined company would find it easier to make a profit despite persistently low oil prices.
But those low prices, and more efficient oil giants, are likely to put more pressure on small companies like his family-owned Badger Oil Corporation in Lafayette. "We'd rather that at $9 a barrel, they were losing money," Mr. Hilliard said, since that would force the big oil companies to consider cutting back on their production.
Others who see their businesses threatened by industry consolidation include Emanuel Silvia, a service-station operator on Cape Cod. "I think eventually they're all headed to do away with people like myself -- push us little guys out of business," said Mr. Silvia, proprietor of Sonny's Gulf in North Truro, Mass. "Exxon's going to have more buying power. They'll control the market and the prices."
Some consumer groups expressed concerns whether regulators would be able over the longer term to restrain the market power of a colossus like Exxon-Mobil.
"If the antitrust authorities fail to block a merger between the No. 1 and No. 2 United States oil companies, it will predictably lead to more mergers and an even higher level of industry concentration," leaders of two groups founded by Ralph Nader said in a statement.
"The proposed merger will predictably raise consumer prices, especially in the many areas where Exxon and Mobil compete directly," contended James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, and Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential Action.
Politicians also weighed in, seizing an seemingly irresistible chance to suggest that it might be a mistake to permit partial restoration of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, which was broken up in 1911.
Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, the state where Rockefeller began his career, said he would ask the Federal Trade Commission to delay its decision on another pending industry combination, that of British Petroleum and Amoco; officials at those companies have said they hope to complete their merger by the end of the year.
Mr. DeWine, chairman of the Senate's antitrust subcommittee, called the Exxon-Mobil deal "worrisome" and said it would be wrong for the F.T.C. to consider either proposal in isolation.
Meanwhile, Connecticut's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, said he would investigate the merger proposal and help lead a multistate inquiry in cooperation with Federal authorities to make sure that it does not stifle competition. Mr. Blumenthal is chairman of the antitrust committee of the National Association of Attorneys General.
Consumer groups and industry officials agreed that the dominance of an Exxon-Mobil in local areas was far more important than its overall size nationally, since motorists -- particularly if their tanks are low -- can only drive so far for a fill-up.
"The market is truly local," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "This deal should not go forward without a divestiture in markets where there would be high concentrations."
Yet Mr. Kimmelman said he was not as upset by the prospect of an Exxon-Mobil combination as he is with pending deals in the telecommunications industry, which he said should be blocked "absolutely."
Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, expressed even less concern, acknowledging that market forces -- not companies or OPEC -- determine the price of crude oil and that technology can bring it from increasingly deep levels under the sea and permits far greater drilling accuracy onshore.
"It's a triumph of economics over the politics of monopoly" that a deal of such magnitude as Exxon-Mobil could be considered, Mr. Cooper said.
Mr. DiBona, formerly of the petroleum institute, said that the merger would have minimal, if any, impact on consumers.
"The oil industry was and is not a concentrated industry," he said, pointing to competition from independent competition at every stage, from Hunt Oil exploring in Yemen to Cumberland Farms retailing gasoline in New England. "There's always new people coming in to this market, that's what keeps it highly unconcentrated."
And back at the gas pump, some consumers doubted prices would rise as a result of the merger, but were more worried about the workers. "I don't think it's going to affect us at the pump," said Frank Ross, at a Mobil station in Chicago. "Unfortunately, because of the merger, some people are probably going to lose their jobs."

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE CULTURES -- Do Oil and Bigger Oil Mix?;
Exxon-Mobil Union Raises Questions On Varying Styles

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
When the heads of most of the world's biggest oil companies were recently invited to the home of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States in McLean, Va., each of the seven tried valiantly to put his best foot forward. They had come, after all, to discuss a tantalizing opportunity -- helping Saudi Arabia develop its vast energy reserves.
Up first was Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's chairman, who delivered a trim, concise speech. He recited, from memory, statistics on Saudi natural gas reserves and suggested some specific ways Exxon might be able to help. 
 Five other executives followed, each making low-key, carefully worded pitches. Finally, it was the turn of Lucio A. Noto, Mobil's chairman, who, characteristically, started off with a joke.
Little had changed, he said, since Mobil had been the smallest partner in Aramco, the four-company partnership the Saudis nationalized in the 1970's and still maintain to run their oil industry. Now, once again, he was the last in line.
That shattered the meeting's icy atmosphere, allowing Mr. Noto to go into a lengthy discourse on the Saudi political landscape, ground he was familiar with because he knew some Saudi princes when he was a young Mobil executive in their country two decades before.
The bosses at Exxon and Mobil, in short, have markedly different styles, making their proposed alliance seem an odd match indeed.
Not that it would be a marriage of equals, though. It is Mr. Raymond who would put a far bigger stamp on the combined company.
Mr. Raymond, 60, has always been clear and focused. He grew up in tiny Watertown, S.D., and, in 1963, armed with a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota, he joined Exxon as a production research engineer. In his methodical rise at Exxon, he never flinched from tough assignments, including overseeing the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the legal settlements that followed. He gained a reputation of being reserved and analytical, of investing Exxon's huge cash flow with great care. So it surprised no one when he was named chairman and chief executive in 1993.
Mr. Noto, also 60, has a far quirkier resume. The son of Italian immigrants, he once pushed clothing-filled carts in New York in the summer. Persistent and gregarious, he was able, soon after he getting his M.B.A. at Cornell and starting his climb at Mobil, to impress the powerful with a savvy sense of political and economic trends. He was a dark horse when the top spot opened up in 1994, and even he was surprised when he was named chairman, president and chief executive.
And in many ways, each man does reflect the company he leads.
Mobil, which spends millions to run opinion-laden advertisements and sponsor "Masterpiece Theater," has long been aggressive in courting public opinion. Run by strong executives who are given a lot of leeway to take risks, the company found ways to make deals to move into Russia and Kazakhstan. And it is quick to apply new technology, leading the way, for instance, in credit card systems that allow pay-at-the-pump gasoline sales. Before Mr. Noto came on the scene, though, Mobil's return on equity was far from stellar.
Exxon, by contrast, run under the tight grip of Mr. Raymond and a small group of top executives, tries to avoid the limelight even when news is good. It excels at squeezing the most return from the resources it has, but balks at taking political risks. And while its exploration skills are first rate and its refineries and network of service stations are run with clockwork efficiency, it likes to limit its risk. For example, it let Royal Dutch/Shell show that oil and natural gas could be profitably recovered from fields thousands of feet below the ocean surface before taking the big plunge itself.
And the merged company, with Mr. Raymond in charge, would be likely to mirror the Exxon model, with the devotion to cost-cutting and engineering prowess that has made Exxon by far the most profitable of the oil majors. In an era of $11-a-barrel oil, energy diplomacy and power politics -- Mobil's specialties -- may have to take a back seat for now.
Not that Mobil, and its distinctive style, would be entirely swallowed up. As in any marriage of opposites, analysts say, the beginning may be rocky.
"They are both so independent that they like to do things their way," said Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear, Stearns. "That makes it almost impossible to get together in any amicable way."
Yet each may find that his partner has strengths that will shore up each company's weaknesses.
In an interview yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, Mr. Noto, sitting next to Mr. Raymond, acknowledged that the two had different styles, but said, "You don't run a company based on style."
He added that he was "quite comfortable" working for Mr. Raymond, a rival he has butted heads with many a time. "I can adapt myself to this," he said.
Mathieu Zajdela, a managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group based in Washington, who has worked with Mobil in Europe over the years, foresees difficulties, however, because Exxon is so much bigger.
The danger, analysts say, is that Mr. Raymond, so used to thinking of Exxon as a paragon of efficiency and profitability, could ride roughshod over Mobil. And the merger could, in fact, leave Mr. Noto playing a very limited role as vice chairman of a 19-member board that would include just 6 directors from Mobil.
Mr. Raymond plans to take all the top positions -- chairman, chief executive and president. And the headquarters of the new Exxon Mobil would be in Irving, Tex., the Dallas suburb that is Exxon's home, far from Mobil's home base in Fairfax, Va., which would house the company's management for refining and marketing.
Not that Mr. Noto would be surprised at his secondary role. The plunging crude oil prices that have put pressure on the whole industry have hit Mobil especially hard because it is smaller. Earlier this year, Mr. Noto began looking for a merger partner, approaching British Petroleum, Amoco and Conoco. In August, though, when British Petroleum announced its $48 billion takeover of Amoco, his options narrowed considerably. And talks with Conoco were called off when it became clear that it would not be a good fit.
And Exxon was surely even tougher for Mr. Noto to crack because of its size and because Mr. Raymond had always been wary of the uncertainties of a merger.
Mr. Noto, however, is known for his persuasive powers. Two years ago, he put together a joint marketing and refining venture with British Petroleum that has led to the shedding of thousands of jobs and the saving of about $500 million a year in costs, a move that prompted other oil majors to form similar ventures.
The idea of a merger was born, Mr. Raymond said in the interview yesterday, during lower-level talks earlier this year about combining refining operations in Japan. When he and Mr. Noto attended a meeting together in June, Mr. Raymond brought up those talks and said, "Maybe we should talk about that."
To which Mr. Noto responded, "That and other things." Within three weeks, the two were talking about far closer ties.
The two companies, Mr. Noto stressed, have many things in common, including not basing "our strategy on what is popular today."
As soon as he took charge at Mobil, Mr. Noto made it clear that even though Mobil had already eliminated 15,000 jobs the previous five years, the belt-tightening had just begun. "The challenge is how do you run the company the way you think it should be run and still have enough of an eye on the short-term considerations, like the shareholders?" he said in an interview shortly before he took over.
He was determined to make Mobil more profitable and make shareholders happy, a goal analysts say he achieved. He set out to cut another 15,000 jobs and to pass down more power to middle management to shake Mobil out of its doldrums.
But simply cutting jobs would not be enough for Mobil or Exxon, which has also seen significant job cuts. Both Mr. Noto and Mr. Raymond faced the daunting task of finding huge new fields of oil and natural gas to replace dwindling reserves. Both pinned high hopes on the opening of Russia and other former Soviet-bloc countries, but economic and political realities soon derailed those dreams.
That left even a strong company like Exxon, which has been slow to replace reserves, wondering where it would strike oil next.
Further complicating the industry's future has been the impact of global warming -- an issue that Mr. Raymond has not been afraid to tackle. He has insisted, for example, that the phenomenon had not been proved scientifically. And recently, when he was chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, he was the point man in trying to head off attempts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, which would almost surely force industries to cut down on oil consumption.
And he has not been afraid to be blunt about it, causing an uproar with his views at a meeting of the World Petroleum Congress last year.
"Some people seemed astonished that someone would actually stand up in public and point out some of the scientific uncertainties and damaging economic consequences of the proposals under discussion," he said at last year's meeting of the American Petroleum Institute.
In dealing with the varied groups claiming damages from the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in 1989, he has often taken a tough line to keep claims down. He was also willing to take the heat for having Exxon go through the continuing long and costly appeal of a $5 billion jury award in the case, even though many people say Exxon should simply pay it.
As for today's challenges, Mr. Noto and Mr. Raymond might be the ideal team. Mr. Noto was in Saudi Arabia from 1977 to 1985, making friends with some current Saudi leaders, and Mr. Raymond has the resources and skills to put projects together. Between them, they may find a way back into the country that by far has the largest oil reserves in the world.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
N.B.A., Players to Talk Without Preconditions

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
After 15 days away from the bargaining table, players and owners tomorrow will make another bid to resuscitate the National Basketball Association season.
Billy Hunter, the union executive director, telephoned Commissioner David Stern to set up the meeting yesterday as the lockout entered its sixth month. 
 The meeting in Manhattan will include full bargaining teams from each side. There will be only one pre-meeting stipulation: every issue on the table will be negotiable.
"There will be no preconditions," Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner, said. "Whatever proposals we made two weeks ago, we're not bound to. Whatever was put on the table at the last meeting is now undone. I'm not optimistic, but like I said a number of times, it doesn't usually hurt to meet."
Meanwhile, players missed their second payday. The union president, Patrick Ewing, who was due to earn $18.5 million this season, has now lost nearly $4 million in salary. Total player salary losses are projected above $300 million.
Concern is mounting on both sides as to whether the season will actually be canceled. The league has refused to set an official deadline, but if no deal is struck by mid-December the feeling among many of the league's 29 owners is that there is no point in having less than a 45-game season. The league has refused to use a mediator and will not declare an impasse in negotiations, a tactic baseball unsuccessfully used in 1994.
Given that it will take a month after an agreement is reached for the season to begin, it would not be surprising if the league soon announced the cancellation of the All-Star Game Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
If the league were to cancel the All-Star Game, it would most likely award Philadelphia the game in 2002. The N.B.A. has already committed itself to holding the event in San Francisco in 2000 and in Washington for the 2000-2001 season.
The meeting is the first since Nov. 20 in New York -- a 10-hour affair that seemed to produce the most encouraging signs of a possible settlement. Within two days, that progress was dashed when the union and the league clashed over key economic issues. A misunderstanding over how an escrow system would be implemented in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of a seven-year plan led to a breakoff of the talks again. The league said the players had accepted an escrow tax, and the players contended they were unsure of exactly what the league was proposing.
Either way, 10 hours of bargaining went to waste. While both sides had moved off their desired numbers for total revenue distribution -- the N.B.A. wanted the players to make no more than 53 percent of income and the players proposed a 57-43 split, the league is back to asking for a 50-50 share and the players want up to 60 percent of the revenue.
 
Refunds on the Way
National Basketball Association teams are sending out refund checks this week to season ticket-holders for games that have not been played. Each team must send back a pro-rated share of each season ticket, along with 6 percent interest.
"The teams have five business days from today to send out the checks," Brian McIntyre, a spokesman for the N.B.A., said yesterday.
The Nets offered season ticket holders cash refunds or credits for four canceled home regular-season games and one canceled exhibition game, said Jim Lampariello, an executive vice president of the team.
The choice of credits included additional tickets for games later this season if the lockout ends, or playoff tickets. About 70 percent chose refunds, which the team will start mailing out tomorrow and Thursday.
The Knicks offered fans cash refunds, and checks were being mailed out yesterday for only five home regular-season games and two exhibition games, said Barry Watkins, a Madison Square Garden spokesman.
People with individual game tickets can get cash refunds at outlets where the tickets were purchased.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE MOTIVES;
Supply and Profits

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the wealth of Exxon and Mobil -- and all the market power inherent in their announced merger -- these two oil giants are essentially purveyors of an ordinary commodity, and commodities are in huge supply. Their falling prices are cutting into profits everywhere and hurting national economies.
The merger is essentially an attempt by Exxon and Mobil, particularly Mobil, to sustain profits. The two companies have been among the nation's most profitable, but the current price of crude oil, $11.13 a barrel, is barely enough to cover Exxon's exploration and production costs, and less than what Mobil spends to find and retrieve oil and natural gas. 
 "The cost reductions from this huge merger will come in many different areas," said Victor Burk, chief of Arthur Andersen's Energy Services Group. "Exxon and Mobil will combine their headquarters and back office operations, and their purchases of supplies and services. As the world's biggest company, their negotiating power will be greatly enhanced. And they will try to reduce Mobil's costs for finding and developing oil reserves, bringing them more in line with Exxon's."
All that cost-cutting cuts two ways for ordinary Americans. Lower costs mean lower prices for gasoline, plastics and other petroleum-based products, reducing inflation. But the cost-cutting also means downsizing and lost incomes.
Cost-cutting through mergers is hardly a new tactic. In the oil industry, BP Petroleum and Amoco have already taken this step, and so have Texaco and Shell. With oil prices unlikely to rise until Asian demand revives -- probably many months in the future -- other oil companies appear to be moving in the same direction. France's Total S.A. announced yesterday that it had acquired a 41 percent stake in Belgium's Petrofina S.A.
The plunge in commodity prices goes beyond oil, and also beyond steel or textiles or livestock or grain or all the other basic materials that the word "commodity" brings to mind. Because of the collapse in Asian demand, an index of 28 of these standard commodities has fallen by 25 percent since last spring, a record drop. But in today's modern global economy, "commodity" also takes in numerous manufactured goods that are easily produced anywhere.
Commercial airliners are not commodities. Two companies, Boeing and Airbus, control the key technologies and production skills. Highly technical medical devices are also exempt, their production limited to those companies and workers with the necessary know-how. But razors are a commodity, the very best easily copied and manufactured.
Fabric is another example and so are apparel, lathes, computer chips, small appliances, toys, kitchen ware, television sets, watches and many other electronic devices. Commodities in this broader sense are in over-supply mainly because so many companies stepped up production in recent years, in the expectation that as supply rose, so would demand, absorbing the new supply.
The Asian crisis destroyed that strategy, and now manufacturers find themselves unable to sell all they can produce. They are often forced to cut prices, hurting profits and forcing layoffs here and abroad as production has been cut back.
"The basic phenomenon, however you define the word commodities, is that there is a huge amount of slack capacity in most industries," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist.
Exxon and Mobil are caught in this squeeze. No American corporation was more profitable than Exxon last year, and Mobil was also among the top performers. The two giants are still reporting healthy profits. Their refining operations and gasoline marketing, for example, continue to prosper.
What's more, says Mr. Burk, an Exxon-Mobil merger will give the new company much more influence in dealings with OPEC. "In terms of production," he said, "it will be near in size to several of the big state-owned oil companies in the Middle East. It will have the means to finance very large exploration and development projects. And we may see Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, for example, opening their countries to foreign oil investment."
But right now, in the basic business of exploring for oil, drilling the wells and recovering crude oil and natural gas, Exxon's and Mobil's costs are beginning to reach or surpass the basic price they get for even the best quality crude, known as West Texas Intermediate. Its price of $11.13 a barrel yesterday was down 41 percent from $18.83 last summer.
Exxon, the stronger of the two companies, pumped from its American fields 204 million barrels out of its total worldwide production of 584 million barrels last year. The exploration and production costs averaged $7.11 a barrel, according to Arthur Andersen's Energy Services Group, which surveys oil industry costs, based on public disclosures. Outside the United States, the Exxon exploration and recovery cost was $10.39 a barrel -- a healthy margin last year, when crude oil rose above $20 a barrel for a while, but uncomfortably close to today's much lower price.
Of the 250 million barrels of crude oil that Mobil pumped everywhere in the world last year, 89 million came from American fields, at a cost of $14.85 a barrel in the United States for exploration and recovery, and $11.52 abroad.
"Mobil is not in good shape today in this category," Mr. Burk said, "and when you consider all the other costs involved in recovering crude oil, the cost for both companies is probably more than the current world oil price."

UNITED DOMINION TO LET 600 GO IN CONSOLIDATION

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
United Dominion Industries Ltd. said yesterday that it was laying off about 600 employees, or 5 percent of its work force, and consolidating 12 facilities to cut costs as its customers decreased their capital spending. The company, a maker of cooling towers, valves and testing instruments, is also taking a $15 million pretax fourth-quarter charge, which could be offset by unrelated gains, for the cuts. The company said some facilities would be closed but would not specify how many or where they were. United Dominion said the cuts were necessary in the face of an "uncertain" economic environment. United Dominion, based in Charlotte, N.C., employs more than 11,000 and had sales of $1.65 billion in 1997.

SMURFIT-STONE TO CLOSE FOUR U.S. CONTAINERBOARD MILLS

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation said yesterday that it would close four containerboard mills in the United States as part of a previously announced restructuring that will cut 1,660 jobs and generate annual savings of about $350 million. The company, the world's largest paper-based packaging concern, will also stop producing pulp at a Canadian mill in Bathurst, New Brunswick, although it will continue to make containerboard at that site. The American mills are in Alton, Ill.; Circleville, Ohio; Jacksonville, Fla., and Port Wentworth, Ga. Smurfit-Stone was created last month from the merger of the Stone Container Corporation and the American unit of Jefferson Smurfit Group P.L.C. of Ireland. About 1,400 jobs will be lost at the mills.

HEADLINE: Pact to Provide Minority Housing in White Areas in Yonkers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER with DAVID ROHDE

 BODY:
Bringing to a close a major theater of battle in a legal conflict that has had Yonkers in its grip for almost two decades, New York State agreed yesterday to pay $16.4 million to help the city build new housing and buy existing homes in white neighborhoods for black and Hispanic families.
Yesterday's decision still leaves simmering some of the educational issues in the desegregation litigation that began in 1980, when the Justice Department and later the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People accused Yonkers of intentionally maintaining segregated schools by confining black and Hispanic families in the southwestern corner of the city. 
 But in a financially strapped city whose schools have lost a substantial share of their middle-class white students over the years, officials were more troubled about how they would address a judge's finding that Yonkers's housing patterns had contributed to racially segregated schools and how they would pay for any remedies. Thus, yesterday's settlement, with the state's agreement to pay half of the costs for a package of 740 homes, brought expressions of unusual delight.
"We're very happy about that," said Mayor John Spencer, who has led the city since January 1996. "The taxpayers of Yonkers have been carrying the burden all by ourselves for too long and it's something as Mayor I've been talking about for years. I think to the state's credit they've recognized their culpability."
Gov. George E. Pataki, whose administration had at first fought the Yonkers demand that it help pay for a housing plan, seemed pleased that this political hot potato would be put behind him. "By putting aside old divisions and focusing on a better future for the people of Yonkers, we have reached an important settlement that finally brings an end to the years of litigation in the Yonkers housing desegregation case," he said.
The settlement commits the state over the next five years to pay $7.5 million to help mostly minority families buy 600 single-family homes and condominiums (including subsidies of as much as $20,000 for the lowest-earning families) for down payments, closing costs and repairs.
The state will also have to pay $6.4 million for building 118 new houses and rental apartments in three locations in Yonkers -- Yonkers Avenue, Hoover Road and East Grassy Sprain Road. Yonkers is about to break ground on a fourth site required by the Federal court order, 22 homes on Cross Street, that the state will not finance.
The final piece of the complicated package is a promise by the State of New York Mortgage Agency to make available $100 million in low-interest loans for families buying homes. Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., an Atlanta lawyer who has represented the City of Yonkers in the desegregation case, said the value of reducing the interest on the mortgages amounted to $2.5 million.
The path toward yesterday's settlement was broken last Feb. 5, when Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan found that the state bore a sizable share of responsibility for segregated patterns of housing in Yonkers. He found that the State Urban Development Corporation chose in the 1960's and 70's to build many of its low-income apartment houses in southwest Yonkers, where the majority of black and Hispanic residents already lived, thus aggravating segregated housing patterns that had contributed to school segregation.
In his comments yesterday, Judge Sand showed the ebullience of a jurist who could glimpse the conclusion of a case he has presided over for almost two decades of his life. "There have been many occasions since the outset of this litigation in 1980, when I sat on this bench experiencing frustration, and a failure to appreciate why, when the parties had the same objectives, it was so difficult to reach a consensus," he said.
"I am very pleased," he continued. "The goal of increasing housing opportunities in Yonkers will be materially implemented, There will, at long last, be an end to this phase of this ongoing saga."
As the new homes are built or bought, there may yet be some protests, controversies or lawsuits, but what happened yesterday was significant because the money was pledged to pay for the housing plan that had been reached two years ago between Yonkers and the N.A.A.C.P. Nothing, it has long been clear, would be put into effect until hard-pressed Yonkers, with the paradoxical help of the N.A.A.C.P., succeeded in shifting some of the costs to the state.
The total cost of the housing program is $32 million and Yonkers wanted the state to pay half. A major part of the Yonkers share, however, will consist of community block grants it is getting from the Federal Government.
The housing plan itself Mr. Fitzpatrick emphasized, is race-neutral, giving no explicit advantages to black and Hispanic residents over whites for the homes that will be created. But there are preferences in the plan for people who lived in subsidized or public housing in southwest Yonkers, so it is not surprising that most of the applicants for housing have been black and Hispanic.
The amount of assistance to each family seeking housing will depend on income. Families earning less than 50 percent of the Westchester median income can get as much as $20,000. Those earning between 50 and 80 percent of the median income can receive as much as $15,000. And households earning between 80 and 100 percent of the median income can receive $10,000.
The court settlement did not state the median income, but the Westchester County Department of Planning said, in its most recent report, that it was $61,861 in 1996.
In the educational part of the desegregation litigation, Yonkers has worked out a plan for teacher training and programs for students that will try to bridge the gap in achievement between white students and black and Hispanic students. The state is paying a share of those costs as well, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, though it is appealing the requirement that it do so.
Also at issue are Yonkers's resistance to moving ahead with bilingual programs and with a reading and writing program that was prescribed in the plan.

HEADLINE: 2 Decades On, Miami Endorses Gay Rights

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 1

 BODY:
More than 20 years after Anita Bryant's "save our children" crusade here led to the repeal of one of the country's first gay rights ordinances and galvanized the debate over gay rights in the nation, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted again today to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The commission's hearing chambers erupted in bear hugs, kisses and tears as the 13 commissioners voted 7 to 6 to amend the county's antidiscrimination law to prohibit unequal treatment of homosexuals in housing, employment, credit and finance and public accommodation. Many who remember Ms. Bryant's campaign for repeal of a similar law in 1977 saw today's action as a vindication laden with symbolism and historical significance. 
 "It says that we've grown up," said Carlos Hazday, 40, an accountant who was manager of Safeguarding American Values for Everyone, or SAVE Dade, as the pro-amendment campaign called itself. "We're not perfect, we still have differences, but we're learning from our mistakes."
Gay rights advocates and Miami-Dade officials agree that the vote reflects a national change in attitude as Americans have become increasingly tolerant of equal rights for homosexuals. Miami-Dade has also grown into a metropolitan area of more than two million people that prides itself on its ethnic diversity and is trying to sell a world-class image. Officials say it cannot afford to be perceived as intolerant of homosexuals.
The absence of a gay rights ordinance in the county was a particular thorn for the gay rights movement because Miami-Dade was the first major urban area in the country to pass legislation protecting homosexuals. But that show of leadership was severely eroded when Ms. Bryant, then a singer, advertising personality and devout Baptist who lived in Miami Beach but had a national reputation, led a campaign to repeal the gay rights law that was passed in 1977, calling it an attempt to legitimize "a perverse and dangerous" way of life.
At one point she argued the law was a license for homosexuals to recruit and molest children.
Two main factors appear to have helped propel the measure that was approved today after a similar bill was introduced last year but failed to make it to a final vote. One was the case of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who died in October after he was kidnapped, beaten and left tied to a fence for 18 hours. The crime fanned outrage over hate crimes nationwide and became a theme here during the hearing that preceded today's vote.
"When you unleash hatred it's only natural that some people would run with it, and sometimes it becomes deadly," said Commissioner Jimmy L. Morales.
More important, many Miami-Dade political and civic leaders rallied behind the measure by arguing that intolerance was bad for an economy that depended on tourism and new investments. Other municipalities and counties in South Florida, including Broward County and Miami Beach, have already enacted gay rights legislation or laws extending benefits to domestic partners.
"Greater Miami is no longer a provincial, backwater town," Miami Beach's Mayor, Neisen Kasdin, whose city is a major draw of gay tourism, told the commission. "Let's not retreat from our destiny as a major international city."
Roman Catholic Church officials, who had sided with Ms. Bryant in the 1970's, did not take a stand on the debate this time, noting that the ordinance exempted religious organizations from its requirements. But opponents of the ordinance were mostly religious leaders and conservatives who derided the law as condoning homosexuality and as granting special rights for life-style choices or to a segment of the population that did not need them.
"Where are the ghettos and the housing projects inhabited by people discriminated against because of their sexual orientation?" asked Eladio Jose Armesto, of the Democratic League of Miami-Dade County. "There aren't any."
Led by local members of the Christian Coalition, who held a prayer vigil outside the building during the hearing, the measure's opponents said they would consider legal options, including gathering signatures to put the issue on the ballot for another repeal referendum and campaigning against the re-election of the commissioners who voted yes. "Next election there'll be new commissioners in town," said Josh Morales, a Christian Coalition member.
National gay rights advocates say Miami-Dade is a highlight in a year when local governments around the country have passed two gay rights proposals but defeated five, and Maine became the first state to repeal its law protecting homosexuals from discrimination.
Eleven states, 27 counties and 136 cities have passed antidiscrimination laws protecting homosexuals, said the Human Rights Campaign, a national advocacy organization on gay issues, with fewer than 10 of the laws repealed. Although some studies have shown that few claims are filed under the laws, partly because many homosexuals are reluctant to reveal their sexual orientation publicly, supporters of the ordinances say they deter unfair treatment and set a tone that encourages similar policies in the private sector.
Speakers at today's hearing included gay police officers, lawyers and others who told of harassment in the workplace and lost job opportunities because of their homosexuality.
"Many people see 1977 as the beginning of the rise of the extreme right in this country, with a real focus on anti-gay rhetoric," said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. "This shows how far we've come toward basic fairness for gay Americans. This is a wonderful victory for Miami-Dade County, but it's a watershed victory for gays and lesbians nationally."
Two decades ago, though the former antidiscrimination law was repealed by voters by a margin of more than 2 to 1, the campaign also undermined the career of Ms. Bryant, who took her drive to other states. Ms. Bryant, who moved to Oklahoma soon after the law was repealed, lost entertainment engagements and was dropped as spokeswoman of the Florida Citrus Commission in orange juice advertisements. Efforts to reach Ms. Bryant by telephone were unsuccessful.
The issue remained dormant until last year, when a county commissioner introduced a gay rights bill, but it never reached the stage where it was considered at a public hearing or put to a final vote by the commission. Supporters regrouped in the last 18 months, and say they are prepared to fight a repeal effort.
"I really think we turned the corner today as a community," said Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County, who had urged a yes vote. "We're much more progressive, tolerant and mature."
It is striking, however, that it took the ordinance 21 years to resurface in an area that encompasses cities like Miami Beach, where homosexuals are an integral part of the cultural life.
Gay rights advocates say other priorities, like the area's need to absorb wave after wave of immigrants, have put issues like gay rights on the back burner.
But for those like the Cuban-born Mr. Hazday, who has lived here for 25 years, the Anita Bryant campaign was etched in memory. He said he was a college freshman when "I saw the hatred and division Anita Bryant brought to our county."
"I promised myself," he said, "next time I would get involved."

HEADLINE: Should Internet Trade Be Taxed?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
According to the report of Ira Magaziner, the Presidential adviser, the heavy hand of Government might have been needed to guide and control Industrial Age industries, but it's inappropriate for our fast-evolving high-tech industries, namely, the Internet and electronic commerce (Business Day, Nov. 30). 
 But what about our fast-evolving financial services, pharmaceutical, biotech, communications, transportation, energy and retailing sectors -- all post-industrial and all arguably hindered, not helped, by bureaucratic micro-management? To be intellectually honest, the Clinton Administration should treat these other economic sectors with similar laissez-faire regulation.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE OVERVIEW;
EXXON AND MOBILANNOUNCE $80 BILLION DEAL TO CREATE WORLD'S LARGEST COMPANY

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, agreed yesterday to buy Mobil, the next largest, for $80 billion in stock, to form the world's biggest corporation.
While the merger is not likely to have any immediate effect on prices at the pump, antitrust regulators will certainly scrutinize it and probably force the sale of some gas stations and refineries. 
 So great are the doubts over whether the companies will win approval or accept the required divestitures that investors sent the stock prices of both companies down yesterday. Shares of Exxon dropped $3.375, to $71.625, and Mobil fell $2.25, to $83.75, well below Exxon's offer of $99.01 a share, based on Monday's closing Exxon stock price.
The agreement would reunite the two largest pieces of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken up in 1911 in the nation's most celebrated antitrust case.
The companies contended yesterday that they now confront global competitors and plunging energy prices, making their combination and the resulting savings a necessity. But while the companies foresee savings of $2.8 billion annually, the greatest costs would be paid by employees. About 9,000 workers out of 123,000 worldwide are likely to find themselves without jobs, the companies said.
Lee R. Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon, who would add the title of president in the combined company, said repeatedly that further efficiency, not brute size, was his goal. "This is the case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts," he said at a news conference, later adding: "I have always had the view that the objective is to be best. If in being best you also have to be biggest, that's fine."
Exxon Mobil, as the company would be called, would have sales of $204 billion, surpassing General Motors as the world's largest company and Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the largest oil company. It would still appear to motorists as the familiar separate chains, with gas stations and oil cans bearing the distinct brand names.
Officials of the Federal Trade Commission, saying they held their first discussions with the companies yesterday, had no comment. Antitrust experts said the regulators were likely to review the effects city by city and region by region, probably requiring the sale of at least some gas stations and refineries. "If large divestitures are required, it could be that the deal doesn't make sense," said Eleanor M. Fox, who teaches antitrust law at New York University.
But many industry analysts agreed with Mr. Raymond and Lucio A. Noto, Mobil's chief executive, who would be the combined company's vice chairman, that the corporations and their shareholders would fare better if united.
The proposed deal comes as mergers are also welding many of the world's largest banks, auto makers and telephone companies. The companies said that they would have about a 13 percent share of the gasoline market in the United States, compared with about 14 percent for the partnership between Shell and Texaco and 10.5 percent for British Petroleum should it complete its planned $48.2 billion purchase of the Amoco Corporation.
Analysts praised the latest combination, saying that other industry mergers would follow. "To create lower costs and greater efficiencies, they had to go outside their own organizations," said Frederick P. Leuffer of Bear, Stearns. "That same question is now before the other major oil companies."
He and other analysts said they considered Mobil's $80 billion price to be fairly high but reasonable, considering the benefits. Mr. Raymond said the purchase would have no effect on profitability in the first year and would begin adding to earnings per share after that.
Exxon would trade 1.32 of its shares for each Mobil share, leaving Exxon shareholders owning 70 percent of the resulting company in a deal expected to close by mid-1999. The company would be based at Exxon's headquarters in Irving, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. Mobil's headquarters in Fairfax, Va., would become the center for refining and sales, while Houston would be home to exploration, production and chemicals.
The contrasting strengths and styles of the companies and their chief executives were on display yesterday at their meetings on Wall Street with analysts and reporters. Mr. Raymond, a South Dakotan with a doctorate in chemical engineering, has a reputation as a blunt cost-cutter and technician. Pruning his work force year by year, he has already made his company a model of efficiency. His shareholder returns at Exxon usually match the performance of market indexes whose advances have been paced by companies making computer software or chips.
Mr. Noto, whose company has slimmed down, too, is better known as a salesman and international diplomat. While Exxon is cautious about developing new oil and natural gas sources abroad, Mobil has expanding interests ranging from Indonesia to the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea.
In an age when chief executives carefully tend their images, Mr. Raymond avoids attention and dismisses questions he deems redundant or dumb. "I'm not interested in your views of how we ought to deal with the F.T.C.," he told a reporter yesterday who questioned why his company had not begun by telling the agency what operations it would sell.
So if Mr. Raymond took the lead in reciting the merger's particulars, it fell to Mr. Noto to set forth the imperatives in more human terms. "This is not a combination based on desperation," he said, his accent showing his roots a subway ride and a world away in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. "It is one based on opportunity. But we need to face some facts. The world has changed. The easy things are behind us. The easy oil, the easy cost savings, they're done. So all of us are now looking for some way to make a jump, to make a quantum leap, to be able to deliver more value to our shareholders, and our employees and customers."
Mr. Noto was likewise the one who explained that while managers could not offer more details of the job cuts: "They are not cold and indifferent. They understand that jobs are important, and they understand the impact on communities." About 40 percent, or 50,000, of the companies' employees are in the United States.
The executives bemoaned oil prices that are low and getting lower since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries finished its recent meeting without doing much more than agreeing to meet again. But they said their deal was based far more on their views of where their business was going over the longer term.
In a consolidating industry, they said, they see powerful state-owned oil companies expanding to other countries. They spoke of the need for huge amounts of capital and deep technological expertise to produce oil and natural gas from beneath Arctic ice and unexplored seas.
Mr. Raymond's restiveness in public and Exxon's history of dealing with the media may hamper efforts to sell the agreement to the public. Exxon's handling of the 1989 grounding of its Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska has come to be known as one of the industry's worst environmental and public relations disasters. Parting company with European competitors like British Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon and Mobil are opposing a treaty meant to slow global warming.
Since news of their talks broke last Wednesday, antitrust experts and consumer advocates have been picking at it. "Rockefeller's revenge," is how Heat USA, a buying cooperative for heating oil in the New York area, put it. "There's little question in my mind that if you have industry consolidation on this magnitude, you're going to see energy prices controlled by fewer people," said Andrew Heaney, the group's president.
At gasoline stations, consumers had mixed views. Some, like Juanita Purner of Santa Monica, Calif., suspect that the deal will raise prices. "To me, that says monopoly, big business, more control," she said at a Mobil station in Los Angeles. "I may have to take the bus."
But others, like Wayne E. Daniels of Farmingville, N.Y., seemed more concerned about the workers. "I've heard that thousands of jobs will be lost in the merger," he said at a Mobil station in Riverhead, N.Y.
Mobil has been far more ardent in seeking partners, allies and acquisitions, combining its European refineries and gas stations with British Petroleum's. Exxon has stood aloof, assuming it was large enough to fend for itself.
But Mr. Raymond said yesterday that he had been pondering how much more profitable his company could become in league with Mobil.
The flirtation began last June after an American Petroleum Institute committee meeting, when a possible partnership in Japan was suggested.
"Maybe we should talk about that," Mr. Raymond said.
"That and other things," Mr. Noto responded. About three weeks later, they began merger talks in earnest.
Those who have been briefed on their discussions said that agreements on price came easily and early. Sorting through the potential antitrust obstacles and deciding who should get what job took longer. The boards held their own separate discussions as well, especially on the antitrust questions.

HEADLINE: Red Tape Keeps Children Uninsured, Report Finds

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Nearly three out of four uninsured children in New York City are eligible for public health coverage, but barriers built into the Medicaid application process and widespread ignorance about another insurance program for low-income children keep them unenrolled, according to a report issued yesterday by the Commonwealth Fund.
The report, based on a series of focus groups conducted with low-income families and Medicaid workers who screen families for eligibility, found that parents were eager to get health insurance for their children but were deterred by an enrollment process they perceived as burdensome, confusing and even hostile. 
 In contrast, parents familiar with Child Health Plus, the other program for low-income children, praised its ease of application, but few families with eligible children had ever heard of it, the report said. Even Medicaid eligibility workers were unaware that it covered poor children ineligible for Medicaid, the report found.
The focus groups were structured to reflect New York City's population and conducted in August and September by the Global Strategy Group Inc. with the support of the fund, a large, private philanthropic organization in New York. There are 370,000 uninsured children in New York City.
David Sandman, program officer at the fund, said the report showed that the problem of uninsured children would not be solved simply through the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and Child Health Plus, scheduled to take effect in stages between Jan. 1, 1999, and July 1, 2000. The statewide expansions, financed with $256 million a year in Federal money, will ultimately cover children in families with incomes of up to 250 percent of the poverty line, or $41,059 for a family of four, potentially reaching 9 out of 10 children under 18 who now lack insurance.
"New York has decided that it makes sense, in both economic and human terms, to provide health care coverage to low-income children," Mr. Sandman said. "But passing new legislation is only a partial solution. The problem of hundreds of thousands of uninsured children without health care in New York City will only be solved by developing new outreach strategies and revamping the enrollment processes for the programs we already have."
Nearly 20 percent of all children in New York City are now uninsured, according to Department of Health figures. An earlier study by the fund found that such children are far more likely than their insured counterparts to go without preventive care, immunizations and even acute medical care.
The new report quoted parents who said they had lost family insurance coverage when they went from full-time work to part-time jobs, or from city employment to private industry, where they found insurance premiums unaffordable and were unaware that their children qualified for subsidized insurance. Others, who had left public assistance, said they were not told that their children still qualified for Medicaid, or said they had given up after calling an automated Medicaid telephone line that provided conflicting information about eligibility rules.
The sharpest complaints were about the Medicaid application process. Parents said they must often miss several days of work to gather and submit documents to Medicaid eligibility workers, whose decisions strike many parents as arbitrary.
"Parents view workers as uninformed, unconcerned and rude and believe they actively discourage enrollment," the report said.
Medicaid eligibility workers from the city's Human Resources Administration also expressed frustration with the enrollment process, the report said, quoting workers who complained that they were overwhelmed by paperwork and confusing rules.
James Whelan, a spokesman for the city agency, said, "We have not seen the report yet and therefore we cannot comment."
The report recommended retraining eligibility workers, streamlining the Medicaid application process and reaching out to low-income working families at schools, workplaces, day care centers and coin laundries.

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Wednesday about public health care for uninsured children misidentified the government program for the poor that was said to deter many parents of eligible children because of a confusing application process. As the article said, the program is Medicaid, not Medicare.

HEADLINE: Study Calls Remedial Classes Good Investment

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
At a time when the City University of New York and other universities are trying to reduce the number of remedial classes in English and math, a new study commissioned by the Ford Foundation says such courses are "a core function of higher education" as well as a good investment for society.
The study, prepared by the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington, was prompted partly by the decision of City University trustees to cut back remedial work by raising admissions standards. Under their plan, students who need any remedial work would no longer be admitted to four-year colleges. Instead, they would be sent to community colleges for their remedial work, and it would be limited to two regular semesters. 
 Although the report, being released today, did not analyze the situation at CUNY directly, it suggests that efforts by universities to limit remedial work are misguided. Among its findings are these:
*The economic and social costs of not providing remedial education are high since so many jobs require skills in reading, writing and mathematics -- the very skills that many remedial courses cover. It cited research showing that 80 percent of jobs with higher salaries required some education beyond high school, and said that better-educated workers contributed to higher tax revenues, higher productivity and lower crime.
*A systematic approach at the state level would be more effective in reducing the need for remedial work than piecemeal "stopgap solutions." The report said that primary and secondary education must be strengthened, and called for better teacher preparation, more individual help for students and more attention to whether students were taking the academically rigorous courses they needed to prepare them for college.
*The financial cost of remediation is modest, typically below the cost of other course work. The study says that national estimates have placed the cost of remedial work at about $1 billion out of a total public higher education budget of $115 billion. Even if the cost were twice that, the study says, "that is a relatively modest amount to be spent."
*While high schools are often blamed for the quality of their graduates, many of the remedial students are not recent graduates. The report said that while estimates vary, one national study found that 46 percent of the entering freshmen taking remedial classes were older than 21, and a separate study in Florida found that 80 percent of the students in remedial classes were not recent high school graduates.
"We have been concerned by the politicizing of what is essentially a very complex educational decision," said Alison Bernstein, vice president for education, media, arts and culture, explaining why Ford had commissioned the study.
She said the report had confirmed the notion that remediation was a national phenomenon as well as how difficult it was to weigh the costs and benefits.
Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the City University board and a leading architect of the board's remedial policy, said yesterday that he had not seen the report but agreed with some of its contents as described to him.
"I agree that one of the unfortunate byproducts of our public school system is that you need remediation," he said. "Some remediation you need, but not as extensive as we have here. But what we can do is get it out of the way as fast as possible, and we need to do a better job with our elementary and secondary school systems."
The new study says there has been little careful research into the effectiveness of remedial education, even though it has existed since the founding days of Harvard in the 17th century.
"It's time to move beyond the finger pointing and jockeying over who should pay for remediation and get at the important education and social issues," said Jamie Merisotis, president of the institute, a nonprofit research group.
Research on remediation is complicated, the study said, by a lack of a common definition about who should be included (should immigrants learning English as a second language count, for example) and what constitutes remediation (remedial work at a highly selective college is likely to be at a different level from that at a community college.)
Another problem, the study said, is that there is such a stigma attached to remediation that "many institutions do not find it in their interest to acknowledge that they enroll students who require remediation."
Yet the study suggested that colleges and universities would be well served to continue their remedial work, since it helps them retain students and a significant portion of those who complete their remedial work go on to graduate.

HEADLINE: Early Start for the Tate's New Museum;
Londoners Already Flock to the Site of a Modern-Art Gallery Opening in 2000

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Several hundred people gathered recently on the south side of the Thames River in London, around the hulking facade of a former power station where Andy Warhol's 1964 film "Empire" was being projected larger than life. Joggers stopped to watch. So did neighbors on their way home from work, cyclists, film buffs and hordes of contemporary-art mavens who had read about the free screening.
Call it curiosity or a cult happening or simply going to the party 18 months early, but the site of the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art, which is scheduled to open in 2000, is already becoming part of the fabric of London's cultural life. Before the museum opens, there will be a program of site-specific art installations around the power station and a series of screenings of other films by popular contemporary artists like Chris Burden, Gordon Matta-Clark, Julian Opie and Richard Serra. 
 "We're getting the public used to going here and making people aware of our existence," said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery and all its branches, of which the new museum is one. "It's also about beginning to build links with the community."
Situated at Bankside just opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, the new $208 million Tate -- the first new national museum to be built in Britain in 100 years and the first national museum in London devoted solely to modern art -- is the biggest news in the London art world for some time.
The excitement is also being felt in the United States where collectors -- like John and Frances Bowes of San Francisco, Donald Bryant of St. Louis and Douglas S. Cramer of New York -- have already agreed to give their support to the new Tate. So has the Annenberg Foundation. These supporters "tend to be people or institutions whose principal commitment is to their local museums but who want to be a part of this project," Mr. Serota said.
Bankside, which has been one of London's most neglected areas, is not only about to get a face lift but also is poised to become a major cultural center. In addition to the Tate, the Globe Theater, a $48 million re-creation of the original Shakespeare theater, opened in the neighborhood last year and has received wide acclaim.
The Globe and the new Tate have prompted a host of other projects. A new $27 million pedestrian bridge -- designed by Sir Norman Foster, the London architect; Sir Anthony Caro, the sculptor, and Ove Arup and Partners, an engineering firm -- will link Bankside to St. Paul's. There will also be a new subway station, designed by Richard McCormick, a leading British architect, and a new apartment development called Manhattan Lofts, as well as scores of new shops and restaurants. An economic development study prepared for the Tate estimates that the new museum will attract about two million visitors a year, create 2,400 jobs and provide direct economic benefits to London of $48 million to $144 million a year.
A modern-art museum in London will add strength to an already vibrant contemporary art scene, where young British artists like Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Waring and Douglas Gordon are becoming internationally known. "We have been experiencing huge audiences when we show contemporary art," Mr. Serota said. "There is certainly no shortage of interest."
Lars Nittve, who was appointed director of the new museum last spring after having been director of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen for three years, said it was not by chance that the new Tate was being built now. "There's a greater self-confidence and international recognition among contemporary British artists," he said. "And this museum will surely trigger more changes."
Mr. Nittve and Mr. Serota envision the new museum as a serious rival to both the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Pompidou Center in Paris.
In fact, the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate are already joining forces to share shows even before the Tate opens. The Jackson Pollock exhibition that opened last month at the Modern is traveling to the Tate after it leaves New York on Feb. 2.
"We have a lot in common," said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern. "It makes sense to collaborate."
London's art dealers and auction houses hope the new Tate will attract more art buyers to London. London has been steadily losing business to New York for the last two years because of rising European Union import taxes and is in danger of losing even more when the Paris auction market opens up to non-French auctioneers in the future.
 
Finding Success In Raising Funds
A museum devoted to modern and contemporary art was the brainchild of Mr. Serota, who oversees all the Tate museums: the original in the Millbank section of London, the new museum and two satellite institutions, the Tate St. Ives and the Tate Liverpool. An adept fund-raiser, he has been able to attract more than $160 million for the new museum, including an award of $80 million from the Government's Millennium Commission, along with $19.2 million from English Partnerships, a redevelopment agency.
Mr. Serota convincingly makes the argument that London needs a modern-art museum. Right now the Tate is able to show less than 15 percent of its permanent collection because of lack of space. About 60 percent of its holdings will be on display once the Tate Gallery of Modern Art opens.
A museum for modern art also gives Mr. Serota the chance to refocus the original site at Millbank, which will become the Tate Gallery of British Art, offering works from 1500 to the present. The Tate Gallery of Modern Art will concentrate on British and international art since 1900.
But with an eye toward keeping its Millbank site an attraction for the young museumgoer as well as the old, Mr. Serota has purposely decided to keep the annual Turner Prize exhibition -- an always much-talked-about show of the work of the finalists chosen for the coveted $32,000 prize awarded annually to a contemporary British artist -- at Millbank even after the opening of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art.
"It's a way of keeping the place contemporary as well as historic," Mr. Serota said. "And that's something we very much want to maintain."
(This year's winner, Chris Ofili, 30, a painter whose work centers on issues of black culture and sexual stereotyping, was announced at a dinner at the Tate last night.)
 
Strong Points Of the Collection
Besides the Turner Prize show, what has lured audiences to the Tate, it has boasted an outstanding permanent collection of British art by masters like Turner, Constable and Bacon as well as its well-produced special exhibition schedule. While its holdings of modern and contemporary art are a far cry from those of an institution like the Modern in New York, which has a classic collection of art starting in 1880, the Tate does have a strong collection of modern and contemporary art with pockets of strengths in the work of, say, the Surrealists and figures like Bonnard, Rothko and Giacometti. It also has some outstanding individual pieces by Picasso and Matisse.
So Mr. Serota knows that his main tasks are to court collectors in the hopes of getting their art for the Tate, as well as to raise money for acquisitions. He has already succeeded in snagging some important collections. Janet de Botton, a London-based collector and Tate trustee, gave the museum her collection of contemporary art last year. Mr. Cramer, a trustee of the Modern who is head of its painting and sculpture committee, also gave the Tate several works of contemporary art.
 
Artists' Opinions On a New Site
Right from the start, Tate officials looked to contemporary artists for guidance in choosing a site for the new museum. The officials learned that converted industrial buildings or galleries in the Beaux-Arts style were preferred by artists over new buildings because they felt their work looked best in them.
Mr. Serota had thought of building an extension to the Tate at Millbank, but space was limited and the planning problems became too great. After considering various locations including sites near the Kings Cross railway station in the South Bank section of London and Vauxhall, just opposite Millbank, he deemed the power station ideal, and the local council happily provided $1.6 million toward feasibility studies.
"The challenge was to turn a very closed building into an urban landscape," said Jacques Herzog, whose Swiss architectural firm, Herzog & de Meuron, was awarded the power station project after an international competition. The original Bankside power station, built after World War II, was an imposing five-story building designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of the Liverpool Anglican Cathedral and the designer of London's red telephone booths.
The renovated power station will be transformed into a 360-square-foot museum (a bit larger than the Modern in New York) with a two-story glass structure running the length of the roof, providing natural light for the upper galleries as well as breathtaking views of London. The museum will be entered via a ramp at the building's west end leading down to a covered plaza.
 
3 Main Elements In the Design
The building has been designed in three distinct elements. Turbine Hall, a space 500 feet long, 75 feet wide and 100 feet high, which once housed the power station turbines, is a long covered street intended to be the heart of the building. The old boiler house on the river side of the building will be turned into three floors of galleries. The old switch station at the rear of the building, which now houses an electricity substation, will be transformed in the last phase of the building's development into spaces for performance art. There will also be space for a cafe, an auditorium and rooms for films, seminars and lectures.
The museum's permanent collection will be housed in three large suites of galleries broadly arranged in chronological order. There will also be gallery space for special exhibitions and loans. "I believe that galleries that are plain are the most powerful," Mr. Herzog said. "But they will also be flexible to change as shows do."
The museum is also about architecture that lures people inside. "This building will be like a filter which people can walk through in all directions," Mr. Herzog added. "We want to attract people who aren't necessarily going to the museum, to turn this once hermetically sealed power station into an urban, totally contemporary landscape where both art and people are embodied within the architecture."

HEADLINE: Elevator Technology: Inspiring Many Everyday Leaps of Faith

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB 

 BODY:
BLEARY-EYED and coffee-saturated, you wait for the commuter train in the morning, then the subway, then for 4,000 people to cross 53d Street. By the time you force yourself through the revolving doors at 9 to get to work, the last thing you want to do is wait for a crowded elevator to haul you up to your office.
We could all take a lesson from the Three Stooges, for they knew how to get an elevator pronto: a simple yank on the floor indicator stick above the door inevitably brought the car to them instantaneously -- along with a jumble of bewildered passengers picking themselves up off the floor. 
 That technique doesn't work that well today. After all, when was the last time you even saw a mechanical floor indicator? In the last 50 years -- with the banishment of human operators and starters, individuals who stood outside elevator banks and, with the flick of their metal clickers, told the operators to start moving -- elevator management has become a computer-controlled science, where improvements are measured in fractions of a second.
The Holy Grail, according to Bruce A. Powell, perhaps the industry's only certified elevator scholar, is to make elevator operation seem effortless from the point of view of passengers.
As sole possessor of the title "technical fellow" at Otis Elevator Company in Farmington, Conn., the industry leader, Mr. Powell directs a team of people trying to figure out how to move as many people as possible as quickly as possible in an elevator.
Mechanically, elevators use the same basic design they did when Elisha Otis invented the safety version in the 19th century (the first modern elevator is said to have been built in 1743 in France as a way for Louis XV to slink around the Palace of Versailles undetected -- or, in an alternate version, to allow his mistress to arrive clandestinely). Cars ride up and down a vertical track, raised by either a hydraulic system or a counterweight. A series of cables and ratchets stop the cab from falling; if a cab falls, a safety brake kicks in to slow and stop it.
Today's high-speed elevators have redundant safety systems. The world's fastest elevator, in Osaka, Japan, can move at 2,600 feet per minute (nearly 30 miles per hour), compared with the elevators at the World Trade Center in New York, which can travel at 1,600 feet per minute. Greater speed does not mean greater danger. The last time an elevator may have entered free fall was in 1945, Otis officials say. That was when a B-25 bomber hit the Empire State Building between the 78th and 79th floors, severing lift cables. A cab dropped 75 stories, but the two women inside survived.
In the 1950's, automatic elevators went to floors in the order the call buttons were pushed. Like an emotionally dependent golden retriever, a car would go to the floor that issued the first call, leaving other would-be passengers stranded. Elevators would arrive at lobbies in packs, often empty, rivaling only Manhattan buses as hallmarks of inefficiency.
By the beginning of the next decade, mechanical elevator dispatchers had been programmed to send cars all the way up and all the way down, stopping for passengers along the way -- great if you were the one on or off first, but frustrating if you were along for the long ride. With zoned dispatching strategies, introduced in the mid-1960's, elevators were designated as expresses, serving just lower or higher floors, or as locals. Zone system technology is still in use.
One impetus for smarter elevators came from Asia's economic boom. The growth of heavily populated skyscrapers created an ideal market for better elevators. To make elevators more efficient, the industry developed fuzzy logic, which allows a system to keep several objectives in mind as it juggles elevator routes. If someone on the eighth floor calls for the elevator, the electronic controller is told, in effect: "Hey, stupid, don't just send the closest cab. Send the one a few floors farther away if it's empty because it'll actually get there faster."
First used in a building in Osaka in 1993, fuzzy logic came to our shores two years ago in an Otis retrofit of the elevator systems in the TransAmerica building in San Francisco. This is fuzzy logic with a twist: not only did TransAmerica workers save time in their vertical journeys, but they also found out which elevator they would be taking the moment they asked because of Otis's early car announcement technology. When a passenger asks for an elevator, the system determines which car the passenger should take and directs the passenger to that elevator door immediately by flashing a light over that door -- instead of indicating the car shortly before its arrival. To make sure that 20 embarking passengers do not collide into 15 exiting workers, the system directs riders to one or more empty cars that will leave more quickly instead of to full ones.
Yet the system can be misunderstood. After it was installed at TransAmerica, an angry executive, misunderstanding the advance signal, complained to the building manager that the elevators must be broken because "the elevator light came on and no car came for a long time." Lunch-time lectures were quickly held to explain the new system.
The next big thing in the industry is perfecting neural networks, computer programs that mimic, to some extent, the kind of complex information processing done by neurons in the brain. A neural network system not only learns from the past in directing elevators but also tries to predict future behavior. The technique is becoming possible only now, thanks to more powerful microprocessors.
"These systems will be like computer chess programs," Mr. Powell said. "They'll look at a building's traffic flow and posit 'what ifs.' " For example, elevator systems today can learn to adjust the way they deploy their cars based on changes in passenger traffic in the past few days. With a neural network, "we'll be able to ask what will happen to traffic and car availability a few minutes after I send car A out and to instruct the system not to do so if certain other conditions occur," Mr. Powell said.
People should not have to modify their behavior to adapt to elevators' needs, he said, adding: "We'll need very speedy computer chips. We want elevators to act more like us."

The next generation?
The Odyssey system, an Otis Elevator concept, combines vertical and horizontal movement, allowing many elevator cars to share the same hoistway.
 
Controlled by fuzzy logic
Every time a hall button is pushed, the elevator system's software is set in motion, performing split-second calculations, based on 21 variables, to dispatch the best car. The system can respond to demand based on what it has learned about traffic patterns.
 
The building manager monitors the system's operation on a personal computer. Animations show which cars are moving in which direction, whether doors are open, how many calls are pending and the average waiting time for passengers.
 
Operations are constantly monitored by Otis's remote elevator maintenance system. If problems appear imminent, a technician is dispatched, ideally before breakdowns occur.
 
After weighing this car, which is traveling light, the system tells it to stop on the 8th floor.
 
The system determines that the closest car should not stop on the 8th floor because, based on the weight of the car, it is near its passenger limit.
 
A person on the 8th floor pushes the Up button, seeking to go to the 9th floor.
The system decides that an empty car is the best one to send to the ground floor, even though it is farther away than others.
 
Early car announcement system instructs the light outside the door of the arriving car to illuminate immediately. That allows passengers ample time to get to the doors, lessening the loading time and allowing the car to leave more quickly. By walking to the elevator before it arrives, passengers have the feeling that the waiting time is shorter than it really is.
 
People enter the office building and push the Up elevator button. The system determines which elevator can arrive most quickly, based on how many other stops it is making to pick up and discharge passengers. If the elevator is due to arrive at the ground floor with a large load, waiting passengers may be directed to an empty car instead to decrease congestion.

HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR
Used in low-rise buildings needing speeds of up to 150 feet per minute. The car is connected to the top of a piston, which moves up and down in a cylinder. Movement is controlled by a hydraulic valve. As fluid is pumped into the cylinder, the car rises; as fluid returns to the reservoir, the car lowers.
 
GEARED ELEVATOR
For medium-height buildings requiring speeds of up to 500 feet per minute. The drive is connected to the motor shaft through gears in a gear box.
 
Entrance protection
Fifty-six infrared beams create an invisible net across the elevator entrance. If any beam is interrupted, the system reopens the door instantly -- without touching passengers. Additional beams project into the hallway to detect passengers as they enter or exit the elevator. That helps avoid a potential collision between slow-moving passengers and the door.

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
A Simpatico Connection for Two Genres

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
It would be hard to find two choreographers as different as Ann Reinking of Broadway fame and Ramon Oller of the avant-garde precincts of Barcelona, Spain.
Ballet Hispanico placed their works on the same program on Tuesday night; it was, depending upon your point of view, an exercise in incongruity or eclecticism.
Nonetheless, this opening of a two-week season at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street in Chelsea) was typical. Tina Ramirez, the company's founder, has never been dogmatic about seeking out new works or new choreographers, asking only for a Hispanic connection in theme or music. More than most artistic directors, she has consistently given exposure to fresh talent. 
 As a choreographer, Ms. Reinking is still a relative novice despite her career as a musical-comedy star and her brilliant recension of Bob Fosse's dances in the current production of "Chicago." Mr. Oller was known on the experimental modern-dance scene in Europe (he was part of the 1992 Lyons Dance Biennial), but it was Ms. Ramirez who introduced his work to the United States a few years ago.
On Tuesday, Ballet Hispanico presented the world premiere of his "Bury Me Standing," inspired by the life of Gypsies, and "Una Mujer Llorando," a recent duet that was added to the program.
To move from the Oller pieces to Ms. Reinking's "Ritmo y Ruido" (1997) requires a psychological shift by the audience. "Ritmo" is a sleek, jazz-tinged crowd pleaser, while Mr. Oller's works generally have a dark side, expressed in a passionate use of energy.
"Bury Me Standing" gets off to a murky start, but its impressionistic images of Gypsy mores eventually achieve a cumulative power. Mr. Oller has borrowed his title from a study of Balkan Gypsies by the American writer Isabel Fonseca. In her book, a Gypsy asks to be buried standing because, he says, he has been on his knees all his life.
Nonetheless, Mr. Oller's piece lacks some coherence and only his final image, of an ensemble running in place, reveals where his sympathies lie. Anyone who has seen the anti-Gypsy code words (No vagabonds allowed) on signposts in Europe will understand this symbol of an entire people on the run as perennial outsiders.
Eugene Lee's decor sets the scene with admirable economy under Roger Morgan's lighting. There is no picturesqueness to this modern Gypsy community site with its wire fence, clotheslines and doorways defined by lighted bulbs. Suits and hats for the men as well as dresses and head scarves for the women come across in Willa Kim's costumes dyed in vibrant hues of red and blue. These are not necessarily Spanish Gypsies, although some of the taped music is flamenco. But other songs are in Romany, reminiscent of those recorded by great Russian Gypsy artists.
In this generic yet specific world, Mr. Oller begins with a cart, a symbol of Gypsy wandering. Wrist-rotating women make way for a male dancer, Pedro Ruiz. Despite the fleeting references to flamenco dance or to a bullfighter's stance in Mr. Ruiz's solo, the choreography throughout the piece is not folkloric but in Mr. Oller's highly physical modern-dance style.
When Alessandra Corona and Yael Levitin tumble off the cart and later explore shifts of weight and support in duets with male partners, the dancing has the look of 1990's experimental dance, full of athletic tensions and released energy. After Arleane Lopez gives the right amplitude to a solo with open shapes, ballet steps and little stamps, Ms. Levitin and Carlos R. Sierra Lopez have a tender duet. He lies on the ground and supports her on the soles of his feet as she changes position. When both dancers rise, shoot their arms forward and freeze in a stylized embrace, their passion is a shock. Then, like the abducted brides of Gypsy lore, Ms. Corona finds herself often carried on Mr. Ruiz's back.
The context for these set pieces is provided by the ensemble, which includes Hector Montero, Aydmara Cabrera, Lisa Nafegar, Terry Fox and Rochelle Aytes. Mr. Oller gives them a collage of motifs from Gypsy customs (a cluster of votive candles) and dances (women slapping their thighs). The piece needs some tightening, but then perhaps its atmosphere would not seep in so persuasively.
"Una Mujer Llorando" ("A Crying Woman") actually begins with Ms. Cabrera sobbing and bent over, with Mr. Montero behind her. As they tumble out of an embrace to guitar music (credited to Peteneras), the kind of expressive physicality that Mr. Oller's company, Metros Dansa Contemporania, executes so fearlessly comes into play. On this occasion the mechanics of the choreography, with its many lifts, was too evident and the devotional ending was obscure.
There was nothing puzzling about "Ritmo y Ruido" ("Rhythm and Ruckus"), and the dancers took energetically to the slink and swivel of Ms. Reinking's choreography. The vocals and percussion score by Philip Hamilton and Tobias Ralph provided the Afro-Cuban beat.

Images of a Bleak Era

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
In the Great Depression, the Federal Government hired a corps of photographers to capture the searing poverty of beleaguered farmers and other workers and, not incidentally, to provide work for unemployed photographers. Now these pictures, some of the most memorable photographs of that era, have been made available over the Internet to anyone with a computer.
One of those great photographers could not be more pleased. 
"I think it's important because otherwise an important part of history is sitting dead in files," said the photographer, Gordon Parks, who went from being a $48-a-week Government photographer to having a long career that also brought him acclaim as a movie director.
The Internet project includes well-known pictures like Mr. Parks's image of a black charwoman holding a broom and a mop in front of an American flag in Washington, which was segregated then, in an ironic homage to Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
"It should be profitable to many people," Mr. Parks said. "The photographs are indictments of what the Government was doing wrong."
The Library of Congress has put on line 52,000 black-and-white pictures, plus 1,600 color ones. They are from the collections of the Farm Security Administration and a successor agency, the Office of War Information, and were selected from 164,000 photographs taken from 1935 to 1945. Eventually, all the pictures in the collection, "America From the Great Depression to World War II," will be put on the Internet.
The Web site for the photos is memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsahtml/ fahome.html.
Besides Mr. Parks, who has 227 pictures on the Web site, other photographers represented include Walker Evans, who has 517 photographs on the site, including the simply titled "Sharecropper's Grave" from 1936.
Dorothea Lange has 759 images, including "Migrant Mother: Destitute Pea Pickers in California." The photograph, from 1936, is of a defeated woman with two children, their backs to the camera, burying their faces on her shoulders as she stares ahead.
There are 1,430 photos by Ben Shahn, some showing people trying to eke out livings as as cotton pickers, miners and masons. An itinerant street photographer stands in front of a restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, in August 1938, his eyes asking that passers-by pose and buy the photograph from him.
Beverly Brannan, a curator of photography at the Library of Congress, said that the Internet program had its roots in a preservation project that started seven years ago, when positive prints and digital versions were made from the library's collection of negatives. The Internet site started becoming available to the public in September. "It is part of a preservation project for the negatives, and at the same time makes it more accessible," Ms. Brannan said.
Mr. Parks and the other photographers still alive will not make any money from the distribution of their pictures because they were made while the photographers were working for the Federal agencies.
Carl Fleischauer, technical coordinator for the project, said that the resolution of the pictures on the Internet was similar to that found in daily newspapers but not so clear as for photographs in magazines. But no matter how good the computer and printer, the Internet pictures are still not near the quality of the photographic prints. These can be ordered from the Library of Congress for $18 and up.

HEADLINE: Toil and Trouble In Plexi-Land

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
MODERNISM can be dangerous. Just ask Cremilda Conceicao, whose forehead and sweat pants bear the battle scars of 14 years of cleaning the see-through elevator, transparent sinks and 17 levels of Plexiglas walkways and mirrored I-beams that snake bewilderingly through the late architect Paul Rudolph's Beekman Place triplex, perhaps the city's most stunning apartment.
"It's a crazy place, very accidental," she was explaining this week, spritzing Windex as she recounted how she almost fell off a balcony while trying to clean a Plexiglas platform that serves as head-grazing ceiling for one level and the floor for the level above. "You're always cleaning back and forth, back and forth. It's never ending." 
 The never-ending possibilities of space was a concept held dear by the modernist architect, who died at age 78 last summer. He left behind a mysterious infinity-box of an apartment -- the building is now on the market for $5.65 million, reduced from $6.25 million -- in which every detail was the product of his singular, some might say obsessive vision, from a built-in television set encased in chrome-plated Formica to steel staircases without banisters, whose dagger edges continue to wreak havoc on Miss Conceicao's sweat pants.
The latest occasion for Windex was a party given by Nest magazine last week, a dizzying affair that drew nearly 200 people, some of whom found themselves drinking white wine and listening to performance artists while trying to forget they were standing in a cantilevered bathtub. Never mind the transparent sink through which you could see into the bedroom below. The most sought-after accessory may not have been a Prada waist pouch, but a scopolamine patch for seasickness tucked surreptitiously behind the ear.
The apartment, a tectonic collision of abstract-mirrored and transparent forms that occupies the top three and a half floors of the nine-floor building, may ultimately be looked upon as a poignant piece of modernist folk art. Like the Rev. Howard Finster's "Paradise Garden," it is a fiercely personal, handmade, never-finished laboratory of one man's ideas. And like the Finster environment, it is in jeopardy. The creator of this passionate spatial fantasy, a rare, intact artifact from the Plexi-Baroque period, was a celebrated Harvard-educated architect, who served as dean of the Yale University School of Architecture from 1958 to 1965, and during his lifetime was described by Mildred F. Schmertz, the former editor of Architectural Record, as the "world's most eminent diehard late modernist."
Though he studied with Walter Gropius and was steeped in Bauhaus, Mr. Rudolph's spaces were "emotionally decorative," observed Donald Luckenbill, who served as Mr. Rudolph's project architect from 1969 to 1982 and oversaw the apartment's construction (though the Mr. Rudolph tinkered with it practically daily until his death from asbestos-related cancer -- "He could never leave it alone," Mr. Luckenbill said). He loved making turns; for example, entering the apartment is a Rod Serling experience in which floors feel tenuous and corners seem to dematerialize in reflections. "He wanted to reorient you to the inside, to debrief you and then capture you in a new world," Mr. Luckenbill said. "He wanted to overwhelm, bedazzle you with what he could do."
The apartment is indeed bedazzling. It was conceived as a sequence of pinwheeling planes, the concept of split-level taken to extremes. It is a piece of spatial choreography, composed of mirrored steel beams and translucent acrylic bridges, that do not form rooms so much as interpenetrate, changing elevations and seemingly defying gravity.
Mr. Rudolph was constantly experimenting with materials, once sheathing the apartment with Plexiglas floors, lighted from beneath. He was not a big fan of furniture, so he invented built-ins, like a daybed in which beige suede pillows are attached with metal rings to steel springs, like a spiral notebook.
In some ways, the apartment might be interpreted as the rebellious act of a minister's son who pushed the limits of conventional notions of space and home. "It's not a normal home," Peter Blake, an architectural critic and close friend, said. "It's a dream house, completely mad and uninhabitable in many ways, but beautiful to be in."
The most uninhabitable spaces may be the bathrooms (mercifully, a see-through Jacuzzi is now boarded up). But one bathroom has no privacy, despite Plexiglas shutters. "He was interested in translucency," Ms. Schmertz said. "Perhaps too interested." The apartment also contains precipitous drops, modernist crevasses, which, a close friend said, resulted in the loss of a pet cat. "People tried not to drink too much when they were at Paul's," she said, "but that poor cat. . . ."
Nevertheless, the idiosyncratic space abounds in human touches, like a spear from New Guinea that projects out defiantly from a kitchen equipped with see-through shelves and see-through glasses. Mr. Rudolph invented ingenious ways to organize his treasures, like tiny Mexican milagros, marching single file along ribbons of Mylar embedded in Plexiglas.
Mr. Rudolph's spirit seems to permeate the place even now, accentuated by a small memorial surrounded by votive candles containing his ashes. It is a shrine to modernism, one that is betraying its age in scuffed chrome, buckling carpeting and fraying Plexiglas.
The fate of Mr. Rudolph's daring creation is of deep concern to his friends and to those who envision the space as an architectural and urban think tank. The Landmarks Preservation Commission does not designate residential interiors unless they are open to the public, though at 30 years old, the Rudolph design could qualify. Ernst Wagner, the estate's co-executor and a longtime friend, says there had been an attempt to contact potential modernist-loving white knights and former clients like Sid Bass, the Texas industrialist. Sotheby's International Realty, the property's agent, has placed ads in Malaysia, Singapore and other outposts where Mr. Rudolph worked in his later years, marketing it as contemporary. "But the Asian economy is not exactly at the point where many are able to make this kind of purchase," Frederick J. Williams, an associate broker, said.
To Mr. Wagner, "preservation is a key issue, because this was a very, very personal piece of work." Thomas Heckman, an attorney and the estate's co-executor with Mr. Wagner, said net proceeds from the building's sale will go to the Library of Congress, home to 1,493 tightly packed tubes of renderings extricated over a two-day period from the apartment. Meantime, the space is being rented out for fashion shoots.
"It's unlike any place in New York," Mr. Blake said. "I'm buying lottery tickets myself."

HEADLINE: The Pop Life;
Cartoons Dare To Mock Icons

BYLINE: By Neil Strauss 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The discipline of pop-music cartoon strips is a small and sad one, but one of the best has always been "Great Pop Things." Running for 10 years in alternative weekly newspapers, this pen-and-ink history of rock-and-roll has informed readers that Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones ate so much candy that "his entire body rotted away from the teeth downwards," Madonna "tried to change organized religion" by "wearing her underwear outside her clothes," Bob Dylan's music opened the way for new singer-songwriters who "were usually discovered feeling sorry for themselves on the stairs at parties" and Bono of U2 "retired from music to make LP's."
For those who don't live in the cities where the comic strip is regularly published (Los Angeles and Chicago, mainly), this smart, skewed, pun-filled and just plain inaccurate history of rock-and-roll has always been out of reach. This month, its best strips have been anthologized for the first time in the United States as a book, "Great Pop Things: The Real History of Rock-and-Roll From Elvis to Oasis" by Verse Chorus Press. (In 1992, Penguin in England released a hard-to-find anthology that the creators weren't happy with, then retained the rights to the comics until last year.) 
 Steve Connell, who runs Verse Chorus Press and is a publisher of the music magazine "Puncture," said he was attracted to the comic strip by "the attitude of complete irreverence to things that are normally approached with great reverence -- phenomena like U2 especially, which begs to be made fun of."
The strip is drawn by Jon Langford (of the 20-year-old rock group the Mekons) under the pseudonym Chuck Death. A friend from his hometown of Newport, Wales, Colin B. Morton, writes the text.
"Some people have a problem with the comic strip," Mr. Langford said. "Morrissey picked up a copy and threw it across the room and said his chin was too big. He was quite angry. But others, especially less popular bands, have used the comic as a T-shirt and view being included in it as an honor."
The criteria for being included in "Great Pop Things" are usually arrogance, a lack of self-awareness and being a pop-culture phenomenon, which has made for lots of comics about Morrissey, Madonna and U2. Unlike Morrissey, U2 has never responded to the barbed, mocking insults the comic has hurled at them. "That's one of the things that gall me," Mr. Langford said. "We relentlessly pillory them for being one of the most obnoxious and pompous of rock bands. But they've never gotten back to us. I'm sure they could break our legs if they wanted to."
The strip originally ran in Record Mirror in England in 1988 and, according to Mr. Langford, his inspiration has never ebbed. "Just when we think we've run out of ideas, David Bowie will say he's going to relaunch 'Ziggy Stardust,' " he said. "Or the Sex Pistols will reform and we'll go, 'Wow, we can get five strips out of that; that's like 500 bucks.' There's no bounds to the ridiculousness of pop people."
But does Mr. Langford feel hypocritical in making fun of all these popular and semipopular musicians when he is one himself? "They've got more money than me, but they're not as good-looking or talented, so I should ridicule them," he explained, not without sarcasm. "So it was partially inspired out of greed and hatred."
 
R-and-B Awards
The Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation announced the recipients of its annual Pioneer Awards yesterday. They include Johnny Adams, the New Orleans singer who died this year; Garnet Mimms, the leader of the Enchanters whose songs have been most famously interpreted by Janis Joplin; Mickey Baker, the prolific session guitarist; Brenda Holloway, the Motown singer; Dee Dee Warwick, the sister of Dionne; Patti LaBelle and the Bluetones, whose original lineup will be reunited at the awards ceremony for the first time since 1967; the Manhattans and members of the Drifters. In addition, John Lee Hooker, now in his 50th year recording music, will receive a lifetime achievement award.
The awards ceremony and performances will be at Sony Studios here, with Smokey Robinson as host, on Feb. 25, a date strategically planned for the day after the Grammy Awards. This way, rhythm-and-blues music can borrow some of the fanfare from the popular music that has borrowed so much from it. Unlike the Grammys, however, recipients of the Pioneer Award receive not just recognition and a piece of molded metal but also a fat check: $15,000 for individuals, $20,000 for groups. This year, the foundation is giving away $260,000, a sum that Janis Hazel, the foundation's new executive director, describes as "an all-time whopper."
Over the last year, she said, the foundation has focused on its education project, creating a 26-part radio series on rhythm-and-blues planned to run on National Public Radio next year and working on bringing music education programs to schools. The foundation has also continued its drive to make sure music pioneers with a legacy but little money to show for it (thanks chiefly to bad record deals) have what they need. It helped pay medical and, ultimately, funeral expenses for one of this year's honorees, Mr. Adams.
The foundation started 10 years ago with seed money from Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records, but recently it has been forced to get more creative in its search for funds, which may be one reason Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon and a rhythm-and-blues fan, will be presiding over this year's ceremony. "The economy has shrunk, the music industry is tightening its belt," Ms. Hazel said. "We need to seriously fund-raise in order to continue with our programs so we have been looking at other industries like automobile and major appliance manufacturers that use R-and-B in their advertisements."

You Bet Your Life

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Let me lay before you a modest proposal that will enable us to double aid to education, insure everybody's health, put a million new cops on the streets and install an impenetrable missile defense -- all while cutting taxes across the board.
Here's the big idea: a national lottery with the world's first billion-dollar jackpot. 
 Radical, you say? Smacks of a banana republic, unbefitting the only global superduperpower? You are out of step with the people; you have missed the great something-for-nothing cultural shift.
Gambling is now far more American than apple pie. Annual U.S. sales of apple pie (35 percent of the total pie market) can be estimated at a mere $150 million; the gaming profession (formerly the casino industry, and before that the gambling racket) turns over bets of at least $50 billion a year.
Politicians oppose gambling's political juggernaut at their peril. The Republican Governors of South Carolina and Alabama, old-fashionably trying to resist the tide of lotteries and video poker games in their states, were overwhelmed by candidates advised by the Cajun Clintonian, James Carville, to advocate letting the good dice roll.
And not just in the swingin' South did the bingo brigades triumph in the '98 elections. Missouri showed us the way in an initiative legalizing "boat in the moat" casinos on riverboats that sit in man-made basins.
Arizonans voted 2 to 1 to continue their troubled lottery. Californians by the same margin gave Indian tribes the right to build glitzy casinos to snatch back high-rolling palefaces from Las Vegas, in the highest-spending statewide campaign in U.S. history. Only in Maryland did the gambling fever fail to infect the populace. Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, standing in the racetrack gate to bar slot machines, turned back a conservative candidate backed by gambling interests.
The people have spoken. Morality, shmorality. Those of us fuddy-duddies who hold that state-sponsored gambling is a perversion of public policy have been routed. Time not just to move on, but to move up to the Age of the Crapshooter.
Who can be expected to support my Billion-Dollar National Lottery (BDNL)?
Democratic intellectuals should seize on it. First, it would put the Federal Government in direct competition with private casino operators, always a desirable matchup. Second, a national lottery, with its publicizable billion-dollar jackpot, would undermine the burgeoning state lottery system and concentrate power in Washington, always better equipped to allocate resources fairly.
Republican fat cats should be supportive. Everyone in the 38 percent bracket knows that it is in the nature of lotteries to soak the poor, who have been getting away with economic murder since the imposition of progressive taxation. Under the BDNL, the sure losers -- those poor suckers happy to contribute a high percentage of their earnings to a lottery -- make it possible to reduce the heavy tax burden of life's winners.
Campaign strategists of both parties will set up their dissembly lines. All know that with the siren call of money "earmarked for education," lottery income soon substitutes for general revenues formerly spent on education. Thus, in the hands of persuasive focus groupies, a surreptitious sin tax can masquerade as a virtuous, pain-free non-tax.
Opposition is likely to come from newly affluent Indian tribes now snatching bread from the mouths of Bugsy Siegel's successors. Senator Richard (Slots for Tots) Bryant of Nevada induced the General Accounting Office to launch a $70,000 harassment of the Federal commission finding rampant compulsive gambling. Instead, his contributor-constituents should get him to induce tax-free tribal profiteers to reduce the $1.7 billion budget of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The most serious challenge to the BDNL will come from the cyberbettors. Government-sponsored gambling will whet the next generation's appetite for ever-greater ripoffs of indigent thrill-seekers. Our great national bet would ultimately be covered and raised: On the Internet, helping squeeze a few hundred million taka out of Bangladesh, millennial gamblers can foresee the Trillion-Dollar Global Jackpot.

HEADLINE: Unions Turn Chilly, Too, By Striking In France

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
French train conductors say they're lonely and overworked, so they have been on strike since last Thursday, disrupting long-distance rail service in many regions.
French journalists say their paychecks don't buy as much as they used to, so they went on strike this week, too -- not against their newspapers and television and radio stations, but against a Government plan to do away with a special tax deduction of up to 50,000 francs, or $8,850, that they have enjoyed since 1934. 
 The long-term unemployed, who closed state job offices last Christmas and demanded higher benefits, occupied an unemployment office on Monday in Marseilles, where the movement began, demanding a Christmas bonus of 3000 francs, or $530, like the one they received last year.
The French have been taking to the streets since the Revolution, usually to demand something from the state. Not surprisingly, because Government spending amounts to 56 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 41 percent in the United States.
The end of the year, when the days become short, cold and gray, usually brings a spate of labor disputes and visions of paralyzing national shutdowns like the three-week transportation strike in 1995 that sealed the fate of a conservative Government that had tried to reduce pension benefits.
The latest strike on the state railroad is not anywhere near that big. But its 11,000 conductors have kept up steady pressure to try to force the network to hire additional conductors. A union conductor in Bordeaux, Sauveur Ventura, told Agence France-Presse on Monday that it was sometimes a lonely job with many responsibilities but nobody to talk to except passengers. "We're also attacked by customers who complain about fares' being raised," Mr. Ventura said.
Then Agence France-Presse shut down for most of Tuesday because of the journalists' strike.
The 182,000 railway workers run some of the fastest, cleanest and sleekest trains in the world. These days they work, indirectly, for a Communist, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, under a Socialist Government that promises to reduce the workweek for all of them to 35 hours starting next year, as some have had for years. But the conductors are also striking to make sure the workweek reductions are negotiated seriously.
The former aerospace executive in charge of the railroad, Louis Gallois, said last week that railroad employees accounted for 20 to 30 percent of all workdays lost to strikes in France.
"It's the way the enterprise resolves its internal conflicts," Mr. Gallois said. "Everybody lives off strikes: the hierarchy, the administration, the staff and the labor unions."
Even though fewer than 10 percent of workers in France belong to unions, polls show that the public generally sympathizes with them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Sales Were Strong in October

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Americans snapped up new homes at a rapid pace in October, keeping sales on course for a very strong year and highlighting the resilience of the United States economy.
Sales of single-family homes rose eight-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 851,000 units, the Commerce Department said today. It was the 14th consecutive month the sales pace has topped 800,000 -- the longest such period on record. 
 "We will easily see an all-time high for sales in 1998," said David Seiders, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, who predicted sales of new homes would total 865,000 this year, breaking the previous record of 819,000 set in 1977.
Analysts said the housing figures signaled remarkable resilience in the United States economy, despite an economic slump overseas that has taken a bite out of the manufacturing sector.
The October home sales rate was well above Wall Street economists' forecasts for 844,000.
The pickup in October was attributable entirely to a large increase in the West. Other regions had declines. In the South, sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent. They dropped 5.4 percent in the Midwest and plummeted 11 percent in the Northeast.

Losses Trimmed in Afternoon Rebound; Dow Falls by 69

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks weakened yesterday after Boeing and Sears, Roebuck warned of lower 1999 profits, but all major averages rebounded smartly during the afternoon to finish with losses well under 1 percent.
"There was pressure coming in, only to be met by strong institutional demand," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at Gruntal & Company. 
 He said some of this buying reflected "window dressing" by portfolio managers eager to be seen holding winners in year-end statements.
Boeing's disclosure late Tuesday that it expected profits to be as much as 25 percent less than the company projected in July sent its shares plunging 6 11/16 , to 33 11/16 , accounting for 40 percent of the loss in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The blue-chip gauge closed 69 points lower after having skidded more than 178 points at midday.
But the aircraft maker's swoon, which also prompted selling in United Technologies, down 4 13/16 , to 101 5/8, and other of its suppliers, was said to be more a reflection of disappointment with Boeing's erratic response to Asian economic problems than to fears that Asian orders will shrink further.
As for Sears, which now predicts an earnings rise of 1 percent to 3 percent instead of the 5.2 percent that Wall Street expected, fell 1 9/16 , to 43, as most department stores and discounters lost ground.
Although most Internet stocks and other speculative favorites lost ground, buyers gave the latest initial public offering a warm reception. E-Tek Dynamics offered 5 million shares at 12 and the fiber optics company traded as high as 29 7/8 before closing at 26 3/4.
The recent frenzied buying of almost every company with an Internet tie brought a strong expression of concern from John H. Laporte, a specialist in small-capitalization companies at T. Rowe Price.
"It clearly represents a speculative bubble," not unlike tulip mania centuries ago in the Netherlands, he told an investment seminar in New York. "I think it's quite worrisome."
A report of stepped-up insider selling at Excite and other Internet companies apparently dampened enthusiasm yesterday.
Another sign that the market may be growing less exuberant, observed Richard E. Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason, is a survey showing less bullishness among Wall Street traders. The latest reading found 60 percent optimistic, down from 78 percent last week.
Exxon, which said it retained the ability to call off its acquisition of Mobil if demands of antitrust enforcers were judged too onerous, eased 3/8, to 71 1/4.
Drug stocks were among the afternoon's recovery pacesetters. Schering-Plough gained 4 3/8, Bristol-Myers 3 7/16 , Pfizer 2 1/16and Merck, American Home Products and Abbott a point or more each.
Tomorrow, Citigroup will begin trading under the ticker symbol C, the designation for Chrysler before the auto maker merged with Daimler-Benz.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 34/100ths of 1 percent yesterday while the Nasdaq composite was down 43-hundredths of 1 percent. The Russell 2000 fell 31-hundredths of 1 percent.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,737 to 1,348, with 74 making new highs for the year and 56 new lows. Volume was a moderate 727.4 million.
Shares were mostly lower overseas -- 1.12 percent in Brazil, 1.36 percent in Germany, 1.04 percent in France and 55-hundredths of 1 percent in Britain. Prices rose, however, in Japan and Hong Kong, by 1.02 percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent.

Bonds Rally for 6th Day
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bonds rose yesterday for the sixth consecutive trading session, the longest contiguous gain in more than a year, as weakened stock prices led investors to the safety of Treasury issues.
The benchmark 30-year bond rose 11/32, to 103 19/32 , cutting its yield 2 basis points, to 5.02 percent, the lowest since Oct. 19.
Bonds have climbed every day since Nov. 23 -- with trading halted Nov. 26 in the United States for Thanksgiving -- for gains of some 2 3/8 points, a streak not seen since November 1997. The 30-year yield has fallen almost a quarter percentage point in that time, as United States stocks retreated from record highs, falling oil prices raised expectations for scant inflation and reports suggested the economy is slowing.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON with John Tierney, Marcelle S. Fischler and Corey Kilgannon 

 BODY:

A Softball Question For Mr. Microsoft
 It was a friendly crowd and a friendly question, but WILLIAM H. GATES resisted the temptation to speak too frankly.
Mr. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft and star witness at the Government's antitrust trial, was addressing a luncheon yesterday at the Roosevelt Hotel organized by the Manhattan Institute, a public-policy group more sympathetic to entrepreneurs than Government attorneys. 
 Sure enough, one person in the audience raised a question about the antitrust case: Was it based on a genuine misunderstanding of the law and the marketplace, or was it class warfare inspired by jealousy of Mr. Gates?
No doubt Mr. Gates could give an answer that would fill a nice long E-mail. But not this time.
"I can't delve into their mental processes," he said, smiling. "There are many paths to making a mistake."
 
No Hard Feelings
The financier GEORGE SOROS is not an unqualified admirer of the International Monetary Fund, and said so at the New York Public Library on Tuesday night. "The I.M.F. system of raising interest rates in a crisis is rather counterproductive," he declared.
At which point his microphone died.
"The I.M.F. just turned it off," quipped the economist JEFFREY MADRICK, who was moderating the session.
The 550 or so tip-hunting listeners did not find out where Mr. Soros thinks the stock markets will go, but once the public-address system was revived, he was asked about his famous bet on the British pound, the one that netted him $1 billion in a single week in 1992. He called it morally defensible.
The financier LEON LEVY went further.
Noting that the British had to devalue the pound and lower interest rates, Mr. Levy said: "George should be honored. They should make him Lord Soros."
 
Reverse Commute
It was camp-reunion time for the Hamptons crowd on Tuesday night. Artists, filmmakers and writers who seem to have been spending at least as much time on eastern Long Island as in Manhattan were sipping cocktails at the Plaza Hotel.
"I didn't know all these people had places to live in the city," said the actor ALAN ALDA, looking over the black-tie crowd at the Guild Hall Academy of the Arts awards dinner, an annual event for the theater-and-museum complex in East Hampton. Mr. Alda -- like at least two other guests, PETER STONE and BARRY SONNENFELD -- lives in the Hamptons year round and ventures into Manhattan only when he has to.
Others in the crowd come and go, but often spend much of the workweek wishing they could stay out east.
"Being outside New York City tends to leaven people somewhat," said the ABC News anchor PETER JENNINGS, who is himself a Hamptons homeowner. "I was talking to Julian Schnabel, who under normal circumstances is a giant, but under Hamptons circumstances is a neighbor. It makes a difference."
 
A Pet Project
 EARTHA KITT arrived with her two miniature poodles, Abba and Mutzi. They are dogs-about-town: she takes them along when she performs at the Carlyle Hotel.
But this was a lunch for the Harmony Institute, a nonprofit group that studies the relationships between people and animals and was unveiling plans for a "luxury pet residence" in Orlando, Fla. It will have concierges for pets and outdoor doggie showers.
"I don't have two-legged kids, I have four-legged kids," MARTHA E. LENTZ, the Harmony Institute's chairwoman, said as she reached for a cigarette after the lunch. "I try to smoke around my pets as little as possible, but I'm sure they have the same amount of lung disease as I do."

RUSSIA: TALKS ON ECONOMIC CRISIS -- The head of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, met again with Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and praised Russia's "pragmatic" course in dealing with its economic crisis. But Mr. Camdessus said a team from the Fund would have to return next month for further negotiations on releasing the frozen loans that Russia badly needs. (AP)
 
RUSSIA: STATUE TO RISE AGAIN -- The Communist- dominated lower house voted overwhelmingly to resurrect a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, left, the first chief of the Soviet Union's secret police, in the center of Moscow. The towering bronze statue of "Iron Felix," a landmark during the Soviet era, was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has since languished in a city park. (AP) 

GERMANY: CHANGE URGED FOR EUROPEAN UNION -- Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said new members should be admitted to the European Union only if Germany's financial contributions to the were reduced. Germany, the largest net contributor, has long lobbied for reform of the group's finances. (NYT)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: BLAIR RETURNS TO BELFAST -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain flew to Belfast for the second time in a week to meet with political leaders in an effort to break the deadlock in the peace effort. Catholic and Protestant parties are feuding over the makeup of the new legislature's executive and the responsibilities to be given new cross-border councils with the Republic of Ireland.

Previous joint exercises involved units from Hong Kong when it was a British colony. China and the United States agreed to conduct joint exercises when President Clinton visited Beijing in July.

CHINA: CALL TO OPEN COURTROOMS -- Court trial procedures throughout China must be opened to the public starting next year, its top judicial official, Xiao Yang, said in a report by the New China News Agency. But the Government has indicated that it will still hold closed trials for people accused under the vague state secrets law used to prosecute dissidents. (AP)
 
JAPAN: JUMP IN DEFICIT PREDICTED -- Japan's budget deficit will rise to 9.8 percent of its gross domestic product by the end of the current fiscal year as the Government is forced to sell new bonds to pay for stimulus measures to revive the moribund economy, the Finance Ministry said. The deficit was 6.3 percent in March 1998, the end of the last fiscal year. (Bloomberg News)
 
INDONESIA: PROTESTERS MARCH ON PALACE -- Ignoring an appeal by President B. J. Habibie to stay off the capital's streets, about 1,000 students marched on the Presidential Palace to present a petition demanding democratic reforms.

HEADLINE: Boeing Plan for Job Cutbacks Is Bitter Pill for Seattle Area

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash., Dec. 2

 BODY:
For all the talk of Microsoft's exercising global dominance from the empire's capital here in the Seattle area, most residents know that the big engine for jobs in the region remains the Boeing Company, the nation's largest exporter, whose 100,000-strong local work force is eight times the size of Microsoft's.
The airplane behemoth is the region's biggest employer, providing good jobs for tens of thousands of blue-collar workers, whose strong union has secured the kinds of wages that enable many workers to afford fishing boats and second homes in the Pacific Northwest mountains. 
 So when the company announced on Tuesday that it was cutting 20 percent of its worldwide work force over the next two years -- 20,000 jobs in addition to the 28,000 it had announced in July -- with many of those cuts planned for the Seattle area, the news hit like a chill winter wind. Boeing, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 16.7 percent, or by $6.6875, to $33.6875 today in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow was down 69 points for the day. Page C1.
The chief factor cited by Boeing for the company's downturn, the Asian recession, continues to hammer at the local economy in other ways as well: exports of all non-aircraft products from this heavily trade-dependent state are down more than 30 percent in the last year, state economists say. And while exporters here see signs that Asia's problems may be easing, those projections seem to provide little consolation for Boeing workers.
"I can't see any quick turnaround," Thomas Plummer, a 49-year-old aircraft test technician on the production line for the 747 jumbo jet, said as he finished the graveyard shift early this morning. "I mean, even if things get better over there, I can't see Asian airlines rushing out and saying, 'Hey, let's buy a lot of big planes to celebrate.' You're talking $180 million or so for a fully loaded 747. That's a serious chunk of change."
Kevin Moe, 35, a wing mechanic who was laid off for four years in the early 1990's and fears a similar fate now, agreed. "You've got to think, how many planes do we already have sitting in the desert with no customers," Mr. Moe said, referring to a collection of sparkling new wide-bodied jets that are indeed parked there because various airlines, most from Asia, have not been able to pay for their orders.
"You'd like to think there was something you could do, work harder, whatever" to stem the company's problems, he added. "But what can you do? It's out of your hands."
The job cuts represent a potentially serious blow to the region's economy, especially because the rough rule of thumb is that every job at Boeing creates about three other jobs, directly, in related businesses like suppliers, or indirectly, in stores and restaurants. No one here seems to think that things will be anywhere near as dire as the 1970's, when the company cut nearly two-thirds of its work force amid a global recession and a notorious sign directed the last person leaving Seattle to turn off all the lights. But they are a worrying sign.
"If you look at the last Boeing slump, in '91-93, the state economy held up pretty well, because of other areas, obviously the high-tech area, but also timber and agriculture as well," said Charles Hill, a professor at the University of Washington's school of business administration. "The problem now, of course, is that timber and agriculture are Asian-dependent. Go figure. I think it'll hurt us."
Professor Hill and others noted that the Boeing announcement seemed almost strangely late.
"I'm not surprised, I'm surprised that people are surprised," he said. "I think this has been in the cards for 12 months.
"The moment those economies hit the skids," he added, referring to Asia, "this was in the cards."
Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Safeco Asset Management who follows Boeing and who serves on Gov. Gary Locke's Council of Economic Advisers, said the company "seems to be the last one to figure out how bad it would be" in Asia. Even with the signs that the economies are bouncing back, Mr. Whitlow said, there is no short-term good news for Boeing.
"I think it just takes time," he said. "It will be three or four years before you see much of an improvement in deliveries to Asia."
Not everyone thinks that all of Boeing's problems can be traced to Asia. From Seattle to Wall Street, many investors in Boeing have grown frustrated with what they view as the management's persistent failure to forecast the market for its planes accurately.
Boeing officials said today that they had renegotiated many contracts with major suppliers and were taking other cost-saving measures, which they portrayed as helping to ease the problems caused by the fall-off in Asian demand.
"There are things that we can't control, like the Asian crisis," said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. "We work on things we can control, and because of those savings those cuts won't be as deep."
Some of the unionized workers coming off their shift early this morning also said they were suspicious that the cutbacks represent a bargaining threat for the upcoming battle between the company and the aerospace workers union over a new contract. The current one is scheduled to expire next September.
Three years ago, when the current contract was ratified after a 69-day strike, workers claimed a major victory for organized labor, including wage increases of about 10 percent and protection of many health benefits. The bitterness over the negotiations quickly subsided, as the nation and the company enjoyed a huge economic boom. With a surge in demand for Boeing planes, the company made big payments for overtime work, hired more workers (21,000 people in 1996 and 17,000 last year), and pleaded with some retirees to come back to the plants.
Now, of course, the fear is that the boom times are over. And while no specific individuals have yet received layoff notices, everyone knows they're coming.
"You live in this bubble, waiting for the news," said Rolf Vitous, a 34-year-old electrical systems installer who has been with the company for two and a half years. "You don't go out and buy a new car, you don't buy a lot of Christmas presents, you definitely don't go and buy a new house. You lie in the bubble and wait. "
Boeing has jobs in more than half the states in the country, including about 42,000 in Southern California, making it one of the largest single private employers in that region. But its presence in Seattle and its environs is huge, and because this is the production site for most of the wide-bodied jets for which Asian airlines have reduced orders, everyone knows there will be significant job cutbacks here.
"This is a boom-and-bust business, and Boeing people understand the cyclical nature of it," said Mr. Plummer, the test technician. "But that doesn't help when you go home and your spouse says, 'Honey, are you going to have a job tomorrow?' "
While distressed about the job cuts, workers here did not seem particularly angry at Boeing management, nor did they blame the Asian airlines.
"It's not really their fault," said Mr. Vitous. "If you order up a shiny new pick-up truck and then you lose your job, you don't still go out and buy the truck. Well, it's sort of the same thing for them, though we're talking about wide-bodied jets."

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE DEALERS;
Consolidations Give Jitters to Station Operators

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: ROSLYN HEIGHTS, N.Y., Dec. 2

 BODY:
Art Barbuto's credit-card printer spat out a terse message this morning: "Dear Mobil dealers," it said, "A letter has been sent to you today with information on the Exxon Mobil merger."
Like thousands of other gasoline dealers across the country with Mobil franchises, Mr. Barbuto now must wait for answers to the questions that keep popping into his head like the pangs of an oncoming migraine. 
 Will he have to pay more in rent for his filling station? Will the combined entity of Exxon Mobil eliminate the rebates that provide half of his profits? Will he still be able to send his son to college in two years?
In fact, Mr. Barbuto, 42, is in a particularly precarious position. His station, along the eastbound side of the Long Island Expressway, is in direct competition with an Exxon station on the westbound side. Will one of the two stations be shuttered or sold -- either by corporate strategists or by order of the Government's antitrust lawyers?
"There's an awful lot of I don't knows," he said.
Exxon's $80 billion acquisition of Mobil is expected to result in a loss of at least 9,000 jobs for refinery workers and white-collar employees. Consumers could be unaffected, some industry analysts said, if the combined company can bolster profits by cutting costs rather than by raising prices.
Caught in the middle, though -- facing neither the certainty of a swift demise nor the slightest reassurance about the future -- are gasoline dealers like Mr. Barbuto, who leases his shop from Mobil and buys Mobil's gasoline.
There are 8,500 Exxon stations in the country, and 7,400 Mobil stations, according to National Petroleum News, an industry publication. Self-employed dealers account for most of those stations, industry analysts said.
These dealers, who have struggled with shrinking profit margins, are left wondering how many will survive the industry's consolidation and at what price.
The recent combination of the refining and retail operations of Shell and Texaco, which took effect on Aug. 1, suggests the dealers may not escape unscathed. Mike M. Madani, a former Exxon dealer in Redondo Beach, Calif., said the combined Shell and Texaco quickly raised wholesale prices and eliminated the cash rebates they had paid to dealers based on the amount of gasoline they sold -- rebates that frequently meant the difference between profit and loss.
At Mr. Madani's station, now under the Texaco flag, monthly operating profits have fallen sharply. He said he competes with a nearby Mobil, where the operator pays $2,440 a month in rent, and a Shell, where the rent has been raised to $6,000. Since August, he said, the Shell station's pump prices have risen and its sales volume has declined.
Financially distressed Shell and Texaco station operators in 12 states are considering lawsuits over what they consider contract violations resulting from the merger, said Jim Daskal, a lawyer who represents several groups of gasoline dealers.
Dave McKinney, a spokesman for the Shell-Texaco joint venture, said he could not immediately respond to complaints raised by unhappy dealers.
With profits on gasoline shrinking nationwide, service stations have broadened their businesses wherever possible. They have moved from tiny retail counters with cigarettes and candy to ever-larger convenience stores, with drive-up windows for sandwiches and walk-in beer refrigerators.
On this stretch of Long Island's prosperous North Shore, Mr. Barbuto wonders what will become of his hopes to raze his old cinder-block garage, with its three rarely used car lifts, and build a bigger convenience store. "The repair business is dead today, with the advent of leased cars and five-year warranties," he said. "All we get is an oil change here and there, maybe a brake job or a tune-up. I only have one mechanic now. I used to have four."
Mr. Barbuto clearly does not relish the idea of big change. Since he bought the 35-year-old Mobil station from his father in 1983, Mobil has overhauled its fee structure three times, he said. In one instance about six years ago, Mobil charged Mr. Barbuto 20 percent of gross profits -- including sales of gasoline and proceeds from auto repairs. Then, he said, it started charging its costs on the property, plus a markup. Overnight, Mr. Barbuto said, his costs jumped from $3,000 to $8,000 a month.
These days, his Mobil has been locked in fairly stiff competition with the Exxon across the expressway. The cheapest grade of gas at each station was priced at $1.09 today, only 3 cents above what Mr. Barbuto said was his cost. His station sells about 250,000 gallons of gasoline a month from its three pumps, and he believes he has the better location since his is one of the first service stations for drivers leaving New York City, where fuel costs more. But Mr. Barbuto said he still feared what would happen if the merged companies ended up selling or closing some stations.
Federal law gives gasoline dealers the right of first refusal to buy their stations when oil companies decide to pull out of a given area, according to C. Fred Weil, the general counsel for the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association. If an oil company instead sells a group of those franchised stations to an independent company, the new owner is required to offer dealers a chance to stay on. "I don't think any dealer is going to find himself out on the street," Mr. Weil said.
But Mr. Barbuto remains uneasy. While representatives of Exxon and Mobil did not return calls yesterday about their pricing structure for dealers, Mr. Barbuto said all he had heard about Exxon was that it charges gasoline dealers more in rent than Mobil does.
"That's what gets me nervous about the merger," he said. "With Exxon, if they raised my rent another $8,000, I could be facing a $100,000 cost differential. That goes right to my bottom line."

Two French Drug Makers In $10.4 Billion Merger
Two French drug makers, Sanofi and Synthelabo, agreed to merge for $10.4 billion, the second alliance between two European pharmaceutical companies announced this week. 
 The new company, Sanofi-Synthelabo, will have $6.3 billion in annual sales -- about one-fourth the size of Merck -- but will have considerable product strength in the industry. While analysts largely dismissed the partial merger between Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst on Tuesday, the union of Sanofi and Synthelabo won considerable praise. Page C24.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE PRODUCER AXIS;
For OPEC's Richest, Natural Allies of Size

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

 BODY:
With their planned merger, the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation are expected to gain considerably more leverage in their dealings with members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, reversing OPEC's quarter-century of primacy in this relationship, oil-industry experts said yesterday.
The Exxon-Mobil deal, as well as the planned acquisition of Amoco by British Petroleum, sets the stage for a new partnership with large oil-producing countries that could help stabilize prices, but could also curtail the search for oil in countries outside OPEC, where production is more expensive. 
 In essence, these mergers and acquisitions may restore to the international oil companies some of the power they had in the 1950's and 60's, when they were firmly in charge of each facet of the industry, from prospecting for oil to refining it into consumer products.
Now, according to these experts, the consolidating giants will regain control with the willing cooperation of some big OPEC members, which have been financially squeezed by the collapse of oil prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and several other countries are now actively seeking the help of the big international companies to keep their energy industries going.
"At the margin, these mergers are not good news for OPEC, or at least all of OPEC's members," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "They force everyone to be a player. They increase the relative power of buyers against those who sell oil, and they create room for even more savings and more cash to play with by the oil companies. Exxon and Mobil together will need less inventories, less gas stations, less pipelines and less people."
Of course, the lower prices are a potent force behind the mergers. Oil prices have plunged about 40 percent this year, reaching a 12-year low this week around $11 a barrel for American crude oil because of the Asian economic crisis, ample supplies and a succession of mild winters.
So the oil companies are consolidating in part to gain further savings in order to keep operating profitably in the face of such low prices.
"Between OPEC and the oil giants, everybody is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to survive in the low-price environment of today," said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston.
"This is a radical shift from the 70's, which saw the ascendancy of OPEC and oil prices that at times zoomed up close to $40 a barrel -- at a time when Big Oil was kicked out of many oil-producing countries and saw its operations nationalized in places like Libya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait."
Now, with OPEC unable to stop the fall in prices, big oil-producing countries are asking the giant multinationals to come in and look for oil, inviting joint ventures that only a few years ago they avoided.
Over the last few years Iran, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates have initiated joint ventures with international companies. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait say they are now ready, and Iraq continues to seek the lifting of a United Nations embargo to invite the oil companies to come in as partners.
Yesterday, Texaco's chairman and chief executive, Peter I. Bijur, said he would go to Saudi Arabia tomorrow to explore new business opportunities.
"I'm encouraged by the opening of the mind-set of the Saudis," he said.
Roger Diwan, director of global oil markets for the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group in Washington, said the growing collaboration between multinational companies and OPEC nations was likely to dampen the companies' interest in developing production in remote, landlocked regions like Central Asia, where crude oil is relatively expensive to produce and transport.
"It would be absurd," Mr. Diwan said, "for American oil companies to spend huge capital trying to get oil or gas from Central Asia, building pipelines to transport it and shipping it at costs ranging from $6 to $12 a barrel when they can move huge volumes of oil from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran on tankers at costs of $2 to $5 a barrel."
For OPEC's 11 members, the picture will be mixed, Mr. Diwan noted. The big producing nations, with billions of barrels in reserves, are seeing the advantages of using the distribution and marketing resources of the international companies to move large volumes of oil. And countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are attractive to the companies because the oil there can be cheaply produced in great quantities.
As such, the beneficiaries will include Saudi Arabia, which is exporting eight million barrels a day, as well as Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and, in time perhaps, Iraq -- all of which are capable of exporting at least two million barrels a day. All but Iraq have invited large companies to come in and discuss joint ventures.
The losers are likely to be producers like Venezuela, Indonesia, Nigeria and Mexico, which have relatively less in reserve and more expensive oil or, in the case of Mexico, have resisted the idea of joint ventures in favor of building up their own national oil companies as world operators.
Other big losers are likely to be smaller oil companies that emerged in the last two decades to prospect for oil when it was expensive enough to make money.
Many of them are likely to retrench or even go out of business, leaving oil in the ground that has become too expensive to be worth the effort of extracting it. This is particularly so in an environment where oil prices have fallen as steeply as in half over the last two years.
Mr. Diwan estimates that in the last year, the use of drilling rigs in the United States has dropped to less than 55 percent today from 100 percent, suggesting that fewer companies are looking for oil.
This decline in exploration and production is good for OPEC as a whole, Mr. Diwan declared. For years now, the smaller companies have brought more oil onto the market, competing with OPEC production.
Of all the OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia stands by far as the biggest possible beneficiary from the Exxon-Mobil and British Petroleum-Amoco deals. The Saudis have long had close and friendly relationships with large United States oil companies -- ties that have repeatedly paid off.
"We always like our friends to flourish in the oil business," said Hassan Yassin, a Saudi businessman with oil interests. "Exxon, Texaco, Chevron and Mobil have been good friends of Saudi Arabia for decades. It is natural they will be first in line and the bigger they are, the better it is for us."
Abdelsamad al-Awadi, European marketing director for the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in London, agreed.
"There is no question consolidation of the oil industry is a good thing for most of us," he said in an interview. "Our area in the gulf region has been neglected. The big companies will have the money, and we have the oil."
The emerging relationship between the multinational companies and OPEC is different in important ways from the one the companies had in the 50's, 60's and 70's. Now, commercial needs are the primary motivation, whereas in the past relationships were driven by geopolitics.
The change is important to OPEC, an organization that also came to power out of nationalistic concerns.
"We are now open to joint ventures," said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, former oil minister of Algeria who played the major role in 1993 and 1994 in opening the door to foreign oil companies to Algeria.

HEADLINE: BIG OIL: THE WORKERS;
Despite Prospect of Job Cuts, Mobil Workers Are Largely Unfazed

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The lights are not going out at the Mobil Corporation's headquarters now that the Exxon Corporation has agreed to buy the company. They have just become more colorful. 
 At Mobil's corporate headquarters in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Va., today, the day after the largest corporate merger in history was announced, employees were greeted by the company's 21-foot Christmas tree blazing with the sort of large lights that were popular in the 1950's.
Even though 9,000 jobs, about 7 percent of Exxon and Mobil's combined work force of 122,700, are expected to be cut as a result of the merger, the mood of Mobil employees was not gloomy.
Workers seemed festive at the company cafeteria, where Wiener schnitzel was the lunch special. One employee even joked to a colleague: "Where's your tiger shirt?" referring to Exxon's mascot.
The 2,000-plus people working at Mobil's Fairfax campus are not too worried about losing their jobs. One reason is that if the merger is approved by regulators, the Mobil campus would become the headquarters for the combined company's global "downstream" operations, which covers retail gasoline and lubricant sales, as well as refining.
That means overseeing 48,500 gasoline stations and 50 refineries producing 6.1 million barrels of petroleum products a day, said Bob Cummings, a Mobil spokesman.
Workers who do lose their jobs will get four weeks of pay for every year worked at Mobil, double the company's normal severance package.
A lot of that extra pay would go to Mobil's high-level employees of "upstream" operations, involving oil exploration and production, who would not be needed in Fairfax, Mr. Cummings said.
They could be offered jobs at the merged company's office in Houston, which will oversee upstream operations or relocated to international offices, or they could get severance packages.
Mobil's president, Eugene Renna, held two forums with employees on Tuesday to discuss the merger. He said that while there would be job cuts, he did not know where they would occur. "It's total speculation at this point," Mr. Cummings said.
At other locations around the world where Mobil has large numbers of employees, including London, Tokyo, Singapore and Calgary, Alberta, Mobil executives flew in from company headquarters with similar messages.
Workers also saw an eight-minute message from Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Lucio A. Noto, which was taped early Sunday morning, in which he announced that Exxon and Mobil had agreed to the terms of a merger. (Mr. Noto and Exxon's chairman and chief executive, Lee R. Raymond did not actually sign the $80 billion deal until 8:45 A.M. E.S.T. on Monday.)
In his taped message, Mr. Noto, who wore a sweater and slacks instead of a business suit, said the merger would not be without pain but that he would seek to minimize the impact on employees.

HEADLINE: A Call to Unite Arms For Europe;
But Efforts to Consolidate Run Into French Resistance

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Even as global pressures drive Europe to a tighter single market and a new single currency, similar pressures are forcing a consolidation of the weapons and aviation industries.
European leaders recognize that with the fall of Communism, their military needs are radically different. And the emergence of American giants like Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin creates a new competitive landscape. So these leaders envision the arms and aircraft industries from each nation uniting in a single, highly efficient, all-purpose conglomerate. 
 Progress toward this goal has been glacial, but it is still creating tremendous strains, especially in France. Aerospatiale, France's aerospace and arms group, is about to be transformed from a state company to a private one for the sole purpose of qualifying to join this Continent-wide behemoth, but Yves Michot, its chairman and chief executive, is not entirely happy with how the process is unfolding.
"If we want to merge together, we need to have each other's full confidence," he said. And Mr. Michot has not found that comfort level. Like many in France, he objected to the way foreign business leaders, notably those at British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, a unit of the German industrial giant DaimlerChrysler, had threatened to snub the French if they did not cooperate.
And even if Europe pulls off the creation of the conglomerate, tentatively known as the European Aerospace and Defense Company, some experts, fearing a monopoly that would stifle competition, wonder whether it should.
"I do not like a world in which you have three large United States integrated contractors -- Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed -- and one in Europe," said John M. Deutsch, a former United States Under Secretary of Defense. A single European contractor, he said, would "essentially not be competitive."
Far from fighting off antitrust regulators, though, Europe's military industries are getting encouragement from their governments. Competition is assured, the companies argue, given the huge American presence in the European arms and aviation market.
American companies have always done a booming military business in Europe. During the cold war, many European countries, particularly smaller nations like the Netherlands and Belgium, bought United States fighter aircraft and weapons systems. European industry leaders, including the French, deny they want anything like a Fortress Europe now.
American arms companies, of course, went through a similar, though less extreme, consolidation. European executives like to talk about the "Last Supper," a 1993 gathering at which Les Aspin, then the United States Defense Secretary, sketched out for industry leaders the Pentagon's view of the future, one in which a few contractors would divide a curtailed Pentagon budget.
Yet in Europe, the process has been reversed, with executives at British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler pushing their agenda on often reluctant governments.
Nowhere has that reluctance been more evident than in France. The prospect of marring the prestige of a French national industry, not to mention losing jobs, is creating a fierce conflict that pits French traditions against the harsh realities of a globalizing world.
But the process has most definitely begun. In November, Dassault Aviation Group announced that it would transfer the Government's stake, 46 percent, to Aerospatiale. The plan involving Dassault, a maker of Mirage and Rafale military jets and Falcon business jets, was announced in July, but it took months to get the approval of Serge Dassault, the company's 73-year-old chief executive and controlling shareholder.
This follows a decision in July by the Government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, after months of debate, to push the Government's stake in Aerospatiale below 50 percent and bring in the big weapons and publishing group Lagardere as the leading private shareholder.
By this week, after separate French-German and French-British Government consultations about recasting the military industry, Paris appeared to have dropped its fundamental insistence on a simultaneous three-way merger, clearing the path for a gradual two-by-two process, including some form of union between British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler, to be followed by a link with Aerospatiale and Lagardere's Matra military business.
Aerospatiale has excellent products and advanced technology, though past Government largess produced a company rich in technology but inefficient and unaccustomed to the notion of shareholder value. "Ten years ago, the Government told Aerospatiale not to make profits but to make products," said Philippe Gossard of Credit Lyonnais Securities in Paris. The numbers show that productivity has sagged. Last year, each of Aerospatiale's 37,000 employees generated $297,000 of revenue, against $326,000 for British Aerospace's 46,000 employees.
For France's partners at British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler, both owned by shareholders, getting government out of the business is an essential first step.
"Our demand is that future shareholders be of the same sort and share the same goals," said Wolfgang Piller, a strategy chief at DaimlerChrysler. Sir Richard Evans, chairman of British Aerospace, agrees. The group should feature a highly fragmented shareholder base, he said recently, adding that for the Germans and British, there should be no government ownership.
Industry leaders are also urging European governments to end centuries of fragmentation and form common military and security policies, including weapons procurement. "Combine your purchasing power," Mr. Piller said, "and you will have all the influence necessary."
Mr. Michot readily acknowledges that the changes at Aerospatiale must go forward. "It's not a problem of whether big is beautiful or small is beautiful," he said in an interview, "but projects are more and more sophisticated, and bigger and bigger companies are needed."
What he acknowledges less readily is that Aerospatiale needs reorganizing. It is, after all, no slouch. It has a 37.9 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, the efficient, profitable consortium that despite bitter competition from Boeing grabbed half the worldwide orders this year for commercial jets. The Ariane rocket program, a joint European undertaking in which Aerospatiale is the primary contractor, controls 50 percent of the market for satellite launchings, a business expected to be worth $60 billion over the next decade.
Yet some activities, like missiles, lose money, while others, like a stake in ATR, a maker of turboprop aircraft, face an uncertain future. Ariane itself may prove to be a white elephant, as smaller and cheaper satellite launchers enter the market.
Some experts even question whether Mr. Michot, 57, an aeronautical engineer with decades of experience as a Government adviser on weapons programs, is the man to do the reorganizing. Indeed, part of the reason for bringing in Lagardere was to tap the group's thick-skinned managers, like Philippe Camus, its 50-year-old chief executive. The challenges facing the merger appear not to have escaped Lagardere's investors, about 40 percent of whom are American and British investment funds: after the July announcement, the shares lost nearly half their value, though they have since recovered much of that.
Yet the French willingness to accept private solutions by bringing in Lagardere and Dassault shows their flexibility. And Mr. Michot says it can go further. Mr. Jospin's Government, he said, which originally insisted on a permanent Government minority stake in Aerospatiale, and hence in the new European arms company, is now pragmatic. "If I go back with a good idea, the consequence of which is a new decrease in the Government stake," he said, "they are ready to examine it."
Such French pragmatism, experts say, illustrates how even rigid political positions are yielding to the realities of international competition.
Meanwhile, discussion of a common European security policy is reviving, and the process is expected to accelerate when the euro, the European single currency, begins in January. Finance ministers from the 11 countries that will adopt the euro meet regularly to formulate common economic policies, and this month the 15 military ministers of the European Union began similar meetings.
"If we have common grounds for our prosperity," said Holger H. Mey, director of the Institute for Strategic Analyses in Bonn, "then shouldn't we have a common security policy?"
But if that is the long-term goal, what drives the current change is the onslaught of the American giants -- Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. In 1987, the United States had 22 percent of the $85 billion world arms market; by this year, the market had shrunk to $40 billion, but the United States share had climbed to 55 percent, though in dollar terms it had risen only from $19 billion, to $22 billion.
Late last year, Governments in France, Britain and Germany endorsed the idea for a unified company; the plan has since been supported by Spain, Italy and Sweden.
Yet some experts caution that seeking to merge the industries of three or even six countries at once will be almost impossible. Nor has the global economic slowdown made the task easier. This week, Boeing said the downturn in Asia would force it to trim production of commercial jets beginning next year and to cut as many as 20,000 more jobs in the next two years than it had earlier indicated.
Speaking recently to British industrialists, Sir Richard of British Aerospace checked off just some of the thornier choices facing such a company, including where production sites should be and where to put groupwide units, like finance and central management.
Moreover, as industries are merged, jobs will disappear. Deciding who remains will be particularly difficult, since Europe's unemployment rate remains at least double that of the United States.
"Where there are two partners, it is difficult, but just achievable," said John Dowdy of McKinsey & Company's military industry group in London. He described the American industry consolidation, with its two-by-two mergers, as the "Noah's Ark formation." But "when you add three or four or more, it becomes exponentially more difficult," he said.
John Weston, British Aerospace's chief executive, said the Pentagon's decision earlier this year to block Lockheed Martin's bid for Northrop Grumman might have signaled the start of an American search for trans-Atlantic partnerships.
Mr. Michot agreed, adding that Europe must be prepared for such alliances. Europe's goal, he said, is not to circle the wagons but "to create conditions in which we are on a level field with the United States."

As the emergence of Pentagon contracting giants like Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin creates a new competitive landscape, European leaders are planning to unite their the arms and aircraft industries into a single conglomerate. Here, based on the most recent data available, are the regions where European arms makers sell weapons.

AS EXPECTED, KELLOGG WILL CUT 765 JOBS IN NORTH AMERICA

 BODY:
In a widely expected move intended to help revive its ailing cereal business, the Kellogg Company said yesterday that it would dismiss 525 salaried employees from its North American operations and would eliminate 240 of about 600 contracted positions. Kellogg, the maker of Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, said it would take a one-time charge against fourth-quarter profits of $45 million, or 11 cents a share, to pay for the job cuts, which the company expects will reduce annual expenses by about $105 million. Those savings would help offset increased spending on product development and promotions. Kellogg said most of the jobs to be eliminated would come from its headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich. The company's stock fell 93.75 cents, to $36.375.

B. F. GOODRICH TO CLOSE 4 PLANTS, AFFECTING 775 WORKERS

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company, the leading maker of aerospace systems and specialty chemicals, said yesterday that it would close four plants and take a fourth-quarter charge against earnings of about $11 million before tax, or 9 cents a share. B. F. Goodrich said it expected to exceed analysts' earnings expectations of $3.04 a share for 1998, excluding the charge. The company said the plants employed a total of 775 workers. Goodrich, based in Richfield, Ohio, will shut down a composite bonding plant in Hagerstown, Md.; two assembly sites in Heber Springs and Sheridan, Ark., and an assembly-service site in Hamburg, Germany -- all part of B. F. Goodrich's Aerostructures Group. Goodrich's shares fell $2.9375 each, to $34.75.

Clemens Demands To Be Traded

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
When Roger Clemens was a free agent two years ago, he shunned two teams that had been, and would continue to be, legitimate contenders, the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. Now, after winning his fourth and unprecedented fifth Cy Young awards but no championships with the Toronto Blue Jays, Clemens wants to be traded to a contender.
The 36-year-old pitcher made that request yesterday through his agent, and the Blue Jays, adhering to a verbal commitment made two years ago, said they would comply. Gord Ash, the team's general manager, said he wanted to move as quickly as possible, in the next week to 10 days. 
 "I'd say I'm on a fast track with this," Ash said by telephone from Toronto. "There are so many other things going on with free agents and other deals, we need to have this clarified before we move on."
After speaking with Clemens's agent, Randy Hendricks, Ash wasted no time. He immediately contacted the Yankees, Cleveland, Texas and Houston, teams, he said, that had shown the strongest interest in the pitcher, dating to last July. He said he expected to talk to other teams as soon as the news spread.
Ash said that Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, told him that he would have to talk to George Steinbrenner and would get back to him.
"They were very interested at the trade deadline, so one could assume they still are," Ash said.
The Indians, Rangers and Astros, he added, all said they were very interested and would be in touch with him.
Cashman said the Yankees would discuss a possible offer for Clemens.
"You're always interested in a guy like Roger Clemens," Cashman said last night. "Whether it's a realistic and viable option is another story. We've had conversations about Rocket during the season and the early part of the winter, but they weren't sure what they were doing. We'll talk about it."
Now the Blue Jays know what they're doing. "We'll be looking for players who could help us at the major league level now," Ash said. "Prospects aren't going to work. We're going to need at least some pitching back, but I want to be open-minded about this. I don't want to predetermine what it will take. I want to see what the offers are."
Given that the Rangers, Astros and Indians have all been seeking pitching to bolster their staffs, the Yankees would seem to be in the best position to include a starting pitcher because they have six. But would the Blue Jays really trade Clemens to a team in their division?
"We've debated that," Ash said. "I don't see that as a roadblock. What we have to concentrate on is getting the best possible deal. If that presents itself from within the division, that would be unusual, but you have to do what you have to do both short and long term."
Clemens has two years left on the contract he signed in January 1997, after Paul Beeston, then the club's president, convinced him that the Blue Jays would be a contender. Clemens, whom the Boston Red Sox let leave as a free agent because they viewed him as an aging pitcher, accepted the Toronto offer because he felt the environment there would be best for his family.
Ash and his two assistants, Tim McCleary and Dave Stewart, visited Clemens at his home in the Houston area recently to discuss the Blue Jays' economic and competitive circumstances, and his decision stemmed from that discussion. "We laid out our game plan, why we think we're competitive," Ash related. "Dave laid out the San Diego situation, how they won without having a huge payroll."
The Blue Jays, owned by a Belgian brewery, Interbrew, had a $34 million payroll last season, and expect to reach the mid-40's for next season. Clemens has been outspoken about Toronto's refusal to offer a lucrative contract to Jose Canseco, who hit 46 home runs for the team last year.
"Roger is driven by the one thing he's not accomplished in this game, a ring," Ash said, referring to a World Series ring. "And if he can't get a ring, he wants to play close to home."
Clemens has an $8 million salary for next season and $8,125,000 for 2000, salaries that seem quite reasonable by current standards.
The right-hander had only a 40-39 record in his last four seasons with the Red Sox, but he has been the American League's best pitcher with the Blue Jays. He won his fifth Cy Young award this year after compiling a 20-6 record, producing the league's lowest earned run average, 2.65, and leading the league in strikeouts with 271, the third-highest total of his career. He won his last 15 decisions after losing on May 29.

HEADLINE: The Latin Arms Explosion That Fizzled

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Sixteen months ago, the Clinton Administration lifted a de facto ban on sales of the most advanced American weapons to countries in Latin America, and many feared the change would unleash a flood of fighter jets and other sophisticated weaponry into a region still haunted by rivalries and political instability.
But nothing happened. 
 The wave of arms sales that many predicted -- for better (more exports for American arms makers) or worse (a dangerous arms race) -- has not materialized. And with the economic slowdown that hit Asia last year still rippling around the world, there are few signs that any country in South or Central America will soon be able to afford the sophisticated weapons.
Chile, whose interest in buying as many as 24 F-16 fighter jets in large part prompted the Administration to reverse the prohibitions, has now put off its purchase indefinitely. Chile's Defense Minister, Jose Florencio Guzman, today placed the blame squarely on "the international financial crisis."
"Until that situation is clear, we are not going to be in a position to make a decision," Mr. Guzman said in an interview on the closing day of a conference of defense ministers from the Americas in this Caribbean city.
Only one other country, Ecuador, has even expressed an interest in purchases. But the State Department, which controls foreign sales of military equipment, made it clear late last year that Ecuador would not be considered until it resolved its border dispute with Peru. It did so this year, but since then neither Ecuador nor any other country has applied to the State Department and none are expected to do so soon, officials said.
In fact, in three days of meetings, cocktail parties and other functions at this week's conference, the issue was never seriously discussed, American officials said. Chile's thwarted plans did not even come up at a meeting today between Mr. Guzman and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen.
"It's not something on my agenda," Mr. Cohen said on the eve of the meetings.
Pentagon and Administration officials portray what has happened as a vindication of President Clinton's decision to lift the ban, which was imposed by President Carter in 1978 to deny modern weaponry to the military dictatorships that then held sway in most of the region.
Mr. Clinton reversed the policy at the urging of the Pentagon, which viewed arms sales as a way to shore up American manufacturers and help Latin American countries make their militaries more modern and professional. Officials argued that the reawakening democracies in Latin America had matured enough to be treated like other countries around the world by resolving their territorial disputes and establishing civilian control over their militaries.
"There was all this controversy" about the impact of the change, said Peter Romero, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who attended the conference. "It hasn't panned out. That has to do with a couple of things. One, there's peace in the region, and two, these militaries are looking at this in the long term, as part of their modernization plans."
Others, however, point to hard economic realities, which have depressed sales globally, especially for aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
Over the last year, a number of Latin American countries, including Brazil, have had to rethink plans to modernize their forces because of the economic crises. Chile has seen a debilitating drop in the price of copper, one of its leading sources of revenue.
"The fact that there's no major sale is as much a result of economics as a result of policy," said Richard F. Grimmett, an analyst for the Congressional Research Service who monitors the international arms trade. "Despite the window shopping that a lot of them do, they don't have the resources."
The executive order that President Carter signed in 1978 did not represent an absolute ban on sales of advanced weaponry but required the State Department to consider prospective sales with "a presumption of denial." Still, the United States granted approval for only one major sale during the whole time the restrictions were in effect: President Reagan let Venezuela buy two dozen F-16's in 1981, citing a threat from Communist Cuba.
As a region, Latin America spends less on the military than any other part of the world, and the market for high-tech sales has always been viewed as relatively modest, ranging from $500 million to $2 billion a year at most.
But arms manufacturers lobbied for the change in policy since several countries, including Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru, were in the market for weapons and, increasingly, looking to European makers.
Byron Callan, an aerospace analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said militaries in Latin America often face internal threats not easily attacked with supersonic fighters and air-to-air missiles.
In the years ahead, he said, these countries are more likely to want more mundane equipment, like trucks and transport helicopters, which were never covered by the ban.
"The most pressing problems they seem to have are internal rebel movements and drug traffickers," Mr. Callan said. "They may not necessarily need multirole combat aircraft."

HEADLINE: Remove Threat of Prosecuting the President

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire ("King of Chutzpah," column, Nov. 30) implies that the American people are in no mood to impeach the President because "the market is booming" but that in "two years hence, we could be in a recession, with people finding fault. A missile from a rogue nation could remind us who opposed a missile defense." 
 The American people are smart enough to recognize that there is such a thing as over-insurance, that a degree of protection against a missile attack has its price: economic ruin for the country.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI STIRS UP BORDER TENSIONS WITH TRASH PLAN

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN and DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani triumphantly unveiled a proposal yesterday to ship most of the city's residential garbage to transfer stations in New Jersey, but the administration's glee was quickly muted by an embarrassing lapse in political tact: It did not tell New Jersey of the plan until yesterday morning, and then only in sketchy detail.
At the same time that Mr. Giuliani was proudly discussing how his administration had possibly resolved one of the city's most vexing problems -- the future disposal of its millions of tons of trash -- New Jersey's Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, was issuing a news release that included the headline, "Whitman to New York's Garbage Plan: Drop Dead." 
 "The proposal being promoted by the City of New York is a direct assault on the beaches of New Jersey and a very real threat to our quality of life, especially to the residents of Hudson, Union, Essex and Middlesex Counties," Mrs. Whitman said. She added that she would do everything in her power to block any plan that might harm the state's environment.
The stakes are high for New York City, which must find an alternative to dumping its trash at the largest landfill in the world, Fresh Kills on Staten Island. But Fresh Kills is scheduled to close by the end of 2001, and Mayor Giuliani expressed fears that Federal environmental authorities could shut it down at any time, creating an immediate crisis.
Under the city's plan, it would send nearly 5,900 tons a day of Manhattan and Queens garbage to transfer stations to be built by private contractors in Newark and Carteret, N.J. In addition, a transfer station would be built at the Port of Red Hook in Brooklyn to handle that borough's 3,900 tons of daily trash. Then, after being compacted in air-tight containers at these transfer stations, the garbage would be shipped to privately owned landfills in Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states.
"This plan is a very fair one and a very equitable one," the Mayor said. But by last night, other New Jersey officials had joined the "drop dead" chorus, placing his Deputy Mayor for Operations, Joseph J. Lhota, in the position of defending the plan as environmentally sound but apologizing for its delivery. Mr. Lhota had informed an aide to Mrs. Whitman of the city's plans just hours before the Mayor's announcement.
"It is our fault, and not Governor Whitman's, that she did not understand New York City's environmentally sound plan for long-term solid waste management," Mr. Lhota said in a statement. "The Governor and her staff were not adequately briefed in a complete manner."
In a brief interview last night, Mr. Lhota said he felt contrition. "No one likes to be surprised, and in this case, the Governor was surprised," he said. "It's my job to make the Governor fully apprised."
The sensitivity of the matter goes beyond the traditional rivalry between New York and New Jersey. Though both are moderate Republicans, Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Whitman have quarreled in the past over several issues, from the rights to Ellis Island to the management of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. And recent history made the city's plan sting all the more; the complaints of Mrs. Whitman in early 1997 forced Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki to postpone a city plan to dump 560 million gallons of raw sewage into New York Harbor.
At his news conference, Mr. Giuliani and his aides had engaged in a little New Jersey humor while detailing where the city's garbage would go. "Does any go to the Meadowlands?" the Mayor joked. When told no, he said: "Too bad. Well, we ought to get even, right? I mean for the Giants and the Jets." The two professional football teams left New York to play in the Meadowlands in New Jersey years ago.
The New Jersey jokes had ended by evening as state, county and local officials in New Jersey criticized the plan. "We will not be the dumping ground for any entity," Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said, "especially since their plans call for bringing this solid waste to a site that is near an area that is undergoing extensive revitalization."
Mrs. Whitman and her aides said their principal worry was that garbage might spill from the city barges on the way to the stations in New Jersey, causing pollution of her state's beaches. She characterized the garbage shipping as "an environmental disaster waiting to happen."
Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that he expected the plan to meet opposition; foes will have forums in numerous environmental and land-use reviews in both states, as well as before the City Council, whose approval is needed for the city's overall waste management plan. But the Mayor emphasized that he intended to meet the legal deadline for the closing of Fresh Kills, a deadline stipulated by the state in 1996.
Mr. Lhota said he hoped the proposed New Jersey stations would come to be seen as an economic blessing, particularly considering that a large incinerator in Essex County was underused and could handle some of the trash intended for Newark under the plan. "It's our hope the Governor would look at this as an economic development project," he said. "We're not dumping garbage in New Jersey."
Jim Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said it would be "inexcusable" for any garbage to fall from the barges. But he said New Jersey must regard waste policy as a common interest of the entire region and remember that New Yorkers live with air and water pollution emanating from that state.
But if yesterday's proposals do not work out, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lhota said, other proposals would be reconsidered, including one to use a Bay Ridge pier that sparked fierce opposition from that Brooklyn neighborhood. "There are numerous backup plans, but this is the one we're proposing today," the Mayor said. "There are other places that are interested in getting our trash."
The other part of the city's two-pronged strategy for dealing with the shutdown of Fresh Kills is to truck garbage out of the city in ever greater amounts until none is going to Staten Island. City officials hope that this interim approach will end in late 2001 or early 2002, the earliest they expect to get their long-term plan working.
Under the city's long-term plans, its fleet of 900 white sanitation trucks would still deliver their garbage to seven marine transfer stations surrounding the city, where it would be put in the same barges that now go to Fresh Kills. But instead of going to Fresh Kills, the barges would take the garbage to the private transfer stations announced yesterday.
The one in Carteret would take 3,900 tons of garbage a day from Queens and the East Side of Manhattan to a station to be built by Browning Ferris Industries on land it has acquired. The waste would be put in containers and exported from Carteret by rail and truck to permitted disposal sites in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois. Manhattan's remaining 2,000 tons of waste a day would go to a giant transfer station to be built by Eastern Environmental in Newark on land owned by the Port Authority. It would then be shipped by truck and rail to disposal sites in Virginia and New Jersey.
It was unclear last night what steps Governor Whitman might take to oppose the trash sites, including whether she could block the planned Newark station under her powers over the Port Authority. She did say that she would "do everything I can to assure that no permits are granted for facilities" that would imperil New Jersey's environment.
Some initial reaction from New York officials was positive. Stanley E. Michels, chairman of the Council's Environmental Protection Committee, said: "I think it makes a lot of sense. This seems a feasible plan"

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The decision last year by the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury to push Asian nations to send their interest rates soaring was a crucial blunder that worsened the world financial crisis, the World Bank concluded today in its first history of how the trouble started.
A 200-page report by the bank deliberately omitted any direct reference to the fund or to the Treasury, which has a major voice in fund decisions. The omission, bank officials said, was a conciliatory gesture to both institutions, which have often disagreed with the bank on how to repair the crisis since it began 18 months ago. 
 The bank's blow-by-blow account of a series of cascading misjudgments places much of the blame on global investors who lent money to developing nations with abandon, and on Asian officials who were eager to absorb the cash.
But the study left little doubt that in the bank's judgment the fund and the Clinton Administration shared responsibility for mishandling the initial response to the crisis. The higher interest rates were among many conditions set to permit the countries to get billions of dollars of aid from the I.M.F.
The bank argues that it would have been less harmful to let the currencies fall but keep interest rates low in an effort to revive the economies as quickly as possible. But that choice would have created other difficulties, worsening inflation and perhaps discouraging foreign investors from returning to those markets for years, other economists argue.
The primary responsibility of the World Bank is tending to the poor, with development programs to help them fight poverty and disease. The fund focuses chiefly on economic and monetary policy.
The report predicts that most of the countries involved will probably begin climbing out of their recessions next year, with growth continuing in 2000. But it warns that a rebound is not certain and that "there is still a substantial risk that the world economy will plunge into recession in 1999," particularly if Japan is unable to end its recession.
The report reflects a broader debate among economists and policymakers about whether decisions by the fund and the United States Treasury deepened the crisis and whether the movement in recent years to liberalize financial markets around the world should be dramatically slowed.
It argues that some system should be developed to limit the rush of short-term investments into developing countries that do not have the systems to monitor spending.
"The heart of this current crisis," the chief economist of the bank, Joseph Stiglitz, said today, "is the surge of capital flows. The surge is followed by a precipitous flow out. Few countries, no matter how strong their financial institutions, could have withstood such a turnaround. But clearly the fact that the financial institutions were weak and their firms highly leveraged made these countries particularly vulnerable."
Neither the I.M.F. nor the Treasury, both of which saw the report before it was published, issued comment. There are parts that the agencies agree with. Officials of the fund and the Treasury have often faulted the huge volume of private investment into developing countries, as well as investors' refusal to heed the risks associated with investing in countries with few regulatory safeguards, for creating the conditions that led to the bust. And the officials say no one foresaw the extent of the crisis.
But they continue to defend their initial strategy of urging Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to raise interest rates, a classic economic solution intended to reassure investors and stabilize currencies. In Thailand and South Korea, interest rates have declined, to about 7 percent, and the currencies have stabilized, developments that fund officials say vindicate their approach.
The bank report argues that the strategy backfired, stabilizing the currencies at the cost of plunging the countries into deep recessions, with substantial unemployment.
The higher interest rate, the study says, spread the economic pain far beyond the banks, investment funds and real estate companies that got the countries into trouble to begin with, sending thousands of small businesses in to bankruptcy.
"Some estimates are that levels of bankruptcy in Indonesia now are 75 percent," Mr. Stiglitz said. "And, you know, you cannot have a country perform with 75 percent of its firms in bankruptcy."
The report was published on the day when the board of the fund formally began its review of the latest bailout, a $41.5 billion aid package to Brazil. It agreed to provide the first installment of an $18.1 billion, three-year loan.
Although the World Bank is a major participant in that bailout, it warned today against the risk of what it termed "rescue creep" as aid packages grow larger and larger. "No reasonable amount of public money can stop a justified speculative attack" on a currency, the World Bank said. "Larger packages worsen moral hazard problems," the risk that investors will expect governments to bail them out, "and may lead to excessively tough conditions, defeating the end objectives."
Their differing mandates have often led the World Bank and the I.M.F. to disagreements. Two months ago Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned both institutions that the time had come to put aside their differences. One of the many proposals here Washington to reform the institutions would merge their governing boards, but that would require a marriage of two extremely different cultures.
The fund continues to insist that it made the best judgments it could at a time of tremendous chaos last year, when the Governments of Thailand and South Korea were going through elections and seemed unable to make decisions.
The fund also argues that its program in Indonesia was undermined by the refusal of President Suharto's Government to stick to its economic agreements and then by the chaos that resulted in Mr. Suharto's resignation and continues on the streets.
Yet, at a seminar this week, a senior fund official conceded that the fund had made some judgments "too quickly" and had mistakenly thought that it was seeing a repeat of past currency crises, particularly the one that Mexico had in 1995.
Internally the fund has debated over the last year whether it erred when it loaned Russia $4.8 billion in July, money that was wasted, and whether it unintentionally contributed to a bank panic in Indonesia last year.
Several months ago the first deputy managing director of the fund, Stanley Fischer, said, "In most cases governments call us in only after they discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things they needed to do long ago."
"If the problems were easy to solve," Mr. Fischer said, "they'd do it themselves."
Many of the conclusions in the report are likely to fuel the debate over what to do next. The bank calls for a major slowdown in the movement to deregulate financial markets in developing countries, a reversal of the policy that the fund advocated as late as April 1997, three months before the troubles in Thailand touched off the crisis.
"Financial-sector liberalization," the report adds, "which can significantly boost the risk of crisis, should proceed with care -- fully and in step with the capacity to design and enforce tighter regulation and supervision."
In the last year the fund and the Treasury have begun to take the same stance, stressing the need to build regulatory institutions before opening economies to huge capital flows. The bank praised fund programs in several countries, including their focus on reorganizing corporations and compelling countries, in return for aid, to overhaul bankruptcy systems and inject public money into weak banking systems.
The bank also credited the I.M.F. for loosening the conditions on the bailouts to ease the pain on the poor. But it noted that 17 million more Indonesians are expected to fall below that country's poverty line.

A World Bank report shows private investment into developing countries with risky markets contributed to the recent global economic crisis. But this year, long-term investment is dropping slightly, while short-term investment is falling sharply. The graph shows the net private investment in developing countries from 1990-1998:

HEADLINE: Grim Assessment by U.N. of Asia Crisis

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The social costs of the Asian economic crisis are far higher than initial estimates and are "dramatically worsening," according to a report here on Tuesday by the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency.
The I.L.O. said the economic collapse had resulted in a combustible mixture of soaring unemployment, spreading poverty and dashed expectations. The lack of social welfare programs made the hardest-hit countries, like Indonesia, "fertile ground for breeding social unrest." 
 "I would veer to the pessimistic side," said Eddy Lee, an I.L.O. economist, who wrote the report. "The unrest in Indonesia is spilling over into Malaysia. And even where you don't have street riots, there is a tremendous amount of social instability just beneath the surface."
Indonesia has seen violent clashes between soldiers and students and between Christians and Muslims. In Malaysia demonstrators are protesting against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for ousting and imprisoning his Deputy Prime Minister.
The report called on governments to increase spending on social programs, particularly unemployment insurance, which is largely unknown in Asia. It likened the current crisis to the Great Depression of the 1930's, which galvanized the United States to weave a social safety net.
"The question we asked was, 'What could people in these countries expect?' " Mr. Lee said. "The answer was, 'Very little.' "
In its bleak tone, the report is starkly at odds with both Asia's resurgent financial markets and other international agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have focused on the prospects for a rebound.
Mr. Lee said a swift recovery is unlikely, given the deeper than expected recessions in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea. In Indonesia, the report estimates, economic output will decline 15 percent in 1998, while in Thailand and South Korea it will shrink by 6.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
Along with the abrupt loss of commercial activity has come rapidly accelerating unemployment. The report estimates that the crisis has wiped out one-fifth of non-farm jobs in Indonesia this year, a loss that will drive 40 million people, or 20 percent of the population, into poverty.
In Thailand, the report predicts, the unemployment rate will triple, to 6 percent, this year. Even in South Korea, which is perceived as being on the road to recovery, unemployment is expected to jump to 8.2 percent, from 2.3 percent, while 12 percent of Koreans will sink under the poverty line.
"What the crisis has driven home is the consequence of not having stronger social policies," Mr. Lee said.
He noted that of these countries, only South Korea offers even rudimentary unemployment benefits.
Mr. Lee conceded that financially strapped Asian governments did not have the resources to subsidize unemployment insurance on a mass scale. But he said such benefits could be financed with a payroll tax.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show. 

Museums
 
 * "DANCING AT THE LOUVRE: FAITH RINGGOLD'S FRENCH COLLECTION AND OTHER STORY QUILTS," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 3). Faith Ringgold's story quilts are an enchanting blend of fictional tales and paintings, done on stitched canvas bordered by patchwork and, except for recent ones, written narrative. Works from her French Collection depict the fantastical adventures of a young black woman who was an artist in Paris in the 1920's; works from her American Collection deal in a visionary way with the lives of blacks in America. Also on view are earlier quilts, like "Tar Beach" (1988), which portrays a homey nighttime family picnic on a Harlem roof, with a daughter of the family flying over the George Washington Bridge in the background. A vivid sense of history, an audacious imagination and an irrepressible joie de vivre find voice in this lively show. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3 for artists, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
 * "FROM VAN EYCK TO BRUEGEL: EARLY NETHERLANDISH PAINTINGS AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 17). A patch of heaven has touched down in Manhattan. This dream of a show is exactly what it says it is: a display of more than a hundred 15th- and 16th-century Flemish paintings representing the bulk of the Met's impressive holdings. Long-hidden pieces have been pulled from storage, and familiar works have been brought together from throughout the museum. And the big news is also old news: the unrivaled genius of the Netherlandish artists and the inventive vitality of a culture that saw the natural and the supernatural worlds as mirror images. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Admission: $8; $4, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 * "HEROIC ARMOR OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE: FILIPPO NEGROLI AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 17). Negroli (1510-1579) may not be a household name today, but as the most innovative and celebrated Italian armor maker of his era, he was sought after by aristocrats with a yen for the magnificent suits of steel he fabricated. In this, the first large-scale arms and armor exhibition ever held at the Met, the work of Negroli, members of his sprawling family and fellow armorers in Italy makes a dazzling display. These intricately worked helmets, cuirasses, shields and other showpieces were intended more for parade than battle use. Among the knockout regalia here is an armored equestrian mounted on an armored horse, the only surviving example of Roman-style armor for man and beast. It's a visual feast. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).
 
 * "INSIDE OUT: NEW CHINESE ART," Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Jan. 3). Art in China has changed dramatically in the last few decades, and this big, stimulating show gives a sense of vanguard developments on the post-Mao mainland and in Hong Kong and Taiwan and among expatriate Chinese artists in the West. The work ranges from video to Western-inspired Pop painting, from spectacular, room-filling installations to ink scrolls. The messages are complex and contradictory: myth, humor, pessimism and nostalgia rub shoulders, often in a single work. There are ups and downs in this tip-of-the-iceberg showcase, but it's a benchmark event. Asia Society: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays to 8 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. P.S. 1: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $4 to Asia Society, $5 to P.S. 1; $2, students and the elderly, at both (Cotter).
 
 * ROBERT IRWIN: "PART 2: EXCURSUS: HOMAGE TO THE SQUARE 3 ," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 13). The magic of this maze of 18 cubicles, made by dividing Dia's third-floor gallery, lies in its intense distillation of light, color and space. The walls of each room are translucent scrim; each wall bears a double fluorescent bulb whose color is enhanced by white and silvery tones. The bulbs change color from room to room, subtly modulating your perception of the space; at the north and south sides of the building they are augmented by natural light coming in through windows. As you walk through this eloquent labyrinth, which seems to have no end and no beginning, the light shifts and slips from bright, almost full-day illumination to a lovely quiet gloom. Despite Mr. Irwin's declared disinterest in making art as imagery, the installation can't help evoking such environments as a chapel, a Quaker meeting house and a noir film set. However you see it, it's an affecting experience. Hours: Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 * "JAPONISM AND FASHION: JAPAN DRESSES THE WEST," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1000 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 14). This beautiful show is the first to isolate the influence of Japanese culture on European and American fashion. As with most shows devoted to Japonism, it has the feeling of a love affair, of one culture becoming infatuated with, seduced by and then profoundly altered by another. It includes lavish 19th-century evening gowns made in Paris and London from the densely embroidered silks of Japanese kimonos; quilted silk dressing gowns made in Japan for export, and a fascinating range of pieces by 20th-century designers. These run from Madeleine Vionnet, whose influential garments made innovative use of the simple structure of Japanese garments, to Japanese designers like Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo, whose fusion of Eastern and Western clothing conventions took international fashion by storm in the early 1980's. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. (until 11 P.M. on the first Saturday of the month); Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $4; $2, students; $1.50, the elderly; free, children under 12 (Roberta Smith).
 
 SHIRIN NESHAT, "Turbulence," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue at 42d Street, (917) 663-2550 (through Jan. 15). For this installation by the Iranian-born Shirin Neshat, two short films are projected on opposite walls. In one a man sings a Sufi devotional hymn for an all-male audience; in the other a veiled woman sings a passionate wordless chant in an empty hall as the camera circles her. The installation refers to the fact that women in Iran, because of Islamic law, are forbidden to perform music in public. But it is really about a wealth of male-female contrasts, suggested through body language, setting, camera work and the music, which is thrilling. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays to 7:30 P.M. Free (Cotter).
 
 * JACKSON POLLOCK, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Feb. 2). A landmark. If you care about art, you live for exhibitions like this, in which an artist, against the heavy odds of his skewed talent and unhinged personality, pursued something so wild, untested and mysterious that its full meaning was unclear even to him, yet who, briefly, wrung from his peculiar system of painting one variation after another. Pollock was a quintessential American because of his aspiration to make something from what seemed like nothing. Sometimes he botched the results, but this was intrinsic to a process that consciously flirted with incoherence: accidents, on which his art depended, had to be held in tension with acts of extreme control, and the exhibition is instructive, among other reasons, for letting you see some of his failures, which by contrast clarify his successes. His biggest triumphs, the classic paintings from 1950, "Autumn Rhythm," "No. 32" and "One," are hung together here so that you can scan them by swiveling your head 180 degrees. It's an amazing sight. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission; $12.50; $9.50 students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
 * "RENDEZVOUS: MASTERPIECES FROM THE CENTRE GEORGES POMPIDOU AND THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUMS," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 24). With its landmark Paris home under renovation, the cream of the Pompidou collection has hit the road, joining forces with the Guggenheim's in an unusual, perhaps unprecedented exhibition that fills the Fifth Avenue building to the brim. The familiar story of modernism is told, but in contrasting voices and with a cornucopia of unfamiliar works and telling juxtapositions. Not to be missed. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * "ROYAL PERSIAN PAINTINGS: THE QAJAR EPOCH, 1785-1925," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 24). Think "Persian painting" and what comes to mind? Small illuminated miniatures with diminutive landscapes and teensy figures. But the Qajar emperors thought big. They liked their portraits life-size, their battle scenes Cinemascopic. Even their collectibles -- lacquered boxes, gilded enamels -- have a trumpeting, clear-the-way flair, like props in a Handel opera. This extraordinary show is the first major Western survey of a self-promotional dynastic art of almost hallucinatory strangeness and brilliance. It holds many surprises, none more mesmerizing than the power portraits of the ruler Fath Ali Shah: with his dainty, high-heeled slippers, extravagant beard and Napoleonic hauteur, he projects a preposterous, inimitable glamour. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 * "SACRED ARTS OF HAITIAN VODOU," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through Jan. 3). The 500 objects in this exhibition -- shimmering, sequined flags, plaster Madonnas, medicine packets wrapped like Christmas gifts, miniature coffins, carved wooden drums -- weave African, European and indigenous New World influences together in an art of visceral excitement and disquieting beauty. The installation is expertly organized. It begins with paintings depicting the growth of Vodou among African slaves in the Caribbean. (The show avoids the Anglicized voodoo, with its history of racist associations, in favor of the Creole Vodou.) And it concludes with three big, glamorous, assemblage-style altars that catch the essence of what this religion is: a magnificent, spiritual tour de force. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8:45 P.M. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly; $4.50, children (Cotter).
 
 * "SACRED VISIONS: EARLY PAINTINGS FROM CENTRAL TIBET," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 17). Bringing together well-known and little-seen masterpieces, many newly cleaned, this stunning exhibition of 60 thankas, or paintings on cloth, is the first attempt to trace the blossoming of one of the world's great medieval painting styles as it emerged between 1150 and 1450 in central Tibet. Images of beatific Buddhas and extravagantly wrathful deities abound, as do portraits of monks and abbots, most of them accompanied by extensive entourages of smaller figures and set in elaborate architectural compositions. With its smoldering colors, exquisite rendering and religious fervor, this exhibition lies at the center of the museum like the molten core of a blast furnace and is one of the must-see events of the season. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 BOB THOMPSON, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 3). This radiant exhibition of 100 works from 1959 to 1966 traces the brief headlong career of Thompson (1937-1966), a black American artist and one of the rising stars of the early 1960's. He lived hard and died young, and was also tremendously productive. Trips to Europe fired his enthusiasm for the Old Masters, whose religious and mythological themes and compositions he modernized with flat, bright color. These reds, blues and yellows also functioned metaphorically, implying a multiracial world alternately pastoral and violent in mood. Thompson died too early to achieve greatness, and as the middle of the exhibition demonstrates, his paintings could be simultaneously formulaic and hesitant. But there are several remarkable works here, especially his small paintings and studies. And the biggest painting, "Garden of Music" (1960), may be his masterpiece. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $9; $7, students and the elderly (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
 * ARSHILE GORKY, "Paintings and Drawings 1929-1942," Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Jan. 9). This small, museum-quality show makes an excellent companion to the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Here we see Gorky still working mostly in Picasso's shadow but beginning to discover -- in "Garden in Sochi," for example, a delicate, surrealistic mindscape from 1942 -- the gravitationally liberated space and elegant line that characterize his great works of the mid-1940's (Ken Johnson).
 
 * HENRI MATISSE, C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through Dec. 12). Celebrated as one of the 20th century's greatest painters, Matisse (1869-1954) also produced some daringly innovative sculpture. Breaking with centuries of European tradition, he viewed sculpture not in pictorial terms but as self-referential, i.e., it should not express anything but its substance, existing as a process rather than a representation. Paring down heads to their essence, shaping bodies by means of rhythmic forms, incorporating stylized elements of African art, he freed his work from the traditional European emphasis on anatomical credibility, exerting a crucial influence on 20th-century sculpture (Glueck).
 
 * SIGMAR POLKE, "New Paintings, Printing Mistakes," Michael Werner Gallery, 21 East 67th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through Jan. 16). This German painter is a major artist who has never really taken off in the United States. He's an antimastery master who produces a post-epiphany, post-ego painting, an impure hybrid that mixes ideas and formal ploys like so many chemical additives. His works preserve a tradition, and they also turn it into something else. That something else can be sampled in this show of two dozen strange, beautiful, sort-of-abstract new paintings based partly on newspaper misprints (Cotter).
 
 * ED RUSCHA, Richard Gray, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 472-8787 (through Dec. 12). No one confounded the verbal and the visual with more economically inventive wit during the 1960's and 70's than Ed Ruscha. This show gives a good account of that period. "Eye Infection" (1967) is spelled out in illusionistic ribbon; the medium is gunpowder. In "Faith" (1972), modernistic letters are cut in white out of a dark red, Rothko-esque space, setting up an understated collision between Romanticism and irony (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
 ROSS BLECKNER, Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929 (through Dec. 19). The uptown segment of a two-gallery exhibition shows the artist continuing to cultivate a dazzling new painting technique that is responsible for the relatively impressive paintings in the show's downtown half in SoHo. Here, he seems to have shifted into overproduction, adding pleasing color and a surface slickness that pushes the abstract toward the Photo Realist (Smith).
 
 JAMES DE LA VEGA, Caribbean Cultural Center, 408 West 58th Street, (212) 307-7420 (through Dec. 23). For his first New York solo, this young artist has brought indoors the tape drawing technique (figures outlined in strips of masking tape and spray painted) that he executes on the streets of East Harlem, and they look good. St. Lazarus leaps from one wall; a Last Supper of chattering skeletons fills another. More of Mr. de la Vega's work can be seen outdoors in the neighborhood around East 103d Street and Lexington Avenue (Cotter)
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
 ROSS BLECKNER, Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene Street, (212) 965-0753 (through Dec. 19). The downtown segment of a two-gallery exhibition includes big, beautiful grisaille abstractions whose strikingly optical cell-like patterns (a result of careful use of an airbrush) count as some of the most convincing images Mr. Bleckner has made. The artist's political conscience has been relegated to a series of high-minded photo appropriations that seem about 20 years too late (Smith).
 
 * "WILLEM DE KOONING: DRAWING SEEING/SEEING DRAWING," the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166; "Willem de Kooning: Drawings and Sculpture," Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, and Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 744-7400 (all through Dec. 19). These three shows don't pretend to add up to a survey of de Kooning's drawings, but they have fine stuff and lots of it: high-spirited warm-ups for paintings, ultra-refined finished pieces, all manner of glorious doodles. The Drawing Center show is thematically the most coherent and includes a series of fascinating Crucifixions. The other shows highlight links between drawings and sculptures, of which several are on view. It's great to have all this coincide with the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (Cotter).
 
 KIM DINGLE, Sperone Westwater, 142 Greene Street, (212) 431-6835 (through Dec. 19). This Los Angeles artist, known for paintings and sculptures featuring malevolent schoolgirls and toddlers called Prisses, is making her subjects behave themselves, and the shift from truly nasty to just naughty indicates that her work is formally pallid and unadventurous. Best is an installation in which two Prisses break through a plaster wall like Supergirl-cherub, but even that wouldn't be out of place in a Christmas store window on Fifth Avenue (Smith).
 
 JACKIE FERRARA, "Red Arches," Frederieke Taylor/TZ'Art Gallery, 470 Broome Street, (212) 966-9059 (through Dec. 24). Known for her site sculptures and large public commissions, Ms. Ferrara uses an austere vocabulary of Minimalist forms to build architectural structures. They can be useful or purely sculptural, but are in any case admirable for their subtle geometries. For this show she has redone the gallery's walls in a design of large, repetitive arches, made entirely of flat segments of birch plywood and rounded off at the top by stepping back the plywood segments in ziggurat fashion. Arches and wall are of one flatness, but the arches also stand out by virtue of their pinkish staining against the walls' lighter tones. Like the walls of a Moorish harem, they bestow a soft, sensuous effect on the entire space (Glueck).
 
 * KAHN/SELESNICK, "The Circular River: Panoramic Photographs, Siberian Expeditions, 1944-1946," Monique Knowlton, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-2625 (through Jan. 9). Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick produce elaborately staged, faux antique photographs. Each of the 59 pictures from their most recent project is a sepia-toned, six-foot-long panoramic print that purports to document an expedition to Siberia undertaken in the mid-1940's. Together with its lengthy journalistic text, it's a funny, Monty Python-esque parody of the generic scientific adventure narrative (Johnson).
 
 "MOUSE: AN AMERICAN ICON," Alternative Museum, 594 Broadway, at Houston Street, (212) 966-4444 (through Dec. 19). This selection of works by 24 artists, every one featuring a more or less politicized image of Mickey Mouse, has a few good things in it. In Luis Camnitzer's "Reality Check," a real stuffed mouse has been absurdly equipped with round Mickey ears; John Fawcett's drawn and collaged mixes of pop culture and hallucinogenic Mickeys are dizzyingly complicated; Jaune Quick-to-See Smith's "McFlag," which sports big, round, earlike speakers at each upper corner, is a strident takeoff on Jasper Johns's iconic "Flag" (Johnson).
 
 "PSYCHOARCHITECTURE," Richard Prince and Martin Kippenberger, Anton Kern Gallery, 558 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 965-1706 (through Dec. 19). Kippenberger, a German jack-of-all-media artist who died in 1997, favored found materials; Mr. Prince, an American appropriationist fascinated by this country's obsessions, preferred the pre-existing image. This oddly personal display of their photographs reveals a shared interest in what might be called the architectural unconscious, the frayed edges where modernity's failed dream is especially visible. Mr. Kippenberger tended toward details of decaying concrete buildings that resemble his sculpture; Mr. Prince, toward upstate yards and driveways populated only by forlorn basketball hoops and infused with the desolation and dysfunction so familiar to his art (Smith).
 
 SAM REVELES, CRG, 93 Grand Street, (212) 966-4360 (through Dec. 19). Paintings in which Old Masterism and new abstraction are dissonantly layered. Mr. Reveles begins each work with a pale, unfinished pastiche of Italian Primitive, Renaissance or Indian painting, over which he paints dense, scribbly passages that almost completely obliterate the underlying imagery. At this point, the relationship between the two modes seems more frustrated than fruitful (Johnson).
 
 ALAN UGLOW, Stark Gallery, 113 Crosby Street, (212) 925-4484 (through Dec. 19). A painter of seemingly purist abstractions flirts curiously with content. Mr. Uglow's pristine stripe paintings evoke tennis courts or soccer fields, an association he affirms by installing a neat little shed and bench for soccer players, complete with soccer commentary broadcast by hidden speakers. There are also photographs of soccer fields and stadiums. It all leaves one confused about what the paintings are supposed to mean (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
 WILLIAM COTTON, Silverstein, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 929-4300 (through Dec. 23). Paintings of low-income dwellings -- trailers, high-rise projects, worker housing and the Unabomber's cabin in Montana -- made to look as though they were constructed of candy, gingerbread, cookies and frosting. The tension between grim reality and confectionery fantasy is interesting, but the nondescript way the pictures are painted undermines the impact (Johnson).
 
 MONIQUE PRIETO, Pat Hearn Gallery, 530 West 22d Street, (212) 727-7366 (through Dec. 23). Working with a computer, Ms. Prieto generates shapes of blobby, biomorphic contour, then paints them flatly in bright, toylike colors on fields of raw canvas without any hint of shading or perspective. Her antecedents seem to be Pop; the work has suggestions of the commercial bustle of elements in Pop Art, and the bam-splat bursts in cartoon imagery. They are smart and knowing, if not particularly consequential (Glueck).
 
Other Galleries
 
 GREGORY CRANE, Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, lower Manhattan, (212) 925-9424 (through Dec. 31). At his best, in magically real, panoramic views of semirural Hudson Valley landscapes, Mr. Crane creates the feeling of seeing the world through the eyes of someone -- an Emerson or a Thoreau -- in a transcendentally (or psychedelically) elevated consciousness. Color and paint are lush; smoke plumes, rainbows and odd clouds animate the sky and a visionary light transforms mundane reality (Johnson).
 
 CHARLEY FRIEDMAN, CRP, 100 Water Street, near the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 858-1373 (through Dec. 14). Funny conceptualism by a 30-year-old Brooklyn artist. In a large photographic self-portrait, Mr. Friedman appears unshaven with black-rimmed glasses and a cigarette wedged between his lips in deadpan imitation of Chuck Close's canonical self-portrait. In a video, the artist abuses a guitar and violently eats a grapefruit, peel and all, to the driving beat of Led Zeppelin (Johnson).
 
 "JUST RIPE," Smack Mellon Studios, 81 Washington Street, near the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-8761 (through Dec. 20). A lively, uneven show of young artists considered "just ripe" for a major show by its curator, Joan Snyder. Among the better works on display in a sprawling, raw space are sleek, photographic pictures within pictures by Sophia Petrides; small, painterly pictures of flying airliners by Andrea Legge and grotesque, free-standing dresses by Martha Posner. In the basement there's a scary, black-light-illuminated installation collaboratively produced by Kate Dodd, Andrea Reynosa, Kevin Vertrees and David Baskin (Johnson).
 
 JANNIS KOUNELLIS, Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, near Spring Street, West Village, (212) 255-5599 (through Dec. 24). New, huge-scale work by the Italian Arte Povera master. Live starlings flutter in cages hung by meat hooks in front of massive steel plates; antique wooden armoires dangle absurdly by thick ropes from overhead I-beams. His work is grandiose, but Mr. Kounellis's poetic imagination can be charmingly capricious (Johnson).
 
 FRED SANDBACK, Lawrence Markey, 55 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 627-4446 (through Dec. 19). This slight show of new work features one extremely minimal piece in this artist's signature material: a single length of cardinal-red yarn stretched from a point high on the wall to a point on the floor about five inches out from the wall; the line leans slightly to the left. Less audaciously radical are three small wooden panels incised with saw cuts (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
 FERNANDO BOTERO, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through tomorrow). Large-scale drawings by the South American artist famous for making people and things chubby. You'd think Mr. Botero's shtick would be worn out by now, but his fattening transformations are still hard to resist: funny, sexy and oddly faithful to reality. These drawings in charcoal, red chalk or watercolor on canvas are as big as paintings but have a charming, unforced immediacy (Johnson).
 
 SUSAN CRILE, James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through tomorrow). After a series of combustive paintings of the Desert Storm-related fires in Kuwait, Ms. Crile has turned to the historic architecture of Verona, Italy. Her new canvases, the most interesting of which are long and narrow, present fragmentary views of floors, columns and windows, including areas of elaborate decorative patterning, all rendered with a thin, brushy touch and in a muted, predominantly orange-and-blue palette (Johnson).
 
 * "DAYS OF DISCIPLINE AND GRACE: TREASURES FROM THE IMPERIAL BUDDHIST CONVENTS OF KYOTO," C. V. Starr East Asian Library, Columbia University, Broadway and 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7403 (through today). Many of the objects in this tiny exhibition, tucked away deep in the library's stacks, are pocket-size or fold-upable. Most date from the 17th century, though some are quite new. Several were made for pleasure, not spiritual profit: parlor games, for example, outnumber religious icons. Together they capture the subtly exalted ordinariness of convent life and the creative spirit of the aristocratic women who chose to live it (Cotter).

For Highway Hostility, A Thin Line of Defense

BYLINE: By LESLEY HAZLETON 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
THE Toyota Camry zoomed up behind us on Interstate 5, hung hard on our tail as though we were in a Nascar race, swerved suddenly to pass on the inside, then cut sharply back into our lane. Orest Wilson, a Washington State trooper, braked hard to avoid a collision. It was a good way to catch his attention.
"Did you see that?" he said. "Did you see what that knucklehead just did?" 
 At the wheel of his unmarked Chevrolet Lumina, he sounded like any driver who had been shoved around on the road -- except he could take action. He flipped down the sunvisor, into which police lights were set, switched on the siren and pulled the Camry over. He wrote the driver up for three moving violations. The total fine was $565.
Trooper Wilson was getting to do what most drivers only wish they could. He was an angel of justice, just waiting for someone to display the kind of aggression that leads most people to mouth words they would not ordinarily use. He rarely had to wait more than five minutes.
He was one of the first five troopers to serve a three-month rotation on the Washington State Patrol's Aggressive Driver Apprehension Team -- Adapt, for short -- which was started in June. Seventeen states, including New York and New Jersey, have established similar programs, most of them in the last year. All involve the use of unmarked police cars.
"I never usually see driving like that," Trooper Wilson said as he returned to cruising speed on the inside lane. "They see a marked car, everyone's driving the legal speed. Down the road, out goes the halo, in comes the pitchfork."
He put his foot down on the pedal, the souped-up engine surged smoothly up to speed, and he was following a Chevy Malibu at 90 miles an hour as it veered back and forth across five lanes of heavy suburban traffic. He was about to pull the transgressor over when a marked patrol car came into sight on the shoulder. The Malibu braked hard and moved to the inside lane.
"Yep," Trooper Wilson said. "There's the halo, hands at 10 and 2, speed one mile under the limit. Well, guess who's been following you for the last three miles . . ." He flipped on his lights and siren.
Trooper Wilson made 10 to 15 such stops a day during his rotation, and he would have made far more if the paperwork didn't take twice as long as the actual stop, or if he didn't have to wait for the regular patrol to arrive to arrest the drivers with suspended licenses or outstanding warrants.
In two days of riding with him, an observer noted that most of the cars he stopped were small economy models: Escorts, Neons, Civics, Rabbits, Cavaliers -- not the vehicles one might expect to be driven most aggressively. "Rather like small dogs snapping at big dogs?" his passenger suggested.
"You got it," the trooper replied. "It's not the car, but the attitude that's the problem -- the idea that 'I'm No. 1. What I'm doing is more important than what you're doing. I'm the only one that matters.' "
Though word is out on local highways that unmarked patrol cars are on the prowl, it's still too early to tell how effective they are. "We need a full year of statistics first," said Sgt. Gary Gasseling, the supervisor of the Adapt program. "What we're doing right now is reinstituting the fear factor out there: letting violators know that the car right beside them could be a police car. That makes them think about how they're driving. It's really driver retraining, a mix of education and enforcement."
The unmarked patrol is not looking for just plain speeding, not unless a driver is going more than 20 m.p.h. above the limit. "We leave that to the marked cars," Trooper Wilson said. "We're looking for multiple violations, the kind of driving that's either endangering or likely to endanger others. I know they call us the 'road rage unit,' but that's when the car is intentionally used as a weapon. We're aiming to stop aggressive driving before it reaches that stage."
An Escort raced across four lanes to an exit, then wavered before pulling over as Trooper Wilson declared his presence. "That makes me mad," he said as he stopped on the shoulder behind the Escort. "They've been driving like homicidal maniacs, and then when the lights and siren are right behind them, it's: 'What? You mean me? Innocent little me?' " He got out of the car grim-faced; the Escort driver was in for a hard time.
But most of the time, the trooper keeps perfectly cool. "The only time I lose it is when kids are involved in a crash," he said. "That upsets me."
There were no children in the collision that occurred on the second day a reporter rode with him. Just a 40-year-old woman and her 18-year-old daughter. They had been in the fast lane going north on the interstate, swerved to avoid a car that cut in front of them, lost control, bounced and rolled over the grass median. Their car was then hit, broadside, by a minivan traveling south. Their bodies now lay beside what was left of a Honda Accord.
All but one of the southbound lanes were closed while uniformed troopers did the lengthy on-site examination required for all fatal crashes, and traffic backed up for miles. To get out of the jam, frustrated drivers were crossing the median and turning into the fast lane of the northbound traffic. Trooper Wilson picked them off as they made the turn. Each would pay a $337 fine.
"You'd think it's just common sense that you wouldn't want to turn into a lane of traffic traveling at 70 miles an hour," Trooper Wilson said grimly. "There's going to be another crash here. I guarantee it."
It happened just a couple of minutes later, but not in the way he'd expected. A car had angled out of the line of stalled traffic to make a U-turn on the median just as a motorcylist was riding along illegally on the shoulder. One could see the impression of the biker's body on the driver's door of the car, a Hyundai whose license plate frame read "How's my driving?" above the plate number, answered by a vulgarity below it.
"Nice plate holder," said Trooper Wilson, coolly sardonic.
The biker would live, though the medics said they doubted he'd walk again. "I have no sympathy," the trooper declared. "You recognize that bike? He was on the shoulder five minutes back, when I was writing up another ticket. I warned him to get back in lane." He shrugged, tight-lipped. "That's the end of aggressive driving for him."

All in a day's work with the Washington State Patrol: In an unmarked car, Trooper Scott Jarmon observed a white Plymouth being driven aggressively on Interstate 5 south of Seattle. He clocked the car at 94 m.p.h. After pulling it over, he cited the driver, an 18-year-old with a learner's permit, for speeding, following too closely and not wearing a seat belt. She also received a criminal citation for no driver's license. The car was impounded. (Photographs by Therese Frare for The New York Times)

HSBC to Freeze Salaries in 1999

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 3

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings Ltd. said today that it would freeze the salaries of its work force in Hong Kong in 1999.
The salary freeze, which applies to more than 13,000 employees, is for one year, an HSBC spokesman said. 
 He said HSBC would make a usual 13th-month salary payment to its staff in 1998 since it had already been approved for this year by the board. "But it is a discretionary payment and therefore it will be decided next year by the board," the spokesman said.
A spokeswoman at Hang Seng Bank Ltd., a subsidiary of HSBC, said that no decision had been made yet on 1999 salary plans but that the board would decide by the end of this month.
HSBC is the holding company for the London-based corporate banking and financial services firm. Its units include the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Hong Kong's leading bank, and Marine Midland Bank in the United States.

HEADLINE: Workers Are Producing More Than First Estimated

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
United States workers produced more at less cost in the third quarter than the Government first estimated, a sign that the almost eight-year-old expansion of the economy will stay on track into the new year.
Productivity rose at a revised 3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in September, initially reported as a 2.3 percent gain, the Labor Department said. Unit labor costs -- a separate index measuring changes in worker compensation and productivity -- rose at a 1.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, initially estimated at a 1.7 percent annual rate. 
 That means businesses will be able to hold the line on prices even as their labor costs increase. "This is unambiguously good news," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. "Without productivity growth, there can be no increases in real incomes."
Discount retailers and specialty clothing chains reported today that sales at stores open at least a year rose in November, though department stores saw slower results at the start of the holiday shopping season as warm weather and competition hurt clothing purchases.
Still, first-time jobless claims rose 12,000, to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 for the week ended last Saturday, after falling 39,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. The more closely watched four-week average also rose to a seasonally adjusted 319,250 last week from 319,000, suggesting that companies are gradually laying off employees.
The third-quarter revision in productivity was not surprising, given the pace at which the economy grew. Gross domestic product was revised to a 3.9 percent increase at an annual rate from the 3.3 percent initially reported by the Commerce Department.
United States businesses -- from factories to pharmacies to financial service companies -- have invested billions of dollars in computers and various high-technology equipment to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This has allowed companies to increase productivity and performance at a time when there is little ability to pass higher labor and production costs on to their customers.
Most forecasters, however, are expecting the economy to slow next year, which will restrain future productivity increases.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Lackluster response to European rate cuts may signal price pressures for domestic stocks.

BYLINE: By Edward Wyatt 

 BODY:
THE late autumn rally has erased much of the stock market's summer declines. But stock investors may have little to cheer about for the rest of the year.
Witness the market reaction yesterday to a surprise cut in short-term interest rates across Europe -- a resoundingly positive development that should stimulate the economies of some of America's biggest trading partners. 
 Rather than extending the glee evinced by European markets, Americans shrugged it off. They turned their attention south to Brazil, where the Government's failure to gain approval for a fiscal austerity measure sent Brazilian stocks plunging nearly 9 percent.
The specter of yet another emerging market crisis fueled a 2 percent decline in major American stock indexes and nudged some investors back to the safety of United States Treasury securities. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell back to near 5 percent for the first time in six weeks.
Uncertainty about Brazil and other factors could keep stock prices under pressure for a few weeks, financial analysts say. After regaining nearly all of their July and August losses, and coming within spitting distance of new highs, the major stock market indexes are due for a pause. Add nervousness over emerging markets, concern over fourth-quarter profits and the inevitable round of year-end tax-related selling, and many investors might opt to preserve their gains for the year.
But the same financial advisers say they are optimistic that barring a Brazilian disaster investors will start the new year confident that the stock market continues to hold the greatest potential for long-term financial gains, sending a fresh wave of money into stocks.
"Even though we'll continue to get some of these periodic scares, I think we're building a very positive case for financial assets," said Robert Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, a unit of Wells Fargo & Company.
Given the gyrations in stock prices during the second half of this year, a few weeks of sideways movement might not be a bad thing. And in the longer term, many investment professionals remain upbeat on the outlook for stocks.
"In the longer term, the European rate cut is a very positive signal to the marketplace," said John Y. Kim, chief investment officer at Aeltus Investment Management, Aetna Inc.'s money-management division. "But questions continue to linger on about what happens in the emerging economies. There, I think the road will be pretty bumpy, at least in the near term."
In the United States, the economy has continued to exhibit slow and steady growth. That gives Mr. Kim and others confidence that American companies will report reasonably strong growth in corporate profits for the fourth quarter.
"Certainly, we're not going to see the bottom fall out of earnings in the fourth quarter," as many had feared when they pondered the effect of the Asian slowdown, said George Cohen, a principal at Cohen Klingenstein & Marks, a New York money management firm. "I think earnings will be all right."
Of course, companies whose businesses are closely linked to Asia, like the Boeing Company, could continue to experience problems. Others, like Sears, Roebuck & Company, are apparently suffering from problems specific to their businesses, Mr. Cohen said.
"But companies like Cisco Systems, which we own, have so much demand that they can't deliver products fast enough to meet demand," Mr. Cohen said. "Companies like that are not affected by the problems in Asia."
Indeed, the Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology stocks, has risen twice as much as the Dow Jones industrial average since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq index finshed yesterday at about 1,954, up 24.5 percent since Jan. 1. That compares with a 12.3 percent gain for the Dow industrials, which ended yesterday at 8,879.
Some economists, like Anthony Chan, the chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, are more cautious about the outlook for corporate profits. The events in Brazil, he said, are a setback. And even though yesterday's interest rate cuts by European central bankers are "great news for investors around the world," he said, it will not be until late 1999 or 2000 that the effect of those cuts will work its way through to corporate earnings.
"It's a bit too early to bring out the trumpets," Mr. Chan said. "But I think these moves today will have a positive impact on corporate profits."

HEADLINE: Europe Finally Acts on Interest Rates

 BODY:
The world's economic situation remains delicate, but until now European central banks have refused to join in international efforts to lower interest rates. Thus it is salutary that the German Bundesbank and other major central banks announced rate cuts yesterday.
But the fact that Hans Tietmayer, the head of the Bundesbank, finally yielded to the pressure to cut rates is also an indication that the economic outlook in Europe is weakening. Europe and the United States have been the bastions of strength in a world economy plagued by recessions in Asia and signs of downturns in Latin America. 
 The question for the major Western economies is how they can continue to prosper while the rest of the world suffers. In the United States, consumers remain confident and this Christmas looks like a strong one for many retailers, notwithstanding poor sales at Sears. But the industrial sector continues to suffer -- as Boeing workers facing layoffs can attest -- and some measures of industrial activity indicate a risk of recession.
In this unsettled time, the World Bank's annual report on global economic prospects, released this week, contained reasonably encouraging forecasts. While it said global growth this year was expected to be only half the level of 1997, it forecast a mild recovery in 1999 as East Asian economies stabilize.
But the World Bank warned that a global recession next year was a possibility if things go wrong. Insuring against that possibility -- through reforms in many countries and through pro-growth policies -- should be the goal for policy makers. It is likely that the new European Central Bank, which formally takes over monetary policy in the 11 European countries that will adopt a common currency at the end of the month, will need to lower interest rates again next year.

HEADLINE: Doing the Right Thing(for Europe)

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Three months ago, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the United States could not "remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress."
It has taken a while, but Europe has come to the same conclusion. After brushing aside hints from the Clinton Administration in September that the United States would like to see coordinated trans-Atlantic interest rate cuts, Germany and the other nations that are creating a single European currency trimmed rates today to help keep their economies from stalling. 
 As in the United States, where the Federal Reserve cut rates three times in seven weeks this fall, the impetus to ease monetary policy in Europe came primarily from concerns about the effects of the global downturn at home, not from a desire to fix the rest of the world's problems.
But there is a broader message in the European action as well: that central banks in all the major industrial nations have now shifted their attention from fighting inflation to nurturing growth at a time when the world is suffering one rude economic shock after another.
"We are seeing, and justly so, the abandonment of the inflation-fighting religion, which was eminently successful, perhaps too much so, and has given us a world of recessions and considerable risks, including deflation," said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics. "The European move is part of that process."
The rate reductions in Europe are unlikely to have a direct influence on policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who will meet on Dec. 22 to decide whether to cut rates again.
But the forces that led the Fed to ease policy over the last several months, and that led Europe to act today, have proved difficult to contain, and both emerging economies and industrialized nations remain vulnerable. Just today Brazil's Congress failed to pass a key component of its economic recovery package, jolting investors across Latin America and on Wall Street.
Germany's Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, is scheduled to meet here on Friday with Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. American officials made no substantive comments on the European rate cut today, but are sure to welcome it in their discussions with Mr. Lafontaine.
Economists have been slashing their estimates for growth in Europe next year, saying that a decline in exports caused by the global troubles will hurt the Continent's gradual recovery. The left-leaning Governments that now dominate Europe -- especially Mr. Lafontaine and the new German Government -- have also been pressing openly for lower rates from their central banks, especially since inflation is dormant and unemployment remains high.
"The European rate cut should be seen in the context that Alan Greenspan formulated back in September -- that of a change where the risk is of a growth slowdown and not from inflationary price pressures," said Christopher Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities.
In moving today in a way that stunned the financial markets, which had not expected a rate cut for weeks -- or maybe even until after the new European Central Bank took over, the 11 European nations also seemed intent on reminding the world that collectively they are a major new economic force in the world.
At the same time, though, the move seemed to underscore their willingness to accept that with their newfound clout comes the need to view an economically united Europe as more bound to the ups and downs of the rest of the world.
"The future of monetary and other economic policy is going to be much more integrated and coordinated because all these countries are part of the world system," Mr. Sinai said. "The lesson of the Asian events is how tightly tied to each other the countries of the world are."
Still, some analysts think the Europeans may have had a less altruistic goal in mind, as well, one driven by the increasing competition for export sales around the world as demand in many countries declines.
They said Europe did not want to risk entering monetary union, which formally starts on Jan. 1, with the new currency, the euro, valued at a level that would make it hard for European exporters to compete around the world. Lower rates could help hold down the value of the euro, which otherwise might rise relative to the dollar if the American economy continued to slow and the Fed cut rates further.
In any case, by moving now, before monetary union formally starts and the European Central Bank assumes the power to set rates for 11 nations, the members of the single currency got the new central bank out of a tricky spot. Although a rate cut would have been justified by the darkening economic outlook, to cut rates at a time of growing political pressure to do so might have left the new central bank looking weak willed.
"If a rate cut was coming, it was better to get it out of the way while the Bundesbank was still in charge," Mr. Widness said.
Some analysts said the national central banks also seemed to be telling the European governments that they would prefer to see the economic problems dealt with through monetary policy than to see big increases in government spending and growing budget deficits.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, said the rate cut was carried out on the assumption that Governments would stick to the fiscal criteria laid out in the single currency plan, which include a limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: Light Trucks Exceed Cars In U.S. Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Americans bought more sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans than cars last month, for the first time since a brief period at the end of World War II, as very low gasoline prices, low interest rates and a strong economy kept overall auto sales brisk.
Sales of so-called light trucks reached 50.8 percent of the market last month, mainly because of a steep climb in sales of sport utility vehicles. The broad popularity of these vehicles began in the early 1990's and has accelerated in the last three years with the introduction of much bigger models like the Ford Expedition and Dodge Durango. 
 Domestic and foreign auto makers sold cars and light trucks last month at a brisk annual rate of 15.4 million vehicles, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier. Ward's Auto Info Bank, an industry data service, predicted that this year would be the second best ever for sales in the United States, trailing only the 16.0 million sold in 1986. Plunging gasoline prices and changing tax laws produced a surge of sales then.
Domestic and foreign auto makers sold 579,845 light trucks and 562,190 cars last month, according to Ward's. Light trucks typically account for a slightly higher share of new vehicle sales in November than in any other month, as Northeast buyers snap up four-wheel-drive vehicles in preparation for winter.
Excluding commercial purchases, American families bought more light trucks than cars in November and December of last year. But November of this year marks the first time since a brief period at the end of World War II that overall auto sales, including purchases by rental car agencies and other commercial fleets, have included more light trucks than cars. Rental agencies have historically bought mostly cars.
Light trucks are typically bigger and more powerful than cars, and millions of Americans are turning to them now that gasoline prices have fallen so steeply.
Light-truck sales have also increased this year because of aggressive marketing. For years, demand for sport utility vehicles and minivans outstripped supply.
But by the mid-1990's, practically every auto maker had decided to design new light-truck models and build new factories for them or convert car factories. Light-truck production is now surging as a result.
The Ford Motor Company, which has been rapidly expanding production of full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, announced today that it sold 1.3 percent more vehicles last month than a year earlier, as a 7.4 percent jump in its light-truck sales more than offset an 8.4 percent drop in its dwindling sales of cars.
The General Motors Corporation, which still sells more cars than light trucks, suffered a 5.6 percent fall in overall sales, as its car and light- truck sales eroded. The giant auto maker has been short of inventory, partly because it is switching factories over to the production of new full-size pickup truck models and partly because of a crippling, two-month strike last summer that left its dealerships almost barren of popular models even as other auto makers' sales were climbing.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rate at 6.71%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON,Dec. 3

 BODY:
Average commitment rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the United States fell this week to their lowest level in nearly two months, Freddie Mac said today. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages fell seven basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to an average 6.71 percent in the latest week, from 6.78 percent the previous week. Fifteen-year mortgages also fell seven basis points, to an average 6.37 percent, from 6.44 percent in the prior week, Freddie Mac said. Freddie Mac said one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also inched downward to an average 5.52 percent in the week, from 5.54 percent.

HEADLINE: Nucor Cuts Its Prices for Hot-Rolled Steel

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 3

 BODY:
The Nucor Corporation has cut hot-rolled steel prices by 7.4 percent, to $250 a ton, as it tries to counter cheaper imports from Asia and other regions.
A wave of steel imports from Japan, Russia and other nations with slowing economies has dragged down United States prices more than 20 percent in the last year. Some foreign producers are selling hot-rolled steel as low as $200 a ton. 
 On Tuesday, Nucor, which is based in Charlotte and is the nation's second-largest steelmaker, cut prices $20 a ton for hot- and cold-rolled steel used in autos, appliances and machinery. Nucor's largest buyers will receive the $250 rate for hot-rolled steel -- the lowest in company history. Smaller customers will pay as much as $280 a ton.
Nucor's price cut comes as the Commerce Department considers a plea by a dozen domestic steelmakers to impose limits on imports and as Clinton Administration officials hold discussions with major steel exporters on a range of measures to halt the rising tide of shipments to the United States.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Ignoring Europe's Rate Decline, U.S. Markets Take a Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks fell broadly yesterday, buffeted by more projections of reduced sales and earnings and a budgetary setback in Brazil that caused its Bovespa index to plunge nearly 9 percent. Seemingly ignored was a coordinated interest rate cut in Europe.
"Some of the old devils of international economies and earnings outlooks are coming back again," said John H. Shaughnessy, the chief strategist at the Advest Group. 
 Analysts also pointed to a lack of a strong new sector during the market's rebound from the October lows, a situation they said helped put investors in a mood to cash in profits.
The three most popular American gauges each dropped about 2 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending down 184.86 points. Of the 30 blue-chip components, only Allied Signal managed even a fractional advance.
This was another session of exceptional volatility, the fourth straight in which the Dow's gyrations created a gap between its high for the day and its low that exceeded the 30-day average. The last time the daily range was more than 100 percent of the average for so long was from Aug. 27 through Sept. 1, when the market hit its 1998 low.
In such a climate, said Fane Lozman, chairman of the Chicago-based Scanshift, which analyzes stock market data, investors should be more careful in placing orders to buy and sell because they may wind up in a fast-moving market with unacceptable prices by the time their orders are executed.
"People need to pay attention to slippage on a market order," one executed at whatever price prevails when it reaches the market-maker or exchange specialist, Mr. Lozman said. Using a limit order, one that will be executed only at a specified price, can be used as protection though it may also keep the transaction from getting done at all.
Internet stocks were caught up in yesterday's pounding as Ebay skidded 16, Onsale 12 5/8 and Amazon.com 10. Some investors may have turned to Ticketmaster Online-City Search, the latest hot first public offering. Shares were offered at 14, began trading at 52 and then changed hands as high as 56 3/8 before closing at 40 1/4.
"If you own no Internet stocks, you're not playing" these days, said Larry Rice, the chief investment officer at Josephthal. He bemoaned a lack of market breadth of late and called the market overvalued at more than 22 1/2 times next year's expected earnings.
The financial services, computer and drug groups were especially hard hit yesterday.
The surprise rejection by Brazil's Congress of a tax increase designed to shrink the country's budget deficit shriveled bank shares, especially those with heavy Latin American exposure. Among those down were BankBoston, off 3 11/16 , to 38 15/16 , and J. P. Morgan dropping 4 1/16 , to 107 1/4.
Most drug stocks also suffered multiple-point losses, with Eli Lilly down 5 1/8, Merck and Bristol-Myers each down 3 1/2 and Schering-Plough down 3 1/4.
Alan Bond of Bond Procope cited poor "sentiment and the underlying tone" of the market in the last few days and said late in the session that he had heard that computer chip stocks had come under pressure because of higher production in Korea.
"If that's the case, investors are awfully jittery," Mr. Bond said.
Chip makers, vulnerable to distress in Brazil, were mixed, but Intel was driven down 4 1/16 , to 109 1/2.
The Nasdaq composite index, larded with high-technology shares, fell 40.88 points, or 2.05 percent.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fared slightly better, down 21.11 points, or 1.8 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bonds rose for a seventh session -- the longest streak since September 1993 -- as tumbling stocks bolstered demand for the safety of Treasuries.
"We don't feel we're out of the flight-to-quality environment," said Ken Anderson, who helps manage $14.5 billion of bonds at Evergreen Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y.
The price of benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32 , to 103 28/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5 percent, from 5.02 percent on Wednesday.
Still, some investors balked at bond yields of 5 percent, making bonds shed the day's best gains. A $3 billion three-year sale by Freddie Mac may have also drawn demand away from Treasuries, traders said.

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: TORY REBELLION -- William Hague, left, the Conservative Party leader, found himself at odds with one group he thought he could count on, the Tory peers in the House of Lords. Mr. Hague dismissed his party's leader in the House of Lords, Viscount Cranborne, for striking a deal that could let 10 percent of the 759 hereditary peers retain their voting rights. Mr. Hague later endorsed the same legislative proposal himself, prompting the entire Tory leadership of the Lords to resign their front bench posts. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

RUSSIA: ECONOMIC PLAN SOUGHT -- The Government needs to come up with a more detailed plan for Russia's economic recovery, Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov said after the International Monetary Fund director, Michel Camdessus, left without promising Moscow new loans. The Government has produced an anti-crisis program but it has not reversed the country's slide nor impressed international lenders. (AP)
 
SWITZERLAND: UKRAINE EX-LEADER HELD -- Pavlo Lazarenko, Ukraine's Prime Minister from June 1996 to June 1997, was arrested as he entered Switzerland. The Swiss news agency A.T.S. reported that Mr. Lazarenko and a colleague were wanted by Ukrainian authorities on suspicion of having siphoned $20 million of public money and deposited it in Switzerland. (Reuters)
 
GERMANY: NO PAYMENT TO NAZI SLAVES -- A state court in Cologne overturned a landmark ruling that a Nazi-era slave laborer was entitled to compensation from the German Government. The court rejected the claim of Rywka Merin, a Polish woman who immigrated to Israel in the 1960's, and those of 20 other Jewish slave laborers at Auschwitz, ruling that Germany's compensation law for victims of Nazism did not provide for payments purely for slave labor. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: AIR ROUTE TALKS CONCLUDE -- United States officials from the Department of Transportation concluded two days of "encouraging" meetings with their Chinese counterparts to pave the way for expanded air routes between the two countries. The officials said current passenger and cargo schedules between the United States and China are inadequate, considering the growing trade relationship. Elisabeth Rosenthal (NYT)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Latin Markets Fall as Brazil Rejects Reform

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Markets throughout Latin America plunged today after the Brazilian Congress voted down an increase in pension contributions by public workers, delivering an unexpected blow to the Government's pledges of economic reform.
The vote in Brazil's lower house late Wednesday threw out a measure to increase to 20 percent from 11 percent the pension payments of civil servants earning more than $960 a month. 
 While the defeat represented the loss of an estimated $2.2 billion in revenue, the vote's damage was more severe in political and psychological terms.
Brazil, by far Latin America's biggest economy, has been under great pressure to cut its deficit and avoid the same kind of financial crisis that ensnared Asian economies over the last year and more. Asia's troubles began an economic cycle that has repeatedly shaken financial markets and raised fears of a severe global downturn.
For investors and political analysts, the vote in Brazil signaled trouble ahead for a raft of proposals to reduce Government spending and raise taxes, plans intended to make the country solvent.
The legislative defeat also raised concerns about Brazil's ability to meet the terms of its agreement for $41.5 billion in credit from the International Monetary Fund. The loan has been crucial in offsetting fears of an economic crash in Brazil that would affect the rest of Latin America and possibly, the sounder economies of the United States and Canada.
With nearly 165 million people, Brazil concentrates more than half the population of South America in a country bigger than the continental United States. Thanks to a succession of privatizations in recent years, it is home to $36 billion in direct foreign investment. Its size and weight make it the undeniable leader in Latin America, which in turn is the market for about 20 percent of United States exports.
Despite a round of coordinated interest rate cuts throughout Europe, markets throughout Latin America today skidded in reaction to the defeat in Congress. In Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the benchmark stock index plunged 8.8 percent, while Argentine shares fell 6.55 percent. In Mexico, the market dropped 3 percent, and in Chile, 1.9 percent. Here in Caracas, Venezuelan stocks fared better but still gave up four-tenths of a percent.
The rampant selling in this region also rattled markets in the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 184.86 points, or 2.04 percent, to 8,879.68.
The Brazilian Congress had been expected to grant President Fernando Henrique Cardoso broad support to carry out economic and financial reforms. In the past, Congress has supported the Government in moments of economic crisis, most recently after Thailand's devaluation and financial collapse started the Asian cycle of crises last year.
"This was something that wasn't supposed to happen," said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging markets research at Solomon Smith Barney. "It's raising questions about the ease with which they can pass the rest of their package."
Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based political consultant, said future reforms would likely take more political maneuvering to win approval. The defections came from the President's party, with 25 legislators voting against the measure, and from an allied party led by a former Sao Paulo Mayor, Paulo Maluf.
"This is just the beginning of a rough road ahead," Mr. Barros said. A recent scandal, featuring secret recordings of conversations in which Cabinet ministers appeared to be favoring another former official in the auction of Brazil's phone system last summer, has heightened skepticism toward the Government. Earlier this week, the President's wife was booed when she visited a university in Rio de Janeiro, with students throwing money and coins at her. "The honeymoon's over," Mr. Barros remarked.
The I.M.F., which announced today that it would release an initial $5.3 billion of the bailout loan, issued no formal statement on the Congressional defeat. A spokesman told the Reuters news agency that it was "looking at the situation."
Under the terms of its agreement with the fund, Brazil must produce a surplus in its primary accounts -- Government expenses less debt service -- amounting to 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product next year. The Government had presented a $23.5 billion package of budget cuts and increases in taxes to demonstrate its ability to reduce the deficit.
The budget deficit has blown up to 7 percent of output, or more than $55 billion. The reforms were intended to bring down interest rates and reduce the deficit to 4.7 percent next year.
Sergio Amaral, a spokesman for the President, told reporters that the failure to approve increased pension contributions would mean "more cuts in public works projects and reductions in transfer payments to the states and municipalities."
Paulo Ferraz, president of Banco Bozzano Simonsen, said that the markets had overreacted to the defeat of the bill and that he did not believe the vote spelled the end, or even the delay, of reform. "Markets tend to be extremely pessimistic or optimistic all the time," Mr. Ferraz said. "Our view has been that those things take time, but they're all going to be implemented in time."

HEADLINE: Drug Maker To Close Plants And Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
In a move to bolster lagging earnings, Johnson & Johnson, the world's fifth-largest drug maker, announced yesterday that it would take an $800 million charge in the fourth quarter in part to close 36 plants and cut 4,100 jobs, about 4 percent of its global work force. Eleven of the plants are in the United States.
The cuts come as Johnson & Johnson, one of the most diversified companies in the pharmaceutical industry, struggles to keep pace with its competitors. In the third quarter, the company posted an 11 percent increase in earnings, one of the worst performances in the industry, while most of its competitors had gains of some 16 percent. 
 Analysts were surprised yesterday not so much that Johnson & Johnson was reorganizing but that the cuts were so severe. In the next 12 to 18 months, the company will eliminate 5,800 jobs worldwide, primarily in manufacturing, with 2,500 of those coming in the United States. At the same time, the company will add 1,700 jobs, bringing the net reduction to 4,100 people. Some of the displaced people may fill the new positions.
Even though Johnson & Johnson has three large divisions -- medical equipment, consumer products and pharmaceuticals -- the job cuts will not be evenly divided. Company executives confirmed yesterday that the pharmaceutical operations would largely be spared, with the majority of the job cuts coming from the medical devices and consumer products.
That strategy virtually guarantees that few pink slips will be passed out at Johnson & Johnson's headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J. Company officials said late yesterday that of the 11,000 people who work in New Jersey, about 160 are expected to be laid off.
Robert J. Darretta, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, said late yesterday that the majority of job cuts were coming from the company's consumer and professional divisions because both units were being converted from primarily local to regional operations. The pharmaceutical division already largely functioned under a regional system, Mr. Darretta said.
The job cuts, though, made up only half of the company's $800 million charge. Johnson & Johnson will write off $300 million of research and development with the company's $3.5 billion acquisition of DePuy Inc., an orthopedics company. Mr. Darretta said the remaining $100 million consisted of miscellaneous charges, including $50 million to write off good will from several of the company's previous acquisitions.
The reorganization should generate annual savings of $250 million to $300 million, the company said. Analysts said yesterday that the savings should bolster Johnson & Johnson's earnings gains to 14 percent a year, well ahead of its current pace.
Johnson & Johnson's reorganization comes at an odd time for the company. Even though its third-quarter earnings gain was only half that of some of its competitors, investors recently sent the company's shares to record highs. Analysts said anxious investors had traditionally bought shares in Johnson & Johnson because the company was a consistent performer during periods of market volatility.
Yet, even with the investor frenzy, there had always been a hint of trouble within the company. Last month, Johnson & Johnson announced that it would not meet its $3-a-share earnings forecast for 1999. That only raised more criticism on Wall Street that the company's diverse products, which include the world's largest line of medical equipment and Band-Aid adhesive bandages, was taking valuable resources away from its high-margin pharmaceuticals.
Nowhere was that more evident than the company's stock. Even though Johnson & Johnson's stock hit record highs this year, it could not match its competitors' gains. The company's shares have increased 20.8 percent so far this year, compared with 82.4 percent for Warner-Lambert and 47.9 percent for Pfizer. The Standard & Poor's drug index is up 44 percent.
Johnson & Johnson's shares closed yesterday at $79.5625, down 93.75 cents. The market had closed before the company's announcement.
"Johnson & Johnson is just starting to feel some of the setbacks from some of their businesses," said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical investment research company in New York. "The over-the-counter drug business is only growing at 1 percent annually. Johnson & Johnson can close some of these plants and not lose any efficiency."
While analysts generally applauded Johnson & Johnson's reorganization, Mr. Darretta denied that the company's realignment had anything to do with its competitors' sizzling earnings performances.
"This was not related to our competition at all," he said. "I have no idea what this realignment will do to our stock price tomorrow. But what I do know is that because of it our company will have a stronger future."

HEADLINE: Fuji Settles Orange County Suit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Dec. 3

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., said today that Fuji Securities Inc. had agreed to settle a lawsuit against it for at least $7.9 million in connection with the county's 1994 collapse in the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history.
Orange County said Fuji had agreed to make an immediate payment of $7.9 million and would pay up to $8.6 million more if a court overturned a decision made in favor of Fuji, the United States investment banking arm of Fuji Bank Ltd. of Japan, when it is appealed by the county next year. 
 The settlement is the latest between Orange County and securities firms stemming from the county's collapse after losing $1.69 billion in derivatives trades during the plunge in the bond market in 1994. The county has recovered almost $800 million to date, including the Fuji settlement and another settlement for $10 million by the Minneapolis-based Dain Rauscher Corporation, which was also announced today.
"While Fuji Securities continues to believe that it acted properly in all of its dealings with the county, the settlement relieves it of the continuing burden and expense of litigating the county's remaining claims," said a statement by Dean Jeske, a lawyer for the Chicago law firm of Foley & Lardner, which represented Fuji.
The strategy of the former Orange County Treasurer, Robert Citron, of borrowing short-term money with repos to buy longer-term maturity derivative securities made money in 1992 and 1993 as interest rates dropped. It fell apart in 1994 when bonds fell and rates soared, and the county filed for bankruptcy protection.
Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch & Company agreed to pay $400 million to settle allegations it contributed to Orange County's trading problems.

HEADLINE: Companies Used to Getting Their Way

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
After tornadoes, El Nino rains and an ice storm swept across large swaths of the country, Congress enacted an emergency spending measure in May providing $2.6 billion in natural disaster relief. Deep inside that bill, though, in a last-minute addition, the oil industry won a big concession: relief of $66 million from the amount owed for extracting oil from Federal lands.
Then in October, with Congress wrangling over a huge spending bill and eager to cut deals and leave town, the oil industry won again as the House leadership reaffirmed that relief. Indeed, in the end, Congress even sweetened the deal a bit, by extending the break a little longer. 
 Such is the power of Big Oil in Washington, and two of the biggest players in this monolithic and highly effective industry lobby are the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation. Rich in cash, aggressive in style, with issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes and the environment, they have been effective in pushing their agenda through behind-the-scenes contacts at the highest level of Government and through arm-twisting in Congress.
"Some companies have a narrow range of interests to lobby on," said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks Washington lobbying. "But, by its very nature, oil is so pervasive and it is so affected by Government policy that they care about everything."
With the oil and gas industry generally marching, and lobbying, in lockstep, it is often hard to separate Exxon and Mobil from their rivals. While somewhat different in their approaches, both companies are big supporters of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association that spent $3.7 million on lobbying in 1997. They often join industry coalitions created to lobby about a specific topic -- the lifting of sanctions to oil-producing nations like Iraq, for example, or the ability of American oil companies to swap oil with Iran.
By themselves, Exxon and Mobil have a combined total of 15 full-time lobbyists on their payrolls in Washington, and employ other Washington lawyers and lobbying firms as well. Last year, Mobil spent $5.3 million on Federal lobbying and Exxon spent $5.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Combined, this would make them the fifth-largest entity in spending on lobbying the Federal Government.
As multinational corporations with businesses in far-flung spots, Exxon and Mobil's interests in Washington touch on many trade and finance issues. The two companies have won favorable tax rulings before the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department concerning the use of foreign tax credits to reduce their United States tax bill.
They are sensitive to the State Department's Middle East and Asian policies, especially since oil is often found in pariah nations such as Libya, Myanmar and Iran. They are generally supportive of Arab nations. And new issues, like the proposed Caspian Sea pipeline route -- a region where Mobil has operations -- have engaged them.
"They are probably most effective behind the scenes," said Martin Lobel, a Washington lawyer who represents consumer groups and small oil companies. "They'll get their economists and lawyers to see the I.R.S. and the companies will stay relatively hidden. You've got maybe two Ph.D economists in the entire I.R.S. and Exxon can hire as many as they want. We were once in a big battle with Exxon on the issue of oil overcharges and there must have been 30 economists on the other side."
Edward Rothschild, a senior associate with Podesta Associates, a Washington lobbying firm, said that the two companies' lobbying on complicated tax issues had paid off handsomely.
"There's a lot of esoteric issues, especially in taxes, but which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars," he said. "There were efforts by the Clinton Administration in the last two budget bills to reduce the value of the foreign tax credits. But Exxon and the industry descended and those provisions were quietly eliminated. I don't know who they talked to, but they got the job done."
While Exxon and Mobil are usually allied on industry issues, each has a different operating style: Exxon is more aloof and somewhat diffident about how it is perceived; Mobil is quicker to defend its public image and more willing to enter the political fray. Exxon's brashness was evident when the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, one of the worst environmental catastrophes in United States history, became a giant tax break, as the company wrote off all disaster-related expenses -- including legal bills and cleanup costs.
Mobil makes few campaign contributions, while Exxon is a leading donor to the Republican Party and candidates. In the 1996 Presidential election cycle, Exxon contributed $593,928, donating 95 percent to Republicans; in the last Congressional races, Exxon gave $475,855, 84 percent to Republicans.
This G.O.P. tilt could help the companies in the next Congress: the three new top House leaders are all Republicans from the Oil Patch: the House Speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana; the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, and J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's new conference chairman.
On Capitol Hill, Exxon and Mobil opposed the Clinton Adminstration's efforts to gain Senate approval of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to curb global warming that had won support by other oil companies like Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum.
And, in the last Congress, they won significant victories to halt the Interior and Treasury Departments' efforts to get oil companies to pay more in royalties for oil and gas extracted from Federal lands and pay back some $345.5 million in past royalties that the Interior Department says is owed.
The Justice Department has even filed suit to collect these royalties; last August, Mobil spent $56.5 million to settle these claims. Meanwhile, in Congress, Exxon leads an industry effort to pay royalties owed to the Government in oil rather than in cash -- a proposal the Government strongly opposes.
"The oil companies lobby in a very coordinated way," said a staff member for a House energy-related committee, who spoke on the condition that neither he not his committee be identified. "They rely heavily on the American Petroleum Institute, but they've also got their people. Exxon's lobbyist is very friendly and outgoing and the company is really involved in the royalty issue. On a technical point, Exxon's lobbyist will bring in 11 people to talk to you about it. They are incredibly influential."
Lynn Russo, an Exxon spokeswoman, said it was too early to tell how the company's lobbying would be affected by the merger, a view shared by Donald Turk, a spokesman for Mobil. Mobil does plan to continue paying for op-ed newspaper ads and for the "Masterpiece Theater" television series through 1999, Mr. Turk said.
If history is any guide, the companies' lobbying expenses will undoubtedly rise while the merger faces Federal scrutiny: The Bell Atlantic Corporation's lobbying costs shot up to $15.6 million at the time of its merger with Nynex, and the Boeing Company's costs rose to $10 million as it was acquiring McDonnell Douglas.
Still, the specter of a combined Exxon-Mobil juggernaut on the Potomac scares some. "They will be so huge and interested in an incredible number of issues," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group. "They'll come up with new lobbying battlegrounds."

HEADLINE: EUROPEAN BANKS, ACTING IN UNISON, CUT INTEREST RATE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 3

 BODY:
In the most coordinated action yet toward European monetary union, 11 nations simultaneously cut their interest rates today to a nearly uniform low level.
The move came a month before the nations adopt the euro as a single currency and marked a drastic shift in policy. As recently as two months ago, European central bankers had adamantly resisted demands from political leaders to lower rates because they were intent on establishing the credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank in world markets. 
 But today, citing signs that the global economic slowdown has begun to chill Europe, the central banks of the 11 euro-zone nations reduced their benchmark interest rates by at least three-tenths of a percent. The cuts are intended to help bolster the European economies by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. Page C1.
"We are deaf to political pressure, but we are not blind to facts and arguments," Hans Tietmeyer, the president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said.
When the dust settled, every country in the euro zone except Italy had reduced its key interest rate to 3 percent. The Bundesbank, which has long been the benchmark for all the others, cut its basic rate from 3.3 percent. Italy, which has had some of the highest rates in Europe, dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The key rates are comparable to the Federal funds rate in the United States, the target rate for overnight loans between banks, which is now 4.75 percent.
"Convergence is now complete," said Holger Fahrinkrug, head of Economic Research at the Frankfurt office of Warburg Dillon Read. "We have arrived."
The rate reductions are unlikely to have a direct influence on United States rate policy, but they could aid the American economy by strengthening the market for goods in Europe and by helping bolster the world economy.
Though most economists had expected the new European Central Bank to lower interest rates early next year, almost everybody was surprised when the national central banks settled the issue before the new bank officially assumes responsibility for European monetary policy.
Today's decision came after months of bitter and public battles between Europe's conservative central bankers and the left-of-center Governments that are in power in most countries. The angriest battles have been in Germany, where the Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has waged a relentless public campaign to persuade the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank to lower rates.
In announcing the decision, Mr. Tietmeyer said today that the central bankers had acted in response to mounting evidence that European growth rates would be significantly slower next year than they had predicted as recently as last summer.
"Our basic estimation is that there will be a measurable slowdown, but there won't be a recession," he told reporters today. But he adamantly denied accusations that today's decision was a response to political pressure.
Mr. Lafontaine, preparing to board a plane today for the United States, said he was pleased. "Over all, I'm satisfied," he said. "We saw how the crises in Asia were not without impact. On that basis we welcome this step."
Most economists argued today that the central bankers had strong reasons for opening the monetary spigots a bit. Even though Germany reported today that its economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, Government and industry economists have been lowering their projections for next year.
Meanwhile, Europe's already low inflation rate has declined even further in the last year. In Germany, where annual inflation has dropped to seven-tenths of a percent from 1.8 percent so far this year, many experts say the country is already on the brink of at least a mild deflation.
"I think it's a brave decision," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, global economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London. "There are many who feared that the extensive criticism from political policy makers would prevent the European Central Bank from taking action because they would be worried about being seen as responding to political pressure.
"What this showed is that they realized that they were brave enough to realize that their credibility is not enhanced by making bad decisions."
Economists across Europe have lowered their predictions for growth in the euro zone to less than 2.5 percent in 1999 from about 3 percent in 1998. With inflation having all but evaporated, economists said the central bankers had room to inject extra money without causing prices to skyrocket.
"If you look over the last 12 months, inflation has dropped substantially and interest rates have not," Mr. Fahrinkrug said. "The European Central Bank has demonstrated that it is sensitive to global woes and that it is ahead of the curve."
But at least a few experts suspected that politics played at least an indirect role in the rate cuts. Skeptics noted that political leaders and central bankers had in some ways been shadow-boxing around a trade-off between lower interest rates and adherence to tough-minded budget policies.
Mr. Lafontaine's top economic adviser stunned many economists last month by publicly arguing that European countries might have to relax the tough rules governing budget deficits for countries adopting the euro. Other leaders have suggested that Governments might have no choice but to increase spending if the central bank refused to lower interest rates.
"I think it was kind of a poker game between the Governments and the central bankers," said Emmanuel Ferry, economist at Credit Commercial de France in Paris. "I think there was some very tough bargaining going on between the Governments and the central bankers and that there was a trade-off between monetary policy and fiscal policy."
But Mr. Ferry said he was as surprised as everyone else that the bankers moved as early as they did.
"The timing is a big surprise because personally I was anticipating a cut during the first quarter of next year," he said. "Our idea was that the first move would be carried out by the European Central Bank."
In effect, today's decision appears to have been made on Tuesday, when the central bankers from each national central bank met in Frankfurt for a regular meeting of the governing council of the European Central Bank.
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, dropped strong hints that a rate cut might be imminent after the council meeting broke up Tuesday evening. But the European Central Bank does not officially make monetary policy until January because the power remains with the national central banks until then.
Mr. Tietmeyer, on the other hand, could not officially commit the Bundesbank to a rate cut without bringing the issue to a vote by his bank's board. As a result, the decision had to wait until today, when the Bundesbank met for its regular meeting.
World financial markets reacted modestly to the unexpected rate cuts. The dollar, which has increased significantly against European currencies in the last several weeks, held steady today and traded for about 1.67 marks. Ordinarily, a surprise rate cut across Europe would tend to strengthen the dollar, but traders said the rate cut was offset by new worries about financial instability in Brazil.
European stock exchanges all climbed slightly today, in contrast to the declines suffered on Wall Street. Germany's DAX index of leading stocks climbed 2.13 percent, while the French CAC 40 index climbed 1.8 percent.
Today's decision will probably reduce the political pressure on Mr. Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker who has been fixated on demonstrating his political independence ever since European political leaders named him president of the new European bank in May.
It was Mr. Duisenberg who remarked just one month ago that it was "normal" for politicians to voice their thoughts about monetary policy but that it would be "abnormal if those suggestions were listened to."
Because today's rate cuts were led by Mr. Tietmeyer, an undisputed monetary hard-liner who has stared down political leaders time and again, they will almost certainly provoke less second-guessing than if they had been pushed through by the still-untested Mr. Duisenberg.
"I think it was a pretty smart move to do it earlier, because it takes political pressure off the European Central Bank," Mr. Fahrinkrug said.
But perhaps the most profound aspect of today's action was what it said about European monetary union. Under a single currency, every country becomes subject to the same monetary policy and interest rates essentially converge at some common level.
That process of convergence has already been under way for a long time as central banks from Spain to Portugal to France modeled their policy after that of the Bundesbank. But the convergence reached its finale today, when countries like Ireland and Portugal cut their rates by more than a half-point and brought them even with the low bar set by Germany. The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
Italy is now the only country in the euro zone with a base interest rate greater than 3 percent. But Italy is expected to match those of its neighbors before Jan. 1.
"What's important for investors and the financial markets is that Europe is stepping in with this interest rate, which is valid not just for one day," Mr. Tietmeyer said.
Economists and bankers disagreed about whether Europe would have to lower rates even more in the months ahead.
"The 3 percent level could hold for a significantly long time," said Matti Vanhala, governor of the Bank of Finland, at a news conference in Helsinki.
But private economists like Mr. Ferry at Credit Commercial predicted that Mr. Duisenberg would have to reduce rates to about 2.5 percent by the middle of next year.
"Financial markets are still nervous," said Werner Becker, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. "The central banks are beginning to recognize that inflation is no longer a problem and that deflation might be the bigger problem."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Bankruptcy Judge Approves $25 Million Loan for Livent

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
A Federal bankruptcy judge last night approved a $25 million loan for Livent Inc., the Broadway theater company that has been crippled by a financial scandal, after the lender agreed to lower the interest rate.
The ruling by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez relieved, at least temporarily, an acute financial squeeze on Livent, which had warned that without more cash by today it would close its doors on Monday. Livent is the producer of "Ragtime" on Broadway as well as other shows now in New York, Chicago and Toronto. 
 Judge Gonzalez's decision came after a lengthy hearing in his Manhattan courtroom over whether the proposed lender, Angelo, Gordon & Company, a New York investment firm, might have a conflict of interest and could be charging too much for the loan.
A group of Livent creditors and bondholders had objected to the loan from Angelo, Gordon, saying they were concerned that the firm might have ties to companies interested in buying Livent or its theaters. They also said they had found another lender willing to lend Livent the money at less cost.
Lawyers for the creditors and bondholders did not mention any names of companies with which Angelo, Gordon might have a tie. But Angelo, Gordon was founded by John Angelo, a good friend of Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company. Disney is among several companies that have been mentioned as a possible buyer of Livent, its theaters or other assets.
But Robert B. Webster, an executive vice president at Livent, told the court that he did not believe that Angelo, Gordon had an outside "agenda" in offering the company the loan. "I believe they are approaching this from purely a lending perspective," Mr. Webster said.
And Adam C. Harris, a lawyer for Angelo, Gordon, said that the firm had no agreement with any third party that might be interested in Livent.
At the four-hour hearing attended by at least two dozen lawyers, Mr. Webster said that the company would close its doors on Monday and begin selling all its property if it did not get $13 million by today. "We don't have enough money to run the shows or run the business," he said. "We will begin to liquidate the company on Monday morning."
The creditors said that they had found another lender, Farallon Capital Management, a California investment firm, willing to lend Livent the money immediately at an interest rate of 12 percent.
But after negotiations behind closed doors, Angelo, Gordon agreed to lower the interest rate on its loan to 13.5 percent from 14.5 percent.
The creditors and bondholders then withdrew their objections. It was unclear why they did not press for an even lower rate.
Mr. Webster said the loan would carry the company to June or July.
The company is now trying to reorganize its finances. This week, Livent laid off hundreds of full-time and part-time employees, and said that it planned to cut its administrative costs by 40 percent.
On Nov. 18, Livent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from its creditors. That move came just six months after Michael Ovitz, the former president of Walt Disney, took over the company. Mr. Ovitz and the company's other new managers have blamed the founders, Garth H. Drabinsky and Myron I. Gottlieb, for the company's financial problems. The new managers say the two men engaged in a widespread financial fraud and manipulated the accounting ledgers to hide millions of dollars in losses from the company's musicals.
Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb have denied all wrongdoing.
Angelo, Gordon, a private firm, focuses on investing in financially troubled companies. The firm was created in 1988 by Mr. Angelo and Michael Gordon, who had headed the arbitrage department at L. F. Rothschild & Company.

HEADLINE: 11th-Hour Tinkering Keeps Big Board Plan in Business

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange yesterday failed to ratify a $900 million plan to build a new trading complex in lower Manhattan and said it would resume consideration of a move to New Jersey, but a bit of last-minute tinkering appears to have saved the plan.
City and state officials in New York, who had expected the directors of the exchange to approve the deal yesterday, were stunned to learn about the sudden revision in what had been a carefully written script. But after several tense hours, Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the Big Board, drove to City Hall from Wall Street for a 5 P.M. meeting with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The 60-minute parley ended peacefully with an agreement to resolve what both sides described as "some minor issues." 
 "The Mayor and Dick Grasso just concluded a meeting," the Mayor's press secretary, Colleen Roche, said yesterday evening. "They made good progress, and we expect to wrap up the deal in a couple of days."
Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for the exchange, also said the meeting resolved some open issues. "We're hopeful there'll be a speedy resolution," he said.
The deal appeared to have hit a serious snag earlier yesterday when the exchange issued a statement: "No vote was requested at the board meeting. Discussions continue with the city and state of New York and with the state of New Jersey."
After months of dickering, city and state officials in New York had agreed to acquire an entire block across the street from the exchange's historic home on Wall Street and to build a trading complex at an estimated cost of $450 million. The officials would also provide the exchange with up to $160 million in tax breaks and low-cost electricity.
The exchange, in turn, would pay rent starting at $10 million a year for the trading complex, which would rise on the block bound by Wall Street and Exchange Place between Broad and William Streets. City and state officials hope to offset the estimated $300 million cost of acquiring the property by selling the right to build a large office tower over the trading box.
New Jersey officials have been pursuing the stock market since May, after exchange officials complained that City Hall seemed more interested in building a new stadium for the Yankees than it was in retaining the exchange. The exchange has also talked to the Mack Cali Realty Corporation, which was willing to build a 1.2-million-square-foot headquarters at its Harborside Financial Center complex in Jersey City. But real estate executives on both sides of the Hudson River said there was little chance that the exchange would leave Manhattan.
John S. Dyson, chairman of the Mayor's council of economic advisers, played down the brief contretemps with the exchange yesterday and the threat to move to New Jersey.
"They don't like to let go of the Jersey card until the last minute," Mr. Dyson said. "We have a handshake deal with Grasso. Honorable men do not easily give their handshake. We just have a few details to work out."
If the deal with the New York Stock Exchange is completed, it would end an often contentious, decade-long poker game in which each of the city's four financial markets has threatened to flee to New Jersey in order to extract a package of subsidies and tax breaks. Bluff or not, the city has agreed to provide nearly $1 billion in subsidies, including $599 million in cash.
That sort of arrangement has prompted reproaches from Mr. Giuliani's critics. "The Mayor's ideology of limited government obviously excludes this kind of mega-handout of public resources for private purposes," said Harvey Robins, the city's director of operations under Mayor David N. Dinkins. "These resources are better spent on the long-term investments in schools, transportation, parks and libraries, which make the city a better, more competitive place to live and to work for all New Yorkers."

HEADLINE: Outside Capital, Republican Objections to Inquiry

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
As House Republicans push toward a vote to impeach President Clinton, not only is public sentiment overwhelmingly against them, but so are many prominent Republicans across the country.
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say there is credible evidence that the President committed perjury and other impeachable offenses. Moreover, they say they are duty bound to follow a constitutionally established process and cannot be swayed by public opinion. 
 "The guys who have the constitutional and historical responsibility are us," said Representative Christopher B. Cannon, a Utah Republican on the committee.
A large majority of House Republicans seem inclined to follow the panel's lead. Most come from safe districts -- only 10 House Republicans won their races in November with 52 percent or less -- and consequently few face repercussions from constituents by voting for impeachment. Indeed, many Republicans face pressure to satisfy their conservative base, or what lawmakers call the subtle urgings of a top House Republican leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas.
But a growing number of Republican governors, mayors and state party officials are expressing reservations about the Republican-led inquiry or outright opposition to impeachment.
Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a former three-term Republican Congressman, said today: "Did Clinton do something wrong and lie? Yes. But does impeaching the President serve any public good? The answer is absolutely not.
"Now is the time for Congress to get past this issue," said Mr. Rowland, who added that the House should censure Mr. Clinton. "They should focus on the Asian financial crisis, Social Security, improving the quality of life and on being civil again."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who believes that the accusations against Mr. Clinton do not amount to impeachable offenses, said last month: "The rush to impeachment by Republicans has been very, very harmful to us."
Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts was equally blunt: "I don't think it's helping the Republican Party."
Other Republican leaders, like Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a former state Attorney General, expressed doubts about how the Judiciary Committee had conducted its investigation. "I've been somewhat concerned that the process is less judicial than what I thought it should be," he said.
The committee's zigzagging over the past two weeks into Mr. Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices and accusations that the President groped a White House volunteer in 1993 has perplexed many party faithful.
"Every time there's a new twist, it confuses people about the mission of the Judiciary Committee," said Greg Brock, executive director of the Michigan Republican State Committee.
Many other Republican leaders voice concern that the inquiry and impending votes in the House not only risk drawing a backlash from a scandal-weary public, but may also distract the party from important legislative priorities, from tax cuts to shoring up Social Security.
"We have to get this over with as soon as possible," said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin. "The voters are sick to death of partisanship. We need to move on and develop a strong offense, based on a strong policy message."
Mayor Brent Coles of Boise, Idaho, the ranking Republican in the United States Conference of Mayors, said in an interview today: "It does seem to me that we're talking about it way too much. Whatever the House's job is, they must do it quickly. Get in, get out, and do it post-haste."
Even Republican officials who remain neutral on the Congressional proceedings take pains to distance themselves from the Lewinsky scandal and the three-month inquiry into the matter.
"As reprehensible and disgraceful as Bill Clinton's behavior has been, our concentration has to be on doing what's best for Texas, and not on that mess going on in D.C.," said Robert Black, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas in Austin.
Representative Robert L. Livingston, the incoming Speaker, said today it is possible that the House could vote on impeachment later this month. Mr. Livingston has said any vote would be a vote of conscience for every member.
Similarly, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said today that the Senate was waiting on the Judiciary Committee and was not making preparations to receive any articles of impeachment from the House.
Whatever temptation Republican senators may have to intercede, they have kept that impulse in check. "My responsibility is not to come to that judgment that fast," Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, told reporters today.
When asked why senior Senate Republicans had not called for an end to the proceedings, Mr. Lugar said: "Sure, people want it done. Toast. Over. But that can't, in a rule of law situation, be the governing principle. We need to proceed deliberately, and not just wave it out."
Indeed, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee say that not only are they obliged to pursue the accusations against the President, but that the case against Mr. Clinton is overwhelming.
"The fact of the matter is that we have a mountain of sworn testimony that points to the conclusion that the President is guilty of various offenses, including lying under oath," Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida Republican on the committee, said at a hearing on Tuesday about the consequences of perjury.
Nor are committee members fazed by the notion of removing the President for his alleged offenses. "I don't think anybody is irreplaceable," said Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican. "I think Al Gore would make as fine a President as President Clinton."
Mr. Cannon said in an interview today, "To have a President who ultimately, constantly and thoughtfully lied to us under oath on several occasions, you need to deal with that in the most severe terms, and that is impeachment."
Scores of Republicans off the committee lean toward impeachment for various reasons.
Conservative groups have targeted moderate Republicans who have publicly opposed impeachment and supported censure as an alternative. Human Events, a national conservative weekly, labeled 11 of these moderate Republicans in a recent issue as the "pro-perjury caucus."
Several of the lawmakers singled out, including W.J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana and John Edward Porter of Illinois, have adopted a much lower profile since the newspaper article.
Mr. Clinton is losing support among many of these moderate Republicans. "If they make the case they had substantial and credible evidence that perjury or obstruction of justice was committed, I would be inclined to vote for impeachment," said Representative Marge S. Roukema, a New Jersey Republican.
Many undecided Republicans were especially angered by what they viewed as Mr. Clinton's contemptuous replies to 81 questions submitted by the Judiciary Committee.
"His word-smithing in response to the questions has raised the deception to new heights," said Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Maryland Republican. "Two weeks ago, I was more impressionable. Quite honestly, now I'm leaning toward voting for an article of impeachment dealing with perjury."
Finally, many Republicans on the fence say they feel the influence of Mr. DeLay, the House Republican's chief vote counter. Mr. DeLay strongly opposes even allowing a vote on a censure, and on Wednesday his whip organization helped Republicans informally gauge support for impeachment.
"DeLay right now is the prime force," said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican who opposes impeachment.
"He's not telling people how to vote," said Mr. King. But then Mr. DDeLay, the third-ranking House Republican whose nickname is "The Hammer," does not have to, Mr. King said. "He's made it clear he's for impeachment and he's from the leadership."

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Plans to Lay Off 2,000

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Ontario, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The United States unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. will lay off all 2,000 workers at its truck factory in Windsor, Ontario, to prevent the buildup of overly large inventories of its Dodge Ram vans and wagons.
The company, the world's fifth-largest auto maker, will idle its workers at the Pillette Road Truck Assembly starting Friday and running through Jan. 4, a spokeswoman, Jody Ness, said. The Windsor plant is the only North American factory that builds Dodge Ram vans and wagons. 
 DaimlerChrysler said last month that it would idle 348 workers at its minivan plant in Fenton, Mo., in anticipation of a seasonal slowdown in sales. It will also suspend production at a 2,900-worker factory in Sterling Heights, Mich.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Calls Garbage Plan Regional Plus

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vowed yesterday to forge ahead with his plan to ship most of New York City's residential trash to transfer stations in New Jersey, saying that politicians furious about the proposal would calm down once they realized the economic benefits that their constituents stood to reap.
The unveiling of the plan on Wednesday piqued the interest of a number of New Jersey towns eager to do business with the city, Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he had received calls from "at least three public officials" who were "very, very anxious to make deals with us." 
 But as Mr. Giuliani unflinchingly predicted that the plan would be in place by the end of 2001, when the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island is scheduled to close, opponents in both states were threatening to do everything in their power to thwart it. In New Jersey, elected officials said they would block construction of huge transfer stations in Newark and Carteret, where garbage from Manhattan and Queens would be shipped under the plan.
And in Brooklyn, where a third transfer station would be built, community groups were considering a lawsuit on grounds that the plan violated environmental laws.
Mr. Giuliani, a Republican whose second term will end just as Fresh Kills is supposed to close, has a lot resting on the proposal. Overwhelming support from Staten Island helped him win the mayoral elections of 1993 and 1997, and that backing would also be important if he decides to run for the United States Senate in 2000. If the garbage proposal failed, it could also hurt any plans Mr. Giuliani might have to seek a national office by raising questions about his ability to carry out plans he proposes.
But yesterday, the Mayor insisted that the plan would be relatively easy to carry out -- even as he admitted that his administration made what he called "a good faith mistake" by waiting until the last minute to tell the New Jersey Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, about the plan. Mr. Giuliani said his administration kept the plan from public officials in New Jersey until it was complete because of New York City's strict rules for reviewing bids.
"On reflection, it certainly should have meant that Governor Whitman was briefed," Mr. Giuliani said in a rare show of contrition. "That was a mistake, but it wasn't a bad faith mistake. It was a good faith mistake."
Joseph J. Lhota, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said that he had discussed the plan with Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff in several phone conversations yesterday, and that officials from both administrations would continue the talks in person. But while Mrs. Whitman's aides said they were not necessarily against having some of the city's garbage brought to the state, they promised to fight Mr. Giuliani's plan to ship it to Newark and Carteret on barges and to build new transfer stations to store it.
"This isn't about New York City's trash," said Pete McDonough, chief spokesman for Mrs. Whitman. "It is about the method for receiving it."
United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli also denounced the plan, using even sharper language than the Governor's aides. "This is not going to happen," said Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat. "Garbage cannot be transferred on barges off of beaches without impacting the quality of life in New Jersey. We must present a united front in opposition to this plan."
Back in New York City, at in a news conference for which he chose the Hudson River and the not-so-distant shores of New Jersey as a backdrop, Mr. Giuliani insisted that the plan would succeed once politicians there realized how much it would spur economic development. "This is going to happen," he said. "You've got to understand, the politics of garbage is different from the business of garbage."
But in New York, opponents of the proposal said they feared that the two transfer stations planned for New Jersey would never be built. In that case, they said, the one that is to be built in Brooklyn would get much more than its share of garbage.
The Giuliani administration is already locked in a legal battle with Brooklyn, which is fighting a short-term plan for dealing with the city's garbage while the long-term plan is phased in over several years. The borough has already stalled one proposed short-term site for a transfer station in court.
Jim Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the controversy surrounding the city's long-term plan could leave the short-term plan in effect for years after the landfill closes. "The interim plan may not be so interim," he said.

HEADLINE: Window Wonderland;
Those Lavish Holiday Displays Are Serious, Competitive Business

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Expensive, over-the-top, glorious department store windows at Christmastime are a ritual as integral to the season in New York City as overpriced chestnuts sold by street vendors and traffic snarls near Rockefeller Center. News programs troop over to Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor for their 20-second spots of Santas, chimneys and the small voices of children's choirs, while tourists line up three deep between Thanksgiving and New Year's to take in the festive window scenes.
But what amounts to a moment's thrill for those who pass by the windows is the result of months of tedious, highly guarded planning among retailers, who are looking for much more than appreciative gawking: they see the windows as a competitive tool for increasing news media attention and store traffic. 
 "The windows are certainly competitive," said Sheri Wilson-Gray, executive vice president of marketing at Saks. "Christmas is a key selling season with lots of tourists and infrequent customers, and great windows give you an advantage."
Window dressing has attracted even more attention in recent years as competition among department stores has grown increasingly intense at the same time that their merchandise has become increasingly similar. The windows, then, set the tone and image for each retailer, especially for those shoppers who come only at Christmas and may not know the character or style of each store. The competition is especially heightened this year, as New York City experiences a record flow of tourists, or in the stores' views, potential shoppers.
With Gimbels, Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and other department stores now resting in the retail graveyard, the attention has come down to a few prominent players, who spends thousands of dollars on their windows to stand out and draw customers in.
The windows rarely feature merchandise for sale in the store, but rather a theme the retailer hopes is alluring. Details count. Creative directors may spend weeks choosing the perfect ribbon, or ferreting out pumpkin-scented room spray.
"Windows are getting much more intricate and detailed since the economy has improved," said Sam Joseph, visual director for windows at Macy's. In the early part of the decade, when the economy was less rosy, many windows were more austere and featured headless mannequins and far fewer trimmings, he said. Now opulence is in.
"To the retailers who still do it, it has become more important," said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York and author of a new book, "Confessions of a Window Dresser" (Penguin Studio, $40). "They are more of a marketing springboard, because windows create a buzz about the store."
A huge part of all the buzzing is due to Mr. Doonan, who has raised the bar for Christmas window displays in the 13 years that he has been doing them for Barneys. His mandate for drawing attention grew out of the store's former geographically challenged spot at 17th Street and Seventh Avenue, where nary a tourist would go to see holiday displays.
"We needed to be a destination; people needed a reason to go down there," said Mr. Doonan, adding that the tradition remained even after Barneys opened a branch at the heavily trafficked Madison Avenue and 60th Street and later closed its original store.
Mr. Doonan's windows are a big departure from mistletoe and gentle Santas. He tends to pepper his displays with inside fashion jokes and playful sendups of celebrities, from Madonna to Anne Heche to Margaret Thatcher as a dominatrix clad in a British flag.
He also draws heavily from other pop culture. In this year's installation, he made a kitchen stool out of Comet cans and walls from Jiffy Pop popcorn containers. Another year's display featured a Christmas tree created with condoms.
Mr. Doonan's work has sometimes landed him in hot water, as in 1994, when he hired the artist Tom Sachs to make a "Hello Kitty Nativity Scene," which featured the Three Kings in the form of Bart Simpson, the Madonna (the religious icon) depicted as Madonna (the singer) in leather and the Kitty -- the popular figure decorating children's school supplies, hair accessories and the like -- as the baby Jesus. After protests from Roman Catholic groups, he took the display down.
His displays have inspired others to do offbeat holiday windows with pop culture references. The windows at Sony Plaza on Madison Avenue this year were done by Martha Stewart, and feature giant versions of her frosted animal-shaped cookies, elaborate food displays and a parody of her personal calendar, which is featured in the front of her magazine each month and lists her plans for things like antique shows in the Hamptons and a great deal of mulching.
On this calendar: "Tie bows with tweezers" and "Iron 311 yards of ribbons."
"We want people to stop and look," said Christine Belich, Sony's creative director. "And we know people are not going to come into the store because there is a TV in the window."
Many stores stick to the traditional imagery of Christmas and still attract attention. This year at Saks, each window depicts children from the 1920's looking at parts of the world through their attic telescope. Lord & Taylor, the master of childhood themes, is using Peter Pan this year, with the tag line "Think Happy Thoughts."
Lord & Taylor's trademark is technology; it has the world's only hydraulic window display, which is created in the store's basement and actually rises into the windows each November.
But whether the windows feature condoms or finely crafted puppets, the displays take months of planning. Ms. Belich at Sony started doing her work back in April by poring through Martha Stewart Living magazines.
"You have no idea about the details," she said. "The color of the thread used to embroider the tag line on the window frame? Everyone had an opinion on that. We decided to use silver on a 'Martha' green. We looked at 10 samples of pine cones before we selected one. We went through 20 samples of frosting styles before we found the one thing that was perfect. It couldn't be almost perfect. It had to be perfect."
At Bloomingdale's, Michael Fisher, the creative director of visual merchandise, found a way to scent the store's sidewalks with essence of pumpkin for the window unveiling this year. He will not say how he accomplished this task. He does not want other stores copying the trick.
Joint ventures are also common now. Barneys received some financial help from In Style magazine for its windows this year, and in a pleasantly tacky way that only that store's tribute to popular culture could get away with, the magazine is plastered all over the display. Bloomingdale's worked with the magazine in the past, too. The relationship is partly financial and partly part of marketing: for a small fee, In Style can glean some hipness factor from being in the right store window (and maybe attract a few new customers of its own).
Although he is certainly the leader of his generation, wacky window displays did not start with Mr. Doonan. In the 1930's, during the height of the Dada art movement, artists were called upon to create nontraditional, if not downright macabre scenes for displays. In 1938, Salvador Dali put a bathtub with a bloody-faced mannequin in a Bonwit Teller Christmas window, and later some windows displayed a Santa falling off a tree.
Macy's first moving figures were featured in their windows back in 1898, but the real art of display did not get going until the late 1920's, said Jane Stubbs, the curator of the new show "Just Window Dressing?" at the Municipal Arts Society, which looks at the history of the retail art.
"In department stores here in 1905," Ms. Stubbs said, "they would put paper flowers in the windows and mannequins with missing body parts and sleeves hanging down because they didn't have arms."
Window design experienced a certain frenzy during the 1970's, reflecting, perhaps, a sense of decadence in fashion and life style similar in many ways to today's. "In the 1970's, there was this great explosion of controversial talent," Ms. Stubbs explained. "There was Candy Pratts Price, whose windows at Bloomingdale's had a slightly violent edge, but the city at that point was undergoing a very tough time."
One of window dressing's greatest stars, Gene Moore, died last month. Mr. Moore was best known for his work at Tiffany's, where he did windows for several decades. But he did work for many retailers, including the Clarence House fabric store, where he once did a display featuring three wise women in Norma Kamali dresses looking at a street sign that pointed to Bethlehem, as well as to Paris and New York.
No one knows whether those windows sold more fabric, but sometimes, even today, the larger goal of windows is to feed not simply the cash register, but also the ego.
"This is absolutely competitive," said LaVelle Olexa, senior vice president of fashion merchandise at Lord & Taylor. "As a retailer, you are always interested in what other retailers are doing. Windows in New York are always compared store to store, and you want to put your best face forward."

AIDS Stigma in Africa May Have Long-Term Effect
Experts say discrimination against people with H.I.V. and AIDS is particularly severe in Africa, where few people admit to having the disease. The shame that people feel and the treatment they suffer at the hands of their communities has far-reaching consequences for efforts to fight the epidemic, experts say. A1 

Mandela Meets With Fugitive

Criticism of Citibank Dealings
Citibank executives, while doing business with Raul Salinas de Gortari, a brother of the former President of Mexico, ignored basic safeguards against the laundering of illicit funds, a Congressional report said. The report by the General Accounting Office said the bankers took in millions of dollars from Mr. Salinas, but never asked for standard information on his financial background and made virtually no effort to verify the source of his money. A8
 
Kosovo Rebels Widen Control
Ethnic Albanian rebels in the Serbian province of Kosovo are spreading their influence to places they had not operated in until NATO threats made the Serbian government withdraw many police and army units. By expanding the area they control without having to fight for it, the rebels may hamper American efforts to fashion a negotiated settlement. A3

A11
 
Guatemalan Prosecutor Quits
The prosecutor investigating the killing of a Roman Catholic bishop has withdrawn from the case, but denied bungling the inquiry. The prosecutor, Otto Ardon, has been criticized for not seriously investigating the possibility that the military was behind the killing of Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, 75, who campaigned for human rights. The prosecutor ultimately accused a priest, the Rev. Mario Orantes, without ever providing a motive. A8

11 European Nations Move To Lower Interest Rates
Eleven European nations simultaneously cut their interest rates to a nearly uniform low level in the most coordinated action yet toward European monetary union. 
 The move marked a drastic policy change and came a month before the nations adopt the euro as a single currency. Just two months ago, European central bankers had refused to lower rates because they were intent on establishing the credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank. Page A1.
 
Agreement Reached on Encryption
The United States Government announced that an agreement had been reached in Vienna that was expected to produce new international controls on the export of data scrambling software and hardware, a long-contentious issue pitting individual privacy against national security in the information age. The new agreement is a compromise that places new restrictions on the exporting of mass-market software with keys above 64 bits in length. C4.
 
Stocks Drop Sharply in Late Sell-off
Stocks slumped in volatile trading, hurt by fears of weak corporate earnings and a budget setback in Brazil that unnerved Latin markets. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq index fell more than 2 percent as investors ignored Europe's rate cuts. C12.
 
U.S. Productivity Rises 3%
Productivity in the United States rose at a revised 3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in September, a sign that the almost eight-year-old expansion of the economy will stay on track into the new year. But the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims rose 12,000, to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 for the week ended last Saturday, after falling 39,000 the previous week. C4.
 
The Japanese Government said yesterday that the economy had shrunk at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter, signaling deeper troubles ahead for Japan as it struggles through its worst recession since the end of World War II. C6.

Americans bought more sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans than cars last month, for the first time since a brief period at the end of World War II, as very low gasoline prices, low interest rates and a strong economy kept overall auto sales brisk. Sales of so-called light trucks reached 50.8 percent of the market last month. The broad popularity of these vehicles has accelerated in the last three years with the introduction of much bigger models like the Ford Expedition and Dodge Durango. C4.

HEADLINE: The Lion and the Moose;
How 2 Executives Pulled Off the Biggest Merger Ever

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
The Tiger and the Flying Horse would have been too obvious.
Instead, Lee R. Raymond, chairman and chief executive of the Exxon Corporation, and Lucio A. Noto, his counterpart at the Mobil Corporation, referred to the companies they run by the code names Lion and Moose. 
 So went Lee and Lou's intensely personal quest to pull off the world's largest corporate merger, a deal between two companies that were once part of a monolithic whole but that, during 87 years apart, had grown as proud and self-sufficient as sovereign empires.
For years, Mr. Raymond had insisted that others might seek alliances and mergers, but that Exxon could only be weakened by taking on a partner. Meanwhile, Mr. Noto had been looking for a huge acquisition or at least a merger of equals to lift his oil company, already the nation's second largest, into Exxon's league.
Some of their board members were skeptical. Others were incredulous.
Even as Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto negotiated in secret, the lawyers for both companies continued battling in court over Exxon's accusation that Mobil had infringed a patent worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And even after they had summoned their respective directors to gather in New York on Tuesday morning to ratify the deal, last-minute hitches kept senior executives up late into the night.
The $80 billion agreement they reached demonstrates that even in an era of corporate megamergers that require the efforts of battalions of investment bankers and lawyers, the most important deals still can come down to the leaders' outlook and character. "To an unusual extent, the C.E.O.'s established this deal," said one participating board member. "Those two men deserve the credit."
Both chief executives, passionately analytical, ordered up mountains of studies and scenarios to make sure the merger would work whatever the price of oil. But both also agreed to keep their lawyers and investment bankers far away until they had an agreement virtually ready to be drafted. Most of the talks were directly between two executives who regarded each other as among their few equals.
Those two leaders have had little to say themselves. And -- with their companies' habitual secrecy reinforced by fears that any leaks might sink the merger as regulators begin to examine it -- they have demanded that their board members, aides and outside advisers remain silent as well. Thus, the accounts of those individuals with some knowledge of the process and willing to speak are fragmentary and sometimes contradictory.
The origins of the deal rest on a series of obscure musings, dropped hints and preliminary approaches calling to mind the old joke about how porcupines make love -- very carefully.
Exxon was once known as Standard Oil of New Jersey and Mobil as Standard Oil of New York, the two largest pieces of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up in 1911. Initially, the two companies continued to share confidences as well as a headquarters at 26 Broadway in lower Manhattan.
Succeeding generations of ambitious executives took the two companies in very different directions, but they came to face similar challenges. Most recently, the falling oil prices of the 1990's -- now lower after inflation than before the Arab oil embargo of 1973 -- has caused severe cutbacks that led to tens of thousands of layoffs at both companies.
With the price of oil taking another step down this year, the companies' chief executives finally concluded they had done all they could on their own. "The easy things are behind us," Mr. Noto put it earlier this week. "The easy oil, the easy cost savings -- they're done."
Mobil -- outflanked by Exxon, which is twice its size, and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which is even larger -- began hunting for partners. In Europe, Mobil combined its refinery and marketing operations with those of British Petroleum, even agreeing to let the British brand predominate. It knew that DuPont wanted to sell its Conoco oil company to the public or a large buyer. With both B.P. and Amoco, the old Standard Oil of Indiana, Mobil was willing to discuss mergers of approximate equals.
Meanwhile, according to one Wall Street executive, Mobil was also suggesting that it might consider an outright sale. Investment bankers were encouraged just enough to present the idea to Exxon executives early this year, this deal maker said, but it appeared to fall flat.
No wonder. Mr. Raymond was saying Exxon had no need to resort to the mergers and partnerships that weaker companies were trying. If Mobil was rattled by an agreement between Shell and Texaco to team up in refining and sales in the United States, Exxon remained combative. Mr. Raymond even boasted last year that his lawyers were reviewing the Shell-Texaco agreement on antitrust grounds, adding that suing one's rivals was "the American way."
But then Mr. Raymond doesn't have to try hard to be intimidating. A Ph.D. in chemical engineering, with a heavy frame, rumbling voice and jowly visage, he seldom hesitates to let reporters, analysts or aides know when he thinks what they are asking or doing is just plain dumb.
Such attributes, combined with acknowledged technical brilliance, helped him drive his company to the limits of efficiency, while he remained cautious about costly new ventures abroad. But, associates said, even Mr. Raymond was starting to bump against the limits of efficiency gains Exxon could achieve on its own.
If Exxon was to take any action, an official there said, Mr. Raymond felt it had to have the scale and substance to truly improve his company. He first broached the subject of Mobil with his board this spring, receiving enough encouragement to take the next step.
By June, at an American Petroleum Institute meeting, Mr. Raymond and Mr. Noto were chatting about a Japanese refinery where they each have a stake, they said on Tuesday.
"Maybe we ought to have a conversation about the U.S.," Mr. Raymond suggested, perhaps with a view toward countering the Shell-Texaco partnership. Mr. Noto responded in kind, saying, "Well, yeah, that and some other things."
About three weeks later they met in the Washington area, where Mobil has its Fairfax, Va., headquarters. Discussions moved slowly at first. But as the men pondered whether to begin more serious talks, they saw that their companies were more complementary than it had seemed.
Their foreign ventures had surprisingly little overlap, with Mobil more devoted to developing natural gas. Mobil's marketing ability -- it popularized the self-service gas station -- fit well with Exxon's huge and efficient product volumes.
Mr. Noto also agreed early on that Mr. Raymond would be the boss. Though both are now 60 years old, there would be no awkward attempt at having co-chief executives.
That Mr. Noto would accept a vice chairmanship at the combined company, to be called Exxon Mobil, surprised some who know him. "Lou Noto is a very -- I don't want to say egomaniacal -- he has a very big ego," said William L. Randol, an independent analyst.
Mr. Noto -- compact and balding, with a brushy moustache -- is much more the salesman and adventurer, a lover of sports cars and opera, comfortable chatting up reporters or literary luminaries. At their news conference on Tuesday, he repeatedly stepped in to rescue Mr. Raymond from awkward moments. Asked about their rapport, he said, "We do a bear act if you give us a moment."
To associates, Mr. Noto had been making it clear that even a company as huge as Mobil might not be able to go it alone. That conviction was reinforced in August, when British Petroleum announced its $48 billion takeover of Amoco.
That news reverberated at Exxon as well, though executives there almost made a point of not dwelling on it. "That would not have been the Exxon style," said one official.
Also in August, a Federal jury awarded Exxon $171 million in the patent-infringement case, which Mobil said it would appeal.
As the talks turned earnest, the companies began exhaustive analyses. In a project code-named Highway, using far fewer people than normal to preserve secrecy, they tested the merger's benefits for years to come at a wide range of oil prices. Even if prices unexpectedly rebounded and made savings less pressing, they concluded, the deal would still pay.
Though they had agreed on the measures they would use to value their companies, agreement on a precise price came late. Discussions about antitrust issues also persisted.
Investment bankers and lawyers, however, were only brought in once Mr. Raymond, Mr. Noto and their boards were almost ready to have their agreement rendered on paper. By about mid-November, others at the companies began preparations to make the deal public.
Board members of both companies, who had been kept closely informed, were asked several days in advance to convene in Manhattan Tuesday morning, the Mobil board at the company's midtown offices, the Exxon board at those of its bankers, J. P. Morgan.
Last-minute details, however, kept senior executives up until late Monday night, leaving some wondering whether the documents would be ready for the boards' votes by the time the markets opened.
With hardly an hour -- if that -- to spare, the Exxon board approved the deal unanimously. The 14 Mobil directors, only six of whom would join the combined board, had one abstention or no. Minutes before markets opened, the news was officially out.

HEADLINE: Legislators Raising Questions on Terms Of Patriots Stadium

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 3

 BODY:
They are not sure where it will go, what it will cost or when it will be finished, but leaders of the Connecticut legislature are moving swiftly to approve a deal that sports economists think will be the biggest giveaway in the history of professional sports: a new stadium for the New England Patriots.
In the two weeks since Gov. John G. Rowland stunned the public and the sports establishment by luring the Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, to Hartford, the fine print of the deal has prompted a round of second-guessing by legislators of both major parties in the General Assembly who are alarmed by a price tag that could rise to more than a billion dollars, and by a host of unanswered questions. 
 Not a single parking space is included in the stadium's budget; the land at the site where officials hope to put the stadium is polluted with coal tar, and taxpayers would be liable for millions of dollars in guarantees each year if luxury seats go empty. In addition, the deal promises to raise instantly the value of the Patriots by $100 million because of the deal's favorable terms, while the state's projection of its own profit stands at $3 million over the 30-year term of the deal.
"We're writing a blank check to the Patriots," said Representative J. Wayne Fox, a Democrat from Stamford. Representative John W. Thompson, a Manchester Democrat, said he was imploring his colleagues to reconsider their euphoria. "The momentum is to do it as fast as possible, but there are at least six or seven serious questions, and I think there will be more," he said.
And Senator John A. Kissel, a Republican from Enfield, said Connecticut would be jeopardizing other programs by taking on such a huge debt for a stadium. "People understand you can't keep charging everything in the hopes that things will remain rosy," he said.
But the skeptics and opponents remain a small minority. So far, only about 12 of the state's 186 legislators have indicated that they will vote against the plan when it comes up on Dec. 15. Governor Rowland said this week that he did not care how rich his state makes the Patriots, as long as it helps Hartford, and predicted that the deal would be passed by the legislature easily and in just one day.
"Bet the ranch on it," he said after a Christmas tour at the Executive Residence. "Full speed ahead. Go, Pats!"
How is it that Connecticut, which fancies itself "the land of steady habits," has gone giddy? The stadium deal would allow Hartford to begin a long-dreamed-of redevelopment project, Adriaen's Landing, along the Connecticut River, giving the city the hope of halting the downtown decay that began with the exodus of manufacturing jobs in the 1950's. Also, a major-league team would give Hartford, which has fought a reputation for dullness ever since Mark Twain arrived in 1868 and complained about the paucity of cigar stores, a chance to be known for something besides insurance-company headquarters. No longer could Bostonians dismiss Hartford as "the filing cabinet of the Northeast."
The state plans to spend $375 million on a new stadium, which the Patriots would use rent-free in return for a 10 percent tax on tickets and an agreement to stay in Hartford for 30 years. Already, that is an unusually good deal, according to several sports economists, but then there are the extras: The state would guarantee up to $17.5 million a year for luxury boxes and club seats that go unsold, would pay for the team's property insurance, would give the team catering rights for University of Connecticut games that are played in the stadium and would throw in $15 million for a practice center elsewhere in Connecticut.
The state promised to make any road improvements necessary so that the stadium could be cleared in one hour or less. The tentative agreement that Mr. Rowland and Mr. Kraft signed last month also gives the team any money from advertising signs in the stadium and "any and all other sources of revenue from or relating to the stadium that may be developed in the future." On top of that, the Governor agreed to pick up the tab for major repairs at the stadium.
While the Governor's aides insist that the deal is "revenue neutral," Andrew S. Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and one of the nation's leading authorities on stadium financing, estimates that it could cost Connecticut taxpayers $30 million to $50 million a year.
The state's potential liability over the 30 years of the lease includes $375 million for construction and infrastructure improvements, $525 million in guarantees for unsold luxury seats and boxes, and $115 million for a capital-improvement fund. For parking, the plan relies on spaces that exist up to a 10-minute walk from the stadium site, and on parking lots that are to be built at the Adriaen's Landing hotel and convention center.
"This could set a record in terms of the richness of the deal," Mr. Zimbalist said, pointing to the size of the guarantee for luxury seats and the fact that the guarantee is being paid by the state government instead of by business groups, as is more common.
By contrast, the St. Louis Rams pay a city commission rent of $250,000 a year, and a local group received $80 million in fees from preferential seating licenses. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which moved into a new stadium this year, pay a city authority more than $3.5 million each year in rent. The Baltimore Ravens paid a state authority $10 million for the right to sell the name of the team's new stadium (still on the market).
"Most of these stadium contracts are sweetheart deals," said Dean A. Bonham, a consultant in Denver who specializes in valuing teams and sponsorships, "but this is a gimme from beginning to end. If it gets put together, it will be unquestionably the best deal for any owner in the N.F.L. and, in all probability, the best deal in professional sports."
The state had promised to have the stadium ready for the 2001 season. But the company that owns a steam plant on the proposed site is demanding $100 million to move, a figure that is not in the project's budget. Negotiations seem to be at an impasse.
Arthur C. Marquardt, president of the plant's owner, C.T.G. Resources Inc., said the state or the developer would have to pay for the demolition and replacement of the plant since it would not result in any growth of C.T.G.'s business. But Governor Rowland said, "We're not paying the whole freight."
In another twist, regulators say that a half-dozen environmental permits and studies will be required because of the extensive pollution caused by leftovers from a coal gasification plant. Those requirements may make the three-year construction schedule impossibly optimistic, the regulators say.
Mr. Rowland says he still believes that the stadium can be built on time, but he is now calling 2001 a "target date." And leaders say the legislation will not specify a location for the stadium, in case the problems with the proposed site become insurmountable. The legislature has until Dec. 31 to act on the proposed contract. After that, Mr. Kraft would be free to negotiate with other states. If he begins such negotiations before then, he would have to pay Connecticut a $2 million penalty.
Mr. Rowland, a Republican, has managed to make Democratic legislative leaders unofficial partners in the deal he signed with Mr. Kraft on Nov. 19. Although Mr. Rowland negotiated with Mr. Kraft in secret for months, he brought the leaders of the House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats, into the talks four days before the deal was announced.
It cannot have hurt his cause that the Senate President Pro Tem, Kevin B. Sullivan, is from West Hartford, and the Speaker of the House, Thomas D. Ritter, is from Hartford. After months of conference calls between the Governor's aides and Mr. Kraft's lawyers, a new voice joined them as the final terms were worked out: a lawyer for Senate Democrats.
The result is that instead of shooting holes in the Governor's plan, legislative leaders are looking for ways to make the deal work, no matter how many wrinkles arise. "I think I sold five sky boxes today," Mr. Ritter said on Wednesday.
When the Governor's office released the plan's financial details this week, the haste showed. A state-financed report by the consulting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick seemed to prove the Governor's claim that the stadium would wind up costing taxpayers no money. But then the Governor's aides acknowledged that the report did not consider the cost of paying the guarantee on some sky boxes, which would be necessary under what they billed as their conservative scenario.
During an occasionally tense meeting with the Governor the next day, Representative Moira K. Lyons, a Stamford Democrat who is the House majority leader, said she needed more information than was in the report and asked for "a breakdown of what the real costs are." The Governor's aides said they would get back to her.

Labor Talks Spiked With Pessimism And Emotion

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Despite the presence of Michael Jordan at the bargaining table for the first time in more than a month, there were few encouraging signs yesterday that the five-month-old National Basketball Association lockout would end soon.
Owners and players, negotiating for the first time in 13 days, exchanged angry words during bargaining sessions in Manhattan that began at 11 A.M. and ended at 11:30 P.M. 
 After the 12 1/2-hour session, Commissioner David Stern said: "It's more likely that we won't have a season than we will have a season. As strange as it sounds, we left on pleasant terms, agreeing that we couldn't agree. Now I think we sit and watch and wait as the season slips away.
"We both made minor adjustments. They weren't significant enough to meet our needs."
No talks were scheduled for today, but the players' negotiating committee was scheduled to meet this morning.
Asked if the players were willing to give up a year's pay, Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, said, "If they compel us to miss the season, we'll miss the season."
The players again asked for a mediator to try to settle the dispute, but Stern rejected the request.
"We made progress, but not like we expected," said Larry Miller, the Utah Jazz owner.
One participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the afternoon session was "less than amicable and several times talks almost broke off completely."
"But enough key people on both sides decided that an open dialogue was better than none at all," the participant said.
The two sides broke for lunch after meeting for almost two hours. They met again for nearly five hours before caucusing between about 6:30 and 7:30 P.M. Neither the owners nor the players took a dinner break.
There was a sense of urgency conveyed by Stern. He was said to have made an impassioned plea to the players that losing the season would have a devastating effect on the league.
Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts, also grew emotional, a league official said. As he was giving a comprehensive presentation of the N.B.A.'s plan for a collective bargaining agreement, Checketts argued with the union's chief outside counsel, Jeffrey Kessler, and other union lawyers.
But it was Jordan's presence that created the biggest stir. He got out of a limousine at about 1:45 P.M. and took an elevator one flight up to the bargaining session. In town for a board of directors meeting for Oakley Sunglasses, it was Jordan's first appearance at the negotiations since Oct. 28 -- a marathon session that ended at 1 A.M. in a Manhattan law firm. Though Jordan questioned owners about their proposals yesterday, he stayed for only four hours. About 5:45 P.M. he left for a family engagement and returned three hours later.
The two sides still argued over how to divide roughly $2 billion in annual revenue over the next five to seven years.
The recent stalemate was prompted by a failed negotiation on Nov. 20, a session in which both sides claimed more progress than at any since the lockout began on July 1. But within 48 hours, all progress was shelved. The union was upset about an owners proposal that would severely limit the signing of the free agents who can sign for any amount over a team's salary cap. The owners then accused the union of reneging on its acceptance of a complex tax formula that was to be used as part of an escrow system in the final years of a proposed seven-year plan.
It was unclear late last night whether they had made progress on those economic issues or any myriad others that separate them.
"We felt our last offer gave them what they wanted, which is cost certainty," Alonzo Mourning said yesterday morning. "They're trying to take everything from us. This lockout will not end until the owners get as much as they can from the players."
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said: "There's a sense of urgency, but the owners have said they won't operate our business in a way that makes no financial sense."
Given that it will take about a month for training camp and free-agent signings to take place after an agreement in principle is reached, the earliest the season could start -- provided negotiations produced a settlement in the next week -- would be the second week of January.
That timetable would mean about a 48- to 50-game schedule, figures that straddle the line of being considered a legitimate season.

At first glance, Bernice Jones is not your typical college student. At 33, she is a little old, and she arrived for her criminal justice class at Rutgers University straight from work at the Essex County Prosecutors Office, neatly dressed in a navy blue suit, blue pumps and matching handbag.
There is also what she delicately calls "my family background in the criminal justice system." Her two brothers (one of whom has since died) both served time in prison for drug convictions and the father of her 2-year-old daughter is serving a 10- to 15-year sentence for armed robbery. 
 But both her job and her family situation do make Ms. Jones representative of the multitude of students flocking to criminal justice courses, making criminal justice the fastest growing major in the nation, according to the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, a professional organization.
From an obscure discipline scorned by most academics with only two small doctoral programs as recently as 1970, criminal justice has exploded to 350,000 undergraduate majors at colleges and universities, said Freda Adler, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers and a former president of the American Society of Criminology.
In part, the appeal of criminal justice is a result of the huge growth in crime since the 1960's, the prison building boom and the fascination with criminals. These factors have combined to create a major new job market for police officers and prison guards. For some students, like Ms. Jones, criminal justice also offers a way to understand the lives of those around them better.
But at another level, the flood of new courses and students is a reflection of the intellectual success of criminal justice. Ten to 20 years ago academic criminologists and law enforcement authorities thought the police could do little to fight crime, but now many new ideas have proved successful in reducing the country's high crime rate.
Among these seminal theories was the suggestion by Prof. James Q. Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles and George Kelling of Rutgers University that the police concentrate on "fixing broken windows," meaning that they could avert more serious crimes like murder by arresting people for petty crimes like vandalism. At the same time, Prof. Herman Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin pioneered the concept of community policing, that police officers, instead of sitting in their patrol cars waiting for a 911 call after a crime has occurred, should be involved in their communities, thereby preventing crime.
Some of the ideas have come directly from the police themselves. Foremost among these is the management strategy introduced by William J. Bratton when he was Police Commissioner of New York City in the 90's, under which he insisted on the rapid collection of crime statistics and then held his local police commanders responsible for crime control in their areas. Like community policing, this got his officers more involved in their neighborhoods.
On a different track, Gerald Patterson, a psychologist at the Oregon Social Learning Center in Eugene, demonstrated how early intervention with troubled children, particularly getting their parents to do a better job of monitoring and supervising their behavior, could prevent delinquency. And John Braithwaite at the Australian National University in Canberra has introduced a less punitive alternative to jail and prison by bringing criminals together with their victims to mediate a resolution, an idea being rapidly copied in cities around the United States.
The popularity of criminal justice on campus has cut deeply into traditional fields like sociology and psychology. And it has emerged as a "cash cow" for college administrators, said Donna Hale, a professor of criminal justice at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania and past president of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.
At Shippensburg, criminal justice has become the second largest major, after education, with 409 undergraduates in a total enrollment of 6,700.
"We could easily be the largest, if the administration gave us the resources, because there are so many students transferring here for criminal justice and there are so many students on the waiting list," Ms. Hale said.
One of the factors that seems to set criminal justice apart from some traditional fields is the makeup of the student body, according to those teaching. At both urban, inner city schools like Rutgers, where many of the students are black or Hispanic, and rural universities like Shippensburg, where most of the students are white, the teachers say the majority of those majoring in criminal justice are from working-class backgrounds and are the first member of their family to go to college.
The appeal is jobs as police officers, prison guards, probation officers, private security company employees or F.B.I. agents.
"I'm interested in the private prison field," said Michael Bonavota, a 22-year-old senior who took Ms. Adler's class. "It's a growth field with good job opportunities. As long as there are criminals, there will be prisons and jobs."
Ms. Hale and other specialists in criminal justice are quick to admit that their field has also benefited from movies, television and widely covered trials like that of O. J. Simpson. "The largest single impact on criminal justice enrollment in the past 10 years was 'Silence of the Lambs,' " said Timothy Flanagan, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University in Texas.
Rebecca Thaxton, a student who was also in Ms. Adler's criminal justice class at Rutgers, is an administrator for an investment bank by day but wants to become a profiler for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Her inspiration comes from watching the NBC show "Profiler," which is about a beautiful, blond F.B.I. agent who solves gruesome murders through psychological analysis of demented killers' minds.
"When I'm teaching," Ms. Hale recounted, "I ask students why they take the class and what they want to be. It used to be they wanted to be police officers or state troopers. Now they all want to be F.B.I. profilers. They see it on TV; it's very glamorized."
Criminal justice as a subject dates back to the 1890's when the University of Chicago's famous School of Sociology began studying deviance in society. But it remained the poor stepchild of criminology until the late 1960's when President Lyndon B. Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice recommended that police officers be college graduates to cope with the explosion of violent crime in the nation.
In 1968, as a result of the commission's findings, Congress created the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which spent $7 billion, much of it going to new departments of criminal justice at colleges and universities to improve education for the police, Ms. Adler recalled. As part of this surge, she helped create a School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers in 1974.
While the border between criminology and criminal justice is sometimes hard to define, Lawrence Sherman, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, describes criminal justice as "applied criminology, that portion of criminology that specializes in studying the police, the courts and prisons." The broader, older field of criminology is more focused on the study of what causes crime and criminal behavior, issues like poverty, the family, neighborhoods, gangs and increasingly, biology.
Criminal justice is still looked down on by some academicians and is still not taught at some prestigious schools like those in the Ivy League. But Mr. Sherman says it has "really become a liberal art," explaining that "it combines sociology, psychology, history, economics, politics and statistics" and uses the scientific method.
With all the interest in crime, criminal justice studies have taken on a gold rush feel. At Franklin Pierce College in New Hampshire, the administration long lobbied the faculty to create a criminal justice major because it was one of the most frequently requested majors at college job fairs and looked like a way to attract applicants.
"The administration presented a message that we had to respond to the market demand and offer a criminal justice major," wrote J. Forbes Farmer, a professor at Franklin Pierce, in a bulletin for the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. "Like other small liberal arts colleges, the administration was promoting strategies to survive the enrollment and financial crunch of the 1990's." In 1996, the faculty finally and reluctantly approved, Mr. Farmer said, a decision greeted ecstatically, he recalled, by school officials.
At Rutgers, Kimberly Robinson, a sophomore from Newark, is thinking about majoring in criminal justice. A big reason, she said, is that "I grew up around crime." Her brother is in prison, her three uncles are each serving life sentences and her father has been incarcerated four times.
"At a personal level, I felt I just didn't understand the criminal justice system," Ms. Robinson said. Now, she added, "I'm so interested in criminal justice, it's the only class where I stay awake."

HEADLINE: MUSIC REVIEW;
A French Phenom, a Protege of Boulez

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
The great young hope of English music, Thomas Ades, holds the spotlight in New York just now, with his acclaimed opera, "Powder Her Face," about to be presented in Brooklyn. Meanwhile, a great young hope of French music, Marc-Andre Dalbavie, passed quietly through the Miller Theater at Columbia University on Thursday evening with a dazzling display of his wares presented in a fascinating context.
Mr. Dalbavie is not as young, to be sure: all of 37. But he came with formidable credentials, as a protege of Pierre Boulez, whose music was also presented here, by Ensemble Sospeso, along with that of other French composers obviously influential on Mr. Dalbavie. 
 Mr. Dalbavie's "In Advance of the Broken Time" (1993), which opened the program, seemed a sort of cross between Mr. Boulez's idiom and that of Steve Reich, if such a merger can be imagined. (And it became easier to imagine later, when Mr. Boulez's "Anthemes," of 1992, showed that composer in a surprisingly mellow, if not wholly tonal, frame of mind.)
The work, for chamber orchestra, begins from simplicity, concentrating on a single tone with manic repetitions and pulsations, and pulls free of it, first gradually, then wholesale. Through it all, a strong predilection for bright coloration, governed by a strict economy, suggests a Boulezian influence as much as a Reichian one. Some hoedown-type fiddling in disembodied harmonics was an especially delightful touch.
Mr. Dalbavie's "Tactus" (1996), which closed the program, had been performed just three nights before by the Cleveland Orchestra, which recently gave Mr. Dalbavie the odd title composer-in-association. This work, too, begins from basics in each of its five movements, sparking an organic growth that ultimately turns back on itself. Mr. Dalbavie's rich sonic and musical imagination keeps the movements' basic similarity of structure from palling.
The music in between -- Olivier Messiaen's "Merle Noir," Henri Dutilleux's "Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher" and Mr. Boulez's "Derive 1" as well as "Anthemes" -- offered illuminating perspective. And it must be said that Mr. Dalbavie's music could stand with the best of it.
The Ensemble Sospeso, conducted in the Dalbavie works by Jeffrey Milarsky, made much of all this, getting the notes tidily in place, which should perhaps be enough in such difficult fare.
At times, though, it seemed that some added expressiveness might have made these already strong cases even stronger.

HEADLINE: India's Testing Issue

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The Hindu nationalists who lead India's Government were trounced in state elections last week because of their failure to deliver on pocketbook economic issues. But the defeats, which weakened their already tenuous grip on power at the national level, are also likely to make it more difficult for them to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
The Hindu nationalists, who lead an 18-party coalition Government, would face heavy political criticism from militants in their Bharatiya Janata Party, as well as from their victorious opponents in the Congress Party, if India signed the test ban treaty without securing what could be sold at home as a good deal. 
 "To sign it is not an easy thing, especially for a Government which enjoys a paper-thin majority and has its own domestic problems," said Pramod Mahajan, a senior leader in the party. "The United States has to give something to this Government so it can say, 'Look what we got for it.' "
Since first India and then Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests in May, India has engaged in long talks on nonproliferation and security issues with American officials, who felt betrayed by India's action and imposed economic sanctions on both India and Pakistan after the tests.
So far there has been no breakthrough despite more than 50 hours of discussions in seven diplomatic rounds between India's envoy, Jaswant Singh, and President Clinton's representative, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. It is not clear that the eighth round, scheduled for January in New Delhi, will be any more productive.
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is to address Parliament next week on the status of the talks with the United States and the negotiations on the test ban treaty, officials in his administration said today. Mr. Talbott spelled out the American position three weeks ago in an article he wrote for The Times of India.
The United States wants the Indians to sign the test ban treaty, to stop producing materials for nuclear weapons and to hold the development and deployment of nuclear-tipped missiles to the lowest possible levels, Mr. Talbott said.
The Indians want a complete lifting of economic sanctions and the freedom to develop what they term a minimum, credible nuclear deterrent, according to Brajesh Mishra, principal secretary and national security adviser to Mr. Vajpayee.
Since November Indian and Pakistani officials have been doing one thing the United States had requested of the adversaries, and that is to talk to each other in a series of formal meetings. But the meetings have yet to yield much fruit.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton recently lifted some of the sanctions on the two nations to reward them for steps they have taken to reduce tensions in the region. For instance, Mr. Clinton decided to allow American banks to lend money to their Governments.
But Mr. Clinton also exercised his discretion to lift more of the sanctions on Pakistan than on India -- a step that angered leaders in both the Bharatiya Janata and Congress parties here and that may complicate future efforts to sell the test ban treaty.
The United States decided that Pakistan was such an economic basket case that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank should be allowed to resume lending to it in hopes of restoring stability there, while such loans to economically stronger India should continue to be blocked.
"This discriminatory attitude creates an unhelpful atmosphere in India," Mr. Mishra said in an interview today. "And it creates problems for a smooth dialogue between India and the United States."
Mr. Mahajan, the Hindu nationalist leader who serves in Parliament, was less diplomatic about what he described as the unequal punishments meted out to the two countries. "If you made a law," he said "that you would hang someone for murder and then you say, 'I won't hang him because he's thin, but I'll hang him because he's strong,' what kind of law is that? A murder is a murder."
While Mr. Vajpayee may find that signing the treaty entails significant political risks, he is also in need of accomplishments that show he can govern effectively. His central political task in the coming months will be to win back the public's confidence by bringing down the prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Their high prices led to his party's devastation at the polls.
But his administration has also put its prestige on the line with the high-profile negotiations over nuclear issues with the United States. The political challenge for Mr. Vajpayee is to change the nature of the debate here on the test ban treaty. He has already said publicly that India learned enough from the nuclear tests in May to make further testing unnecessary.
But the treaty is still widely seen here as part of an unfair effort by the big nuclear powers to keep the rest of the world out of their club. Mr. Vajpayee has bitterly referred to the status quo before India tested as "nuclear apartheid."
His primary opposition, the Congress Party, opposed the test ban treaty when it was in power in the mid-1990's. Its position was that the nuclear powers should agree to a scheduled series of steps toward nuclear disarmament before India would sign.
Congress, which won three major state elections last week, has not taken a position on the treaty since the nuclear tests, but its leaders could depict a decision to sign as capitulation to American pressure.
"The Americans continue to say, 'We will unilaterally dictate the role of nuclear weapons in your defense strategy,' " said Mani Shankar Aiyar, spokesman for the Congress Party. "It becomes very difficult for any Indian government to put a signature on a piece of paper for something that the American Government wants that is not perceived to be for Indian security."
Mr. Mishra, Mr. Vajpayee's security adviser, said he still believed that the political obstacles to India's becoming a party to the test ban treaty can be overcome if his country's core security needs are met.
India has promised never to use nuclear weapons first, he said, but wants its adversaries to know that it would retaliate if nuclear weapons were used against India. To achieve that, he said, India needs the ability to develop missiles and the means to deliver them. So far, he said, the United States has not given India the room it needs to do so.

HEADLINE: Bradley Takes First Step Toward Presidential Race

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Bill Bradley, the former New York Knicks basketball star who represented New Jersey for three terms in the United States Senate as a Democrat, today took the first major step toward running for President in the year 2000 and said he could foresee nothing that "would derail me at this stage."
Describing himself as rejuvenated in the two years since he left the Senate and now "on top of my game," Mr. Bradley, 55, said he believed he could offer the leadership needed to address the nation's problems -- from the lack of affordable health care insurance to childhood poverty. 
 "I think I can unleash the potential of the American people," he said, standing in the gymnasium of a community center here. "I see the energy out there every day that makes the economy run, makes the technological breakthroughs. I want to turn that energy toward dealing with the problems in this country."
Today Mr. Bradley formally created a Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Committee. He will meet with fellow Democrats in New Jersey over the weekend to begin putting together the apparatus for a Presidential campaign, which will be based in New Jersey.
Mr. Bradley, who resisted efforts by supporters to run in 1988 and 1992, would most likely face a difficult fight for the nomination. Despite his celebrity and track record raising millions of dollars in previous campaigns, he would need to overcome the well-financed organization that Vice President Al Gore has built across the country over the last six years and the inherent advantage Mr. Gore has as the nation's second-highest official.
Another challenge for Mr. Bradley would be in finding a message to differentiate himself from Mr. Gore, and other possible Democratic contenders. And today, Mr. Bradley resisted making such a distinction.
"This is not about Vice President Gore and me," Mr. Bradley said. "This is about telling people what I believe, going out and talking to people, as I have been doing for 30 years."
Mr. Bradley will need to raise $22 million to $25 million in the next year to be able to successfully compete for the nomination, particularly now that the Presidential primary process is likely to be front-loaded with contests in New York and California on March 7. Early next week, he will travel to Los Angeles and San Francisco to meet with supporters and begin the fund-raising process, his aides said.
Mr. Bradley left little doubt that he was seriously committed to the race. Although his family did not join him at the announcement today, he noted that he had the full support of his wife, Ernestine, and his daughter, Teresa Ann, a junior at New York University.
"This is training camp," he said. "This is when you get your team together. You see how you relate to each other, try to work out some plays, and the regular season is when you form the official campaign. I can tell you that I have never gone to training camp without expecting that I would be playing in the regular season."
Mr. Bradley's advisers said that they expected he would wage an "anti-political" campaign with an "outside-the-Beltway" message that would seek to reach voters directly and tap into voter frustration over the recent scandals in Washington. But Mr. Bradley, trying to paint his campaign as positive mission, said he would not make the President's recent troubles an issue in the race.
Even though he spent 18 years in Washington, Mr. Bradley sought to portray himself as an outsider. He often operated outside the traditional party structure in the Senate as well as in New Jersey. In the Senate, Mr. Bradley focused most of his efforts on overhauling the tax system, third-world debt, race relations, the environment, health care and education.
When he left the Senate two years ago, Mr. Bradley declared that the political system was broken. He said today that his complaints then were about the amount of money in politics, the sensationalism of the news media, and politicians who who did not believe in core convictions. "I am not sure that it has been proven what I said," he said. "But I think it is important to try to make changes."
At the time, he left open the possibility of running for the Presidency. He had thought about it in 1988 and 1992, but both times he said in a recent interview that he had decided that he was not ready. In one of his books, "Time Present, Time Past," he wrote that he was partly concerned about privacy for his family, as well as a fear of failure.
He said that he recently made up his mind to run this time because he had the full support of his family and because he truly believed that he was prepared. He described today reaching a certain level of "peace" within himself. He said that he intended to tell the American voters "what I believe and take my chances."
Mr. Bradley arranged to announce his decision to enter the race in today's editions of the The Star-Ledger in Newark. After giving brief remarks at a luncheon at the community center here, he answered questions from reporters. He stood with his hands clasped in front of him before a plywood platform lined with a phalanx of television cameras.
Since Mr. Bradley left the Senate two years ago, he has played various roles from professor to best-selling author. He taught at Notre Dame, Stanford University and the University of Maryland. He has also appeared on national television as an essayist for CBS Evening News.
Mr. Bradley also spent much of his time over the last two years cultivating a network of friends and supporters whom he will now try to rely on for money and organizational help. Although Mr. Gore presents stiff opposition, some political analysts said that Mr. Bradley's celebrity should assist him and he would probably lead other possible contenders.
Mr. Bradley's celebrity should assist him in gaining an early lead among possible contenders, other than Mr. Gore.
Other Democrats considering making a bid include Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, and the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Democratic political consultants who represent Mr. Gore and other possible contenders said that they welcomed Mr. Bradley into the race. "I've always thought it's going to be a big field," said Robert Squier, a Democratic political consultant who is handling Mr. Gore's campaign. "It's a prize worth fighting for."
"Right now, Mr. Gore is such a prohibitive favorite that it is difficult to imagine any of the other candidates, justifying, a race at the moment," said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Governmental Studies. "That can change quickly. And Bradley is a genuine celebrity in the age of celebrity of all sorts, real and phony. He has established his credentials in the field of politics, and outside of it. He has good issue base that ranges from campaign finance to economic issues. He is in a good position, but no one is in a good position against Mr. Gore."
A former Princeton basketball star, Mr. Bradley went on to win an Olympic Gold Medal. He was also a Rhodes scholar before joining the Knicks. He played for the team from 1967 to 1977, helping them win two championships in 1970 and 1973 and earning a reputation for his integrity by refusing to endorse products.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Both Sides See N.B.A. Season as Ever More Remote

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Commissioner David Stern wore a look of resignation, saying he had accepted the idea there might not be a basketball season. Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, rambled on about not accepting a bad deal until he ran out of breath himself.
It was nearly 1 A.M. yesterday, and the two principals in the National Basketball Association's five-month-old labor war were wrapping up their respective news conferences after 11 futile hours of talks. 
 Day 157 of the lockout had come and gone with barely a trace of progress. Never had the two principals discussed so openly the possibility of losing the season.
"There may not be a solution, and we accept that," Stern said. "I now recognize the possibility, or the likelihood, that the season will expire."
For his part, Hunter said: "Our players have decided that if push comes to shove, and they compel us to miss a season, we'll miss a season. Our membership is definitely prepared for that possibility. And we're not blowing smoke."
Eight weeks of the season have been lost. Even a surprise settlement next week would mean about a 50-game season, a figure thought to be close to a cutoff for having a representative season.
"I think we're within striking distance, but there are pretty significant issues that separate us right now," Hunter said. "Unless they soften their stances on those issues, we're not going to have a season."
Depending on one's view, Stern and Hunter are either crying wolf before they reach an 11th-hour compromise or are the culprits in what could become the most costly labor debacle in professional sports.
Either way, Stern, Hunter and their respective bargaining teams are running out of time to make a deal and resuscitate the season.
"We now know everyone agrees on two things," Stern said yesterday on Day 158 of the lockout. "If we made a deal tomorrow, the season couldn't start until January at the earliest. And we're not even negotiating. So we're not going to be making a deal any time soon. In that sense, we both agree the season is at risk."
Hunter said yesterday that he planned to telephone Stern over the weekend and painted a slightly rosier outlook -- if anything can be rosy about the projected loss of $400 million in salaries.
The only game on the horizon involving N.B.A. players is an exhibition game to be played Dec. 19 in Atlantic City between members of all four Dream Teams: the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 world championship teams. The agents Arn Tellem and David Falk will formally announce the game Monday.
The union's negotiating committee met yesterday morning to reaffirm its solidarity and contemplate its next move.
Among the players to speak yesterday was the loquacious Karl Malone, who dared Stern to cancel the season.
 "If we're going to do the deal, let's do it right now," said Malone, who last attended a bargaining session in August. "If not, cancel it. Stop teasing the fans. Stop stringing people along. I'm willing to sit out the whole year to get what's fair.
 "They can take the season away, that's Commissioner Stern's call. But if you're going to take it away, take it."
Stern continues to refuse to announce a cancellation date. Last month he said a settlement would be necessary by mid-December to salvage the season.
Hunter has a deadline in mind. "With 200 guys waiting to sign free-agent contracts, it would have to be by Jan. 1," he said. "I'm convinced there's going to be a season and a deal. I don't think David and the owners can afford for there not to be a season. There's too much at stake."
Aside from the $1.1 billion in player salaries lost, an additional $300 million to $400 million would be lost if the entire 82-game schedule and post-season were terminated. An announcement is expected next week on the cancellation of the All-Star Game in Philadelphia on Feb. 14.
There was minor progress on several economic issues on Thursday night, with the owners showing flexibility on phasing in timing rules in order to address the players' concerns about free agency.
The players made concessions on the rookie salary scale. Under their proposal, an owner after three years would choose one of these two options: Keep a player at scale for a fourth year, or invoke the right of first refusal.
The players also made an escrow tax proposal. But there are several factors still keeping the two sides apart, including agreed-upon percentages for revenue distribution.
"It's not the so-called intransigent and greedy owners that are blocking the deal," Stern said. "It's no one that's blocking the deal. It's just two sides that cannot agree."
Yesterday morning, after the meeting, Stern used a multicolored chart illustrating the owners' proposal in an effort to show the news media what he has been trying to show the players: that the salary structure proposed by the owners would help the players.
But Hunter shot it down. He even used the phrase "hard cap," two words that have polarized the talks in the past.
Hunter added: "I'm not pessimistic. Obviously things are somewhat acute. It's no joke. We're moving into the extreme zone. But I feel something will happen."

HEADLINE: Premiums Rising for Individuals

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Renee Couture earns about $21,000 a year as owner of a struggling Domino's pizza franchise in Danville, Ky. Single, 37, the mother of a 5-year-old daughter, Ms. Couture also has diabetes, though thanks to her health insurance from Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, she said, "My diabetes is in the best control it's been in my whole life."
Then, in October, Anthem notified Ms. Couture that it was more than doubling her premium, to $498 a month -- nearly 30 percent of her salary -- from $197, a little more than 10 percent. 
 All other options, she said, are at least as expensive: "The clincher for me is diabetes. Once an insurance agent hears that, it's uh-oh."
At more than 100 percent, the size of Ms. Couture's premium increase may be extreme, but many others among the 16 million people under 65 who have to buy their own health insurance are facing increases of 40 percent or more this fall.
Self-employed, unemployed, working for small employers who do not offer health insurance, or retired early, often because of poor health, these people are a step away from joining the nation's 43.4 million uninsured, too young for Medicare, the Federal insurance for the elderly, not poor enough for Medicaid.
Premiums are also rising for many of the 160 million Americans covered by employers' group policies, with increases in the next year projected at 8 percent to 20 percent.
But individuals who buy their own insurance already pay far more because no employer subsidizes them, and now their soaring premiums are creating a dynamic that appears certain to send prices even higher.
The dynamic works this way: As premiums for individual health coverage rise, the youngest and healthiest holders of those policies, like people just out of high school and college, decide to do without insurance. That leaves insurance companies with a shrunken pool of customers who are older and less healthy -- and whose health care costs cannot be spread across the general population.
The result is that premiums for the people who need health insurance most are raised higher and higher to cover the cost of their own care.
For years, these people have been paying about 40 percent more for their care than the great majority of insured Americans because they pay the full cost, said Deborah J. Chollet, vice president of the Alpha Center, a nonpartisan health care research organization here. Now the gap is widening.
In general, state regulators report, individuals' premiums are climbing at least twice as much as the increases in group-policy premiums that employers face next year. Premiums for the individual policies are even rising faster than health care costs at the start of the 90's, a phenomenon that stirred President Clinton's effort to overhaul the health care system.
Last year, the President proposed helping uninsured individuals with the highest medical bills, those aged 55 to 64, buy Medicare coverage.
"The President proposed the Medicare legislation," said his economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, "precisely because he has long recognized that there is a growing and often severe access problem for countless Americans in this age group."
In the eyes of patient advocates, many regulators and some health care organizations, the eruption of individuals' premiums suggests that the Administration's and Congress's alternative to an overhaul has not worked. Their alternative left the system to the marketplace, although they did make some modest repairs.
No two states are alike in how they regulate the industry or in their experience with premiums. But for all, the direction is up. Washington State says the average rate for unsubsidized, middle-class subscribers to a state-administered health plan rose 72 percent this year and will rise 62 percent next year.
Maryland's Insurance Commissioner, Stephen B. Larsen, reports increases in the "20-, 25-, 30-percent range" for individuals' premiums.
Tightly regulated New York, with increases of less than 10 percent, and New Jersey, with 14 percent, are exceptions. In Texas, said Ana M. Smith-Daley, deputy commissioner for life and health insurance, "The range we're seeing is 7.5 percent all the way up to 40 percent." Connecticut's individual premiums rose 15 percent to 25 percent this year and will rise by the same amount next year.
The increases, furthermore, are averages, obscuring the experience, for example, of Ms. Couture, whose increase was much higher.
"The increases in the individual or direct-pay market are sizable and significantly more than in the group market," said Scott Serota, executive vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a federation of 55 insurers and health maintenance organizations.
Initiatives by Congress and the Administration for incremental intervention, with laws to help expand coverage for uninsured children and other groups, have had little effect on individual subscribers' costs. The two-year-old Kennedy-Kassebaum law, for example, says that people who leave jobs and lose their employers' health coverage can get individual policies or immediate coverage in other jobs, but the law does not regulate premiums.
In an assessment this year, the General Accounting Office reported that insurers were using high premiums and other devices to drive away applicants, especially the sick.
Among the implications, Ms. Chollet says, is that many people may continue to stay at jobs they want to leave, rather than start their own businesses or retire, because they fear losing their employer-subsidized insurance.
Managed care organizations succeeded in one respect: they captured 85 percent of the insured work force. But their costs still rose and most are now losing money. With the magic of managed care still unproven, they are trying to get back in the black by raising premiums.
Individuals are taking even bigger jolts. One reason, some state regulators say, is that they offer the path of least resistance. To raise group-coverage premiums, insurance companies must negotiate with employers, and employers, with their own finances on the line, drive hard bargains.
Mr. Serota, of the Blue Cross association, said a more likely reason was a sea change in how the industry grouped individual subscribers.
Normally, health insurance companies seek the widest possible mix of customers, young and old, sick and well. A wide mix of thousands of subscribers permits them to spread the cost of one subscriber's bout with cancer to the others who pay premiums but make few demands for care.
This system, known as community rating, is breaking down, however.
Most healthy working people, for example, are covered under employer group policies, setting them apart from less healthy, often older consumers, who typically need individual policies.
Lacking the cushion of legions of healthier subscribers, the companies insuring individuals spend more for their care and therefore must charge them more.
It was this development, said Kaiser Permanente, the biggest nonprofit health maintenance organization, that forced it to take age into account when calculating subscribers' premiums this year and then order large increases in individuals' policies.
In part because it stuck with community rating longer than most organizations, Kaiser said, it lost $270 million last year and $150 million in the first half of this year.
"We're saying that community rating is not possible," said Beverly Hayon, a Kaiser spokeswoman.
Now the demise of community rating is fueling an insidious spiral that drives premiums still higher and throws more consumers off the rolls. "It's called, 'Sick people in, healthy people out,' " said Dean Rosen, senior vice president and counsel for the Health Insurance Association of America.
The sicker the individual subscribers are, the greater their incentive to keep buying insurance. Healthier subscribers balk at high premiums and drop out. Then the insurers, left with fewer and sicker subscribers, must spend more per client for care. To avoid losses, they raise premiums again, giving the spiral another spin and chasing away the healthier of the sick.
State legislatures, more than the Federal Government, are grappling with these conditions. Few have tried harder, and with unhappier results, than Kentucky. To see that all individuals had access to affordable coverage four years ago, the state prohibited insurers from taking an applicant's health into account in calculating premiums.
As a result, more than 40 insurers bailed out of the state's direct-pay insurance market. "Now I have two," George Nichols 3d, the State Insurance Commissioner, said. This year, the Legislature reversed course and, within limits, permitted the companies to use health conditions in setting premiums.
That is what led to Ms. Couture's notice from Anthem. "Some people are seeing 100 and 200 percent" increases, Mr. Nichols said. Lawrence Ford, Anthem's spokesman, said the company had little choice if it wanted to avoid more losses.
Twenty-six states, including Connecticut, California, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and Washington, have found another device to accommodate people whom insurers reject because of their health or scare off with high premiums: high-risk insurance pools. The pools are no bargain.
They charge premiums that range from 25 percent to 100 percent above those that other people pay for comparable commercial coverage.
But because the pools' subscribers tend to be old and sick, the cost of their care usually exceeds the higher premium, so the states make up the difference with assessments on insurance companies or with tax revenues.

HEADLINE: America's Duty in the Pinochet Case

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has been dodgy about its commitment to unseal diplomatic and intelligence documents that may directly connect Gen. Augusto Pinochet to crimes committed during his 17-year dictatorship over Chile. Washington must make public as much of this information as possible.
General Pinochet is in Britain, appealing extradition to Spain on charges of torture and international terrorism. Information that may bear on these charges is in the archives of the White House, the State, Defense and Justice Departments, American intelligence agencies and the Ford and Carter Presidential libraries. American involvement with the Pinochet dictatorship was close, and Washington kept detailed records. 
 In the years before General Pinochet seized power, the Nixon Administration openly encouraged a coup against Chile's elected Socialist President, Salvador Allende, and destabilized the Allende Government with economic pressures. After the coup, which took place in 1973, Washington embraced General Pinochet as an anti-Communist ally and muffled criticism of his Government's murderous repression.
But later the United States became more outspoken, especially after the Justice Department established that the assassination of a prominent Chilean exile and an American citizen in the streets of Washington had been ordered and planned by high Chilean officials.
The United States has not been forthcoming in providing documents in its possession on abusive practices of foreign governments it has supported. It has moved at a glacial pace in declassifying material requested by Honduras and Guatemala. In the case of General Pinochet, it should move with alacrity and not hide behind technicalities. The United States can best make amends for its past mistakes and help Chile overcome the traumas of that era by disclosing all it knows about the crimes of the Pinochet dictatorship.

Jobless Rate Slips to 4.4%, Nearing 3-Decade Low
Despite fears that 1998 still could turn out to be the decade's worst year for layoffs, more Americans than ever are working, the Government said. United States employers added 267,000 workers to their payrolls in November as the jobless rate slipped to 4.4 percent, near a three-decade low.
It was the biggest gain in payrolls in three months and matched the pace of the year's first half, when many on Wall Street were more fearful of an overheated economy than of a recession. Page A1.
 
Mylan Said to Face F.T.C. Lawsuit
The Federal Government is preparing to accuse Mylan Laboratories, a big generic drug maker, of anti-competitive practices. The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended filing a civil action against the company, which it said sharply raised the prices of its products after trying to corner the market on the drugs' raw materials.

The stock of the on-line auction company Ubid ended the first day of trading with its shares closing at $48 -- more than three times the $15 offering price. Coming in the aftermath of several run-ups by Internet initial public offerings the last month, Ubid was able to offer the stock at a price beyond the original estimated range of $12 to $14. C2.
 
Scottish Power in Pacificorp Talks
Scottish Power was said to be discussing a deal to acquire Pacificorp, a big utility in the Northwest. The value of the potential deal was not known, but two British newspapers reported last month that Scottish Power wanted to buy Pacificorp for $6.6 billion. C3.

HEADLINE: Space Station's First Construction Crew Lifts Off Aboard the Shuttle

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec. 4

 BODY:
The planet's most daring construction job began today as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first American-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion.
After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launching went off flawlessly at 3:36 this morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star. 
 On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new American module. Wielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically in the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedrals look like child's play.
Projections are that the job will require 160 space walks, which, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. When complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power arrays, is to cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules of interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile.
The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site.
The work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money.
The Russians, whose participation in the partnership cinched the post-cold-war deal five years ago, are now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have left Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology.
At the same time, the station's costs are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will consume their own Federal financing. The project's total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers are to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners about $14 billion.
In exchange, mankind hopes for a grand laboratory where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries, in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other worlds.
Today, in any case, little was heard about the project but praise.
"Great show, Endeavour," mission control in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into orbit.
And here at the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright lauded the launching team and the new venture.
"That was truly, truly fantastic," she told the team after the liftoff. And it is important, she added, to have so many nations "working together on the kinds of issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with."
"So my congratulations to all of you," the Secretary said. "Stupendous work."
The main cargo today was the Unity module, the first American-built part for the space station. Small compared with the giants to come in three dozen shuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules.
On Saturday, one astronaut, Lieut. Col. Nancy J. Currie of the Army, is to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position.
Then, on Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous with the module known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States but built in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is to be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well as communication and rendezvous abilities.
When Endeavour's payload bay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. The mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big. Zarya, although completely weightless in space, has 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill.
As Colonel Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert D. Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together.
When mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to the tips of the solar arrays.
Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future visitors. The builders are to be Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force, 50, and Dr. James H. Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space walks will continue on Wednesday and end on Saturday, Dec. 12.
As construction goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system.
Next Thursday the crew will enter the embryonic station for the first time, installing portable fans and lights. On Friday they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia.
The other astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of the Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new outpost, the crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days.
Gretchen W. McClain, NASA's director in Washington for the international space station, said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small for individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's 96 million taxpayers.
American costs for construction, she added, are $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 are $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion.
Most experts outside the agency consider that figure ridiculously low, because it ignores many billions of dollars spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights, which run about $800 million apiece.
In a report on May 22, the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, estimated the American share of the construction cost at $53 billion and of total cost at $96 billion, including operations but not including the cost of decommissioning by sending the station plummeting into the ocean. (NASA has no estimate of that cost so far.)
Added to that are the contributions of the international partners, like the $6.7 billion from the European Space Agency and an amount from Russia that is still uncertain because of Moscow's financial turmoil.
Over all, experts put the estimated cost at no less than $110 billion, adding, however, that it could well be higher and that only time will tell.
"It's more than the Manhattan Project but less than Apollo," said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. The Manhattan Project, to build the atom bomb, cost about $20 billion in today's dollars, he said, and the Apollo program, which repeatedly put men on the Moon, about $125 billion.
Mr. Pike backs the station as smart politically if it helps stabilize Russia. But many scientists fault it as an enormous waste of money, saying its huge costs and growing budget overruns have already hurt NASA programs and are destined to spread pain further.
In the current issue of Sky and Telescope, a top astronomy magazine, Leif J. Robinson, the editor, strongly criticized America's killing the half-built superconducting supercollider, an $8 billion project meant to illuminate the building blocks of matter, but backing the international space station, or I.S.S., which Mr. Robinson ridiculed as a "flying fiasco."
Maybe the atom smasher's ghost, he wrote, "will rise up and drag the I.S.S. down to the hell it deserves."
Backers hail the outpost as a foreign-policy coup and a steppingstone to human exploration of Mars and more distant worlds, saying its studies of human physiology are a must for learning how people can venture far from Earth.

HEADLINE: The Last Disciples Of Bacchus;
In the Bronx, Home Winemaking of a Certain Vintage

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
There are two kinds of home winemakers. There are those who choose to make wine. And there are those who can't help themselves.
John Salvo is definitely one of the latter. And as a cold November breeze whipped up his block in the Country Club section of the east Bronx last week, Mr. Salvo was not pleased. The air was cold enough to dull the smell of decaying leaves in his neighborhood, cold enough to erase the scent of Neapolitan cooking that usually emanates from its kitchens, cold enough to keep 50 gallons of his 1998 vintage from fermenting. 
Standing in the driveway behind the tidy stucco home where he and his wife raised their two children and have lived for 47 years, Mr. Salvo pulled up the collar of his blue jacket, shook his head and predicted a space heater vintage.
His most significant contribution to the art of home winemaking, he said, is his technique for providing the constant 72 degrees that crushed grapes require to ferment. The Salvo innovation involves swaddling the 50-gallon fermenting vats in blankets and positioning a space heater close by when it gets cold outside.
"The wine is like the woman you marry," Mr. Salvo said. "You want to make a baby, you got to stay close and get her warm. That's the same way with the wine. You got to keep her warm or else she does nothing but sit there."
The 73-year-old retired building contractor is one of the last of the neighborhood's old-time home winemakers. He scoffs at the high-priced winemaking equipment and technical manuals that today's food-obsessed, vintage-savvy younger set buy to feed their dreams of making award-winning varietal wine.
Mr. Salvo does things the old-fashioned way. He retools and jury-rigs his winemaking tools. He follows his senses, not a recipe.
His instinctual approach to winemaking is one reason that people like Ronnie Palumbo apprentice themselves to Mr. Salvo. Mr. Palumbo, 52, is young and affluent enough to appreciate fine varietal wine. But he is also old enough to worry about the passing of the vintners of his father's generation and the wine they made from recipes handed down from Bacchus.
Mr. Salvo's brown-eyed, white-haired puckishness makes him almost as difficult to resist as his thick red wine -- "not too sweet, not too dry, 3 cases white seedless grapes, 7 cases Alicante grapes, that's my recipe that everybody love," he says.
After decades of making their own wine, neighbors who have become too frail for the ritual call on Mr. Salvo to set their annual stores.
He is happy to oblige -- up to a point. "The first ton of grapes, I can handle," he said. "After that, I need help."
In addition to a procession of apprentices including his son Joseph and grandson Johnny, friends and fellow retirees like Vito Poveromo and Lochy Conlon have established themselves as the winemaker's constant assistants. In fact, so large is the Salvo consortium that, when he retired five years ago, Mr. Salvo moved his center of operations from a tiny cloakroom near the front door of his home. His new center is actually his former garage.
Since then, the particulars of home winemaking have become the organizing principle of his life.
In the summer, he scours bars for empty bottles. It takes all afternoon to wash, sterilize and sun-dry the bottles. By Sept. 1, Mr. Salvo has entered the grape-buying stage.
He and his consortium pile into his light blue 1983 Chevy and cruise the Conrail freight yards in Mount Vernon, in Westchester County. Various vendors sell California grapes directly from freight cars, cash only.
Back in the Bronx, the winemaker and his assistants also drop by Jerry's Nursery and Wine Grapes Company on Boston Road. Mr. Salvo is a big believer in comparative shopping and Jerry's is his personal commodity price index.
Mr. Salvo claims that more than 65 years of winemaking, beginning with his apprenticeship to his grandfather in Salerno, Italy, helped him refine his blend. But his main purveyor suspects that price is a significant factor in Mr. Salvo's formula.
"The old guys like John and my father aren't going to pay $34 a box for merlot grapes or $35 for cabernet when they can get Alicante for $20," said Carmine Cipolla, son of Jerry Cipolla, founder and owner of Jerry's Nursery and Wine Grapes Company.
In addition to shopping for the best price, said Mr. Cipolla, "the old guys think the way they do it is the only way, because it is the only way they ever did it and no way they're going to change."
In fact, he said, the old-timers tend to be immigrants who may be loyal to their fathers, or may think that $20 for a bottle of wine is highway robbery, or may be too wary to drink any wine they have not made themselves. For whatever reason, their response to autumn is to begin the wine, quickly, instinctually and, after they have settled on the price of the grapes, without question.
They make hot, sturdy wine that cannot be aged and begins to sour within a year, wines that might cause a sommelier to sniff. But in wines like Mr. Salvo's, the contradiction between their fleeting fragility and their full, rough body is their charm.
The younger, more enlightened winemakers of today, said Carmine Cipolla, aim to make fine wines, distinct wines, wines that can be aged.
"The newcomers are full of science and social ambition," he said. "They tend to belong to wine-tasting clubs and drive their BMW's to Jerry's to buy princely varietal grapes and designer-priced winemaking equipment."
Suzanne Berens, the editor of Wine Maker, an annual magazine that premiered last summer, said home winemaking is one of the fastest-growing hobbies in America.
Jerry Cipolla isn't so sure. "When I started this business 60 years ago, I had 10 competitors within 3 blocks," he said. "Now I'm the only guy and I lose a customer every couple weeks. They die."
He doesn't trust the youthful hobbyists with their ready cash and vinicultural vocabulary. Heck, next year, they may decide to take up quail shooting. In an economy that runs deeper than dollars, Jerry Cipolla knocks a couple cents off his price to Mr. Salvo every time the winemaker loses a customer.
The gesture is not lost on Mr. Salvo, who is uncharacteristically specific when it comes to cost and quantity. He bought 3,780 pounds of grapes this year, which cost about $2,160 and made precisely 315 gallons of wine, just under the legal limit for personal consumption. He makes wine for himself first, and then for the neighbors.
After blanketing the fermenting vat and firing up the electric space heater one recent afternoon, Mr. Salvo rubbed his hands together over the glowing coils and surveyed his world.
The newly expanded Chateau di Salvo is a cinderblock structure with one glass brick window, two walls of wood shelving that accommodate his giant aging barrels, and an eclectic assortment of vodka and Scotch bottles as well as various grinders, filters and clear plastic tubing.
The spine of the room is a platform that is about 36 inches high and houses two 50-gallon fermenting vats. Both of the stationary grape presses bolted to the concrete floor were gifts. One is a 150-year-old, hand-cranked metal model from a neighbor who had grown too old and weak to turn the massive handle. As the winery warmed, and the poignant smell of splattered grapes and yeast came alive, Mr. Salvo watched Mr. Poveromo and Mr. Conlon shoulder the grinder's handle like two yoked oxen.
Inhaling one of those precious moments between raw grapes and vinegar, Mr. Salvo rocked contentedly in his running shoes. Then he started to giggle like a madman.
"Last June, some doctor tell me I'm going to die in one month. I say to him he better be wrong or else he's not going to taste my wine. Now he's calling me asking for his wine. Who else is he going to call?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON LAWYERS DEMANDING 3 DAYS FOR HIS DEFENSE

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
With the House Judiciary Committee just a week away from a scheduled vote on articles of impeachment against President Clinton, the White House challenged the panel's inquiry tonight by demanding several days to present a defense that would slow the committee's deliberations.
Responding to the committee's invitation to appear next Tuesday, the President's lawyers sought to move the impeachment inquiry in a new direction while raising doubts in the public mind about the proceedings' fairness and scope. They asked for three or four days to call witnesses and raise questions about the legal and constitutional basis for the inquiry. 
 In the opening passage of a letter sent to the Judiciary Committee this evening, the two top White House lawyers dealing with impeachment, Charles F. C. Ruff and Gregory B. Craig, said the stakes were extraordinarily high.
"Short of a declaration of war," they wrote, "there is no more significant or grave constitutional process than the impeachment inquiry currently under way in your committee. Should the House of Representatives approve an article of impeachment against the President and send it to the Senate for trial, the impact on the national Government and on the American people as a whole would be profound. For that reason alone, this process must be deliberate, thorough, fair and expeditious."
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, hopes to have it vote on impeachment late next week. He did not immediately respond to the White House proposal.
The tone of the White House letter signaled an effort to present a vigorous defense of the President against accusations of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power raised by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel. Many in the White House assume that the politically polarized committee will vote along party lines to approve at least one article of impeachment.
The counterarguments the White House hopes to present next week appear aimed at moderate Republicans who are still trying to decide whether to vote for impeachment on the House floor.
"We made the decision that we want to go up and demonstrate that these proceedings have not been fair," said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. "None of the allegations that have been made rise to the standard of impeachment. It's that simple. This is not a bank shot."
Republicans said they saw the White House move as an effort to stall the proceedings until January, when a new Congress convenes in which their House majority will be trimmed by half, to only six votes.
But Mr. Lockhart denied that the White House proposal was a delaying tactic. He said the committee could still vote on articles of impeachment by the end of next week if the President's lawyers were allowed four days to make his case.
The White House letter echoes complaints that Mr. Clinton's partisans have raised throughout the process. They maintain that the committee's Republican majority has conducted a partisan inquiry that has not provided Mr. Clinton an adequate opportunity to defend himself against the charges raised in Mr. Starr's referral.
With the committee rapidly approaching a vote on impeachment, the White House clearly wants to slow the process and raise issues it says have been given short shrift in the panel's accelerated schedule.
The White House said it wanted to present three panels of witnesses over three to four days to discuss what constitutes an impeachable offense, the standards for prosecution of the acts that Mr. Starr has attributed to the President, and prosecutorial misconduct.
"We feel it is essential to the President's defense that we be able to call our own witnesses and present our own arguments to address these important questions," Mr. Clinton's lawyers wrote to the committee.
The White House proposed a daylong seminar on each of those questions but did not disclose any list of witnesses it intended to call to make its case. The President's lawyers said they would present a summation of Mr. Clinton's defense at the end of the panel discussions.
The White House has contended all along that Mr. Clinton's misleading statements under oath about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky do not constitute perjury, and therefore do not justify impeachment. The President has steadfastly denied tampering with witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice, and has also said that nothing he did constituted abuse of power.
As part of its defense, the White House wants to use the hearings next week to showcase once again what it calls Mr. Starr's misconduct.
When Mr. Starr appeared before the committee two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton's lead private lawyer, David E. Kendall, grilled him for more than an hour on what Mr. Kendall contended were leaks from the independent counsel's office, intimidation of witnesses, selective presentation of testimony and deceptive investigative techniques. Mr. Kendall did not raise a single point in defense of the President's actions, however.
Now the White House says Mr. Kendall was not given enough time to defend the President.
"With the exception of one hour of time provided to us for questioning Mr. Starr at the end of his appearance before the committee," the letter this evening said, the White House has been "foreclosed from playing any role" in the impeachment proceedings.
"We anticipate," the letter concluded, "that we will require no more than three to four days of the committee's time to deal with the topics identified above, at which time counsel for the President will present a final argument as to why, given the law, the facts and these circumstances, this committee should not report out articles of impeachment to the full membership of the House of Representatives."

HEADLINE: A Drug Maker Is Said to Face A Suit on Prices

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
With the prices of some generic drugs soaring to record levels this year, the Federal Government is preparing to accuse one of the world's largest producers of tripling its prices after trying to corner the market on the drugs' raw materials, lawyers involved in the anti-competition case said today.
The company, Mylan Laboratories Inc., has been notified that the staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended filing a civil lawsuit accusing the company of anticompetitive practices after it raised the price of several generic medications, including lorazepam, an anti-anxiety drug that is known popularly by its brand name, Ativan. 
 Generic drugs have historically been more attractive to consumers, particularly people on fixed incomes and the elderly, because the drugs are no-name knock-offs of more expensive brand names. But this year prices of many popular generic drugs have risen dramatically, far outpacing increases in the brand-name drugs. Industry analysts say Mylan has been the most aggressive of the price raisers. In fact, the swift increases this year in the costs of Mylan drugs have been so big and widespread -- in some cases more than tripling -- that they largely contributed one month to a record increase of 10.7 percent in the prescription drug portion of the Producer Price Index, an important measure of inflation.
Later this month, the company plans a new round of price increases, ranging from 44 percent to 71 percent, on 20 of its products.
In recent years, the Federal Government has taken steps to encourage competition in the drug and pharmacy businesses, although there has not been any other case where a drug maker is accused of trying to control a supplier to increase prices.
Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission blocked two proposed mergers involving four drugstore wholesalers. The wholesalers control about 80 percent of the wholesale prescription drug business. Last August, the commission reached an agreement with Merck that prevents its drug sales unit, Merck-Medco Managed Care, from discriminating against drugs made by competitors.
The Government's inquiry has focused on whether Mylan, which fills more prescriptions than any other generic or brand-name drug manufacturer, sought to illegally corner the market on important raw materials supplied by an Italian company for some of its drugs, including lorazepam, and then sharply raised prices.
Last year the company struck an exclusive arrangement with Profarmica, an Italian company that is a major supplier of the materials for lorazepam and other drugs Mylan makes. After that deal, the supply diminished and the cost of the raw materials to Mylan's competitors significantly increased. The company more than tripled lorazepam's price to $122.11 for 100 two-milligram tablets, and smaller competitors followed suit.
These and other increases by Mylan have led to large price increases by the company's smaller competitors.
In response to questions today, Mylan issued a brief statement that "no pharmaceutical company in America has a better record of safety and compliance with the law."
"The Federal Trade Commission has not brought a single charge against the company, and we are certain no credible charge can be brought," the statement said. "Mylan has done nothing wrong. We look forward to making our case before the commission."
Mylan's lawyers are now preparing a presentation to the agency's commissioners in the coming days to urge them to reject the findings of the staff. The company's lawyers contend that the arrangement with Profarmica was proper.
"These agreements assured a source of supply which the commission should recognize is a pro-consumer result," said Kevin J. Arquit, one of the company's antitrust lawyers. "The competition that existed in this market prior to this agreement continues to exist today."
Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman at the Federal Trade Commission, declined to comment.
But antitrust lawyers who follow the commission say that in most instances the commissioners follow staff recommendations and are expected to do so in Mylan's case, an inquiry closely watched in Congress.
Executives at Mylan have said the price increases this year were necessary to reverse sharp losses in many of their generic drugs. The prices had been driven down by growing competition, as more manufacturers have entered the market, hoping to profit by selling generic equivalents of the growing number of brand- name drugs losing patent protection.
Last year, company executives say, Mylan lost money on 41 of the 97 drugs it sold. Jerry Treppel, an industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, estimated that about 10 percent of the company's earnings this year will come from the sale of lorazepam following the price increase. In the year ending in March, Mylan reported earnings of $100 million on revenues of $528 million.
The company, based in Pittsburgh, is the world's No. 2 maker of generic drugs behind Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, an Israeli company. Founded in 1961, it first began making generic penicillin in 1966 and tetracycline in 1968. It is a major maker of generics such as the ulcer medication cimetidine and atenolol for angina.
Despite the company's contention that its price increases were essential to stay in the market, some consumer groups and pharmacy groups have said the increases are inexplicable. Earlier this year two House Democrats, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Pete Stark of California, urged the commission to begin an inquiry.
"There is no question that the drug companies are systematically targeting these people, jacking up prices and hitting the elderly the hardest," said Mr. Berry, a former pharmacist. He said he had known of at least two people who died after they stopped taking drugs they could no longer afford.
The pharmacy industry has also complained to the Federal Trade Commission about the price increases.
"No one could understand why the products had gone up so precipitously," said Todd T. Dankmyer, a spokesman for the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents 25,000 independent pharmacists. Mr. Dankmyer said that after the association met with Mylan representatives earlier this year to discuss the price increases, "the explanations were never satisfactory."
Mr. Dankmyer said the association was told by Mylan that the new price rates still put their drugs at about 50 percent of the price of their brand-name equivalent, which was probably true.
"But before the price increases, it was probably 5 to 10 percent," he said. "Why they chose these products and why their prices went through the roof is an interesting question."

HEADLINE: JUMP IN NOVEMBER SENT WORK FORCE TO A RECORD HIGH

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
In the midst of a fresh wave of corporate downsizing announcements, the Government reported yesterday that more Americans are working than ever and that the overall economy continued to create jobs at a robust clip.
While corporate giants from Boeing to Johnson & Johnson are planning to lay off tens of thousands of employees because of various business difficulties, American employers expanded their payrolls by an estimated 267,000 workers in November, the Labor Department said. Unemployment fell to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent, coming close to the lowest rate in the last three decades. 
 The gain in jobs was the biggest in three months and matches the strong pace of the first half of the year. Moreover, job growth in September and October was bigger than had been previously reported.
"However many jobs were lost in November, even more were created," said Thomas Nardone, who is in charge of the employment numbers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Some 64.1 percent of all Americans of working age now have jobs, the highest percentage on record. And even though about 250,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost this year, American workers on average are earning 3.7 percent more than a year ago, a strong increase at a time when inflation has nearly vanished.
Despite the tightest labor market in decades -- the unemployment rate has been below 5 percent now for nearly a year and a half -- there is little evidence that rising wages are starting to push up prices.
While economic turmoil swirls outside the United States, prime-age workers -- those between the ages of 35 and 54, who are the breadwinners of millions of American families -- are enjoying the same low unemployment rate, 3 percent, as in the best of the Eisenhower years.
The strong labor market suggests that the economy, while expected to slow from the current brisk pace, has plenty of momentum to keep expanding next year. Wall Street cheered the report, seeing hints that company profits may improve next year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 136 points, closing above 9,000. The bond market, which often fears that a robust economy threatens to lift inflation, took the unexpectedly strong numbers largely in stride, pushing long-term interest rates up only slightly. Page C1.
The report appeared to dash any lingering hopes that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates again when it meets later this month for its final monetary policy session of the year.
So far this year, the economy has been growing at a 3.7 percent annual rate and adding an average of 226,000 jobs a month. The economy entered its 91st month of uninterrupted growth in December, suggesting that the current expansion will soon surpass the 92-month period of growth in the 1980's. It will beat the record 1960's expansion if growth continues for another year.
Not everything is rosy by any means. American manufacturers are struggling, and factory workers are losing jobs in large numbers. Manufacturers shed 47,000 jobs last month after eliminating 61,000 in October. But a roughly equal number of construction jobs were added in their place, and the service sector continued to race ahead.
"There's a spending-and-construction boom and a production bust," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
How can the total number of jobs grow so much when so many people appear to be losing theirs? The answer lies in the capitalist process of constant job destruction and job creation that the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed "creative destruction" as long ago as 1942. Even a large number of layoff announcements, expected to exceed 600,000 this year, pales in a economy that has added more than 19 million jobs this decade and currently employs about 132 million people.
In fact, numbers based on newspaper reports grossly understate the amount of job destruction. "Big layoff stories are the tip of the iceberg," said Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago's business school. Something like one in 10 jobs disappear in a typical year, research by Mr. Davis and others shows. That means roughly 13 million jobs vanished this year. Yet not only were all those jobs replaced, but several million more were created.
When unemployment is this low, workers to fill new jobs have to come from somewhere else. "If Boeing lays off 20,000 workers, we need them," said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business. Nearly one-third of small businesses surveyed last month reported having trouble filling job openings. "These are not hamburger-flipping jobs," Mr. Dunkelberg added.
Evidence that he is right comes from the rapid rise in average wages -- especially in real, inflation-adjusted terms -- for the last few years.
Of course, there is plenty of pain in manufacturing, which employs about 15 percent of the work force. American industry is being battered by a nasty combination of slowing capital investment at home, collapsing export markets abroad and surging imports, which depress prices and profits as well as cut into sales. A sharp 1.6 percent drop in factory orders in October portends further pain ahead.
Since last March, manufacturing payrolls have fallen by nearly a quarter of a million jobs as companies cut production and struggle to rein in costs. Not surprisingly, the cutbacks have been biggest in those industries that are most affected by foreign trade, including metal, transportation equipment, capital goods, clothing, textiles and electronics.
While manufacturing is in a slump, the rest of the economy is on a tear.
Retailers, gearing up for holiday sales, did lots of hiring, adding 65,000 more workers than they normally do at this time of year. Over the year, employment in this industry has risen by 457,000.
The boom in housing and a surge in heavy-construction projects added 47,000 new jobs as fewer than the usual numbers of carpenters, electricians and plumbers were laid off. The housing boom also spilled over into the finance industry, where most of the 10,000 new jobs were created among mortgage brokerage firms. The insurance and real estate industries added 5,000 and 7,000 positions, respectively.
Over the last 12 months, employment in construction has risen 310,000. "The housing market is going to set its third consecutive record this year," said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the biggest buyer of home mortgages.
As it has month after month, the sprawling service sector continued to power the job machine, adding 50,000 new jobs in November, the largest increase since May. Employment in business services rose by 55,000, including 30,000 management and engineering consultants. Private educational services added 15,000 jobs in the month, for a total gain of 54,000 since August. Employment in health services was up 14,000, with the largest increase in doctors' offices and clinics.
With labor markets this tight and job growth this robust, wages are rising briskly, but the pace of increase slowed slightly last month. Hourly earnings rose 3 cents in November, to $12.93.
Still, with workers producing more per hour, those wage gains are being largely offset by greater efficiency, easing the strains on companies that find it difficult, if not impossible, to raise prices. So, with that negligible inflation, pay increases are being translated into some of the best gains in real purchasing power in decades.

HEADLINE: Canada Agrees to Reduce Barriers Against U.S. Farm Products

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Moving to head off a border blockade by angry American farmers, Canada agreed today to lower barriers to farm exports from the United States but not to reduce its own shipments of meat and grain.
Under the agreement, reached after months of negotiations between Canadian and American trade and agriculture officials, Canada promised to let United States farmers export grain by rail more easily, to revise its health regulations on imported livestock, and to eliminate burdensome testing requirements for a wheat disease called karnal bunt. 
 A weakened Canadian currency has helped lower prices for Canadian grain and meat that have been pouring into United States markets for months, frustrating farmers in this country who have threatened to set up blockades at the border in the next few days. American wheat farmers temporarily held up shipments from Canada this summer, contending that the wheat was unfairly priced.
As the new deal was announced, farm leaders called for an end to the threat of a blockade. "Given the success of these negotiations, an imminent blockade of ports of entry is totally unwarranted," said Dean R. Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. "The last thing U.S. farmers can afford is an irresponsible action that would shut down, even temporarily, trade with one of our best customers."
And the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, commented, "This is a first step, but for American farmers and ranchers it is good news in a trying year."
Agriculture Minister Lyle Van Clief of Canada said, "I think both countries have had a victory." He praised American negotiators for taking "the path of trade enhancement and not trade restriction."
Canada and the United States are each other's largest trading partners. American officials said that in the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, this country shipped $7 billion of agricultural products to Canada and the Canadians exported $7.7 billion of goods to the United States. But in commodities like wheat, the imbalance was greater.
"It's been a lot easier for Canada to ship agricultural products to the United States than it's been for the United States to ship to Canada, which has caused great frustration among our farmers and ranchers," a senior Administration trade official said.
Dana Hauck, chairman of the international markets committee of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said, "We have Canada's attention," and he called for "continued aggressive action" from the Clinton Administration to lower Canadian trade barriers.
American growers have been faced with a spate of bad news. Asian nations, immersed in their own economic crises, can no longer afford to buy as much food as they had from the United States. At home, American farmers have had to contend with lower prices and supply gluts caused in part by the Canadian imports. Congress increased farm aid at the insistence of the Clinton Administration, but lawmakers from the Northern Plains states have said that their constituents continue to face an economic crisis.
"It would be our hope that farmers and governors and elected officials in this region would see that they now have a mechanism in place to address problems, and it's not just a lot of talk," the senior official said in a briefing for reporters.
But Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who has called for cuts in Canadian exports, termed the agreement an "illusion" and said that the United States should press a trade complaint.
Although the agreement did not restrict imports from Canada, it contained several provisions meant to make it easier for the United States to detect unfairly priced goods, especially wheat, American officials said.
The United States will begin to monitor imports of Canadian grain more closely, requiring Canadian shippers of wheat to provide more information to Customs.
Bill Flory, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said the new data would "lift the veil of secrecy" that has allowed the Canadian Wheat Board, a state trading enterprise, to sell more wheat in the United States. American farmers have complained for years that the board has used discriminatory pricing to penetrate American markets and undersell American grain abroad.
Canada also agreed to mmediately drop a requirement that hogs shipped live from the United States be held in quarantine for 30 days. The pork industry in the United States has been plagued by oversupply, driving prices to 18 1/2-year lows, and eliminating the quarantine should provide something of an escape valve for the surplus.
Donna Reifschneider, a hog producer from Illinois who is president of the National Pork Producers Council, praised that provision, saying that "the choice of sending hogs north will be very significant for certain producers, particularly in border states." But she said that she did not expect a significant number of hogs to be sent north right away, and added that about four million Canadian hogs, a fifth of Canada's supply, would be exported to the United States this year, adding to the backlog at meatpacking plants.
Canada also said it would expand agreements allowing cattle to be shipped north for fattening under less burdensome regulations than in the United States.

HEADLINE: No Banker's Holiday for Europe;
With a Jan. 4 Debut for the Euro, the Rush Is On

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: VERONA, Italy

 BODY:
The bank where Salvatore Bellu works is strongest in Italy's dynamic northern industrial belt, filled with mighty little multinationals, like Zanussi and Rex, washing machine makers in Sweden's big Electrolux appliance group. Come January, Electrolux is shifting its business to Europe's new single currency, the euro, and Zanussi and Rex are under orders to do likewise.
Even though Sweden will be outside the euro zone, Electrolux, by adopting the currency, expects to reduce costs and avoid having to hedge against currency fluctuations, all of which should pay off in increased competitiveness. 
 So if Electrolux wants to pay bills in euros, or transfer funds from one bank to another, Mr. Bellu's bank, Cariverona Banca S.p.A., will be ready to do so. For two years now, the bank has been throwing money and people at the task of getting ready for the euro, or risk seeing lucrative customers flee to better-prepared competitors.
Cariverona is caught in a rush that is reaching a crucial stage as the date for introducing the new currency, Jan. 4, nears, pitting bankers, software specialists and consultants against the guts of a banking system that serves 290 million Europeans.
If it works -- and major banks are reasonably sure it will -- Europe will take a further giant stride toward overcoming traditional economic fragmentation by operating under the umbrella of a uniform monetary policy on most of the old Continent.
 Indeed, by cutting short-term interest rates simultaneously on Thursday to a nearly uniform 3 percent, the central banks of the 11 nations that will join the euro essentially opened the door to the new era this week. Of the 15 countries in the European Union, three qualify but are staying out for now: Britain, Denmark and Sweden. Greece has not met the requirements. The participants are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
For starters, banks in the euro countries will be required by law to keep track of day-by-day operations -- deposits, withdrawals and the like -- in euros as well as the local currency, and to make all bank-to-bank transfers in the new single currency.
Regular reporting to national central banks, which will function under the new European Central Bank somewhat as regional Federal Reserve banks operate in the United States, must be in euros. And since securities markets like the stock exchanges in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan must operate in euros, the banks' brokerage units will have to be equipped for euro-denominated investments.
Thus, brokerage firms, banks and financial service companies, spurred in many cases by euro-prone customers, are racing to get ready. Most will use the long weekend in early January to fine-tune systems for the start of business on Monday, Jan. 4.
"Sure, there will be some problems," said Mr. Bellu, who has overseen his bank's drive to the euro, with a sigh of realism. "Monday, the 4th, will tell us if it works."
Christian Noyer, deputy chairman of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, said the central banking system appeared ready to go. "All the systems have been tested and re-tested," he said in a recent interview. "The worst has been imagined, along with the solutions."
Euro coins and bills will not be introduced until the end of 2001, but starting in January the marks and francs and lire in circulation will simply be fixed units of the new euro, the banking system's fundamental yardstick.
And since much commerce in Europe, as in most modern economies, is conducted without cash, hotels, department stores and most other consumer-oriented businesses are moving to list prices and take payment in both euros and local currencies.
American Express will offer credit card and banking services in euros and local currencies; in January, it will start selling euro traveler's checks in 21 countries, including the United States.
"Early indications are that large department stores and hotel chains are ready to price in euros and accept payment," said Keith Meyrick, spokesman for the traveler's check program in London.
For American travelers to Europe, the advantage is clear. With 11 European currencies locked together in the euro, euro traveler's checks will be exchangeable for all 11 currencies at a predictable rate, reducing the need to exchange dollars into local currencies along the way and thus the risk of losing money if the dollar-euro exchange rate shifts.
"Anyone who sees a competitive advantage in the euro will use euros," said Bruno Leresche, who heads the transition to the euro at Paribas, the big French financial services group.
The biggest question for bankers is the extent to which ordinary consumers will switch to euros. Will customers want bank accounts denominated in euros, or request monthly statements in both euros and local currencies? Partly, that will depend on how soon, say, employers begin transferring salaries to employees' bank accounts in euros, or how soon landlords require that rents be paid in euros.
Given their druthers, many customers do not appear eager to switch, bankers say. Recently, Paribas surveyed its private clients, and few even bothered to reply, Mr. Leresche said. Customers reacted, he said, as they do to a new model television set. "When I see my neighbor get one," he said in describing the common attitude, "I'll buy it."
Still, banks that want to be competitive are striving to be ready. They are tailoring computers and software to enable monthly statements to be issued in euros, or in a combination of euros and local currencies. Thus, a bank customer who regularly receives deposits on a French franc account in German marks and Spanish pesetas might request that monthly statements give the total euro amounts plus a breakdown into local currencies. Some banks are already gearing their computer software to be able to provide such information.
And well-prepared banks are trying to persuade customers to make the switch to euros sooner rather than later. Paribas, Mr. Leresche said, spent $71 million preparing. Come January, it will offer all services in French francs, euros or a combination of currencies. Over two years, Cariverona invested $8 million to overhaul 30,000 software applications, said Mr. Bellu, including some that prepare monthly statements and others for making interbank payments, and to train personnel to explain the benefits.
By the year 2002, Deutsche Bank will have spent $295 million for euro conversion, according to Victor Bruns, its euro project manager. He figures the bank has burned up "1,200 man-years" on the project. "We believe we will make it, but a switchover of this magnitude is a unique thing," he said.
The Gartner Group, the United States technology consultants, estimates that Europe's total investment between 1996 and 2002 to introduce the euro will be as much as $400 billion.
Experts agree that much has already been accomplished.
"It's been mostly a people and systems challenge, and over all, it's been very well met," said Keith Stock, head of A. T. Kearney's global financial institutions group in New York.
Given the costs, many banks are trying to kill two birds with one stone, eliminating the so-called Y2K millennium bugs from computers while preparing for the euro. Despite shortages of consultants and software experts that have driven up the cost of services, what makes the situation manageable, bankers say, is that not everything must be done at once.
Banks have concentrated efforts on absolute requirements, like interbank payments. Paribas's Mr. Leresche said French banks had done "virtual transfers" on recent weekends to test transfers among banks. The banks, he said, distinguish between fundamental snags in the system and those that simply make it slower or less efficient.
"There have been no fundamental bugs," he said, reflecting a widespread impression in other European countries.
What troubles bankers much more, however, is the euro's impact on their income, a problem not fixable with new software.
Earnings from foreign exchange, traditionally a lucrative source of profit, will dry up. Italy's banking association predicts that gross profits in the industry will drop an average 37 percent after the euro. Cariverona says it will shed 80 percent of its foreign exchange trading. Moreover, the fiscal belt-tightening required to qualify for the euro has led to lower interest rates, narrowing the spread between the relatively low interest banks pay on deposits and what they earn by reinvesting the deposited assets in high-yielding securities, like Government bonds, thus squeezing a second major source of bank income.
To offset this decline in traditional income sources, many banks hope to expand investment banking. But experts agree that the process will create many winners and losers, leading to further bank concentration.
In France, small rural banks with few corporate customers are moving more slowly than banks in Paris. In Italy, banks in the south, still struggling with losses accumulated in the early 1990's, are far from ready. Experts say most will be able to execute essential functions, like interbank transfers, but may not be prepared to offer customers extra services, like dual currency statements or other euro-denominated services.
Rome's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Government-owned bank whose executives have been getting it ready for an offering of shares on the stock market, will be ready to meet the requirements for the euro, but they have had little time to push a euro strategy much beyond that.
Often, small banks are under little pressure from corporate customers to change. "Among Italian small businesses, the degree of preparation is very low," said Angelo Peretti, an economist at Cariverona. They view the euro, he said, "mainly as an accounting and monetary problem, not as a strategic problem."
Earlier this year, General Motors' European unit told 15,000 suppliers across Europe, many of them small and medium-sized companies, that they should be ready by January to quote prices in euros. Hans De Vriese, director of cost management for G.M.'s European purchasing, said that 95 percent replied that they were ready to do so.
In Germany, big corporate customers have told Volkswagen that they want prices in euros as soon as possible. Beginning in January, VW will comply, and has passed the message to its suppliers. Brigitte Dietz, who heads VW's push to the euro, said the company hoped to switch from dollars and German marks as its operating currencies to the euro. Still, she said, "we won't force anyone."
Paradoxically, the very Governments that imposed the euro are the biggest obstacles to its wider use.
Earlier this year, Italy said its tax collecting and social security offices would not be ready to deal in euros until 2002; in Belgium and Germany, local and federal tax offices and benefits agencies have said the same. Thus, for internal accounting, VW will introduce the euro "at the latest possible date, in order to spare resources," Ms. Dietz said.
Moving sooner, she said, would mean "still having to do everything in German marks, and that would cost two to three times as much."

 BODY:
Talk about an offer you can't refuse. The one that Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut made to the owner of the New England Patriots to lure the football team to Hartford was so generous and encompassing as to put the recent sports giveaways in Tampa, Baltimore, St. Louis and Cleveland to shame.
The deal, which the State Legislature will consider Dec. 15 after a hearing next Wednesday, includes, at Connecticut's expense, a riverfront stadium for at least $280 million, $70 million to acquire and improve the site, $25 million to $100 million for environmental cleanup, land for a pavilion and hotel, a $15 million practice site, 26,000 parking spaces, $170 million in a fund for future improvements and assorted state guarantees. 
 In return, Robert Kraft, the team owner, would pay no rent for the 30-year life of the deal and keep all revenue from ticket sales, luxury suites, parking, concessions and so on. All told, Mr. Kraft's stadium income could be $100 million a year. The state would get only a 10 percent ticket tax.
With such an alluring offer, one might think that Mr. Kraft needed enticement. Far from it. The team's current home in Foxboro, Mass., is an hour from Boston and surrounded by inadequate access roads. The 1971 stadium has virtually none of the amenities or revenue-generating accouterments of newer parks. And Massachusetts and Boston have done little to try to keep the team.
So why did Governor Rowland have to cut the worst deal in the history of the National Football League? He didn't. But it is easy for small cities like Hartford to lapse into a bidding-war mentality where N.F.L. franchises are concerned, for two reasons.
First, far more than in other sports, the N.F.L. has extensive revenue sharing among its teams. Teams split all regular and post-season television revenue equally, as well as all licensing and sponsorship income. They also split 40 percent of net gate sales. As a result, the top revenue-making team in the N.F.L. might earn 50 percent more than the bottom team, while in baseball the top team earns three times as much as the lowest.
Second, an N.F.L. team plays only eight regular season home games a year. The Patriots in Hartford would have to sell only 680,000 seats (counting exhibition games) a year; a baseball team would have to sell about four million seats to sell out.
Thus the N.F.L. has dozens more cities ready to bid for its teams than other sports have, and it capitalizes on that dynamic. Public subsidies tend to be much larger in the N.F.L. than in other sports.
There is an argument for some public subsidies of stadiums. If nothing else, a sports team can build community pride.
If Connecticut believes that such benefits, largely intangible, warrant spending of $35 million to $65 million a year on debt service and other costs, then it should support Mr. Rowland. (The 10 percent ticket tax would generate $5 million to $7 million a year, but much of that would only replace sales tax money lost elsewhere in the state; the deal is decidedly not revenue neutral, despite claims by Mr. Rowland and a new Peat Marwick study.)
Connecticut, however, should not support the plan if it expects the Patriots to create jobs or raise per capita income. All experience with new stadiums and new teams suggests that the Patriots would not have a significant impact on the Connecticut economy. Indeed, Mr. Rowland's largesse portends either higher taxes or reduced services.
Hartford might enjoy a bit of a revitalization. But this would largely consist of shifting economic output toward Hartford and away from other parts of the state. In any case, if Hartford's welfare truly concerns the Governor, things like tax incentives for industry and increased spending on education would provide more bang for the buck.
If Connecticut legislators are determined to have a football team, they would do well to try to modify Mr. Rowland's deal. There is, for instance, no reason the state should guarantee $17.5 million of premium seat revenue annually. In other N.F.L. leases, any such guarantees are usually arranged through business associations.
That some legislators have begun to ask questions is a good sign. Connecticut has more leverage than Mr. Rowland thinks, and should use it.

 "As I am you despise me," Charles Brockden Brown wrote to a friend and ex-roommate on New Year's Day 1798. "How can I remove the burthen of your scorn but by transforming myself into a new being? . . . I shall die, as I have lived, a victim of perverse & incurable habits."
Brown's friends were used to his high-strung self-reproaches. The playwright William Dunlap called them "mysterious & unintelligible." Another friend, Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, heard them so often he lost patience. "What, my friend, is the meaning of all this?" Smith once demanded of Brown. "If you meant that we should understand you, why were you not explicit?" But it does not pay to be explicit -- not even to your friends -- when you are trying to get away with something. Brown was trying to get away with writing novels. And in the American Gothic style that he would pioneer, an air of mysterious criminality was a boon.
Charles Brockden Brown was born to a family of Philadelphia Quakers in 1771. Modern literary critics harp on the "Brockden," probably because three names sound grander than two, and because, at cocktail parties, it helps to distinguish him from Snoopy's friend. But Brown himself may not have been so fond of his middle name. He got it from his great-uncle Charles Brockden, whom Benjamin Franklin once described as "an eminent Scrivener or Conveyancer." The original Charles Brockden was a paralegal -- like Melville's Bartleby, though not as lowly. Brockden researched property titles and copied legal documents. Brown's father, too, worked as a conveyancer, after he had failed as a merchant. The family gave young Charles B. Brown an education so that he could become something better -- a lawyer proper. But inadvertently, that education introduced him to the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Samuel Richardson, who sowed in Brown a wish to use words even more freely and imperiously than lawyers do.
In the words of the critic Leslie Fiedler, Brown became "the inventor of the American writer." Brown was the first to live a myth that is still familiar, despite the Federalist-era particulars of his case. A young man with delicate health (consumption) and a strangely overkeen conscience (see the self-reproaches above) shirks a responsible career (law) to run off to New York City, where he camps out in the apartments of his radical friends (deists, vegetarians and anarchists) and risks his life (during a yellow fever epidemic) for no very good reason. After years of unemployed vagrancy, when everyone has given up on him, he writes masterly novels that earn him little money. He then gives up on art, marries, takes a steady job, and dies in relative obscurity.
Ordinarily, a Library of America edition compacts into one volume a career that spanned decades. But to publish three of Brown's novels at once approximates the pace at which he wrote them. In 1798, the year he burst forth, Brown wrote two and a half novels. By 1801, when he gave up fiction, he had written seven (one has been lost), as well as novel fragments and short stories.
In 1846, the transcendentalist Margaret Fuller called Brown one of "the dark masters," because it was Brown's genius to descend, precipitously, into the twisty maze of a lonely mind that was trying to think its way back to the light. Fuller also noted that Brown was something of a feminist, since he "usually placed this thinking royal mind in the body of a woman." Brown's "Alcuin" imagined a gender-neutral utopia and a critique of marriage based on William Godwin's anarchist philosophy. Unfortunately, this Library of America edition omits "Alcuin," as well as Brown's most woman-centered novel, "Ormond," whose heroine not only resists but stabs to death her would-be seducer, just moments before her girlfriend breaks down the door to save her. But the reader does get to meet Clara Wieland, the fierce protagonist of Brown's first published novel. As Kevin Williamson, the scriptwriter of "Scream," could tell you, as a rule horror heroines should be sturdy. If you think a character is braver than you are, it is easier to let your guard down and sympathize with her fear. Appropriately, the Clara of "Wieland" is strong, and she protects her boundaries. She lives alone, rather than with her brother's family, because she is "an economist of pleasure." To danger she is "habitually indifferent." The first time the Wieland family hear a voice they can't explain (they learn, much later, it's a ventriloquist's), her brother Theodore feels dread, but Clara feels only "a thrilling and not unpleasing solemnity." Clara obeys another law of horror scripts, too: she is so out of touch with her feelings that she has no idea whom she can trust -- and therefore, neither do we. Love, in Clara's narrowed eyes, is "a passion that will never rank me in the number of its eulogists." She also has the obligatory traumatic past: one night while praying, her father spontaneously combusted.
Clara is thoroughly modern. Ventriloquists, however, are no longer scary, which makes it hard to read "Wieland" today with the terror it deserves. When Clara addresses the villain Carwin, a young man who knows how to throw his voice, as "O most fatal and potent of mankind," 20th-century grown-ups may giggle. For an analogous modern threat, you would have to imagine someone who knows your credit card numbers, has broken into your E-mail account and has pocketed your cell phone. In the late 18th century, selfhood was not digitized, and the human voice had the burden of representing political agency, sexual reputation and financial integrity. You were only as good as your word, and words were supposed to give order to the world. It makes sense that an 18th-century set of words, the Constitution, should have balanced power so exquisitely as not to have toppled in 200 years. Corrupted by Godwin and Rousseau, Brown was experimenting with words that failed to give order, or words that called up the disorder of violent feelings.
When Clara unmasks Carwin, she shrieks that "he is able to speak where he is not." She could be accusing her villainous author and the suspect potential of his art. If voices can be split from their subjects, if stories can be made up, then it becomes impossible to know any social fact for sure. And so, in obedience to another rule of the horror genre, Clara blames the wrong person. Carwin the ventriloquist is no mastermind killer. He is just a piece of news: in the future, the media will be unreliable, striving for sensation rather than accuracy. Carwin is a geek. The real monster is someone else, whom this new contingency pushes over the edge.
Brown's writing can be clunky, almost as if he wants to call attention to the inadequacy of words to experience. For example, when Clara hears two voices in her closet debating whether to shoot or strangle her, she explains that "flight instantly suggested itself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous." A sentence like that is meant to take a little too long to read. It's the literary equivalent of the movie actor pausing to tie his shoes while the audience screams and the spree killer raises his ax.
Unlike ventriloquism, the peril in "Arthur Mervyn" is accessible to modern readers -- eerily so. A plague of yellow fever has descended on Philadelphia, poisoning society with distrust and fear, just as young Arthur arrives in the city to find his fortune. Arthur hires himself out as a scrivener, but in a plot twist that hints at Brown's distaste for the family business, the man Arthur copies for turns out to be a forger -- as well as an impostor, adulterer, thief and murderer. In an odd congruence, Arthur's panics, vigilance about secrets, imprudent idealizations and doubtful moral choices foreshadow uncannily the modern experiences of gay men who came to the metropolis in search of community, only to find an epidemic.
"Arthur Mervyn" may have the messiest plot that the Library of America has ever published. In Part 1, Chapter 23, for example, Arthur discovers in his master's attic something that "furnished matter which my curiosity devoured with unspeakable eagerness," but it is apparently too awful to share with the reader, who is hurried on to the next shock, a house of prostitution. Brown does not unravel his mysteries so much as distract you with new ones. Brown's first biographer complained of "this perpetual intrusion of novelty to explain a novelty." However, these disruptions in Brown's style -- the "ambiguities, abruptnesses and dark transitions," as he called them -- are Gothic effects. They are designed to unnerve and compel. Brown's plots have loose ends, but so do most nightmares. (The narrative logic of David Lynch's "Lost Highway" was not exactly airtight, either.) When Brown writes that all the men in the Mervyn family die before the age of 21, it may irk a close reader that Brown ends his novel, happy marriage and all, without either firing or unloading this Chekhovian rifle. But an omen would not be quite so frightening if you knew for sure it would come true.
There is a similar logic of distraction and dislocation at work in "Edgar Huntly." The book starts as a whodunit. Edgar wants to know who killed his friend Waldegrave. He spies on a man named Clithero, who has the guilty habit of digging up and reburying a box while he sleepwalks. Soon Edgar is chasing Clithero through a jagged and confusing limestone landscape in Pennsylvania, then sleepwalking himself, then slaughtering cougars, then slaughtering Native Americans -- and we never find out who killed Waldegrave. Brown's fugue feels genuine, nonetheless. There is nothing aimless about Edgar's path from mourning to obsession to violence. It may have been the path of Brown's own mind, as he tried to mourn his friend Elihu Hubbard Smith. A sort of junior Ben Franklin, Smith had provided the intellectual spark that ignited Brown's fit of creativity. He supported Brown through his fallow years, spiritually and financially, but then died of yellow fever halfway through the writing of "Arthur Mervyn." Like Waldegrave in "Edgar Huntly," Smith left behind a cache of letters full of his troubling, radical ideas. In Federalist America, that was not an easy legacy to inherit, and Brown, like Edgar Huntly, survived it by making a violent break.
"Edgar Huntly" was Brown's last Gothic novel. One of his brothers suggested that readers disliked his books' gloom. Since Brown was impatient to earn a living as a writer, he decided that this was "a sufficient reason for dropping the doleful tone and assuming a cheerful one." Unintentionally, Brown's cheerful tone was even more gruesome, and he soon dropped fiction altogether. He should have persisted in gloom, which would eventually earn a commercial reward that outran the avarice of his most flagitious villains. Though he did not realize it, during his brief, doleful career Brown succeeded in infecting America with his perverse and incurable taste. The nation has been horrified ever since.

HEADLINE: Editors' Choice

 BODY:
THE best books of 1998, chosen by the eight editors of the Book Review from 25 initial nominees, are three novels, two collections of stories, three biographies, a scientific tour d'horizon and two books about slaughter -- one concerning diplomacy to end it in the Balkans and another asking why it happened and no one tried to stop it in Africa.
At first glance it might seem the editors are habit-bound. There were also 11 books on the 1997 list, by four women and seven men -- and this year's 11 are by four women and seven men. Last year, however, six of the writers had appeared on these lists previously. This year only two are repeaters, a biographer of Victor Hugo and a Canadian fiction writer making the list for the sixth time in 15 years. And one of the books here is its author's first -- a fairly rare occurrence. All the fiction writers are North Americans; the nonfiction authors are three Americans and three Britons. 
 There is no history in the lot. That is unusual. But the biographies contain a great deal of it, our reviewer called one novel a personalizing of history, and the volume of science is a biological history recounting four billion years. One biographer has a passion for his subject's warts and poetry, but the two others exhibit tendencies that may signal a sea change in our mores: the life of a robber baron is eminently evenhanded and does not try to incite mobs against him, and the life of a painter does not peek once into the artist's bedroom. What is going on? Do these writers not know this is the year of the Starr report?
The boss's 1997 decree that editors' discussions must be civil held this year, with a vengeance: everyone found flattering things to say about every book nominated. The result was that the boss expressed surprise that the majority did not make the cut when we voted. Is that remark the first sound of the crumbling of civility? Sweeter than a nightingale's song it was.
Certain types of books, like letters and diaries, are not eligible for nomination. It was not a remarkable year for them in any case, although last month did see publication of "I Will Bear Witness," the disturbing diary of Victor Klemperer, a Jewish-born German academician during the Nazi years.
The best books are chosen from among those reviewed here since last year's Holiday Books issue, and the summaries below are generally drawn from the reviews. They are not included among Notable Books of 1998, the list of which begins on page 65.
 
BIRDS OF AMERICA
 Stories.
 By Lorrie Moore.
 Alfred A. Knopf.
The two epigraphs of Lorrie Moore's third volume of short stories are taken from poems on birds -- one by Amy Clampitt questioning whether their songs mean anything and another by Charlie Smith musing that grief cannot be translated into any comprehensible language. Moore bypasses translating emotions. She uses her fluid, colloquial sentences and her mordant wit to pry the feelings of her characters loose inside the readers, where they resist articulation and make us sense the depth of the predicaments that most of her protagonists, usually women, fail to extricate themselves from. The story is Moore's natural scale, and the best in this collection, especially the last three, are stellar performances. They all concern cancer -- the whole book is a probing of mortality -- but even the most overpowering of them, the already famous "People Like That Are the Only People Here," has a kind of steady hilarity amid its sublime darkness. Moore, like Samuel Beckett, sees that nothing is funnier than unhappiness. Her precise observation of characters' horror, or suffering, is often delivered in prose that extorts laughter, and the mirth is a jolt when it bursts out. Here is a measure of her mastery: in a reverie, a mother discovers that despair over her baby's cancer has deprived her of once formidable gifts of expression, and her search for words to define her grief becomes a satire of Moore's own writing. Now that is confidence, and it is fully justified.
 
CLOUDSPLITTER
 By Russell Banks.
 Harper Flamingo.
How do you survive upbringing by a fanatical prophet? You don't. That is the story in Russell Banks's huge novel about the abolitionist John Brown, whose 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry was one of the fuses that detonated the Civil War. Banks seems to take his cue from the assertion by some modern historians that history is not an account of what happened but of what people think happened. This domestic drama is told early in this century, nearly 50 years after Harpers Ferry, by Brown's son Owen, a spiritual tag-along to his father. Slowly, deliberately -- the storytelling often assumes the leisure of timelessness -- Owen draws a magnificent picture of the older Brown as an unmoved mover, a man of giant ambitions whose biblical learning makes him eerily worldly; his absolute righteousness is a religious mystery, not a neurosis, but a mystery that still brings madness and death to his children and pain to some escaped slaves for whom he is ready to kill if need be. Next to him Owen appears emptier page by page; he knows he died with his father on the scaffold. Banks's analysis is moral, not psychological. The result is that the closer John Brown gets, the more he too appears a ruin -- drawn by Piranesi, to be sure -- scorched and gutted by the purity of his vision. Fittingly, Banks brings the whole world to witness Brown's fate: revolutions, the fall of empires, the grandeur of the earth; indeed, the American landscape is virtually a character, heralded by the book's title, the name of a mountain.
 
LIFE
 A Natural History of the First
 Four Billion Years of Life on Earth.
 By Richard Fortey.
 Alfred A. Knopf.
At last a book that puts dinosaurs in their place -- and it turns out to be a niche. Dinomania has nearly blinded the public to the reality of evolution. But Richard Fortey, a British paleontologist with an extensive range of humane learning and a gift for arresting language, gives a coherent account of the biological history of earth for four billion years, surprisingly the first popular but authoritative one written by a professional. This is no boring slog, but an adventure -- one comes away with a reverence for the courage of the students of fossils -- in which we meet weird creatures like rats as big as bears, dragonflies as big as people, carnivorous kangaroos, poisonous sea octopods and shell-crushing clams. Fortey does not present evolution as warfare, but at times the development of species does look like an arms race. In his words the evolution of whales from land animals is as dramatic as some paleontological expeditions he describes. He decries the mutation of natural history museums into entertainment palaces, but his book has plenty of entertainment in the form of digressions, literary excursions and surprising analogies -- enough to irritate some readers. However, it is a survey of the facts of life that reliably summarizes state-of-the-art knowledge from many sciences, and it is written for readers with no science. It will help them understand the specialized and often technical books on evolution that make headlines but leave most people wondering why.
 
THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN
 Stories.
 By Alice Munro.
 Alfred A. Knopf.
Alice Munro is, in Virginia Woolf's phrase, one of the few writers "for grown-up people." Retrospection has always been important in her work, but never has she been quite this autumnal, acting as the mediator between the way people lived around 1960, when all but one of these eight stories begin, and the way we live now. She has an uncanny ability to make a reader realize that people really think differently in different eras and that morals may shift more quickly than customs. The price can be, as she puts it in a story about a woman who leaves her family to be with her new lover, a pain she will have to get used to until it is "only the past she's grieving for and not any possible present." Her stories were always long, and now they grow longer. The title story -- an extraordinary accomplishment even by Munro's soaring standards -- is really a novella. Also, her conclusions have become ever more open, without being inconclusive. A woman who thinks she knows a quiet man's secret about a drowning death suddenly sees that she faces "an entirely different possibility" from the one that had grounded her until now -- her life will harden into a form unimagined before. The large, enigmatic quality of this ending is reflected in the other stories; they never end where we expect them to and never take a turn without pain. They are like life, but trying to detect their shifts in time or point of view is as difficult as trying to remember where a change came in one's own life that put one in another world altogether.
 
THE POISONWOOD BIBLE
 By Barbara Kingsolver.
 Harper Flamingo.
Zeal is mere termite food in Barbara Kingsolver's novel about a white American clergyman's religious mission to the Congo in 1959. At least ostensibly, this is Nathan Price's story. But it is told by his wife, Orleanna, recollecting years later on an island in Georgia, and her daughters, writing in Africa -- an epistolary novel from places so remote the letters might have been sent to sea in bottles. The picture of Price is merciless; Kingsolver implies that his story is only the one men always tell. There is a load of political message here, but ultimately this is a novel of character; the women discover themselves as they lose faith in Price and find another one, each according to her kind. The tone of Orleanna's reminiscences is ironic, and Kingsolver's use of her unconscious dissembling to reveal her pain is masterly; the mother confides in Ruth May, her baby, the catalyst for breaking up the family, and there is wisdom in every sentence. Rachel, the first daughter, is the brainless soul of American materialism. A younger sister, Adah, is hemiplegic, limping and nearly speechless, but a verbal gymnast whose wit sets fire to her diary and lights up the true nature of anyone she notices. Her twin, Leah, is the conscience of the novel, always measuring the distance she has to go before she is worthy of Africa. Perhaps the greatest character is collective, the Congolese, whose perfect adaptation to the harshness of their lives amid drought, hunger, pests and diseases is simply beautiful. Their rejection of American salvation feels triumphant.
 
PRESTON FALLS
 By David Gates.
 Alfred A. Knopf.
Boomers go bust in this scary novel, the whole generation of them. Doug Willis is a New York public relations executive, and his wife, Jean, a successful designer; they live in Westchester County and own an old getaway house upstate. He is a maelstrom of male vanity whose obsessive irony has left him with little but a withering reflexive consciousness and the cynicism he hopes will prevent him from going missing in the middle of life. Jean's form of denial is keeping up an illusion of normality no matter what happens; she is no wiser than he is, but she is nicer. She's also nicer than their two children. When Willis takes two months off to work on the old house, a family fight on the first weekend lands him in jail, and the lawyer who springs him turns out to be a drug trafficker who brings Willis into the trade. Briefly the dope is a whiff of youth, but then Willis, in a panic about what he is doing, flees the country life without telling Jean where he's going. From there till the end of the novel the suspense about his fate is brilliantly maintained. David Gates has a superb reporter's precision, an analyst's ear, a teen-ager's glee in exposing deception and a moralist's eye that is as unforgiving as Evelyn Waugh's. Here the entire culture is deception, and as these characters betray themselves ever deeper into it, the very possibility of trust, of reliable understanding, is worn away. A reader ends up wary of looking at the book again once he's finished -- because anything could happen and whatever does is likely to be irremediable.
 
TITAN
 The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
 By Ron Chernow.
 Random House.
"Oh, John D., we hardly knew ye." Sorry. It is not that Ron Chernow unearths so much new information about John D. Rockefeller in this biography, but his dispassionate portrait places the man in so rich a context that we understand how he gathered more economic power into his hands than anyone before or since, and, to a large extent, we know why he did it. As we recognize the intelligence, courage and vision of the man, his rapacity and cunning become more alarming,
not less. Chernow catches the early Rockefeller better than anyone has -- the quick-witted young man who had developed by the time he was 30 all the principles and techniques of his business life. With mischievous humor Chernow points out that his analysis of the American economy was Marxist, and he chose to solve its problems with monopoly. The Government finally broke the monopoly, but Rockefeller's organization of Standard Oil has been the model of global business ever since, and the company's reach and power taught the Government the vulnerability of the economy to manipulation and the need for regulation. Finally, we see that underlying all his achievements and philanthropies was a deep religious commitment that was shared by his wife. It shaped them, their family and, through the philanthropies, many religious, educational and social institutions.
 
TO END A WAR
 By Richard Holbrooke.
 Random House.
Diplomacy is the grungiest job, if one judges from Richard Holbrooke's account of the negotiations he led in 1995 to end years of war in Bosnia. But it must be satisfying, because this enthralling book is also a heartfelt call to America to use its power when societies break down and to become a steady global force resisting human rights abuses everywhere. It is filled with anecdotes and sharp pictures of the wily Balkan leaders Holbrooke had to deal with, as well as with shrewd and seldom flattering analyses of the personalities and motivations of timid American and NATO military commanders. Foreign diplomats who complain that Holbrooke is a bulldozer in the polite corridors of international politics may be right, but few could complain that he is gutless. His re-creations of battles over principle and tactics with Western generals and State Department and White House officials are dramatic, and his description of a rudderless Administration during the early days of his efforts is astonishingly candid, and convincing. It is telling that the decision to use heavy air strikes to bring the Serbs to the bargaining table was not a careful calculation but an act of desperation. His combativeness may offend the pinstripe set, but it is wonderfully refreshing on the page; it is a very rare book on diplomacy that makes you feel you were in the midst of it, and excited to be there.
 
THE UNKNOWN MATISSE
 A Life of Henri Matisse:
 The Early Years, 1869-1908.
 By Hilary Spurling.
 Alfred A. Knopf.
Can this be a biography? It says next to nothing about Matisse's sex life. More than half the population has lived its adult life thinking biography means sex, but here if there's a mistress, well, she's glimpsed in our passing among canvases, but we look at them, not her. In fact, it is a smashing good biography, this first volume taking us up to the painter's 40th year -- Matisse before he was Matisse. Hilary Spurling's role is advocate, and she is a formidable one. Her heroic research pays off; her sense of the time and place, of Matisse's family and friends and competitors, of the old teachers and Young Turks in the French art world, is admirable. We are swept into all-night arguments among aspiring artists about what art is, and into their dreams and prospects. We even fear for Matisse -- will he ever find his style? The tentativeness of his career is pointed up by the deaths or despair of contemporaries who were his equals in art and by his failure into middle age to gain a public. A painter's development is both an intimate and an open transaction, and Spurling makes us feel its peril. By the end of this volume, although Matisse is still largely unknown as an artist, it is clear that having nothing to lose is increasingly a spur to his creativity, and one begins to sense that the next door he opens may be the last he has to.
 
VICTOR HUGO
 By Graham Robb.
 W. W. Norton & Company.
What a life! By the time he was 30, Victor Hugo had witnessed Napoleon's Iberian campaigns and seen his fall; his poetry had made him the lion of Paris, and his drama had touched off street battles. He was elected to the French Academy and the Senate before he started a steady march to the left that made him a political force in the revolutionary period from 1848 to 1851, and he became a national hero when, in exile, he led opposition to Napoleon III for two decades. When he died in 1885, at 83, his funeral drew two million people. His huge body of work in every genre has saturated the French language with his expression. Even in life he disappeared in a cloud of myths he created -- tribune of the republic, the arch-romantic, the lifelong womanizer. Graham Robb penetrates the myths and exposes the hidden impulses and hurts that gave rise to them, and he has deep sympathy for the women, many of them victims, who flocked around Hugo. His enthusiasm for Hugo's writing is infectious, and we share his annoyance that there is no good modern English translation of any of it. He tells us to put down his book and read "Les Miserables." Read both. Hugo lifts spirits. Robb will open your mind and heart. His is the best biography of Hugo in English and probably the best single-volume one in any language.
 
WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT
 TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED
 WITH OUR FAMILIES
 Stories From Rwanda.
 By Philip Gourevitch.
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
In 1994 the Government of Rwanda called on everyone in the Hutu majority of the country to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. In 100 days 800,000 people were killed, most of them individually cut down with knives. The daily killing rate exceeded that of the Nazi Holocaust, and the deed was done mostly not by trained cadres but by neighbors, co-workers, even family members. In the years since, Philip Gourevitch, a New Yorker writer, has talked to survivors, witnesses and participants to discover the origins and personal motives for this collective crime. His grim book -- it is his first -- lays a burden on the world's conscience. This genocidal crime now has faces, names, personal psychologies. As we encounter people involved in the massacre, we cannot pull back from looking into their souls, and our own. As the title -- taken from a letter by seven Christian pastors to their religious leader -- indicates, there were warnings. Those given to international agencies, especially the United Nations, make dismal reading. And American policy, which encouraged the United Nations to stay out of internal conflicts, is sickening in retrospect. The history of Belgian, French and British racism in colonial times bears on the massacres too. Gourevitch withholds judgments, but his restraint gives his book a subtle, subterranean power.

HOT SEAT
 Theater Criticism for
 The New York Times, 1980-1993.
 By Frank Rich.
 Illustrated. 1,050 pp. New York:
 Random House. $39.95. 
 Critics -- especially theater critics -- must expect to be hated. The wiser among them even enjoy the contempt, for they understand their colorful and essential role as villains in the larger drama of the theatrical enterprise.
Few drama critics have inspired more fear, loathing and indignation, however, than Frank Rich, the legendary "Butcher of Broadway." From 1980 to 1993, Rich served as the chief drama critic for The New York Times. Now, in the aptly titled "Hot Seat," he has assembled approximately one-quarter of the reviews and essays he delivered from that bully pulpit, formerly occupied by Alexander Woolcott, Brooks Atkinson and Walter Kerr. Equipped with an introduction, some hindsight, some insider gossip and a few amusing "best" and "worst" lists, the result is an exuberant, enthralling and wistful volume no less valuable as social-economic-political history than as a definitive chronicle of the era's theatrical activity.
Rich sooner or later incurred the wrath of almost everyone he wrote about. He was denounced repeatedly from the stage at the Tony Awards. Directors, producers and actors regularly accused him of single-handedly closing their shows. The producer David Merrick even called Rich "a savage dog" on "60 Minutes."
In "Exit the Critic," published as a valedictory in The New York Times Magazine in early 1994 and anthologized here, Rich expresses a wry amusement at the furious passions his reviews used to unleash: "Critics may not be, as is generally presumed, frustrated actors or playwrights, but few of us mind playing our assigned role in the timeless sideshows of the rialto." Elsewhere, he muses that the virulence of the hatred directed at his strong opinions was directly proportionate to the theater's growing inability to compete with television and film for mainstream American audiences, performers and writers. To blame Frank Rich was far easier than to confront the unpleasant fact that many, if not most, of the seats in the dwindling number of Broadway theaters were being filled by foreign tourists barely fluent in English but happy to pay the ever-increasing ticket prices for shows with mountains of scenery and deafening miking.
In "Hot Seat," Rich is eager to debunk the myth of his and The Times's omnipotence. Obviously, the crowds didn't stay away because of his lukewarm response to "Cats" ("If you blink, you'll miss the plot") and most of the other blockbusters by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Nor did his praise of high-minded productions like "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" keep them open. Rich cites further examples in lists like "The Power of The Times Revisited 1: Rave Reviews, Short Broadway Runs."
Whatever you think about Rich's opinions, there's no denying that he's an impressive writer and thinker. Residing in New York for much of the period, I turned eagerly each morning to his artfully fashioned pieces, anticipating another good column and at least a few laughs. Rereading them now, I have been happily reliving the sights, smells, sounds and words of many wonderful, and some god-awful, evenings in the theater and experiencing others that I missed.
Who was better at the lethal apercu than Frank Rich?
"Had the actor Philip Casnoff not been beaned by a falling slab of scenery at a press preview last week, 'Shogun: The Musical' might have been best remembered as the first Broadway musical extravaganza to beguile an audience with a song about a dildo."
"Capped Teeth and Caesar Salad," a song from "Song & Dance," starring Bernadette Peters, "recycles Beverly Hills jokes that had seen better days when Joan Rivers was still in college."
It's only fair, too, to remember the conditions under which Rich labored. Writing on deadline with impatient editors breathing down his neck, he still managed to construct apparently seamless miniature essays. As an occasional critic myself, I tell you this takes talent, discipline and nerves.
There was much more to Rich's success than nasty quips and one-liners. If anything, the sting of his reviews has faded with time, and what remains behind are different, more enduring qualities: a thorough historical and artistic knowledge of American and British theatrical tradition; an encyclopedic familiarity with the work of a wide variety of performers, directors and playwrights currently active in the theater; and an infectious passion for this evanescent and impossible medium.
Not surprisingly, the "330-odd pieces" collected here tend to favor shows the critic enjoyed (almost anything by Stephen Sondheim) or judged significant artistically ("House of Blue Leaves," "M. Butterfly," "Cinders") or commercially ("Cats," "Phantom of the Opera"). But Rich has also been careful to include famous bombs. For him, nothing will top the notorious "Moose Murders": "A visit to 'Moose Murders' is what will separate the connoisseurs of Broadway disaster from mere dilettantes for many moons to come."
As engrossing as the reviews themselves may be, the juiciest parts of "Hot Seat" are the spicy italicized postscripts sprinkled here and there. These include sobering "Whatever happened to . . .?" vignettes, as well as dishy tales of backstage intrigue. At the end of his largely favorable notice on the revival of "The King and I" with Yul Brynner, Rich relates how the imperious star ("not an easy guy") demanded to be transported by motorcade the few blocks from the theater to an appearance on "Nightline." To the review of the revival of "The Front Page," staged by Jerry Zaks, that finally brought the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center back to life in 1986 he appends a well-informed commentary on why thrust stages like the one at the Beaumont proved so unsuccessful wherever they were built.
While no one will mistake "Hot Seat" for a novel, it contains numerous narrative strands. Probably the most important, and most poignant, are the story of AIDS and the arrival of numerous gay characters in plays and musicals both on and Off Broadway.
News of the strange new epidemic hit the Times just as Rich began his tenure there. One of the first AIDS play he saw was William Hoffman's "As Is" in 1985. To his credit, Rich got out front early on the issue, and reviewed (for the most part favorably) the growing number of AIDS plays that appeared in the coming years, from Larry Kramer's "Normal Heart" (which he admits he at first undervalued) to Richard Greenberg's "Eastern Standard" (an overlooked minor masterpiece, I agree) to Tony Kushner's "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches" and "Angels in America: Perestroika." That Rich chooses to end the final season in "Hot Seat" with his adoring, even transcendent, review of "Perestroika" shows just how highly he rates Kushner's emotional and artistic achievement.
Remembered here, too, are the numerous important theater people lost to AIDS: among them, the playwrights Scott McPherson and Harry Kondoleon; the choreographer Michael Bennett; and Charles Ludlam, the wild and wildly gifted director of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. In a wise and humane 1992 Sunday essay, Rich describes how he took his two sons (then aged 12 and 8) to see the gay musical "Falsettos." "I wanted to take my children to an entertainment, a musical no less, that reinforces the notion that there are many ways to be masculine."
In retrospect, this essay ("Discovering Family Values at 'Falsettos' "), not dissimilar to the pieces Rich now produces for the Times Op-Ed page, marked the beginning of his transition to another kind of writing. As he tells it in "Exit the Critic," the incessant attacks on his personal and professional integrity began to wear him down. The disappearance of serious musicals and dramas from Broadway, and the vastly changed economics of producing and ticket prices, depressed him. But the last straw was the deaths of his mother and the visionary New York producer Joseph Papp, founder of the Public Theater. The joy had gone out of the work. "I found myself more interested in writing about the world itself rather than just the theater's vision of that world." It was time to move on.
When the playwright Herb Gardner received the Tony Award for Best Play for "I'm Not Rappaport" more than 12 years ago, he bragged to the audience that his success showed that "there's life after Frank Rich." Judging by this vibrant, eloquent and often moving collection, the same can be said for Frank Rich himself.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Colorado Resorts Get An International Accent

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VAIL, Colo.

 BODY:
DEEP in the nation's heartland, the Colorado Rockies are 1,000 miles from the nearest seaport. But jet travel, satellite television and foreign-language Web sites are quickly integrating America's most popular skiing state into the world tourism economy.
This winter, foreign skiers are expected to buy 10 percent of lift tickets at Colorado ski areas, triple their share of a decade ago. Last winter at Vail and Breckenridge, the nation's two busiest ski areas, foreign skiers bought about 15 percent of tickets sold. At Aspen, the most international of Colorado's resorts, foreigners accounted for 21 percent of ticket sales. 
 The number of lift tickets sold to Americans has been more or less flat for the last decade, so Colorado resorts believe their biggest future growth will be international. This winter, the foreign invasion will be fueled by two new factors. In September, British Airways inaugurated a daily nonstop flight between Gatwick Airport outside London and Denver International Airport. This restored a trans-Atlantic link that was lost five years ago when Continental dropped the service.
"Last year, Britain was our third biggest market, after Colorado and Texas," said Jim Felton, spokesman for Breckenridge, a resort that sold 1.3 million lift tickets over all last winter. "The British Airways flight should keep that momentum going."
Vail's international visibility should grow in February, when the resort and Beaver Creek will host the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships. In 1989, the last time Vail had that honor, the television audience outside the United States was estimated at 300 million people. This winter, with the spread of cable and satellite TV through Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, the foreign audience is expected to be 500 million.
"The 1989 championships truly put the Vail valley on the international map," said John Dakin, spokesman for the nonprofit Vail Valley Foundation, which is organizing the races. "In 1989, Europe was having a snow drought. European viewers were seeing their correspondents standing waist deep in Vail's snow and saying the men's alpine had been canceled because of too much snow."
This winter, the races will be held from Jan. 30 through Feb. 14. "Vail is going to become one giant TV studio, constantly selling how great the skiing is here," said Bruce Mainzer, head of marketing for Vail Resorts, which owns Vail, Breckenridge, Beaver Creek and Keystone ski areas.
The arson fires atop Vail in October, claimed by environmentalists angry over Vail's addition of new ski trails, are not expected to have much impact on foreign visits this winter, said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade group. Three buildings were destroyed and four chairlifts damaged; the lifts are expected to reopen by January.
"The facts seem to have come through fairly accurately, people seem to realize that the Vail experience has not been impacted," Mr. Frew said in a telephone interview from London, where he was the host for ski-promotion events at a travel trade fair. "Out of 500 questions I answered, two were about the Vail fires." He added that he had not heard of any cancellations because of the fires.
Mr. Frew, who was on his third promotional trip to London this year, said that economics are dictating Colorado's pursuit of the foreign skier. His research indicates that foreign skiers stay longer and spend more than American skiers: The average skier from the Denver area spends $49 a day, the average out-of-state skier spends $150 a day, and the average foreign skier spends $300 a day.
While Aspen aims to sell one quarter of its tickets to foreigners by the year 2000, marketers at Colorado's lesser-known ski areas have also caught the foreign bug. Copper Mountain has reservationists that speak Japanese, German and Spanish. Skiers in Australia, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand can now call a toll-free international number and speak in their own language to a reservationist at the Rocky Mountain resort. Silver Creek, a small Brazilian-owned resort, has hired an international marketing manager and is organizing ski trips from Brazilian cities such as Brasilia and Belo Horizonte. Itiro Takahashi, the marketing director and one of 20 Brazilians who will work at Silver Creek this winter, said: "We are promoting easy slopes, a resort where no one gets lost, the possibility of shopping trips on the side."
Skiers from Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires tend to go to Aspen, while skiers from Mexico tend to favor Vail. To cater to this market, Elena Campa is publishing this month a 64-page Spanish-language guide to Vail and a 48-page guide in Spanish and Portuguese to Aspen.
On her bilingual Spanish-Portuguese Web site for Latins planning Colorado ski vacations, www.andandocolorado.com, "we are averaging 6,000 hits a month," Ms. Campa said. With traffic heavy to advertisers through the site's links, she said that many Vail and Aspen companies are now having their own Web sites translated into Spanish.

HEADLINE: A Shifting American Landscape;
In the Heartland, A Cornucopia Of Culture

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
WHEN Richard Nixon asked, "Will it play in Peoria?" he was taking the nation's temperature, checking on the predilections of mainstream citizens. But he was also reviving an adage from the early part of the century, when this city was a center of whisky production and an active vaudeville circuit stop, and the farm folks were renowned as a particularly dour and tough-to-please audience.
When I echoed the question last month -- what I actually said was: "So what plays in Peoria?" -- the occasion was a round-table discussion, organized at the request of The New York Times, among representatives of local arts groups. The subject was the health of the arts in this conservative heartland city of 113,000 people on the Illinois River. And it was with the emblematic history of Peoria in mind. 
 "We wondered how long it would take you to ask," said the Mayor, Bud Grieves. "We get that a lot."
Best known today, perhaps, as the headquarters of Caterpillar Inc., the heavy- equipment manufacturers, Peoria, a three-hour drive southwest of Chicago, has exported a healthy regiment of cultural troops: the comedians Richard Pryor and Sam Kinison, the pop singer Dan Fogelberg and the actors Susan Dey and Tom Irwin, not to mention Betty Friedan. But even with them long removed -- and casting aside the gimmickry of my journalistic conceit -- the city still serves as an adequate emblem of the nation's cultural health. Which is to say, there is a lot more going on than you might expect.
The Mayor had joined officials from the Peoria Symphony, the Peoria Players Theater, the Peoria Ballet, Opera Illinois and a dozen or so others on the second floor of a once-abandoned warehouse on the city's developing riverfront that a young entrepreneur has successfully transformed into a dinner theater.
Mostly, they wanted to brag on themselves, with some reason. All the nonprofits at the table, even the opera, were at least breaking even. That week, the city-owned Peoria Civic Center was presenting the music of both Gustav Mahler and Motley Crue. The Peoria Arts Guild, which exhibits the work of regional artists and each summer sponsors an art fair that attracts thousands of visitors, was preparing to move, with the help of a $1 million gift from a local patron, to a new building near the river, one more addition to what is becoming a bona fide cultural district.
The schools have maintained a modest budget for arts instruction. And as Mayor Grieves pointed out, for 60 years the citizenry has upheld, through a referendum, a tax to support twice-weekly summer concerts by the Peoria Municipal Band.
That, of course, is not the whole story; there is much that doesn't play in Peoria. But it is worthwhile to pause here and consider the good news, because in the continuing public discourse about the state of the nation's cultural life, the good news doesn't seem be heard much.
Instead, mostly because of the well-publicized struggle of the National Endowment for the Arts to remain alive and viable, it seems fair to say the prevailing perception is that the arts in America are suffering, that the nation's cultural life has diminished, that the artistic side of the American character is undernourished. The endowment had its budget reduced by Congress from $176 million in 1992 to the current $98 million, and, even though its Congressional support seems to have stabilized in recent months, its role as grantmaker has been decried by conservatives because of its support for a handful of controversial projects.
IN fact, in its own report on the state of the arts in this country, "American Canvas," the endowment sounded an ominous note, describing the arts as undersupported by the public, and the arts community as insufficiently engaged with society as a whole.
That report was released 14 months ago, about the same time this newspaper gave me the assignment to travel the country and write about the arts as they are practiced and appreciated outside New York. In that time, I have visited 40 cities, my own personal American canvas, and my impression is that far from being dormant or in retreat, the arts, on balance, are edifyingly, thrillingly abloom. Virtually everywhere. The quantity of activity in any given community has surprised me almost every time, and more often than not I was surprised by its quality as well.
Who would have suspected that in Bozeman, Mont., a city of 35,000 people, there are some 75 arts organizations? Or for that matter, that in Peoria and its surrounding counties there are more than 50, including an orchestra, now in its 101st season, that is the 15th-oldest in the United States and that drew some 1,500 people to hear Mahler's Fourth Symphony last month, its tricky, exposed solos in the middle movements handled with delicacy by the horns and woodwinds.
Frequently, I would visit a place to see something or someone specific, and while there come upon a trail of breadcrumbs leading irresistibly to something or someone else. In El Paso, I found a Chicano artists cooperative, painters, sculptors and musicians squatting -- with permission -- in the shell of an old furniture store, enlivening a struggling neighborhood. During a visit to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, I was introduced, by Richard Flood, the chief curator there, to Christi Atkinson, who runs No Name Exhibitions, a group of more than 100 local artists in the midst of renovating an old soap factory. The building was only partly spiffed up; it might be 10 years before the renovation is complete, Ms. Atkinson said. But already artists were working in studios, and several shows had been mounted, even though the place doesn't have heat yet.
I never thought to find -- who would? -- an amateur production of "The Marriage of Figaro" in the woods of mid-coast Maine. Nor did I expect a riverfront concert in Des Moines by the Kabbalas, an Iowa-based rock band with a sound that is part Middle Eastern, part electric klezmer and part Spike Jones. In Sacramento, I stumbled on Fred Rochlin, a 74-year-old retired architect who had just begun a second career -- as a monologist.
This is hardly scientific evidence of anything, true. But these anecdotal examples (and dozens of others) of arts activity in disparate places, often underfinanced and almost always beneath the radar of the media, have reminded me that the impulse toward art -- making it and appreciating it -- is irrefutably potent.
And here are some numbers to underscore my impression. In a survey released in September, the endowment reported that in 1997, 20 million Americans sang in choirs or other groups; 33 million took photographs for artistic purposes; 24 million wrote creatively for reasons other than school or work, and 22 million played classical music on some instrument or other.
The same year, 5 million Americans acted on a public stage. And 97 million, fully half the adult population of the United States, attended at least one of the following events: a museum exhibit, a jazz performance, an opera, a classical music concert, a stage musical, a play or a ballet. In terms of percentage, that is up from 41 percent of adults who attended arts events in 1992, the last time the survey was conducted. (And it is worth noting that this number does not include those who saw a movie, read a novel or played in a garage band.)
The numbers suggest that our arts institutions have begun to address -- successfully -- the problem of integrating themselves into their communities. More educational programs, more children's programming, more outreach: all of this has emphasized the good the arts can do, focusing attention on what Ben Cameron, the executive director of the Theater Communications Group in New York, an umbrella organization for nonprofit theaters, calls "the value rather than the quality" of art.
Of course, in many cities, Peoria included, arts institutions continue to worry about aging audiences. Minority groups still complain about feeling unwelcome in theaters and concert halls where, beyond the occasional token production, programming rarely reflects their interests and where, at the same time, traditional programmers feel frustrated at being unable to attract minority audiences, despite what they feel are their best efforts.
"We have a minority marketing committee but I'll be frank, we have really struggled," said Debbie Ritschel, the marketing director of the Peoria Civic Center. "Our African-American community works very well within its own community, but we can't seem to get them here." Last year, she added, "An Evening With Langston and Martin," a theatrical presentation about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Langston Hughes, sold only 125 tickets, even though it had considerable star power, with Danny Glover as the renowned poet of the Harlem Renaissance.
Stan Maclin, who performs in an African drumming troupe that is based in Peoria, pointed out that in this city, which is 70 percent white, "most people who look like me don't attend meetings like this."
"We aren't usually invited," he said. "It's overwhelming. If you don't know how to get the audience, it's because you've created a situation where you feel you can participate but we don't."
Even so, the fact that minority attendance has recently climbed nationwide in museums, opera houses and theaters is an indication that some people who were not showing up in these places in the past are doing so now.
An annual survey of nonprofit theaters, for example, compiled by the Theater Communications Group, indicated that in 1997, 17.2 million people attended a performance at one of 197 nonprofit theaters in the nation. That is 160,000 more people than the survey counted a year before, which is even more impressive considering that 31 fewer theaters participated in the survey this year.
FURTHER, while it is true that society still marginalizes some outre artists and audiences, even the margins yield a kind of optimism. Did you know that in August, 1,300 people attended the National Poetry Slam in Austin, Tex., testimony to an almost entirely unacknowledged new art form that is being nurtured in coffeehouses and bars in almost every city in the country? I don't even know what to call it -- performance poetry? competitive poetry? -- these spoken-verse contests rooted for and hooted at as though they were football games.
"There is a mix of people involved, people off the street, dissatisfied M.F.A. students," said Guy LeCharles Gonzalez, a New Yorker who, representing the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, was a member of this year's championship team in Austin. "We have some people involved in the so-called legit journals, too, but the lifeblood is people who feel they don't have a voice elsewhere."
Interestingly enough, Mr. Gonzalez, 29, works as the membership coordinator for the Academy of American Poets, which is at the very center of the establishment, and whose president, Jonathan Galassi, once dismissed slam poetry as "karaoke." Mr. Gonzalez also runs a Monday night series of readings at 13 Bar Lounge in Greenwich Village. "Obviously, we're not recognized by the establishment as a legitimate form, so funding sources that are there for others are not there for us," he said. "But if the N.E.A. fell apart tomorrow, these coffee shops would still have readings."
For the purposes of many arts groups, of course, the N.E.A. has already fallen apart; it is impossible to know how many groups disappeared when their Federal grant money did. But less publicized is that local and state governments are supporting the arts at record levels. Part of the reason for this is that the arts have become such proven economic generators that countless communities have, in the last few years, applied public funds to the construction of arts facilities in order to spur redevelopment of benighted neighborhoods. Places as different (and unexpected) as Las Vegas and Madison, Wis., have begun creating strategies for developing cultural tourism.
In another economic trend, in spite of concerns that the decline in Federal grantmaking to the arts would spur a dwindling of corporate grantmaking as well, that hasn't exactly happened. Though a triennial survey released in November by the Business Committee for the Arts, an organization in New York that encourages and tracks partnerships between businesses and arts groups, reported that the percentage of American businesses contributing to the arts dropped to 39 percent last year, from 45 percent in 1994, the total contributed amount rose to an estimated $1.2 billion last year, from $875 million three years earlier. Further, and since 1994, when half of corporate arts financing derived from the Northeast and the West Coast, the money is now more evenly distributed.
Last year, 60 percent of corporate arts financing came from the South and the Midwest, which is particularly significant because almost all corporate contributions to the arts are made locally, and nearly half of the businesses surveyed made contributions to small or emerging arts groups.
Indeed, even as Congress, in its snubbing of the endowment, has refused to acknowledge the importance of the arts to Americans, the corporate community has done the opposite, according to the IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago publication that tracks corporate sponsorships of all types: more than one-third of corporate arts contributions originate not from corporate foundations or charitable contributions funds but from marketing budgets. Clearly, businesses believe an affiliation with the arts helps instill public confidence.
But does it help sell, say, chocolate cake?
"Oh, sure it does," said John Bryan, the C.E.O. of the Sara Lee Corporation, which recently received a Presidential arts medal for its arts support. "There are a couple of reasons the arts are especially effective for corporations. One is the opportunity to identify with the quality image that the cultural aspects of our lives project. Our business is a simple one of creating value by building brands, and to a large extent this happens in the art world. The name on a painting tells you, 'This is an original thing.' It gives you trust in that bit of art, even though it may not be obvious to you why this piece is better than another. The name gives you confidence. The same is true of a brand. So identifying with art is a fantastic opportunity."
Of course, some would question the value of reveling in the corporate sponsorship of art. After all, if art is a mere commodity, if it is so unchallenging as to be popular, if it is fit for mass consumption, then perhaps it is uncertain why we value art and artists in the first place. Isn't art supposed to be provocative? Thorny? Difficult? Art is, by nature, independent, unbeholden to commerce; as arts organizations increase their reliance on corporate support, and increase their solicitation of it, such independence may be threatened.
In fact, one of the often heard complaints now is that artists and arts institutions are in retreat from controversy, a concession to the indignant conservatism that at the beginning of this decade undermined the National Endowment for the Arts, alienated the public and chilled private support. Artists, the argument continues, have conceded as well to a complacent national audience that won't pay to be challenged, only to be entertained.
This is a reasonable concern, but whether, over all, Americans have access to as much controversial, experimental art as they once did is difficult to measure. So is the relative worthiness of the art we are producing. Does more participation in the arts result in more great art being created? Or does it inevitably attenuate our standards? I'm not touching that.
WHAT is true, certainly, is that in most of the country, art is not being made for export; what is created stays home. And for that reason, it is subject to home rule.
"People don't like to see their friends and neighbors in controversial roles," said Ginny Andrews, a board member of the Peoria Players Theater, a community group now in its 80th season of admittedly fluffy fare. "They'll accept it from a touring company, but not from us."
This is not an altogether terrible thing; it is one reason for places like New York, so artists who get weary of the outlook in Peoria have a place to go. And in my experience, most places, from time to time, will surprise you with their tolerance, if not their enthusiasm.
They have never had Tony Kushner's play "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes" in Peoria, which is what you might expect, but a production of its first half, "Millennium Approaches" was well received last month at Illinois State University in Bloomington, 40 miles away. Two years ago, the Lakeview Museum here had a Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit, which caused no stir at all. "On the other hand, I can't say the room was overworked," said Pat Barton, the museum board president.
In the last 14 months, I have seen a lot of theater, opera, painting, dance, orchestral music, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll. Some of it has been terrible. But much of it was not, performing valuable service in its community. And if I have learned anything in my travels thus far, it is that I have only scratched the surface.
"People pay attention to certain places, New York, Chicago, as if they're the center of the world," said Preston Jackson, a sculptor who teaches at the Chicago Art Institute but whose studio is on the Peoria riverfront. "They're not. There's a healthy art scene in Springfield. There's one here. Benton Harbor, Mich., that's another hot spot. People who want to see art should get up and travel a little bit."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
An Appreciation of Cute Finds a Niche in High Art

BYLINE: By SARAH BAYLISS; Sarah Bayliss is an editor at World Art magazine.

 BODY:
KNOWN to American television viewers as Astro Boy, Tetsuwan Atom was one of the earliest icons of cuteness in Japan, a country preoccupied with youthful paraphernalia. The wide-eyed robot with a nuclear-reactor heart and rockets in his feet launched Japan's first animated television show in the 1960's. Atom was created by the comic-book artist Osamu Tezuka, and he spent each episode battling evil robots and supernatural phenomena that threatened to wipe out the human race.
 Signs of Atom and his cartoon descendants are entering the mainstream in the United States, as Japanese comics (manga) and animation (anime) make their presence known in American media and museums. The rap singer Missy Elliott adopted a manga landscape in her 1997 video "Sock It 2 Me," while Michael Jackson used imagery from the Japanese animated sci-fi classic "Akira" in his 1995 music video "Scream." Kim's Video stores in New York have extensive "Japanimation" sections, and the Kim's outlet on St. Marks Place in the East Village has a range of Atom dolls (selling for $19.95 to $65). This month, Stone Bridge Press will release "The Anime Companion: What's Japanese in Japanese Animation?" by Gilles Poitras, the latest of several Japanese pop-culture books produced by American publishers in recent years. 
 In the museums, two young Japanese artists, Kenji Yanobe and Mariko Mori, are also bringing their manga visions to the American viewing public. At the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, images of Mr. Yanobe's cartoon-inspired costumes are on view in a group show through January. Mr. Yanobe's survival suits and bulbous go-carts refer to animated figures from Godzilla to Atom and his sister, Uran, or Astro Girl. First shown in the United States last year, the sculptures move, inflate and make noise. But all of this occurs in a rather endearing, toylike manner. An ambulatory blue Godzilla vehicle, for example, is balanced on small tricycle wheels.
Like Atom, Mr. Yanobe's sculptures are friendly, unthreatening beings. There's a babyishness to their tubby profiles. "Atom was a robot who was trying to be more human, a sort of Pinocchio robot," says Frederik Schodt, author of "Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga." "He established the tradition in Japan of the robot-as-pal, or human friend, which remains a very big genre for children."
Ms. Mori includes more contemporary anime imagery in her photographs and videos. She describes Mr. Tezuka as a "moral teacher" for her generation, someone who taught children about the complexity of human life. Currently at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Ms. Mori's stylized dreamscapes -- in which she poses -- portray electronic geishas, goddesses and animated aliens. Some of her images, like a photograph of a cyborglike geisha offering tea to indifferent businessmen, play off traditional images of Japanese women. Others suggest sci-fi wonderlands with spiritual overtones, as in "Nirvana," in which Ms. Mori appears as a levitating goddess flanked by alien musical attendants.
Some view Japan's love of childish effects, from female fashion trends to Hello Kitty accouterments, as a recreational release valve for Japan's conventions of public conformity. Artistic preoccupation with animated fantasy also reflects Japan's obsession with comics. "More people read manga than read newspapers in Japan," says Jeff Yang, co-editor of "Eastern Standard Time: A Guide to Asian Influence on American Culture From Astro Boy to Zen Buddhism." "School kids read it; businessmen read it; homemakers read it. There are different manga for virtually every background, profession and kink. In America, the television sitcom is like a fun-house mirror of the American id. In Japan, you have that in manga."
Mr. Yanobe readily identifies himself as an otaku, a term that emerged in the 1980's and broadly translates to mean Japanese computer nerds or information junkies. Mr. Yanobe, who was born in 1965, grew up near the ruins of the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka. As a child, he would play among the defunct robots and deserted scientific pavilions left at the festival's enormous site. Mr. Yang characterizes otaku as young men who trade tidbits of information on arcane topics as if they were commodities of value.
Products of Japan's boom economy and post-information age, many otaku are steeped in comic culture. "I don't hesitate to say that my best friends are TV and manga," Mr. Yanobe says, adding that "Star Wars" is his favorite film. His "Radiation Suit (Atom)" and the female version, "Radiation Suit (Uran)," are antiseptic contraptions supposedly made for survival in a toxic landscape. Atom, silver and pot-bellied, features nine Geiger counters and a helmet with Atomesque cowlicks; Uran's headgear has protrusions shaped like mouse ears. Mr. Yanobe recently toured Chernobyl in an Atom suit; the resulting photographs, alternately chilling and endearing, are in the San Francisco show.
While Mr. Yanobe's artworks portray the comic disasters of boyish fantasy, Ms. Mori's imagery, which has also been presented at Deitch Projects, her New York gallery, reveals demurely feminine future scapes. The childish sprites in her earlier artworks draw on Japan's enthusiasm for juvenile attributes and modern anime's portrayal of women as kittenish nymphets. In "Tea Ceremony III," Ms. Mori's lame hooded cap mimics the doggie garments worn by Japanese women in fashion magazines.
"Play With Me" finds Ms. Mori dressed up as a platinum-blond robot meekly loitering outside an electronics arcade. "A lot of so-called otaku shop at that store," she says. "They are more interested in cartoon characters than real girls. That's why I wanted to stand there." During the photography shoot, shoppers ignored Ms. Mori and her unusual costume. "I think they were shy," she says. "I was too overwhelming to look at.".
Mr. Schodt attributes at least some of Japan's culture of cute to manga's influence. "Animation and manga were originally created for children," he says. "Now they're full-fledged media, just like novels and films in the United States. But they still have a legacy of having been for children."
The presence of manga fantasies in museums also suggests the blurred lines in Japan between fine art and pop culture. "With established Japanese artists like Yasumasa Morimura or emerging artists like Yanobe and Mori, you see the self-invention of a persona," says Renny Pritikin, director of the Yerba Buena Center. "Just as a pop singer might change his image or even his name from tour to tour, these visual artists put on masks to explore social and political conditions. Among contemporary Japanese fine artists, I see a form of magical realism that is tough, fragile and electric."
At the Japanese box office, anime counts for approximately 55 percent of film revenue. Modern anime encompasses many different genres, from the robotic machismo of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" to "Sailor Moon," a television show about perky schoolgirl avengers who all die at the end of the first season, then come back to life later on. The technically superb film "Akira" and its spinoffs have portrayed a "Blade Runner"-esque Tokyo, while pornographic anime commands a big market, distributed by labels like Anime 18. At the friendlier end of the spectrum is the anime master Hayao Miyazaki, who is said to have watched "Bambi" 80 times until he knew each frame by heart. In Japan, Mr. Miyazaki's productions have outsold both live-action Japanese films and imports like "The Lion King" and "Beauty and the Beast."
American animation enthusiasts like anime's edgy narratives and emotive characters. "The Japanese place a high value on the feelings of others," says Mr. Poitras. "This is revealed in anime, including satirical anime. American shows tend to be more superficial when it comes to feelings, and that is reflected in American action shows."
In the United States, anime now commands some $80 million in annual revenues, mostly from video rentals.But that number may be growing. Two years ago Disney acquired worldwide distribution rights for nine Miyazaki films, and Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment released his "Kiki's Delivery Service" in September. Miramax is planning an English-language edition of Mr. Miyazaki's film "Mononokehime" ("The Princess Mononoke") in American theaters next summer, with celebrity voice-overs by Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
To Ms. Mori, this pop-culture crossover makes perfect sense. "We are bonded to heavy local cultures," she says. "But pop culture, like what Disney produces, is a universal language."
You've come a long way, Astro Boy.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Adobe's Motto: 'We Do What We Want To Do'

BYLINE: By STEVEN DRUKMAN; Steven Drukman, a theater critic for Artforum magazine, is an adjunct professor in New York University's drama department.

 BODY:
WITH the bravado of youth, the Adobe Theater Company, a nonprofit troupe that prefers to spell its name in lowercase letters, shuns other unnecessary highs: high art, high-handedness and -- until their recent transfer to the 170-seat Actors Playhouse in Greenwich Village -- high overhead.
But after their critically acclaimed "Duet!: A Romantic Fable," a pulpy parody of puppy love and American culture, closed with sold-out houses in SoHo last year, this Off Off Broadway troupe took the leap to their first open-ended commercial run and reopened the play Off Broadway. 
 "Our original mission statement was, 'We do what we want to do,' " said Jeremy Dobrish, the company's 30-year-old artistic director and founder. "We hope we are still doing that, but with a little more attention." For the eight-year-old Adobe, a company that has, Mr. Dobrish said, "cleaned toilets and rat droppings in small downtown theaters so we could work there," the move is significant.
Combining talking animals and punning trees with macabre plot turns, "Duet!" seems poised somewhere between Saturday morning cartoons and "Saturday Night Live" as directed by David Lynch, and geared to an audience weaned on television.
The 75-minute show was developed and staged in episodes for five years by Erin Quinn Purcell and her co-writer and co-performer Gregory Jackson, whom she had dated 12 years ago when they were freshmen at the University of Iowa. The play, which focuses on a young couple (portrayed by Ms. Purcell and Mr. Jackson, both 30) who meet and begin dating, opened in its current form in 1997 at the 75-seat Ohio Theater, directed by its two chief performers and Mr. Dobrish. Mr. Jackson, who is not an Adobe member, said, "The spoof quality of 'Duet!' was something Erin and I had done since college, and it was great that the Adobe, with its playful esthetic, found us and we found them."
However, the company's move "uptown" to the Village could not be financed alone. Adobe's average annual operating budget is about $83,000; it has cost $190,000 for the commercial remounting of "Duet!" To the rescue came Dodger Endemol Theatricals, a producer of such current mainstream Broadway fare as the musicals "Footloose" and "Titanic."
"We are fans, pure and simple," said Michael David of Dodger Endemol, which became a producer of "Duet!" "I came to them after seeing three of their shows. 'Duet!' is such good theater that it seemed serendipitous to support them at this time. It's a win-win situation. They need us, and we felt the need to expose the future of the theater. Twenty-five years ago, grants and foundations did this sort of thing."
The Dodgers' support of "Duet!" may reflect a trend in New York theater: producers with deep pockets, often with several Broadway productions up and running, taking financial risks on shows clearly aimed at younger audiences. Fran and Barry Weissler are planning to produce the commercial transfer of Kenneth Lonergan's "This Is Our Youth," now at Second Stage. And the Shubert Organization's backing of the recent "Stupid Kids," a tale about being gay in high school, was a play, according to Gerald Schoenfeld, the organization's chairman, that was "taken on in the hopes of getting young people into the theater."
Now a collective of 26 actors, designers and playwrights, Adobe initially involved six people when it was founded in 1991, five of whom were friends from Wesleyan University, including Mr. Dobrish and Christopher Roberts, 31, the producing director. The troupe's offices were in Mr. Dobrish's living room in the Flatiron district of Manhattan until 1997, when they rented office space from the Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea.
With his beard, pony tail and casual clothes, Mr. Dobrish, who grew up on the Upper West Side, still looks like a college student. The fact that he and Mr. Roberts called their company Adobe to evoke a sense of homeyness and because the word to them looks like "a visual palindrome," reflects the kind of breezy collegiate style that still informs some of the company's work.
Their first break came in 1992 when a company dropped out of its rental agreement with SoHo Rep, and Mr. Dobrish, then working at the theater, was given the booking in exchange for box office duties. "I couldn't turn it down, even though I had no play," he said recently over lunch in a diner near his apartment. "I threw together an evening of sketches called 'True Words Are Never Spoken,' hardly our crowning achievement, but it launched us."
This early effort, which Mr. Roberts wryly describes as "modest in its ambitions and its achievements," made an instant playwright out of Mr. Dobrish, who has since written or directed most of the company's 20 or so productions. It also defined the troupe's esthetic, which draws from "high art to pop culture, fairy tales to urban myths and traditional theater to modern performance art," in Mr. Dobrish's words. In his review of "Duet!" in The New York Times last year, Peter Marks called the company "an 80-channel cable television system, accepting signals from a host of sources."
While this cut-and-paste style may be more the rule than the exception on Off Off Broadway, Adobe differs from other downtown troupes in its focus on the audience. Spectators can buy beer and soda onstage before a performance and are invited to talk with cast members after every show. "Where else do you get a sense of community these days, besides church or the local bar?" Mr. Dobrish said.
Early experiments with audience involvement included pre-show pranks like an on-stage ringing telephone. And "fun" and "entertaining" seem to be favorite words of Mr. Dobrish and Mr. Roberts.
Frank Wood, an actor currently playing the title role in "Side Man" on Broadway, performed in Dobrish-directed productions with the Adobe between 1992 and 1994. Mr. Wood compared the current "Duet!" "to everything Adobe does, in that it captures the company's spirit: sweet, but not afraid to show the grotesque side of human nature, like Grimms' fairy tales." Mr. Dobrish, in fact, adapted a Grimms tale for "The Handless Maiden," his company's well-received play last spring that was set in both "the faraway kingdom of New York City" and magical forests of demons.
Like their art, Mr. Dobrish and Mr. Roberts wear their erudition lightly, quoting rock musicians (John Lennon and Bob Dylan) rather than Bertolt Brecht or Antonin Artaud to explain their artistic philosophies. And they borrow from everyone, including critics. When Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, described Adobe's 1995 film-noir satire "Blink of an Eye" as "Pirandello on Prozac," Mr. Dobrish thought, "Hey, I've read 'Six Characters in Search of an Author' but I should read some more Pirandello."
Recently, adapting an obscure Pirandello play, "Each in His Own Way," he incorporated images of mobsters from popular culture and dialogue filled with contemporary vernacular. The result was last year's "Notions in Motion," a gangster spoof that played with theatrical illusion, written and directed by Mr. Dobrish in a style he calls "Pirandello meets Tarantino."
"Notions in Motion" was the Adobe success of which he is most proud. "It got high school students into the theater, and they were screaming and shouting," he said. "They might never have been in the theater before, and suddenly they were sticking around to talk about the play with the actors afterward."
Mr. Dobrish, who was a psychology and theater major in college, says he enjoys theater that is "accessible" and expresses disdain for the "self-conscious preciousness" that some people associate with downtown experimental theater. "I would often go see things Off Off Broadway," Mr. Dobrish said, "and feel like I was at a party with the cool kids, but I wasn't really invited."
He mentions as influences the director Mark Brokaw ("This Is Our Youth") and the playwright Tony Kushner, but he is more likely to emulate artistic directors -- Doug Aibel of the Vineyard Theater and Neil Pepe of the Atlantic, for example -- and speaks of admiring artists for sustaining long careers in the theater. Richard Foreman and David Mamet, two far-flung names with whom he admits no stylistic affinity, are to Mr. Dobrish "heroic" in this regard.
He likes to call the Adobe "a downtown theater with an uptown sensibility." "Our company believes," he said, "that it's too bad people think of Off Off Broadway as sitting trapped in some hot basement, watching untalented actors being pretentious. Let's not do that."
But will Adobe's downtown following be alienated by the move to Off Broadway and the $45 ticket price it demands? Mr. Roberts bristled: "Suddenly, the media notices you and wonders, 'Why are you moving?' Everyone forgets that that's the reality of the economic mechanisms in the theater of getting your work seen. You'd never say to a painter, 'You must show that painting 20 times and then put it in the closet and never show it again.' "

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Filmmaker's Duty: To Document Her Homeland

BYLINE: By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on the politics and legacy of Sergei Eisenstein.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
EARLY in the spring of 1992, when lining up at the gas pumps was a weekly ritual of life in the newly non-Soviet Russia, the documentary filmmaker Marina Goldovskaya decided to take advantage of the two-hour wait at a Moscow station. She stepped out of her car, lifted her Super VHS camera onto her right shoulder and began shooting video for her latest work, "The Shattered Mirror: Journal of a Time of Trouble." Turning toward a man waiting his turn in a blue Zhugili sedan, she kept her camera rolling as he called out his window.
"For whom are you filming?" he asked Ms. Goldovskaya, an energetic 5-foot-2-inch blonde. 
 "For history," she said.
"That's noble," he said.
"No, it's not noble," she countered. "It's my profession. I'm a director, a cinematographer."
"Ah, then it's your duty," he said.
For more than 30 years, Ms. Goldovskaya has dutifully and imaginatively chronicled Russia's history in almost 30 films and videos. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called her landmark "Solovki Power" "a remarkable documentary," one "so good that it leaves the audience wanting to know more."
That 1988 film (part of an eight-film retrospective of Goldovskaya documentaries beginning Thursday at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan) took viewers to an island in the White Sea, in the north of Russia. Solovki, once the site of a monastery, served as a labor camp from 1923 to 1939; among those who served time there were workers, mathematicians, theologians, historians, economists and poets.
Juxtaposed with a 1928 propaganda film that Ms. Goldovskaya uncovered about the camp's enlightened teachings, clean linens and tasty meals are interviews with eight survivors. A worker can "never forget the fine leather boots of his tormentors, polished to a high shine." An economist revisits the night she had to wake up her children, ages 4 and 6, and tell them she was going "away to work."
"Papa went away and now you're going," said her son. "If Nanny goes, too, who will stay with us?"
An academician talks about avoiding execution by hiding as 300 shots were fired at his fellow prisoners. The executioners were too drunk to aim properly, and the next morning bodies still squirmed in a dirt pit.
Grisly tales of Soviet life are no longer shocking, but when Ms. Goldovskaya and the scriptwriters Viktor Listov and Dmitri Chukovsky first began working on "Solovki" in 1986, it was still risky to talk of such subjects publicly. Under the guise of making a film about the monastery, they began production.
"When I told my mother, she started crying," recalled Ms. Goldovskaya. " 'You are committing suicide,' she said. 'Don't you remember what happened to your father?' " In 1938, Yevsei Goldovsky, then a Deputy Minister of Film, was supervising the construction of the Kremlin movie theater when a lamp exploded. Stalin, claiming the incident was an assassination attempt, threw the official into prison for five months.
"But while my mother was crying," continued Ms. Goldovskaya, "my son was telling me, 'If you don't make this, I'll stop respecting you for the rest of your life.' "
THE film, released in 1988, helped secure her reputation in Russia. "Marina is one of the best of her generation of filmmakers," said Naum Kleiman, director of the Film Museum in Moscow. "Her work presents small, individual lives in the larger context of history. In our cinema, we traditionally showed the larger view, with a few figures inside. Her reverse angle is very important. It's as if she's painting a fresco; you can examine each figure by itself, but together they form a panorama of the entire country."
Today Ms. Goldovskaya's son, Sergei Livnev, whose father she divorced when Sergei was a child, is a film director living in Moscow with his wife and their 3-year-old son. While Ms. Goldovskaya lives in Los Angeles, she has returned to Moscow in summers to shoot the five films (all part of the retrospective) she has made since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. That year, while teaching at the University of California in San Diego, she was introduced to Georg Herzfeld, an engineer and businessman who had grown up in a Swedish orphanage and moved to Los Angeles. Six days after they were introduced, he "polished off his kneecaps" and proposed. Ms. Goldovskaya is now a tenured professor at U.C.L.A.'s department of film and television and serves on the steering committee of the International Documentary Association, which met at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in October.
Everybody is really making a film about himself," Ms. Goldovskaya told filmmakers assembled at the academy. "You pick a subject that is close to your heart; it's your understanding of the truth."
"I grew up in a house filled with filmmakers and cinematographers," said Ms. Goldovskaya, in response to a question about how she got started. "Many cameramen died during the war; it was so romantic to die for your country. There were so few women in the profession. My father told me that if I went into it I would never have a family, that I would be unhappy all my life. But I was young, it was romantic, and I loved to push the button. I cannot stop pushing the button."
Ms. Goldovskaya often says her field is human emotions, how politics affects the soul, and that her favorite subjects are people with obsessions. So she understands very well when one of her students, making a film about a teen-ager whom he feels has been wrongly convicted of a gang-style murder, may be too close to his subject. "When I begin a film, I write down what it will be about," she told the student. "I write and I write. You hear in yourself a melody of the future film. The bell starts to ring. It will be a long, dark tunnel; you will butt your head along the walls. But if you don't have an angle, you won't get to the light."
Right now Ms. Goldovskaya's own light is a film about a Russian prince, Yevgeny Meshchersky, whose royal family dates back 800 years and who has just moved with his wife and three children to his family's former estate, an hour outside Moscow. It had been nationalized by the Soviets, and now in ruins, its ownership is in question.
Everywhere she and her camera turned, she found metaphors: workers carrying a piano into the once-grand entrance hall in the pouring rain, the prince and his wife coming home with a huge sack of flour on the day the ruble collapsed.
"They drove right into my shot," she said. "Can you imagine how lucky I was? And I followed them into the kitchen. 'This flour will last two months,' Yevgeny told his wife. 'We've grown potatoes and carrots, and we can survive.' "
"It's these moments of truth, little moments that reveal relationships between people, that are important to me," Ms. Goldovskaya said. "They're available only to the camera that is very observant."

HEADLINE: A Shifting American Landscape;
Downtown, Theme Parks For the Arts

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
LATE at night, along Main Street in Louisville, the Kentucky Center for the Arts sits in desolate silence across from the office building of a major financial supporter, the Humana Foundation. Restaurants are barely visible in the corners of office towers on deserted streets. A few pedestrians turn up, walking with purposeful strides. Cars pull into lots beneath the center.
One evening not long ago, the scene inside was almost as surreal. In a packed theater, a three-hour tribute to the mandolin was in progress, featuring a folk musician playing bluegrass mandolin, a Russian virtuoso known as "the Paganini of the Dorma" and a stage full of mandolinists modeling themselves on ensembles that thrived in the Midwest 70 years ago. 
 This collection of high, low and in between, of classical, jazz, country and bluegrass, set in the middle of a darkened, urban street of empty towers, seemed strange to a visitor used to the more frenetic exteriors and less eclectic interiors of New York, but the odd mix is not unusual in American arts centers. These multipurpose, multicultural, multihalled institutions now dominate the cultural scene, often in ways that have barely been recognized. They are becoming as common as city halls, cost anywhere from $30 million to $200 million, and promise cultural rebirth and economic vitality.
The development of these centers may mark the most dramatic change in the American performing arts landscape since concert halls were built in the 19th century. And just as concert halls transformed the nature of classical music, arts centers are having a profound, unexpected and largely unexamined impact on the arts.
The centers, which range from converted movie theaters to Lincoln Center-style complexes, were originally meant to provide homes for classical performing arts groups like orchestras and ballet companies. But they have become something else entirely. The buildings don't just house culture; they alter it.
They have, in their shape and design, actually created an "arts center culture." And the newest centers -- like the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, or the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth -- already take it for granted. Arts-center style leans toward the classical performing arts but celebrates populist variety; it boasts an elite character but celebrates a democratic view of culture.
Bass Hall in Texas, for example, was built with $65 million from private and foundation sources, with orchestra, ballet and musical theater in mind. But its current inaugural season also offers Milton Berle, Judy Collins, the Flying Karamazov Brothers and the ballet "Romeo and Juliet" danced on ice. And all across the country, high-grossing and popular Broadway road shows are often displacing classical groups from their center homes, sometimes for months.
Why have classical arts tended to become less important in institutions supposedly designed for their nurture, and why has a more eclectic arts-center style emerged? Several reasons became evident during visits to a number of arts centers, including three vastly different types in Tulsa, Okla., Minneapolis and Louisville.
* The urban goals of the arts center -- to rebuild downtown areas, increase foot traffic and invite large attendance -- often conflict with the nonprofit artistic goals that the arts center is supposed to embrace. If an artistic event does not attract sufficient popular attention, it becomes a burden to the center rather than an asset.
* Because many centers were also designed as grand civic statements meant to transform declining downtowns, their main halls are often too large for their communities, guaranteeing swaths of empty seats for the more demanding arts -- a vacuum that many centers have come to abhor.
* The high overhead of their new homes and increased competition from the arts centers' own programming add to the classical groups' woes, aggravating their already growing sense of marginality in American culture.
* In an unexpected way, the arts center directors, with the mandate to reach far beyond the classical performing arts for programming, have become the dominant cultural impresarios in many locales, supplanting the artistic directors of orchestras, ballet companies and opera houses. The inevitable result: eclectic strains in American performing arts are strengthened, while classical strains are weakened. Arts that turn a profit compete with those that rely on patronage.
The arts center's creation hinged on one set of premises; its success hinges on another. In 1966, when Lincoln Center was still incomplete, its first president, the composer William Schuman, predicted that its model of a "cultural center" would become "the new establishment." It has, but not in a way that Schuman could have imagined.
THE concept of the arts center developed in the decade beginning in the mid-50's: classical arts were secure in their prestigious positions in cultural life, and the National Endowment for the Arts was conceived. At the same time, attention was ever more focused on the racial and economic problems of American cities. Lincoln Center -- still the archetype -- combined these concerns, beginning with an idea from Robert Moses's Committee on Slum Clearance in 1955 to redevelop New York's West Side.
As the concept spread to other cities, it brought the hope of civic rebirth to abandoned downtowns. More than two-thirds of this country's performing spaces have been built since Lincoln Center was begun, with many of these thousands of buildings being called not concert halls or theaters but arts centers.
Typically, but not always, arts centers are products of financial patchwork quilts. A state or city donates or leases the land to a nonprofit organization. Private and foundation money is used for construction, sometimes with public matching funds. Classical arts groups are often given priority access, sometimes renting at a discount and contributing to the center's overhead. Other rentals are solicited. And the center often puts together its own presentations as well.
Complexes range from the gargantuan Wortham Center in Houston to more humble examples like the Myrna Loy Center in Helena, Mont., housed in a renovated former county jail. Some are mainly concert halls, like the $118 million Benaroya Hall that opened in Seattle this fall. Others, like the $187 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, are multihalled variations on the Lincoln Center model. Some centers rent out their spaces for body-building competitions and wedding receptions; others have more refined standards. Some compete against other auditoriums; others don't.
But the emphasis on urban renewal is fairly consistent. The buildings do not evolve from their surroundings but are seemingly inserted into them. This can create an eerie quality (one that even Lincoln Center had in its earlier years), in which arts centers seem in a place, but not of it, often rising out of dark, deserted streets and reachable mainly by car. A new urban logic is created: the arts don't grow out of the city; the city will grow out of the arts -- or rather, out of the upper-income demographics associated with them.
This urban ambition is one reason so many arts centers -- including Lincoln Center -- are overbuilt, as if preparing for the hoped-for multitudes. But size can create problems. An opera house with 2,500 seats must often satisfy a symphony orchestra that attracts an audience of less than two-thirds that number (as is the case in Tulsa); the ballet may fill even fewer seats (as has sometimes been the case in Louisville).
Size also affects content. Stars are hired to fill halls; pop presentations are courted for their drawing power. And great chunks of repertory are slighted. Lincoln Center's offerings, for example, are hampered by the lack of a chamber opera theater; its organizations must also scale their productions to fill large spaces. Chamber music and vocal recitals may have a harder time on the national circuit partly because they are unsuitable for many centers. Some arts complexes offer small halls, but even then, operas, ballets and orchestral concerts tend to be placed in arenas too large for their audiences.
The problems with the arts-center model are not just physical; an unexpected tension has arisen between centers and the classical groups that inspired their construction. The groups need and want a supportive home; the centers, though, aspire to more events, more money, more artistic possibilities. And while a center can help arts groups by easing promotional costs, interests often conflict.
This competition has been most fierce outside the largest cities, a situation aggravated by -- and aggravating -- the increasing marginalization of the classical arts. In the 1950's and early 60's, the Louisville Orchestra (which had an important national presence with its recordings of new music) had no home; neither did the local opera or ballet. They leased a local legitimate theater, but the landlord planned to replace it with a parking garage. The conflict ended up in court; finally, after 17 years of wrangling, negotiation and fund raising, the Kentucky Center for the Arts opened in 1983 to provide a lasting home.
But in recent years, the Louisville Orchestra, which has been struggling, has had to seek other performance spaces when the center wanted to make room for touring Broadway shows. The Kentucky Opera, experiencing a drop in subscriptions, cut back its seasonal offerings from five to three. There has been contentiousness over how much responsibility lies with the companies and how much with the center. The orchestra is about to announce that next season it will move its classical series from the main arts-center building to an off-site 1,400-seat theater managed by the center.
Richard Van Kleeck, a classically trained musician who is programming director of the Kentucky Center for the Arts, said in a recent interview, "Classical music continues to be the toughest sell; it's tough to get audiences to come out." But the center, he said, has recently examined its mission and will "continue to keep a schedule" of classical events -- though they have become more marginal than the center's founders originally planned.
In fact, the immense success of touring Broadway shows has caused serious conflicts in cities with limited performing spaces, forcing many opera companies and orchestras to relocate temporarily. Next February, in Louisville, the Disney musical "Beauty and the Beast" will take over the main theater of the Kentucky Center for the Arts for a month, forcing the Louisville Orchestra to play at a renovated movie theater. And last season, the Florida Orchestra could obtain only 3 of its desired 21 dates in the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center because of touring shows.
In an interview, Judith Lisi, the president of the Tampa center, acknowledged that the potential conflicts might even force classical groups to reconsider their place in the very halls that had been built for them.
"At some point," Ms. Lisi said, "the orchestras may have to deal with the problem and may have to build dedicated halls."
IN place of the steady diets of classical fare originally anticipated at many centers, what is being offered there now? Here politics can be as influential as taste. At the Kentucky Center, the board is appointed by the state's governor; in Tulsa, the facility is overseen by the city government; in Hartford, the Bushnell Theater is completely private and nonprofit. But municipalities always stand in judgment, and these pressures -- unlike those from private donors -- tend to push in a populist direction.
This has helped create the arts-center style. The emphasis is on serving disparate communities, which in some cases leads to diverse excellence and in others to pandering variety. Performances for children are plentiful. So are performances that try to create links with local ethnic and racial groups. In Louisville, country fiddling and jazz have found their way into subscription series. In Los Angeles, the opera company has appealed to Hispanic communities with zarzuelas. The California Center of the Arts in Escondido also courts multiple audiences, scheduling, during the next two months, "The Hanukkah Story" narrated by Leonard Nimoy, a mariachi band, "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," Argentine tangos and the violinist Itzhak Perlman.
The particular balance partly depends on the vision of the arts center director, who, in city after city, has emerged as a dominant cultural force. Ms. Lisi, for example, may be the most important performing arts presenter in South Florida, booking about 100 different performances a year and running an education program for about 100,000 schoolchildren.
In Louisville, Mr. Van Kleeck's programming may be creating a stronger profile than that of the classical arts groups. Last season, the local premiere of "Les Enfants Terribles" by Philip Glass attracted just a few hundred people, but Mr. Van Kleeck believes the performance was important to his artistic mission.
More commercially successful is Mr. Van Kleeck's regular subscription series, "Lonesome Pine," which last season included the mandolin celebration and this winter offers the bluegrass of John Cowan, the African rock vocals of Salif Keita, the Celtic music of Anam and a Hawaiian slack-key guitar festival.
The eclecticism can take on different characteristics in different cities. During an intermission in Verdi's "Aida" at the Tulsa Performing Arts Center last season, a 13-foot boa constrictor was wrapped around the neck of an "Egyptian." It was held out to daring donors who were offered Polaroid photo-ops. In Tulsa, which was celebrating its centennial origins as an American Indian settlement and is proud of its close connections to the Midwestern wilderness, the snake seemed a reminder of how arts centers adapt to their surroundings.
Tulsa's character -- its conservative taste and entrepreneurial spirit -- is evident even in the nature of the arts organizations that perform at the center. The Tulsa Ballet owns rehearsal studios in an outdoor strip mall, where store rents are used to support it. Theater Tulsa lost many of is resources during the 1980's oil depression, but continues as a thriving amateur group at the center.
The situation is far different in Minneapolis, which is a more cosmopolitan university city; the Walker Art Center can even specialize in a playful, often political avant-gardism that would never last in Tulsa.
Once last season, the Sun Ra Arkestra entered the auditorium of the Walker, clapping, chanting and wearing glittering outfits and headgear -- a style set by the jazz orchestra's late founder, Sun Ra, who liked to claim he was a visitor from outer space. But when the group started to play "When You Wish Upon a Star," peppering the familiar tune with shrieking riffs and dissonant improvisations, the audience -- at least half children -- looked as if it had been abandoned by Jiminy Cricket. Undeterred adults filled the hall for more serious intergalactic jazz that evening.
This was not an atypical event for the Walker, a museum spiced with performances. Its self-consciously post-modern presentations of conceptual art, performance art and film easily find audiences in a cultivated city that has the classical bases well covered. (The Brooklyn Academy of Music under Harvey Lichtenstein has defined a similar vision in New York City.) The Walker's director of musical performance, Philip Bither, puts the museum's spirit of rambunctious and contentious play in audible form, including, this season, a cross-cultural band of Afro-Hispanic pop (Radio Tarifa), an afternoon of interactive electronic music making ("Sonic Circuits"), and "A Prelude to Faust," in which the stories of Faust and Job are intertwined and performed by a local puppeteer and performance artist, Michael Sommers, and his troupe.
DESPITE its variations, the overall arts-center style is still unmistakable, tapping into contemporary America's preoccupation with democratization of the arts and taste: a refusal to make many distinctions, a preference for events that provide the greatest pleasure to the greatest number, a distrust of all elite claims.
The clearest portrait of arts-center style was actually suggested by an exhibition at the Walker last year, a show now at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York: "The Architecture of Reassurance."
This exhibit, about the design of Disney theme parks, shows maps of various Tomorrowlands and Frontierlands, their grand vistas and exotic possibilities extending outward from a quaint Main Street in a stylized American town. That town hardly exists today (if it ever did), but its remnants can be seen in the surreal street signs like Market Street in bare, downtown Louisville, or in the suspended corridors called skyways in downtown Minneapolis, which bridge office buildings for the convenience of pedestrians in winter.
At the artificial heart of these post-urban Main Streets, the arts center is creating its own architecture of reassurance, a kind of eclectic Disneyesque dream image rising out of the cityscape. The towering office buildings and abandoned streets of many a downtown lead to a cultural temple filled with fantastical offerings. The bustle of the streets may be gone, but remnants of the streets -- snakes and mandolins and mariachi bands -- find a home even if classical arts languish. That home is a comfortable well-lighted mall, with a series of amusements high and low, rides for the daring, icons for the devoted, entertainment for the bored and, on occasion perhaps, a kind of enlightenment.

Let's Be Chromatically Correct

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Americans who are simplistically called people of color seem to have had none of the difficulty felt by the allegedly uncolored in absorbing the evidence that Thomas Jefferson sired at least one of Sally Hemings's children. "Everybody knew that already," Fareed Thomas told a Times reporter, referring to his like-minded African-American classmates in a Los Angeles high school.
The reporter, Don Terry, readily accepted this testimony and inserted a charming autobiographical note. He said that adult African-Americans, too, have never doubted that Jefferson and many other of their ancestors practiced miscegenation freely.
"They believed it every time they traced the black and white branches of their own family trees," Terry wrote. "They believed it every time they held a family reunion, and Aunt Wakara, her skin the color of coffee with cream, showed up along with dark-skinned Uncle Noah, espresso-colored cousin Henry, brown sister Julie and baby Nia, who was smack dab in the middle." 
 Without even a wink of irony, Terry went on to quote Fareed's teacher, Fahamisha Butler: "Look at the black people in this class. We are the color of the rainbow. Our ancestors didn't come over from Africa this way."
They sure didn't. But neither did they ever call the rainbow black. Or white, for that matter. The Terry dispatch suggests that a faster way to escape some of America's racial and ethnic muddles may be for all of us to sharpen our vision and make our speech chromatically correct.
The police and the news media could help by becoming much more discriminating about skin color. Just as they have always distinguished among people's black, brown, red, yellow, gray or white hair and their blue, brown, green, gray or hazel eyes, let them offer a rich array of skin shades. What a boon to social harmony and effective police work if we all shed the sloppy habit of identifying achievers and miscreants as merely blacks or whites, and instead called them ebonies, chocolates, cocoas, coffees, lattes and creams on the one hand, and pinks, ivories, taupes and eggshells on the other.
Think how liberating it would be to read, "The gunman, a six-foot ocher, fired twice at the frail, russet shopkeeper before two elderly neighbors, one buff, one milky, wrestled him to the ground." Or, "Muhammed Jefferson Akeem, the first umber ever elected to the House of Representatives, is being actively wooed by both the Melanic and Earthtone caucuses." And how helpful it would be to detectives if police artists rendered their portraits of wanted suspects in truly descriptive shadings.
An even larger social benefit could be achieved in the national census in 2000. America's mating habits have confused and distorted the decennial population counts since Jefferson's time because the racial classifica-
tions have forced so many inhabitants to make an intolerable choice between "black" and "white."
At the least, the census should have provided a registry long ago for "mulattoes" and "quadroons," and for their descendants -- as "octonegral" and "octocaucasal" or some such. In still later generations, of course, this would lead to a wholly unpronounceable nomenclature, without clearing up the additional confusions created by the remaining census racial categories -- American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut and Asian and Pacific Islander. Worse, the Census Bureau then divides all these arbitrary racial groupings into Hispanic and non-Hispanic subsets, looking to document racial and ethnic strength rather than facial coloration.
Whatever may be the residual political and sociological value of these categories, they should not dominate our thought and speech. They cry out for refinement in the next century. Modern printing and computer technologies would make it easy for all of us to be given a new census form that includes a vivid color chart depicting the planet's full range of skin shades. That chart would be held up against every face to determine the closest match.
Such a supplementary survey would finally produce a record that looks like America. The results could be filed and published both graphically and in a new
vocabulary of designer colors: mahogany, saffron and zinc, among others. Bar-ring any change in our mating habits, what may still strike conservative minds as facetious in 2000 will, I think, appear not only sensible but also downright necessary by 2100.
As we correct our speech and thoughts chromatically, why not begin to clean them up historically, too? Unvarnished color consciousness requires that we abandon African-American, Hispanic and Caucasian as anachronistic exaggerations or falsehoods.
Jefferson, who believed that the starkest sort of race mixing produces a "degradation of human character," obviously judged Sally Hemings as sufficiently pale (i.e., un-African) to bear his child, but still dark enough (African) to remain his slave. Most of his American contemporaries probably saw no contradiction in such bifurcated reasoning. Even a man of great intellect and democratic conviction could love and own a woman simultaneously. Nowadays, we ascribe that attitude to a "timebound" racism -- not unlike the timebound sexism that we blame for preserving the ideal of wifely obedience into our century's marriage vow.
Finding this dusty furniture in the mind's attic can be both shocking and illuminating. Just as we now wonder how otherwise enlightened people could trade in dark-skinned bodies or demand and accept female subservience, future generations are bound to marvel at how so many of their forebears could routinely feast while others went hungry, or how some ancestors could amass fortunes while others went begging. Like slavery and male domination in their time, the inequalities of our day are justified even in the most progressive circles as not only tolerable but also actually essential to economic growth and social harmony.
Our descendants will shake their heads in disbelief. But in that distant time, like Jefferson, we will surely want it said that things were never so black and white.

HEADLINE: Helping the Fish Return Upstream

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
SHAD and other anadromous fish -- even some salmon -- are back in the Connecticut River, thanks mainly to the construction of fishways that let fish get past the river's dams. But small streams with dams of their own, also matter, in a big way. Recent collaborative efforts have put fishways on lesser-known streams, and more such projects lie ahead. The plan is to boost not just the fish, but the ecosystem.
Anadromous species hatch in freshwater streams, spend their adult lives at sea, and return to their birth streams to spawn -- unless dams bring them to a halt. Besides the prized shad and salmon, they include alewife, blueback herring, sea-run brown trout and sea lamprey. All are valuable, even the ugly lamprey. 
 This spring fishways opened on two tributaries of the Connecticut in Lyme and Old Lyme. The Lyme Land Conservation Trust led efforts to build one on the Eightmile River, while the Old Lyme Conservation Trust worked to put one on the Mill Brook. "Someone in New Jersey has never heard of these streams," said Steve Gephard, a biologist with the Department of Environmental protection, "but they're important."
Basically, each of the new fishways is a sloping arrangement of four 10-foot aluminum sections (from the Sheepscot Machine Works of Newcastle, Me.), and other components. Each was installed to fit its particular location, has controlled water flow, and lets fish swim past a dam that long ago provided power for a nearby mill. Right from the start, each has proved a success. "We had this question," recalled Anthony Irving, president of the Lyme group. "Was this going to work? The first day we opened, we had herring migrating up."
Jennifer Hillhouse, president of the Old Lyme organization, reported similar success. "Within an hour, the first fish came in. I think it was an alewife," she said, noting its distinguishing fat belly. "Like an old alewife," she explained.
Autumn traffic on the fishways, Mr. Gephard added, includes juvenile alewives and bluebacks, bound for the sea. "What we call 'the young of the year' are going down these fishways in the fall," he said. Meanwhile, sea-run brown trout, which spawn in the fall, generally travel upstream from October through December.
Sea lampreys go up in the spring to spawn, then die. (The larvae remain in the mud for years before they emerge as miniature lampreys and head downstream.) Mr. Gephard stressed that while sea lampreys have caused problems in some areas, where they're an introduced species, in Connecticut streams -- where they've existed for centuries -- they're excellent food for many creatures.
Both new fishways are part of the Anadromous Fish Restoration Initiative, a long-term effort to improve the ecosystem of the lower Connecticut as well as conditions in Long Island Sound and beyond. Partners in the initiative are the D.E.P., the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge and the Connecticut River Watershed Council.
Tom Maloney, river steward for the council, calls the initiative "a food-chain support program." The idea is to have more fish as food for bigger fish, for birds like osprey and kingfishers, and for animals like river otter and mink.
Mr. Gephard also pointed out that having more bait fish coming and going at the mouth of the Connecticut adds to food stocks in the Sound and in the near waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Fishways, he said, "not only provide localized benefits, they contribute to the big picture -- the whole ecosystem." All that means better fishing, better birding and increased economic benefits.
Anadromous fish were in big trouble after centuries of development along the Connecticut and neighboring streams. Dams blocked them, pollution did further damage, salmon disappeared, and other species were greatly diminished.
Efforts begun in the 1960's to clean up the river, build big fishways, and restore fish have brought considerable success. "We had 670,000 shad this year -- a pretty healthy run," said Mr. Gephard. "With salmon, we've gone from zero to 300, 400 a year in the Connecticut. It's a start, especially since they were gone for 200 years."
Now efforts continue to open more streams. While the initiative prepares to build two more fishways, and improve another, on lower Connecticut tributaries, other groups are working to build fishways elsewhere, Mr. Gephard noted. And fishways are becoming more effective, said Mr. Maloney, as people learn more about just what various species require, such as particular slopes.
But it's not easy. While owners of big dams along the Connecticut were required by law to build huge fishways (costing millions), and a hydroelectric plant in Seymour is now putting a fishway on the Naugatuck River to meet licensing requirements, most dams on smaller streams don't come under any laws. Nor can government agencies afford to build fishways everywhere. That's why cooperative endeavors are essential, said Mr. Gephard. The few fishways in Lyme and Old Lyme involved the Watershed Council, the towns, the land trusts, land owners, the D.E.P. and Federal programs. Each cost upwards of $75,000, with money coming from public and private sources. And in each case local people saw a need and got to work, while people like Mr. Gephard and Mr. Maloney provided expertise and support.
Mr. Irving recalled an action-spurring visit, around 1991, to the Moulson Pond Dam on the Eightmile River (so named because it ends -- in Hamburg Cove -- about eight miles upstream from the mouth of the Connecticut). "I was down there one day, and I saw a sea-run brown trout trying to jump over the dam," he said. "I called Steve and asked, 'Wouldn't it be a good idea to have a fish ladder?' We started working on it."
Land trust members tackled such tasks as getting engineering studies, raising money and working with various agencies. "We were just volunteers," said Mr. Irving. "It was a big education project."
To route fish around the dam and a privately owned hydroelectric plant, Mr. Gephard devised a plan that put the fishway between two sluiceways, one of which needed to be reopened.
Sue Hessel and Karen Dahle, the property owners, who live in what was once a mill, granted an easement for the project. Now the Moulson Pond Fishway stretches across their backyard in a channel lined with large rocks found nearby. "We made a point of making this look as natural as possible," said Mr. Maloney.
Working on the Mill Brook (the headwaters of the Lieutenant River, which flows into the Connecticut) is the Mary Griswold Steube Fishway. Mrs. Steube, who died early this year, originally granted an easement for the fishway, then willed the property to the land trust. Other help came from many sources, said Mrs. Hillhouse. She especially recalled an anonymous donation of $10,000 that arrived one day after trust members had been wearily collecting cash from little cans that they'd placed in local bait shops.
Mr. Maloney noted that volunteers now look after both fishways. They check water flow and temperature, count fish and clear debris. "You can have an $80,000 fishway, but if there's one log, there's no fish," he said, as Mrs. Hillhouse bent down to remove twigs from the fishway.
Before putting in that fishway, supporters checked with people like James Tripp, who lives with his family in an old mill just across the Lower Mill Pond Dam. The scene was once lively, with mills, stores and other operations, but today the Tripps' view is mostly of water, woods and fields. Maybe, Mrs. Hillhouse said, they didn't want to gaze on "an aluminum thing."
But the Tripps welcomed the fishway. "Fish come in by the thousands," said Mr. Tripp, a sculptor. "You see ospreys circling ahead of time, watching the brook." He and his family have seen river otters, mink, kingfishers, great blue herons and other wildlife. "When the fish come," he said, "everybody shows up."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND JOURNAL;
North Fork Duck Farmer Holds His Ground

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
SURVIVING as a duck farmer in the suburbs isn't easy.
Especially when you're raising 140,000 white Pekin ducklings in the backyard. 
 "Houses have grown up around us," said Douglas Corwin, a fourth-generation farmer who lives on the edge of his 140-acre duck farm just past the fringe of Riverhead. "This is not a perfume factory." As the last duck farmer on the North Fork, Mr. Corwin, 39, worries about more than the pungent odor of live ducks and the dogs and raccoons that occasionally sneak into his pens.
As the sixth-largest duck producer in the nation, Mr. Corwin's family-owned and operated Crescent Duck Farm harvests 800,000 to 900,000 ducklings a year, 4.5 percent of all ducklings sold in the country.
The only way the business can make it, Mr. Corwin said, is by breeding a premium bird, improving the succulent variety that gave Long Island duckling a national reputation before higher costs and stricter environmental regulations drove most duck farmers either out of business or to the Midwest.
"Labor's expensive, utilities are expensive, land is expensive," he said. "Feed is 15 to 20 percent higher than in the the Midwest, where it's readily available. We can only overcome the costs with quality and service." Mr. Corwin, whose ducklings end up a l'orange or confit on plates at high-end restaurants like the Four Seasons and Tribeca Grill in Manhattan and at Starr Boggs in Westhampton, has no intention of moving.
"I don't know if I'd want to live in the middle of Indiana, Illinois or Ohio," said Mr. Corwin, sitting in his pickup truck on a gravel road in the middle of his farm with nothing but fluffy white ducks in sight, "where the idea of a good time is to go to Cleveland for a weekend, just to be a low-cost duck producer. There have been operators who have moved that way and done that."
Half a century ago, more than 100 duck farms dotted the East End. Climatic conditions, sandy soil and proximity to water helped build the Long Island duckling's culinary reputation, said Joseph Gergela, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau.
Requirements to install sewage treatment facilities to alleviate pollution to nearby bays in the 1970's forced farmers who couldn't afford compliance out of business.
Not only the ducks have flown the coop. Just one turkey farm and one chicken producer remain on Long Island. The last dairy farm went out of business in 1986. And only 6,000 acres of potato fields are left, where once there were 70,000, Mr. Gergela said.
While three other duck farmers still work on the South Fork, Mr. Corwin, who hatches 20,000 baby ducks a week, is the largest breeder. And his Eastport feed mill is the only one left on Long Island.
"This is a high-cost area to farm," Mr. Gergela said. "It's very hard to be competitive. They're not making any more land, it's high valued. It's an equity issue. For farmers, their land is their pension.
"We're not farming in a rural area anymore," he continued. "It's suburbia, and it's a suburban value system. People complain about irrigation systems running on Sunday morning. Farmers have to live with their neighbors. People have moved from west to east to live out here where the remaining farmlands are. While they want to enjoy the esthetics of the area, they don't understand the noise, odor and dust that goes along with farming."
Despite the urban sprawl, Suffolk County remains the leading agricultural county in New York, based on the wholesale value of its agricultural products. As the duck industry declined, the grape and wine industry developed and greenhouse and nursery production expanded. Mr. Corwin, who sells more than $7 million worth of ducks a year and employs 85 workers, isn't complaining. Instead, the scientist, businessman and farmer -- who pursued agricultural economics at Cornell University -- relies on advanced genetics, statistics and four computerized duck diets.
"They eat a much better balanced diet than a human eats," Mr. Corwin said, ticking off a list of nutrients, proteins, vitamins and amino acids he feeds his developing ducks and breeders. "They eat what they need to eat. We eat what we want to eat." The Corwins have 7,000 laying females at any given time, each of which lays 200 eggs a year. He picks the parents, grandparents and great-grandparents of his breeding stock from seven different strains to create a more meaty, less fatty duck. Ducks he can be proud of.
"They're smart for poultry," he said, wandering into the nursery. Hundreds of 2-week-old ducks stood and waddled about at his approach, nary an ugly duckling in sight. "They know me. If I wear a red shirt, they get all mad. They're smarter than turkeys or chickens. You can herd these animals from one building to another. You can't get turkeys to move. Ducks aren't as spasmodic as turkeys. They are much more fluid in their motions. You feel proud when you see a nice, comfortable, uniform group like this," said Mr. Corwin, admitting that he is not entirely comfortable harvesting his flock.
Ducklings mature into ducks at six to seven weeks. Along the way, Mr. Corwin pointed out, their voices change. Females ducks quack; male ducks make belching noises. In the farmyard, he grabs a 5-week-old duck by its neck and runs his hand down its chest, pointing out the broad, thick expanse of muscle along its flat keel bone. He weighs the duck on a scale, then uses ultrasound to measure the thickness of its muscle tissue.
"We're trying to take the genetics of a duckling and make it something that is desirable to a consumer, he said. "We're in the meat-production business. Traditionally, ducks had less meat per pound, but now we're making them tremendously meaty, much more than 10 to 15 years ago, while marginalizing the fat."
A three-and-a-half-ounce serving of his skinless duckling breast has half the fat of the same amount of skinless chicken breast. "The muscle tissue rivals any meat nutritionally," he said. "But duck has always had a negative connotation. People don't eat enough of it. People don't cook enough of it."
Four years ago, Mr. Corwin created an artificial wetland on his property to treat waste water. He's about to invest in a new sewage treatment plant.
"What was good for the 70's, 80's and 90's won't be good for the next century," Mr. Corwin said. "The technologies have increased in waste treatment so much you'd be foolish to ignore them. It's an ecologically sensitive area. Being out here on eastern Long Island, it's a tourist area. The Peconic Bay is an important shellfish area. We have to be proactive, not reactive. We just want to be able to have what we have and keep on doing what we're doing and making a decent living doing it."
Mr. Corwin's self-contained business makes use of every duck part. Duck feet are sold to Chinese restaurants. A quarter of a million pounds of feathers are laundered and baled after processing for use in down jackets and comforters.
In the poultry world, duck is small potatoes. Twenty-one million ducks are consumed a year, versus two billion chickens. According to the Duckling Council, consumption is going up 5 to 7 percent a year.
Sometimes, Mr. Corwin takes a thick lobe of duck, marinates and grills it. "A duck steak cooked medium rare tastes more like beef than what you would think," he said.
Could be. Just don't ask his spouse.
"My wife, Tami, doesn't like duck," he said. "We've been married 17 years. Maybe she's eaten it once or twice. She's cooked it maybe once or twice. We're going out for our anniversary tomorrow night. We're going to a seafood restaurant."

HEADLINE: In the Region/ Connecticut;
Revamping UConn Storrs for Over $300 Million

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE in the School of Fine Arts complex at the southern end of the University of Connecticut's main campus in Storrs, a student practiced on a French horn.
Suddenly a horn of a different timbre resounded, once, twice, three times, a warning followed moments later by a muffled explosion as construction crews blasted away a ledge for the $10-million Fine Arts Center, which will include a new music library and performance hall, part of the first major construction on the campus in a decade. 
 "These are people who would normally complain if a light fixture was making a humming noise, but they're putting up with it, because everyone is so excited about what's happening," said Robert H. Gray, the dean of the school. "The place is coming alive. It's like watching the school wake up."
At the north end of campus, sidewalk discussions were disrupted by construction noises from a former plaza between the physics and biology buildings where a $37.9-million, 133,000-square-foot addition to the science complex is taking shape. In the middle of the campus, workers took the wraps off a $40-million library renovation -- literally. Because bricks had been falling off the old building it had been draped in plastic almost a decade, but the renovated building was dedicated Oct. 18.
The university is charging ahead with changes called for in a master plan developed over the last few years, with funds from a 10-year, $1-billion program known as UConn 2000, most of it devoted to Storrs. In the $382-million Phase 1, which concludes next year, about 80 percent of the funds and all but four of the 30 major projects will go to the 4,400-acre main campus.
"We will move forward from a campus that is unattractive, and technologically underdeveloped, to a beautiful, technologically advanced campus that will make the students part of the process of learning," said Philip Austin, the university's president.
Chancellor Mark A. Emmert said a successful university must have a recruiting "funnel." "The more students and faculty you have to choose from at the top, the more selective you can be at the bottoms," he explained.
"UConn 2000 and the master plan have really opened up the top of the funnel," Dr. Emmert said. "We're seeing a lot more interest in UConn at every level, everywhere in the country. It's really ratcheted things up."
For most of this century, the university has had a reputation as an agricultural school. For two decades administrators have tried to redefine it as a leading research college, with limited success, until the state approved UConn 2000 three years ago.
There will still be agriculture, but it will be agriculture for the 21st century, in a new $13.8-million biotechnology building, in addition to a new $25.6-million School of Business Administration and in a new $4-million pharmacy building. There will also be recreational projects, such as a $4.35-million renovated ice rink that has been expanded to 50,465 square feet, and residential projects, such as the recently completed $12.3-million South Campus dormitory complex.
THE sturdy, brick turn-of-the-century buildings at the east end of campus, and the newer 60's and 70's buildings at the western end, are being renovated. The Family Studies building, a World War I-era edifice, has been repainted and renovated. The walls are now large display screens linked to personal computers, the Internet, or other electronic systems on campus.
"In the confines of buildings that are 70 or 80 years old, we've done things that make a dramatic difference in the quality of learning," said Scott Brohinski, the university's director of governmental relations, who helped build support for UConn 2000 in the legislature.
Many of the buildings in the center of the campus have come down, or are scheduled for demolition. "These are 1950's 'get-'em-up-fast' kind of buildings," Mr. Brohinski said. "This is a makeover that will change the way people feel about themselves, and about the institution."
The university is situated in a rural setting in the Town of Mansfield, so town officials have been invited to sit in on the planning sessions, and there have been compromises to make sure the work is acceptable to local residents.
"The master plan, for the most part, really deals with the core of the university, and in that respect doesn't have a major impact on the town," said Town Manager Martin H. Berliner. "There were some questions about traffic, and parking, but we've worked on those issues. I think it generally is supported by the town."
Larry G. Schilling, the university architect who oversees the planning staff for UConn 2000, said that there were about 20 major contractors on campus, and close to 1,000 workers. He has hired the Bechtel Corporation, a worldwide construction company, as the construction manager.
He tries to make sure that the projects don't overlap, to avoid major disruptions to traffic and having construction crews hampering one another.
But in an area about the size of a city block, he had the new biology and physics project, the chemistry building and a $13.2-million upgrading of a heating all under way at the same time this year.
Dr. Arthur W. Dimock, assistant chairman of the chemistry department, has for the last 10 years headed the committee planning the new 200,000-square-foot, $56.8-million chemistry building now nearing completion that will replace 75,000 square feet in two buildings now.
"But in fact, we're going to have much more space than the numbers would suggest," Dr. Dimock said. "The space we're in now was designed in the 1950s. I'm not sure it was well thought out even for that time, and our needs have changed considerably since then."
FOR instance, most chemistry research now is done under hoods that whisk away any dangerous vapors; the old building had fewer than 60, but the new one will have more than 230. There are a dozen safety showers for people in the old building; now there will be more than 80.
"We hope never to have a need for them, but you feel a little more comfortable knowing that they're there," Dr. Dimock said.
The university is also encouraging partnerships with industry. This year, Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $19-million laboratory for animal vaccine research on campus that it will share with the university. That partnership, Dr. Emmert said, will tie into the school's key strengths in agriculture, biotechnology, pathobiology and pharmaceutical science.
"You enter into those relationships very carefully," Dr. Emmert said. "Intellectual freedom is very important to us. Pfizer's commitment to research was absolutely a critical factor in our decision. What's absolutely critical is that we not engage in development and partnerships randomly, but that we do it in a highly selective, highly focused manner."
But Dr. Emmert said the most exciting change was not the most expensive. This summer, Fairfield Road, which bisects the campus from east to west, was torn up for a $1.8-million pedestrian mall bordered by the renovated library, a new Student Union and other student centers.
"It will redefine the core of the campus as a place where you go, and stay," Dr. Emmert said. "I'm a big fan of loitering. The best campuses are the ones that encourage people to hang around, where you have to shoo the faculty and students home at 2 o'clock in the morning because they just want to be there."
Dr. Austin said that after UConn 2000 is completed, the university will be able to win state support for follow-up elements of its master plan, because officials will see that the university will help revitalize the state economy, and that research there will help spin off new companies that will pay taxes and create jobs.
"We want to make it so obvious, four or five years from now, that what the legislature did was such a wise move, other people and organizations will support the work of the university," Dr. Austin said. "Then, six or seven years from now, we will assess where we are, and if we're as successful as I think we will be at attracting new students and more outside investment, the state may see that it makes sense to do even more."

HEADLINE: New Routes for Moving the Workers to Work, Bus Style

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE bus, not more traffic lanes, is the way to relieve highway congestion. Commuters will park their cars and hop on, if the bus is comfortable and convenient. So say transportation planners studying shifting travel patterns and a changing economy.
Bus routes, established decades ago, usually radiate from the center of a city like the spokes of a wheel. The design enabled them to carry suburban riders to and from the city. But the pattern is changing as more businesses move to suburban locations, and commuters look for different routes. "All over the country, we've realized that the hub-and-spoke system of transportation doesn't reflect where people are going," said David Lee, general manager of Connecticut Transit, the state-owned bus system that serves Hartford, New Haven and Stamford. "We're seeing a lot more suburb-to-suburb travel. Stores, movies and doctors' offices that used to be in downtown Hartford are now in the suburbs." And so, in 1996, the state's Department of Transportation established routes between suburbs. The X-Route, Connecticut Transit's first new route in 15 years, runs from Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester through East Hartford and Glastonbury, crosses the Putnam Bridge into Wethersfield and ends up at the Wethersfield Shopping Center. Stops along the way include Charter Oak Shopping Center, Putnam Bridge Plaza and Somerset Square. The number of riders averages an estimated 350 each weekday. The I-Bus provides weekday express service between downtown Stamford and White Plains. Passengers can transfer to local buses, shuttles and Metro-North or Amtrak trains. Connecticut Transit, under contract with the Connecticut and New York State transportation departments, operates the service. The I-Bus is a federally funded pilot project intended to relieve heavy traffic in the Interstate 95 and Interstate 287 corridors between Stamford and White Plains. The number of passengers averages almost 300 day. A shuttle between Danbury and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad's Harlem Line train station in Brewster, N.Y., was started in October to serve commuters to New York City or White Plains. Metro-North trains run more frequently from Brewster than from Danbury. The shuttle is sponsored by the Transportation Departments of New York State and Connecticut. 
 Federal programs designed to move people off welfare and into jobs helped prompt the growth of travel between suburbs and from cities to suburbs. Regional agencies receive Federal funds to pay for transportation for people making the transition from welfare to work.
Mr. Lee said there is interest in starting bus service along Route 1, between Milford and Norwalk, that would not require passengers to change buses. "It hasn't started yet," Mr. Lee added, "but it's likely to be part of the next phase of welfare to work service."
Michael Sanders, administrator for transit and ride sharing for the Transportation Department, said the X-Route had not been as successful as hoped. "I think a network of services will have to be set up, not just a single route," he said.
The state's Transportation Department is evaluating the 16 transit systems it supports or operates. Richard Martinez, chief of policy and planning for the Transportation Department, said: "We're going to look at those systems to see if the routing is correct and determine whether or not we would pick up more passengers and respond better to changes in development if we moved a route. Some were established in the 1970's."
Mr. Martinez said the study would also examine how the transit districts are financed and governed. The Transportation Department, which currently pays 99 percent of the operations deficit for transit districts, will decide whether to continue that level of support or ask for a larger share from local agencies. The department will also consider whether the transit districts should be operated by the state or another body.
Five separate transit systems provide local bus service in the Route 1 corridor between New Haven and Greenwich.
"These districts are organized to work only in their areas. Sometimes there are connections between them, but they're not the best," said Mr. Lee. "Our vision is a statewide system, and we're asking where the gaps are that make it difficult for people to use the bus."
A step was taken this year to improve connections. At the Derby railroad station, buses from New Haven and Bridgeport link with Valley Transit District buses, which operate in towns in the Naugatuck Valley, and Metro-North's Waterbury branch. The Bridgeport bus was added to transport people who had recently left the welfare rolls and taken jobs, Mr. Lee said.
Genia McDuffie, who lives in White Plains and works in Stamford, said her commute on the I-Bus, a product of a connection across state lines, is seamless. She has a 10-minute walk from her home to the bus stop, where she is picked up, taken to the Stamford Transportation Center and boards the shuttle that takes her to her office.
"As soon as the bus arrives, I get on the shuttle," Ms. McDuffie said. "There's no wait."
Ms. McDuffie would not have taken the job in Stamford if the bus had not been available, she added, because the trip by train and bus would take at least an hour. The I-Bus and shuttle get her to work in about 35 minutes.
Word about this convenience is getting around, Ms. McDuffie added, and seats on the bus are filling up. "I've seen people on the bus who have cars and could drive," she said.
Southeast Area Transit District, which operates in nine towns in southeastern Connecticut, is proposing a regional plan in which bus routes would connect 12 towns in the region and provide local service in Groton, New London, Norwich, Waterford and Stonington.
The time between the departure of one bus and the arrival of another at the same stop would be shortened. Also in the plan is the building of major transportation centers in Norwich and North Stonington.
The current Southeast Area Transit system was designed more than 20 years ago. Over the past 5 years, the region's economy has undergone drastic changes, which have placed new demands on the transportation system. Military-based industries laid off thousands of workers, who made up a large portion of the bus ridership, and the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos opened. With the growth of the gaming and tourism industries, southeastern Connecticut has become a year-round tourist destination.
A bus traveling one morning from Groton to New London and Norwich carried a student at the University of Connecticut's Avery Point Campus, a housekeeper at the Navy Base in Groton, two people who work on night shifts at the casinos and a man who said he lives on the street.
The bus, which has a capacity of 64 passengers, never carried more than a dozen people at any time. But Melvin Prince, who lives in Norwich and works as a cook at the Radisson Hotel in New London, said mass transit saved him.
"I've been riding the bus for the past eight months," Mr. Prince said, "and it's always on time. People might see these buses and think nobody uses them, but they have some faithful riders."
The Capitol Region Council of Governments, comprising mayors and first selectmen of 29 towns in the Hartford area, is considering ways of developing a regional transit system in Greater Hartford.
"One of the primary goals is to determine how to pay for improved transit and build public support for it," said the director of the council, Richard Porth. The council received a state grant to support bus service for former welfare recipients who have found jobs. The route, which follows the Berlin Turnpike from Hartford to Newington, takes most riders from their homes in the city to jobs in the suburbs. "We're moving about 800 people," Mr. Porth said.
The radial routes will continue to be useful in city-to-suburb travel, Mr. Lee said. Banks and insurance companies in downtown Hartford are still destinations for many commuters, and plans are underway to make the downtown area attractive as an entertainment center.
The latest plan to lessen highway traffic is a busway on Interstate 84 between downtown Hartford and New Britain, the stretch where traffic is the heaviest. Mr. Martinez said he hopes to have approval for the project from the Council of Governments by early next year, clearing the way for receiving Federal transportation funds.
"We made a decision that we wouldn't build a new lane in the I-84 corridor," Mr. Martinez said. "Adding a fourth lane would just perpetuate the congestion. We looked at the idea of light rail. But the best idea in terms of cost and potential usage was the busway." Trains are not workable in places like Connecticut, where the population density is low, Mr. Martinez added, and light rail is expensive to build and maintain. In addition, buses allow more flexibility with pick-up and drop-off points. The strongest argument against busways is that commuters won't ride the bus, Mr. Lee said.
What will convert commuters, however, is adequate parking, a terminal with amenities and undisrupted travel to their destinations, he said. "Once you give people those things," he explained, "they don't care whether a vehicle has steel wheels or rubber tires."

HEADLINE: Single-Screen Theaters Find Their Days (And Nights) Numbered

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
THE LAST PICTURE SHOW" would have been an appropriate film to feature at the Branford Theater on Oct. 10. That was the day that John and Lee Vogel closed the theater they had operated in the center of town for the last 23 years. As it was, the final feature attraction was the far more recent "Studio 54."
"We fought as long as we could, but we just couldn't compete with the 10-screen Hoyt's complex about a mile and a half away that opened last January," said Mrs. Vogel, who began working at the theater selling candy in 1965. "It was sad because we ran a clean, friendly, community-type of movie theater that had been a part of Branford for a long time." 
 Indeed, the Branford Cinema had been part of the town's scene for 61 years. The original building was gutted by a fire in February 1953, but the theater was rebuilt and reopened eight months later. Still, even though its top ticket price of $4 was about half that of the Hoyt complex on Route 1, the 880-seat Branford Cinema with its huge screen could not withstand the competition. Neither, apparently, can two movie theaters on the Post Road in Westport -- one with two screens and the other with one -- that will close Jan. 7, in large measure because of strong competition from a six-screen multiplex that opened a few miles away on the Post Road in Norwalk in November of last year. In an era when single-screen movie theaters are becoming a vanishing part of Americana, several other old movie houses also have closed, including those in Canaan, Cheshire, Madison and Milford. But intensive efforts by community groups are afoot in Canaan and Cheshire to reopen theaters that many residents feel are an integral part of those towns.
Meanwhile, following a heated controversy, construction is expected to begin next spring on a quadriplex cinema in the Wilton town center, which has never had a movie theater; a single-screen theater in the town on Route 7 closed several years ago. Opponents of the new theater, which will be adjacent to a planned 10,000-square-foot retail development, have contended that the multiplex will create traffic problems and negatively alter the character of the town of approximately 17,000 residents in lower Fairfield County.
After a downturn in movie attendance in the 1950's and 60's that was attributed to television, more people than ever seem to be going to the movies in Connecticut. Indeed, there are now about 480 movie screens -- not individual movie theaters -- in the state, compared with about 350 a decade ago in the state, according to Milt Daly, the president of the Connecticut Association of Theater Owners and the chief operating officer of Crown Theaters of Norwalk.
The vast majority of the state's moviegoers are viewing films at multiplex centers like the six-screen Crown Royale on Westport Avenue, one of two Crown multiplexes in Norwalk, which has sharply cut into the business of the two Westport theaters that are being closed. The announcement of the closings came as a surprise, since Westport has long been a magnet for moviegoers in central Fairfield County.
"All three theaters had been doing well, but business has fallen off since the multiplex in Norwalk opened," said Mark Pascucci, a spokesman for Loew's Cineplex Entertainment in New Yok, which operates the two theaters along with a third in Westport, the Post Cinema, which will remain open.
"It's no longer economically feasible to operate theaters with one, two, three or even four screens," Mr. Pascucci said. "And nowadays most people gravitate towards the multiplexes where you have far more choices. Our lease on the buildings with the two theaters runs out in January, and, in a mutual agreement with the landlord, we decided to leave."
Mr. Pascucci said he expected the buildings, which are in downtown Westport, would be converted to retail use. "I know they have other options for the sites," he said.
While the Westport theaters and the one in Branford apparently can blame their demise on multiplex cinemas, the Cheshire Cinema has been closed, at least temporarily, because of the building's condition and a longstanding battle between the theater operator and the building owner that has led to a court fight.
John Salomone, the Cheshire Town Manager, said town building inspectors had deemed the building unsafe because of falling bricks and masonry.
"It's strictly a matter of public safety," he said of the town's order to shut down the theater, which is situated on South Main Street, also Route 10, in the heart of the Cheshire business district. "We'd be welcome to an amicable agreement" between Peter Spodick, -- the theater operator, and Donald Stern, the building owner-- "since we feel the theater is an asset to the town."
Mr. Spodick, who also manages the three-screen York Square Cinemas in New Haven, has offered to pay for any necessary repairs, but Mr. Stern has asked the town to demolish the theater and an adjacent building that he owns and then place a lien on the property for reimbursement.
Despite competition from multiplex cinemas in nearby Meriden and Southington, Mr. Spodick said his theater has been doing well, even with ticket prices at just $2 to $4. "We are able to pick whatever pictures we want," said Mr. Spodick, whose 78-year-old father, Robert, has been a movie exhibitor for more than a half century in about a half dozen Connecticut cities and towns. "It's a matter of choice and consideration, and it works."
So much so that two Cheshire residents, Jackie Sully and James McCorkle, have banded together to raise money and obtain signatures on a petition to insure that the Cheshire Cinema will reopen.
"I've taken my two daughters to movies there quite often," Mr. McCorkle said. "And one day after the theater had closed, I was driving by with my 7-year-old daughter and told her what had happened. And she said, 'What are you going to do about it?' Then I called Jackie Scully and several others and we decided to get going. After all, this theater is a cultural landmark in town. It's clean, with great sound and has a lot of charm."
So far, Mr. McCorkle said, he and Ms. Scully, along with Thory Heye of Clinton, have raised more than $21,000 to be used for repairs to the theater. "We've also gotten about 2,300 names on petitions urging that the theater be saved and given them to the Town Council," Mr. McCorkle said. "We also brought in our own structural engineer from Hartford who said all the building needs are some cosmetic repairs."
Moviegoing hasn't been the same for many fans in northwestern Connecticut since the Colonial Theater in Canaan closed in January of last year, following the death of the owner, Shirley Boscardin. Since August a nonprofit organization known as the Colonial Community Theater Group Inc. has been raising money in an effort to buy and reopen the 75-year-old theater, which showed silent films and featured vaudeville acts when it opened in 1923.
"We expect it will cost about $1 million to buy the building and so far we've raised $25,000," said Nick Stuller, one of the organizers of the group, which has rented a storefront adjacent to the theater. "But we'll need a lot of donations and, hopefully, some money from the state."
Meanwhile in Enfield, north of Hartford, a group calling itself "Save Our Strand" has succeeded in obtaining a $1 million state grant to rehabilitate the 61-year-old Strand Theater, which closed as a movie house in the 1980's mainly because of competition from nearby multiplex cinemas.
"We plan to reopen as a performing arts center, but we will also have a classic film series and show movies for children from time to time," said Gerard Fitzsimons, one of those who formed the group. "At present, we're installing a new roof and hope to open by the end of next year."
In Wilton, the town's Planning and Zoning Commission on Sept. 28 approved, by a 5-2 vote, the plan to build a four-screen movie theater and an adjacent retail complex along River Road in what is known as Wilton Center. The action followed several contentious public hearings last summer during which opponents and proponents of the plan expressed their sentiments.
"I think it's a good idea and only wish they had a movie theater in town when I was growing up here," said Arlene Carlson, the owner of Boyd's of Wilton, a gift and card shop in a shopping center adjacent to where the movie theater will be built. "As it is now in Wilton Center, after sundown everyone runs home. And if you want to go to a movie, you have to go to Norwalk or Westport."
In fact, there are a half-dozen restaurants in the village, along with a supermarket, that are open at night. But, as Ms. Carlson pointed out, not much else goes on in Wilton Center at night. Further, traffic at night is extremely light in the village, which is close to Routes 7 and 33 but does not have a main highway running through as is the case in nearby Darien, Norwalk, Westport and Fairfield, all of which have movie theaters.
Even though the Wilton quadriplex would seem to be a competitor, Tony Sakalis, the manager of a video rental store in the same shopping center, said he would welcome the theater. "It will draw more people into town at night," Mr. Sakalis said. "And I don't think it will affect us, since people who want to watch movies at home will still come in and take out videos."
But Don Klotz, who operates a package design business in Wilton, decried the theater plan. "One screen would be fine, but not four," said Mr. Klotz who is the founder and head of a citizens' action group known as Common Sense Coalition. "The traffic pattern is going to be terrible, and we're going to wind up with a mall complex in town. I think we're inviting disaster. And the charm of the town is going to dissipate."
Richard Paukner, a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission who voted against the theater proposal, said "Wilton is one of the last vestiges of a small New England town in Fairfield County, one of a dying breed. And in my vision I don't see our streets in Wilton Center being able to handle all the traffic for a four-screen movie theater. I just don't think this is the way to go for Wilton."
When the multiplex cinema in Wilton does open, it will, most likely, not offer some of the amenities that Peter Spodick has at his 300-seat Cheshire Cinema. "I remember the first time I went there, Peter asked me if I'd like a cup of coffee," James McCorkle said. "Then while I was in my seat on the aisle in the darkened theater, he came down and gave me a cup of coffee. And if you happened to come in late, Peter would tell you what you missed."

HEADLINE: County Seeks Ways To Harvest Methane Gas At Landfill

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
WHAT Westchester does for today's garbage it also wants to do for the garbage of yesteryear: use it as fuel. Westchester officials are exploring ways to harvest the methane gas created by decaying garbage at the former Croton Point landfill, long the dumping ground for all of the county's garbage. That was until it was closed, capped and became a park about five years ago. Now the gas is simply burned.
The situation could change as the result of a $9.5 million budget item. The money would be used to do more research and eventually put into effect projects to convert the gas into usable energy. The item is in the county's proposed 1999 capital projects budget. 
 A gas collection system is already working at the landfill. Robert N. Matarazzo, the county's Deputy Commissioner of Environmental Facilities, said there are alternative uses of the energy, which could be generated over 25 years in varying amounts. Mr. Matarazzo and the county's consultant, Dr. Rengachari (Nivas) Srinivasaraghavan, president of Savin Engineers in Tarrytown, said the alternatives include the following.
*The gas could be used to generate electricity to serve Croton Point Park and run the pumps at the landfill. About 15 million kilowatts of electricity a year could possibly be generated. Savin Engineers has designed a generator, and bids could be awarded next year to build it. A drawback is that power companies appear willing to pay only a few cents a kilowatt for electricity, Dr. Srinivasaraghavan said, so the economic returns are not certain.
*The gas could be purified and made into compressed natural gas, known as CNG, to run the county's fleet of cars, trucks and buses. The county has already shown in the first phase of its methane use program that purification of the landfill gas is feasible. Some county trucks have been converted and are running some of the time on compressed natural gas. Ultimately, from 1.4 million to 2.6 million cubic feet of gas could be generated a day, for about 30 years, Dr. Srinivasaraghavan said. This is equal to between 1 million and 4 million gallons of gas a year, Mr. Matarazzo said. The drawback to this proposal is that vehicles must be refitted to use the energy. It would cost about $5,000 for passenger cars and $10,000 to $12,000 for buses and trucks.
*The county could build a hydroponic (water-based agriculture) and fish farm at a two-acre site at the Croton Point landfill, to be run either by the county or a private company. Under this plan, the methane gas would be used to heat and purify the tanks and greenhouses and re-circulate the water, among other uses. The products -- mainly tilapia, a warm-water fish -- would be sold. Dr. Srinivasaraghavan said that 800,000 pounds of fish could be produced a year, and that the fish currently sell for $2.50 to $3 a pound wholesale. He estimated that the project could raise $1.5 million to $2.5 million a year for the county. The advantage of this approach, he said, is that the return on investment is quicker. The disadvantage is that the county does not know any company using methane gas to fuel such an undertaking, but the county could set up its own project next year to test the idea, he said.
Westchester's efforts to harvest usable energy from the Croton Point landfill parallels what it did in the early 1980's with its garbage incinerator at Charles Point in Peekskill. The garbage burned there is used to generate electricity, which is in turn sold to Consolidated Edison, from 2 to 3 cents a kilowatt hour.
Like that plan in its infancy, the one at Croton Point has its cadre of skeptics who question whether the technology exists to justify the cost. "My concern is that we are being asked to commit $9.5 million of taxpayers' money when we don't know the efficacy of this," said County Legislator Katherine S. Carksy, a Republican from Yonkers.
Richard R. Knabel, a member of the board of directors of Federated Conservationists of Westchester County and a professor of physical science at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, said, "The idea of using the gas makes sense, but to spend $9.5 million sounds like a lot of money."
Both he and Mrs. Carksy said they wanted more details before they could endorse the proposal. For that reason, the Board of Legislators last Monday delayed a vote on issuing the first $2 million in bonds for the project, Mrs. Carsky said. While this year and in previous years, the Board has approved capital projects budgets that included this $2 million in spending, the actual bond authorization had never been approved by the Board, as is required by law.
Michael B. Kaplowitz, a Democratic Legislator, whose district includes Croton-on-Hudson, was generally enthusiastic about the concept of using the gas for energy. He said that spending $9.5 million did not bother him if the county could recoup it in energy savings. "But I am concerned about the visual, the esthetic," he added, referring to the proposed fish farm and greenhouse.
The question of how to use the methane gas has been under discussion for about three years.
Dr. Srinivasaraghavan said he considered and rejected a number of other possible uses for the methane gas. Those included the production of synthetic fuels like diesel or methanol, the production of electricity or gas for large projects at the Metro-North's Croton-Harmon maintenance site, or using the gas in some form to burn sludge at the nearby Water Treatment Plant in Ossining.

Chart: "RECOVERING METHANE GAS"
An example of what could be done at Croton Point Park to turn garbage into usable fuel is the methane recovery system in the Meadowlands in New Jersey. There 111 vertical wells are connected to underground pipes. At certain points a section loops above the surface. The gas is sucked out of the wells, which vary from 50 to 100 feet, under vacuum. Once collected, the gas goes to a processing plant, where it is compressed and treated to remove excess moisture and other contaminants.

HEADLINE: Finding Home Values on a Florida Coast

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
EXPLORERS are still arriving along the northeast coast of Florida. Ponce de Leon was looking for the Fountain of Youth when he reached what is now St. Augustine in 1513. He didn't discover it -- but maybe Nobuko Koop has come as close as anyone will.
A newly retired financial analyst with the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington, Ms. Koop has moved into a one-story ranch house that was built for her on land she bought a year ago in Grand Haven, a new community in Palm Coast, 30 miles south of St. Augustine. 
"I sold my house in June and the next day I headed south," Ms. Koop said. "I've been playing golf five days a week ever since. If I had to describe my life in one sentence, I would say I am on a perpetual vacation, with the convenience and comfort of my own home."
Another of Ms. Koop's discoveries was that these indulgences cost less than they do in comparable communities in southwest or southeast Florida. It is a point that was made by several other recent arrivals, golfers and otherwise, encountered on the 65-mile stretch of the northeast coast from Ponte Vedra Beach in the Jacksonville area to Daytona Beach to the south. It was echoed by newcomers even in the very different environment of historic St. Augustine.
Ms. Koop wound up spending about $200,000 for a three-bedroom ranch with a lake at the rear and views of the 13th and 16th fairways of a new golf course. She said she had taken almost all the upgrades offered by a Palm Coast builder, Arthur Rutenberg. The house has 1,760 square feet of space and was offered at a base price of $160,000.
North of central St. Augustine, Donald and Jacqueline Bosley, retired schoolteachers and avid golfers from Smith Mountain Lake, Va., near Roanoke, bought a lot for $90,000 on a lake at the new World Golf Village, the first project at the 6,000-acre Saint Johns master-planned community in St. Johns County. They are planning to build a house in the $300,000 to $350,000 range. The land is midway between downtown St. Augustine and Jacksonville.
The Bosleys said they spent four years looking at golf communities in southeast and southwest Florida. "We probably would have had to spend 20 or 25 percent more to buy in other places we looked," among them Venice and the Fort Myers areas, both in southwestern Florida, Mrs. Bosley said.
All is not golf, however, in northeast Florida. In the 15-mile oceanfront stretch running south from Matanzas Inlet to Flagler Beach along Route A1A -- halfway between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach -- the appeal is the ocean. Condominium prices are about 40 to 50 percent below those in oceanfront communities in South Florida, said Robert F. Follansbee, who runs Wolcott Realty in Flagler Beach. They range from $75,000 to $145,000, he said. Population density is thin in comparison with South Florida, and much of the development that has occurred aims at a moderate-income market.
Lower land prices in a region of relatively lesser market demand account for the lower price structure. Charles R. Clark, a real estate consultant based in Ponte Vedra Beach, estimated that lower land prices have made it possible for buyers to pay 20 percent to 40 percent less for new homes in vacation communities in the area than they would pay in the more developed vacation- and retirement-oriented centers of southeast or southwest Florida.
In and near Jacksonville there is a substantial burst in primary housing, both rentals and sales, in a wide range of prices, a result of economic growth. One builder there is Mercedes Homes, based in Melbourne. Cora Johnston, president of the company's Jacksonville division, estimated that 5,600 new homes a year were being built in the Jacksonville metropolitan area and that probably 70 percent of the buyers were buying in Florida for the first time, an indication of the region's economic growth.
"As few as 3 percent of our buyers are second-home purchasers," Ms. Johnston said. The Mercedes houses sell for $180,000 to $280,000, and are generally priced a notch lower than other new housing in the immediate area. For example, the company's houses sell in that range at Oceans Edge in Ponte Vedra. Nearby, the average price in recent sales is $611,000 at the high-end Marsh Landing golf-course community.
But it is the new master-planned communities of Saint Johns -- with its World Golf Village as the first major phase of development -- and Grand Haven in Palm Coast that show the region in its strengthened role as a destination and ultimate resettlement location for vacationers and retirees.
A golf course designed by Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen has been completed only within the last year at World Golf Village. The Golf Hall of Fame opened there in May. A hotel and a midrise time-share resort hotel have been completed, and now new home construction is moving forward apace.
There have been 100 house sales so far in first-phase developments by both national and local builders, with homes selling for $180,000 to about $600,000, said Rob Kearney, the marketing vice president. The first occupants arrived in June.
The Grand Haven site in Palm Coast was sold by ITT Community Development Corporation to Lowe Enterprises, of Brentwood, Calif., two years ago. ITT started developing Palm Coast in the 70's on portions of over 100,000 acres of timberland that it owned in Flagler County. The development area was ultimately scaled down to 42,000 acres, and much of it is still undeveloped although many lots have been sold for future construction. But over 33,000 people live there already, many year-round, in such neighborhoods as Indian Trails, Pine Lakes, Sea Colony and Palm Harbor.
It was ITT that developed Palm Coast's first master-planned community, the high-end Hammock Dunes, between the Intracoastal Waterway and the ocean. Lot sales began in 1990, and there are already 376 completed homes -- single-families and condominium units. Its unsold single-family home sites -- currently 154 -- are among the few assets that ITT still retains at Palm Coast, and they are expected to be sold in the near future to another development group. There is nevertheless a sales office on site for developable lots and completed condominium homes. The condominiums start at $315,000 and the building lots sell from the mid-$130,000's to $750,000.
The nearby Grand Haven is on 998 acres on the inland side of the Intracoastal. It will reach a much broader middle-income market than Hammock Dunes. The master developer, Grand Haven Palm Coast Inc., a Lowe affiliate, is building the streets and other common facilities, and last May it completed an 18-hole golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus.
Home building is proceeding apace. Lowe itself is developing three single-family-home neighborhoods, with five local home builders authorized to do custom residential construction. Two national builders -- Centex Homes, based in Dallas, and Pulte Home Corporation, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -- are building in three other residential neighborhoods.
Prices for lots range from the mid-$30,000's to the low $200,000's, the higher prices being for lots along the Intracoastal. Home construction began 18 months ago, and so far 175 houses are completed or under construction. There is a golf club, in which membership is optional at a cost of $150 a month, and a village center with health and fitness facilities.
Through Centex or Pulte, home-and-lot packages are available from the high $130,000's to the low $200,000's. One of Pulte's buyers was Dennis Brydges, an executive with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Washington, and his wife, Evelyn. They closed in October on a $165,000 patio home on a lake, in walking distance of the golf course. "In Naples we couldn't have gotten something like this for under $250,000," Mr. Brydges said.
I F past trends hold true we would expect that 30 to 35 percent of our buyers will be avid golfers," said Bill Haussmann, vice president for sales. "The rest will be occasional golfers or they will be attracted to other amenities." Most buyers are retirees with incomes in the range of $75,000 to $125,000 a year, he said.
Another new golf-oriented project in the area is in Daytona Beach. Indigo Development Inc., a subsidiary of Consolidated Tomoka Land Company, a publicly held company based in Daytona Beach, is developing the LPGA International golf community in cooperation with the Ladies Professional Golf Association and the city.
Two 18-hole golf courses have been completed, one of them only last October, and in the first phase of residential development 57 houses are completed or under construction. The entrance to the site is near a new LPGA Boulevard Interchange on Interstate 95.
Local builders are producing single-family houses, close to a completed course designed by Reese Jones, at prices ranging from $125,000 to $750,000. A 3,000-square-foot home on a third of an acre on the golf course, with four bedrooms and a pool and a two-car garage, would sell for about $330,000, said William H. McMunn, president of Indigo.
Nowhere does golf enthusiasm ride higher than it does at World Golf Village. Buyers are paying a premium for condominium units that offer a direct view of the World Golf Hall of Fame itself. Ecogroup Ltd., based in Tampa, is developing 200 condominium units selling for $250,000 to about $500,000 in buildings of one, two and three stories. They use as a facade element a fieldstone from Tennessee and Alabama that is frequently used in home construction in mid-Atlantic states. The style contrasts markedly with the Spanish or Mediterranean stucco-and-tile-roof look found in southern Florida.
The names of golf heroes of the past are embedded in the cobblestones of a circular walkway, about a mile long, that connects the major elements at the center of the development: 80,000 square feet of new shops under construction, the completed 300-room World Golf Village Resort Hotel, and the 180-foot tower of the hall of fame itself.
The PGA Tour, the professional organization of tournament players and the organization that runs tournaments in the United States, has had its headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach since 1980. It had long wanted to have a Hall of Fame, Mr. Kearney said, in collaboration with other national and international golf organizations. It ultimately joined forces with Davidson Development Inc., the master developer of the 6,000-acre Saint Johns site, to develop the World Golf Hall of Fame as the centerpiece of the project. The location is off Interstate 95 at International Golf Parkway, near an interchange that the developer built in 1994.
A second golf course -- the first collaboration between Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus -- is scheduled for completion in spring 2000. Beyond that the master plan calls for still another golf course.
There are three single-family-home neighborhoods, all in construction, each of which will have a community facility, parks, pools and tennis courts. Five local builders and one national builder -- Panitz Homes, a subsidiary of Beazer Homes, of Atlanta -- are authorized to produce houses in the development. So far 20 are completed and 50 are under construction.
Buyers can purchase lots and bring in their own builders, or build at a future date. About a third of current buyers are planning to build at a future time, Mr. Kearney said. Lot prices range from $55,000 to $100,000. Buyers who are building now are paying from $180,000 to $600,000 for lot and house.
Like Mr. Davidson himself and other executives of his company, Mr. Kearney was active in the development of the Arvida Corporation's Sawgrass master-planned community in Ponte Vedra from 1981 to the early 90's. About 12,000 people live in Sawgrass, which is only 25 miles from Jacksonville and over the years has become as much a bedroom community for Jacksonville as an active-leisure retirement community.
"There's a perfect analogy," said Mr. Kearney. "I think that Saint Johns will eventually evolve into a bedroom community of both Jacksonville and St. Augustine."
Even in the fully developed downtown of St. Augustine, there is new construction aimed at the inter-regional market. An Orlando-based hotel owner and developer, Richard C. Kessler, is restoring an 1888 Spanish Moorish hotel, the Casa Monica, into what he says will be a four-star hotel with 137 rooms and an Old World ambiance, something St. Augustine has lacked in the modern era despite its wide popularity as a tourist resort. It is a $16 million development project, Mr. Kessler said.
The Casa Monica was one of three grand downtown hotels once owned by Henry Morrison Flagler, the one-time business associate of John D. Rockefeller Sr. who wanted to establish St. Augustine as the American Riviera. He bought the Casa Monica in 1889, a year after it was built, and later developed two other hotels nearby. One is now the home of Flagler College and the other is the City Hall and the Lightner Museum.
The Casa Monica closed in the 30's and became the St. Johns County Courthouse. Mr. Kessler, whose Grand Theme Hotels chain has projects in Orlando and Savannah, Ga., bought it last year and began construction three months ago, with Howard Davis of St. Augustine as the architect. It will reopen next September.
"The county wanted to reconstruct it as a hotel and they put it out to bid in 1994 when the hotel market was struggling," Mr. Kessler said. The designated builder was not able to close, and the project long seemed in doubt. "But they stuck to their guns," Mr. Kessler said.
Uncharacteristic as it is of the region as a whole, St. Augustine offers some of the most interesting old houses and one of the few places where restoration has become a major business. "There's not much turnover and there's a waiting list for houses," said Patricia A. Merritt, a broker who set up shop in St. Augustine in 1992 after she and her husband moved from Palm Beach County. "I was a broker there for 20 years, and when I saw the opportunity here I decided to open an office."
There are about 75 sales of turn-of-the-century houses a year in downtown St. Augustine, Ms. Merritt said. Prices are as low as $120,000, but many houses need substantial upgrading. John Valdes, a contractor who specializes in custom restorations, said that many were Mediterranean Revival houses that he has renovated as bed-and-breakfasts.
BUT some become primary housing. Jim Jaffre, an international fast-food consultant, bought a house on Marine Street just outside the city's historic district for $375,000 in 1997 and had it restored and enlarged by Mr. Valdes at a cost of $250,000. "This town is unlike any other part of Florida," Mr. Jaffre said. "Everything else looks like it was built after 1950, whereas this town is older and more quaint."
In a section called the Abbot Tract, old houses on heavily shaded streets sell for $110,000 to $450,000, Ms. Merritt said, and new buyers will often invest $20,000 to $125,000 to upgrade them.
There is also ongoing home development on a strip of land called Camachee Island, bordering on its 300-slip yacht harbor, and on Anastasia Island, reached by the Bridge of Lions from the historic district. There the Thompson family has been developing a waterfront community called Pelican Reef, fronting on the Matanzas River, on land it has owned since 1936.
It took 13 years to complete the permitting process for the 132 home sites, said Paul Thompson. Approval came in 1992. Since then 33 lots have been sold and 22 houses have been built, mainly as primary homes for local residents. The typical cost of a lot with a new house is currently about $350,000 to $400,000, Mr. Thompson said.
For Anthony and Frances La Duca, inland roads are as much an attraction of the region as golf courses, the ocean or a historic city. Mr. La Duca is a motorcycle enthusiast who owns a restaurant called the Camino del Mar in Deerfield Beach. The couple live in Boca Raton.
A year ago they bought a beach house for $178,000 in Flagler Beach. Daytona Beach and its celebrated Speedway are nearby, and Bike Week, which drew half a million motorcyclists to the city last March, also brought 15 or 20 visitors to stay with the La Ducas at their beach house.
But on normal occasions there is more solitude. "When we're up there we like to drive our bike on the back roads around the countryside," Mr. La Duca said. "It's so nice and quiet. It's beautiful."

HEADLINE: BACK FROM THE BRINK;
The Fear That Made The Fed Step In

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
THE slide toward financial panic would have begun with a flutter of pages off a fax machine in Greenwich, Conn., each a notice of foreclosure.
The instant that Long-Term Capital Management missed a payment to a creditor, it would technically have been in default to all of its roughly 75 creditors, thanks to loan provisions that required it to remain current on all its debts. Facing losses, those creditors would have sold assets that the firm had pledged as collateral, sending prices plunging. Dozens of markets, from Denmark to Brazil, would have bucked like terrified stallions. 
 The selling frenzy would have roiled American markets in junk bonds, corporate takeover stocks, mortgage securities and even Treasury bonds. Businesses that depend on those markets for money to expand and add jobs would have suffered. So would consumers whose mortgage rates are influenced by those markets and who have billions in retirement savings in them.
Fears of such a financial panic and its economic aftershocks prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help arrange an 11th-hour rescue of the fund by 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage firms in September.
The rescue prevented the fire-sale liquidation of Long-Term Capital's far-flung, $125 billion portfolio, assembled almost entirely with borrowed money. But even though no public funds were involved, the rescue also produced some of the most stinging criticism the Federal Reserve has faced since its inflation-fighting efforts prompted a national recession in the early 1980's.
SOME economists and members of Congress -- and privately, even a few Wall Street executives -- accuse the Fed of overreacting by helping to rescue a speculative partnership of wealthy investors and the bankers who allowed its speculation.
"Why should the weight of the Federal Government be brought to bear to help out a private investor?" asked Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Others say the markets could have coped with the fund's collapse, although plunging prices would certainly have inflicted some pain on market participants. "There is the impression that the Fed interfered with a market solution," said Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
Fed officials have defended their limited role as essential in avoiding what could have become a free-fall panic in markets already struggling with the aftershocks of Russia's debt moratorium a month earlier.
"It was my judgment that the American people, whom we are pledged to serve, could have been seriously hurt if credit dried up in a general effort by banks and other intermediaries to avoid greater risk," said William J. McDonough, president of the New York Fed, in testimony before Congress a week after the rescue.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, agreed that the times required action.
"With markets currently volatile and investors skittish," he told Congress in October, helping to facilitate a timely rescue of the fund "seemed entirely appropriate as a matter of public policy."
Still, critics worry that by orchestrating the rescue of Long-Term Capital, the Fed suggested that a speculator that grows large enough to threaten the system will be saved -- a message that might encourage recklessness.
"We need to get away from the 'too big to fail' idea," said Hans Stoll, a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University and the author of a number of important studies of the volatility in stock markets. "We are not in the position of saving hedge funds, and the Fed or someone should make that pretty clear."
A SENIOR Wall Street banker who is a director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association argues that the markets for swaps and other derivatives could have coped with Long-Term Capital's collapse.
"There surely would have been price changes, and they might have been significant," the banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But as the prices changed, he added, bargain hunters would have stepped in and the markets would have adapted.
"When the stock market crashed in 1987, swap activity trudged right through without a problem -- with less liquidity and less standardization than we have today," he added. "Would prices have changed? Yes. Would the system have than been in jeopardy? I don't think so."
Few critics of the Fed can be found in Wall Street's corner offices, however. Top executives of banks and brokerage firms estimate privately that the collapse of Long-Term Capital alone could have cost their businesses a total of $8 billion to $15 billion, and one senior executive said he believed that the amounts could have been 10 times higher in a market stampede. "It would have turned a machine gun on the Street," he said.
Andre Levy-Lang, chairman and chief executive of Paribas, the French investment bank that contributed $100 million to the rescue effort, said the Fed "was right in raising the question and making sure the solution is found." There was, he added, "the beginning of a systemic problem" for the markets, and the situation "might have unraveled very quickly."
In the end, said Mr. Litan, the Federal Reserve was "damned if it did and damned if it didn't." If the Fed had done nothing and the hedge fund's collapse had precipitated a bank failure or a market panic, he said, criticism of the sort being cast at the central bank today would seem trivial.
INDEED, some people say a key lesson of the debacle is the need for more regulation, not less. Long-Term Capital's troubles demonstrate that "the regulatory infrastructure is not strong enough or encompassing enough," said Henry Kaufman, an independent market strategist. Unless it improves, he added, there is "a better-than-even chance" that the markets will see "future significant financial problems of this magnitude, or greater."
Mr. Greenspan has acknowledged that an emergency like this one could occur again, and he recently called on bankers and regulators to be more alert to the risks of financial derivatives and other investments in unseasoned markets.
"New instruments, like derivatives, afford the opportunity to reduce risk, but they also afford opportunities to become more vulnerable," Mr. Greenspan told a meeting of Wall Street executives early last month. "Borrowers, lenders and regulators need to improve their understanding of the risk characteristics of the new instruments under a variety of circumstances -- some extreme."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Drawings: "Every Flavor but Plain Vanilla"
 
Beyond investing in ordinary ways, like buying and holding stocks and bonds, Long-Term Capital used a number of unusual arrangements to pluck profits from various markets. Two of those strategies are illustrated here.
 
TOTAL-RETURN SWAP
 
This novel derivative temporarily allowed Long-Term Capital to acquire the benefits and risks of stock ownership without actually buying the stock.
 
HOW IT WORKED
 
Long-Term Capital entered into a short-term agreement with a brokerage firm that had access to a block of stock.
 
During the term of the swap, Long-Term Capital agreed to pay the brokerage firm a fixed interest rate on the amount it would cost to buy that block of stock outright.
 
In return, the brokerage firm agreed to pay Long-Term Capital an amount equal to any dividends the stock generated during the period of the agreement and any increase in the price of the stock during the term of the agreement.
 
But, if the stock price fell, Long-Term Capital agreed to reimburse the firm for the difference.
 
THE POTENTIAL FALLOUT
 
If the stock price declined, Long-Term Capital lost money; if it could not pay, the brokerage firm would have to absorb the loss on the stock.
 
CONVERGENCE TRADING
 
Long-Term Capital looked for securities whose prices normally moved in tandem. For example, the prices of corporate bonds usually fall within a certain range of the price of a U.S. Treasury bond of the same maturity. When these prices deviated from their historical relationship, the fund tried to exploit the divergence using a technique called convergence trading.
 
HOW IT WORKED
 
In one convergence trade, Long-Term Capital noted that the prices of some Brady bonds -- issued by developing nations and backed by U.S. Treasury bonds -- had risen faster than the prices of non-Brady bonds issued by those same nations.
 
Long-Term Capital borrowed Brady bonds and sold them, promising to replace them in the future, a tactic called selling short.
 
Long-Term Capital then bought non-Brady bonds issued by the same countries.
 
If the price gap narrowed between the Brady bonds and the non-Brady bonds, Long-Term Capital would profit. For example, if the Brady bonds fell in value, it would cost less to replace them. If the non-Brady bonds gained in value, the fund could make money by selling them.
 
THE POTENTIAL FALLOUT
 
If the gap in prices widened, Long-Term Capital could lose big on both bets. And if the fund could not replace the borrowed Brady bonds, the lending institution would have to replace them at its own expense.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
What If the Legislature Really Deserves a Raise?

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
No, that silence emanating from the New Jersey State House isn't the symptom of some epidemic of legislative laryngitis. There's no mime contest going on, pitting the Assembly against the state Senate. The peculiar hush surrounding New Jersey's elected officials these days is actually one of the most time-honored forms of political shadow play: the nearly imperceptible sound of government officials beginning to raise their own pay.
The state Assembly took the first surreptitious step late last month, by voting -- without debate -- to authorize a salary commission to study the pay of all three branches of government. Still, one of the sponsors of the bill, Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon, insists that the issue isn't pay increases for legislators, but pay equity for New Jersey's judges. Governor Whitman won't publicly address the issue until, and unless, legislators summon up the fortitude to pass a pay increase plan, according to her press secretary, Jayne O'Connor. But Ms. O'Connor made certain that the Governor's no comment explicitly stated Mrs. Whitman's aversion to the dreaded R-word, by volunteering that the Governor is not considering raises for members of her cabinet. 
 In fact, the issue has rendered so many eloquent people speechless, that it might be easy to overlook the fact that there's a strong case to be made that New Jersey legislators do indeed deserve a raise.
That may sound unusual in this age of civic cynicism and widespread dismay at the state of American democracy. After all, New Jersey's state legislators are paid $35,000 a year, plus health benefits and some expenses, and are supposed to consider their positions part-time jobs. Tax-relief advocates such as John Budzash argue that the lawmakers already earn more than most full-time employees in New Jersey and don't deserve a raise until their constituents also see an increase. "They've done a mediocre job," said Mr. Budzash, founder of Hands Across New Jersey, a tax watchdog group. "Do most employers give their workers a pay raise if they're only doing a mediocre job?"
According to Gerald Pomper, a political science professor at Rutgers University, the answer to that question is yes. Although productivity bonuses are used as an incentive in many businesses, the vast majority of American workers receive periodic raises, either in the form of cost-of-living adjustments or contract raises, regardless of performance.
What's more, Mr. Pomper argues, New Jersey state senators perform a more rigorous, complex task than most workers -- including legislators in many other states. New Jersey lawmakers have to wrangle with some of the thorniest problems of the day, from waste hauling and economic development to transportation and school funding. State senators and members of the Assembly must decide how New Jersey spends its $17.9 billion budget, houses its thousands of prison inmates; regulates its insurance companies; whether it subjects its student athletes to drug tests. Even emotional issues like what denomination of trout should be designated the state fish (Brook trout). All this, while placating that most cantankerous of creatures, the New Jersey voter.
"You ought to think of these people as mid-level executives," Mr. Pomper said. "But they get paid what you'd pay a mid-level clerk."
When compared to their counterparts in other states, New Jersey legislators are the 14th best paid, according statistics from to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They get more than the $16,760 Connecticut pays its state representatives, but a pittance compared to the $75,600 annual salary plus $119 per diem given to California lawmakers.
But a closer look at the duties involved shows that New Jersey's lawmakers have more duties, and a more time-consuming schedule than representatives in other states. In New York, for example, where the legislative session usually lasts just six months, lawmakers are paid $57,800 and are now pushing for a $20,000 increase. New Jersey's legislative calendar runs throughout the year, and although the legislature usually only meets two days a week, many representatives say they spend 40 to 50 hours on their governmental duties, not counting the arduous work of campaigning.
The Senate Majority Leader, John O. Bennett, , one of the few state legislators willing to tiptoe near the issue, says the pay issue, which hasn't been addressed in a decade, could be deterring many quality people from running for office.
"Anyone who's in this for the money has a lot of problems," said Mr. Bennett, a Republican from Monmouth. "You don't want the pay to reach a level where smart, capable people aren't interested because it just isn't worth the time."
Interestingly, one of the few people willing to speak out in favor of granting lawmakers a raise is one the legislature's most outspoken critics, Sam Perelli, state chairman of United Taxpayers of New Jersey. Mr. Perelli says the legislature is now dominated by lawyers who can supplement their government income in the private sector or by "double-dippers" who earn two public sector salaries. By raising the pay to a more livable wage, Mr. Perelli said the state would ultimately make the legislature more closely resemble the make-up of the state itself.
"It would open it up to all the carpenters and auto mechanics and secretaries who can't afford to support their families on $35,000 a year," he said. "We need more Minutemen and Minutewomen there. That way, you wouldn't need to take opinion polls. You'd have the real voice of the public sitting right there in Trenton."

It's Never Too Soon for the Squirt to Wise Up

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
THE two words that strike the most terror into the hearts of educators these days are "core curriculum." This refers to the Department of Education's list of 61 skills that each New Jersey school child will have to master by the time today's fifth graders graduate in 2006.
Many things one might expect are on this list: reading, writing and arithmetic, for example. And then there are those other things that the state of New Jersey also considers important enough to have enumerated. Fourth graders should be able to hop, skip and jump (Standard 2.5). Eighth graders should recognize visual messages of irony (Standard 3.5). And 12th graders must be able to analyze "the responsibilities, joys, demands and challenges of parenthood" (Standard 2.4). 
 Now, I'm in favor of irony as much as the next person, but what I'm wondering about is how the geniuses in Trenton are going to measure it. Because the scary thing about the core curriculum is not that the state wants children to become the temperate, well-rounded, intellectually sophisticated people we are not, but that it's going to put it all on a standardized test. By 2006, one presumes, 12th graders will have to hop on one foot and point out the funniest lines in an Erma Bombeck column.
In fact, it's already started. In last year's Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, given to all fourth graders, each student had to give a short speech (Standard 3.1). There were also several open-ended questions. Unfortunately, I cannot report on how well last year's fourth graders did. Although the test was given in May, the state has not finished grading it yet.
But that isn't all. Now Trenton has proposed a new set of graduation requirements and a school-to-work initiative so sweeping as to make the core curriculum look like the ABC's. Among the proposals: "career awareness" for students starting in kindergarten, a "career plan" for each student starting in fifth grade and a system of "career majors" (the state provides a menu of 14) starting at grade nine. All 11th and 12th graders would have to work in some kind of career-related job one day a week.
I won't even go into what happens to districts that don't get with the new program quickly enough. Suffice it to say that New Jersey schools are preparing their fourth graders for this year's tests as though they were planning the invasion of Normandy. The stress goes from the superintendent's office down to the playground.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand the motivation behind the initiatives. The core curriculum, in its breadth, speaks to the desire to create little Renaissance men and women, people versed in arts and sciences, people who will be good citizens, not just drones. Creating well-rounded people is a fine goal. It's the bureaucratization of such a goal that seems misguided. It's the same codifying impulse that, in health care, has taken power from doctors and given it to 1-800 operators. Here, it turns teachers into test administrators.
But the impetus behind school-to-work and the new graduation requirements stems from a different value, that of creating smart, snappy workers to make sure the United States remains a world-class economic power. I'm not making this up. "America is losing the war with respect to international competition," Ellen Schechter, New Jersey's assistant commissioner of education, told me in a telephone interview. "Unless we significantly raise our standards for all students, then America will continue to lag."
It's all about keeping up with the Japanese.
Putting international competition on the backs of children makes me queasy. Take the Olympics, the very symbol of excellence, perseverance and national pride. The idea of little girls waking every day at 4 A.M., endlessly cutting the same patterns in the ice, all to win Olympic gold, saddens me. It's the opposite of well-roundedness.
And when in 1996, Kerri Strug, the teen-age American gymnast, became a hero by making her final vault despite obvious physical pain, I was appalled. How, I wondered, could her coach allow an injured child to make that leap? The picture of Kerri Strug, crying tears of agony, being carried around as her teammates collected gold medals, filled me with pathos, not pride.
Just how low is our national self-esteem that we have made success more important than childhood? To Marilyn Birnbaum, superintendent of . the North Plainfield public schools, that is what Trenton's new testing plan amounts to.
"In the spingtime, the children should be playing outside," Dr. Birnbaum said. "Instead, they are so stressed out."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Overcoming a Door Jam

BYLINE: By INGRID EISENSTADTER 

 BODY:
FOUR years have passed since Barry Tesser plunked down $1,500 for a sofa bed at Jennifer Convertibles. It had deep cushions, a high upholstered back and heavily padded armrests.
This was one fat couch. Mr. Tesser's apartment, however, had a skinny Manhattan doorway, and that presented a delivery problem. Say hello to the Z Brothers, a sofa disassembly service, which for 25 years has been doing a good business getting big couches through small city entryways. 
 "At first I was extremely leery of buying a couch that had to be taken apart to deliver," Mr. Tesser said. But that was the couch he wanted. It took the Z Brothers about 20 minutes to disassemble the sofa bed, right on the street, and about half an hour to reassemble it inside Mr. Tesser's Murray Hill apartment.
Mr. Tesser and the Z Brothers are part of the city's "tight fit" economy: the business of squeezing, disassembling and hoisting fatter-than-your-doorway pianos, pool tables, hot tubs, furniture, appliances and artwork to get them into urban spaces. Some companies even design their products to come apart easily, while some movers make cardboard mock-ups of items to test how snug the fit is. But whatever the strategy, the need is there.
Just ask Mr. Tesser. He sold his sofa bed in August and called the Z Brothers back to get the old one out and the new one in. In the intervening years, however, he had moved from one Murray Hill address to another, and he called the Z Brothers then, too. All told, Mr. Tesser has spent more than $600 trucking his sofa beds around town; just another routine expenditure in a city where people hail cabs to take them to their cars.
When Joe Zeolla, who owns the Z Brothers with his wife, Diane, started his business, he also had a regular delivery service hauling couches that did not need to be broken down. But now, "We only deliver couches that need to be disassembled," he said. "There's so much call for it, we don't bother with just delivery anymore."
Mr. Zeolla said his company, based in Thornwood, in Westchester County, takes apart and puts together 150 couches a week, mostly for delivery in the five boroughs. A typical disassembly, reconstruction and move costs $165, said Mr. Zeolla, adding that expensive custom sofas held together by glue and dowels instead of nails can cost up to $600. But the profits aren't guaranteed.
"Once my son was reassembling a couch upholstered in silk," Mr. Zeolla said of Joe Jr., a vice president in the business, "and he caught his hand on a staple and got blood on the fabric." Mr. Zeolla paid $45 to a dry cleaner and $200 for another yard of fabric, plus money for a seamstress. He charged just $400 for the job.
Carl Demler, owner of Bronx-based AAA Beethoven Transfer, does for pianos what Mr. Zeolla does for sofas. Mr. Demler's business moves and disassembles about 1,000 pianos a year, he said, including a half-ton, 9-foot-6-inch, $150,000 Bosendorfer, made in Vienna, which his movers occasionally march up and down four rickety flights of stairs into a West Side recording studio.
The price of lugging a piano varies. To move a small spinet from an elevator building to another elevator building costs $110, Mr. Demler said, while disassembling and moving a concert grand costs up to $1,000.
Other variables include $45 an hour for travel time on long-distance moves, Mr. Demler said, and $25 per flight of stairs if the piano does not fit into the elevator. At least once, Mr. Demler recalled, he and his workers carried a piano up 15 stories.
But creativity is as useful as muscle in this business. Once, Mr. Demler said, when his workers were moving a grand piano for Leonard Bernstein, "the fit through the door was so tight we couldn't measure it accurately enough." To figure out the angle of attack, he said, "We made a cardboard mock-up and banged that around for a while, instead of Bernstein's Steinway."
Makers of big household items often design disassembly into their wares. Ron Blatt, the third-generation owner of Blatt Billiards, said all his pool tables typically disassembled into 30 to 50 pieces.
But New York businesses often build easy disassembly into items that do not usually have that feature. "Most Castros are made to come apart because our sofas have been built for this market," said Jerry Benson, manager of the reupholstery division of Castro Convertibles.
Not all manufacturers build to make breaking down easy, however, even if, like Donghia, they specialize in big, expensive custom-made furniture. Customers or their interior decorators must make sure the furniture fits, said Emily Nomer, vice president of operations, adding, "We don't accept returns for this."
For such items, hoisting, though sometimes expensive, may be an alternative. Frank Narcisco, president of Dun-Rite Movers of the Bronx, has hoisted furniture, hot tubs, Batman (for a promotion) and even Godzilla (for a film). He often lifts trees to terraces; one client wanted 30-foot logs for an interior design scheme.
Recently, Mr. Narcisco moved a man from a three-room apartment to a brownstone six blocks away at a cost of $5,000. "Every piece of furniture had to be hoisted through a window," Mr. Narcisco said.
In hoisting, when windows must be removed, "Everything is systemized," he said. "Glaziers take the window out half hour to hour before we hoist, and they hang around to reconstruct the window after the move is completed."
Rope hoisting works well even for heavy objects. Robert Degen, who with his wife, Elie, owns Auer's Moving and Rigging Company, said his workers can hoist up to 1,500 pounds that way. But to move a 7 1/2-ton sculpture by Charles Ray, a Los Angeles artist, into the Whitney Museum of American Art in September 1997, Mr. Degen had to use the company crane.
Yet not all fatter-than-your-doorway stories end in success. Sometimes, said Mr. Demler, particularly in basements, a piano that has been moved in cannot be moved out because the room has been redesigned. And some squeezes are just too snug. Ms. Nomer of Donghia could not get her queen-size box springs up a narrow staircase and under the low ceilings of her city apartment.
Now, "I sleep on a mattress on the floor," she said.
 
War Stories On the Move
UP AND OVER -- The couch was "as big as a house," said Joe Zeolla of Z Brothers, a sofa-disassembly company. Even after the arms and back were removed, the couch still would not fit into the elevator or on the stairs. The solution: the office building next door, which had a wider staircase. "We brought the springs over the roof to the other roof," he said. Luckily, it was a penthouse delivery.
 
HIGH ART -- Robert Degen, of Auer's Moving & Rigging Company, said his highest lift, 48 floors, was of a $1 million painting into an East Side apartment. "After the 10th floor you can no longer see what you're hoisting," he said, "and you need a man on the roof with a radio." Cost: $5,000.
 
ON A TEAR -- "15 years ago we were moving a piano that got stuck on a narrow staircase," said Carl Demler, of AAA Beethoven Transfer. That normally might kill amove, but not this time. "The owner of the piano was a carpenter and he said, 'Tear the wall down' and so we did. Then he built it back up."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Masters of Jersey;
Wall Street Shudders At Life Across the River

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
TO the surprise of almost no one, the New York Stock Exchange has agreed to stay in New York. Whether its well-heeled officials really, truly, turn-blue-and-die meant their many threats to move to New Jersey will probably never be known.
After years of negotiations, the exchange finally muscled city and state officials into coming up with $900 million in cash and tax breaks for a new trading complex in lower Manhattan. The exchange's board still has to vote, but by Friday, it was virtually a done deal. 
 But buckets of money aside, there are certain intangibles that add up to a strong case that they were never really serious about leaving. There are, after all, some things that you just can't put a price on.
Start with the name problem. The New Jersey Stock Exchange. The Jersey City Stock Exchange. Actually, officials had anticipated that problem long ago and secured the right to call themselves the New York Stock Exchange wherever they might land. Still, there would be the inevitable jokes.
"People use the phrase Wall Street around the world," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. "It's a brand name and a marketing image. It's Coca-Cola; it's Scotch tape. The New York Stock Exchange would jeopardize its enormous psychological and marketing value if it moved very far away from Wall Street."
Some companies will move part of their operations to less expensive space in New Jersey or elsewhere, Mr. Shostal said. For an institution like the New York Stock Exchange, however, there is an incalculable value in being in New York, where the financial industry is concentrated.
In the 1980's, Mr. Shostal made his living luring New York companies to Jersey City for Cushman Realty. He jumped through hoops putting together a deal to build a broadcasting headquarters for NBC in Jersey City, only to see NBC snap up a $100 million tax break to stay at Rockefeller Center. "We knew Tom Brokaw was not going anywhere," he said. "The people in the bright red suspenders and the silk ties are not going to go to Jersey City."
After all, New Jersey is off the beaten limo track. Could the masters of the universe have handled the logistics? The trip from, say, Greenwich would border on indignity. The train to Grand Central, then the subway to Times Square, then a transfer to a subway to Penn Station, a walk through the tunnels to get the Path train for the trip under the Hudson River to Jersey City. Then a taxi or who knows what to the new quarters.
And could they really leave behind the headquarters of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, or the restaurants, or the recognition of having made it in New York?
Mr. Shostal did get Merrill Lynch to move several thousand back office workers to Jersey City. But, he said, the tax breaks and subsidies on either side of the river are merely icing on the cake. "The vast majority of tenants locate where they need to for business reasons," Mr. Shostal said. "The bidding war between the states is really a milking of the public sector, rather than a determining factor in where they want to go."
There is no question that the New York Stock Exchange, which pays about $51 million a year in a variety of taxes, is cramped at its 100-year-old home on Wall Street. On an average day, 680 million shares are traded on the market, up from 160 million 10 years ago. Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, who lives on Long Island, always maintained that he wanted to remain in New York. Yet, new construction is always a difficult proposition in Manhattan.
In playing the relocation card, the Stock Exchange was no different than Mercedes-Benz, Nebraska Beef, Intel Corporation or any company that has pitted one state against another, from Alabama to Maine and California. Corporate relocation has had as much to do with the chairman's comfort as with economics. In a study of 38 companies that left Manhattan in the 1970's, the urban planner William H. Whyte found that 31 moved to within 8 miles of the chairman's home.
Sometimes, the flight to the suburbs ends in a crash landing. Mr. Whyte found that 17 of the 38 departed companies were later bought out or raided, or merged with a dominant partner. A majority posted lower-than-average profits, while a comparable group of three dozen major companies that remained behind saw their stock valuation jump an average of 277 percent.
BUT this is an old movie. In 1990, New Jersey offered to build New York's five commodity exchanges a $100 million complex at the Harborside Financial Center before New York offered a more generous deal. Five years later, the Cotton Exchange signed a letter of intent to move to New Jersey, but New York countered with a higher bounty and the traders stayed put.
Even the developers in New Jersey who talked to the the New York Stock Exchange privately acknowledged long ago that they had little chance of luring away the Stock Exchange.
Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, said the New York Stock Exchange needs to be in Manhattan to retain its crown as the world's largest equity market, especially with Frank G. Zarb's Nasdaq moving to New York and merging with the American Stock Exchange.
"New Jersey may be a better place to live but it's not a better place to work," said Mr. Moss. "There is more of a chance of schmoozing and acquiring random information in an hour in the hallways, on the streets, at lunch or on the concourse at Grand Central Terminal in New York than there is by spending a week in a parking lot in New Jersey."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
The Bubble Is Back, Compliments Of the Fed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THIS has been a very strange year. Consider these events:
A 24-year-old woman shakes the Presidency. 
 A septuagenarian senator rockets into space.
Stocks plummet for a couple of months, then turn around and set new highs by the end of November, leaving many to wonder why they fell so far in the first place.
Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company recently took some time -- before Thursday's 185-point selloff of the Dow Jones industrial average -- to talk about developments in the financial markets, and to share his ideas on the year ahead.
 
Q. It has seemed for a while, given the market's upward moves, as if Asia, Russia, Long-Term Capital and Brazil never happened. Are the steps that have been taken to deal with these problems sufficient?
 
A. We have thrown a lot of money at a lot of problems, but throwing money at them doesn't necessarily solve them.
It is really hard to make the case that foreign events caused the mighty, powerful reserve currency capital market to collapse. It closed because American corporations are spending so much right now on investment they are running big cash deficits. And that led the Federal Reserve Board to throw a tremendous amount of money at the capital markets. It is that liquidity that is helping stocks.
 
Q. When they try to explain the money that is flowing into the market, a lot of folks cite big cash balances in money market funds and at mutual funds. Do you buy that?
 
A. The stock market has seen its capitalization increase by at least $1.5 trillion in the last two months. You can't do that with normal savings. There is something powerful underneath this thing, and I would argue it is the Fed.
 
Q. This all sounds rather ominous. Is the market's recovery really that tenuous?
 
A. We are the biggest bulls in the world. But the real question the market is going to have to deal with is what happens when the economy slows. The Fed has now reflated the equity market bubble.
The risk is that next spring they will be looking at an even bigger bubble at a time when the economy will be slowing and profits will still be declining.
 
Q. A lot of people have recently been talking more optimistically about profits, if not in the first half of the year, then later on. You seem to take issue with that view.
 
A. I think the argument is flawed. For the last five quarters, profits have been flat to down in the context of a Goldilocks economy. The basis for profits is fantastically positive, and yet they are weak.
I don't know if we will go into a recession or not next year. But I do know we will run that risk, and will go through a period of very, very sluggish growth, a time when investment spending will slow. When that happens, spending, income growth, profit growth and employment will all be weaker.
 
Q. Are the announcements of the Exxon-Mobil merger and Boeing's production cutbacks examples of that?
 
A. They sure are. So was Intel's decision to cut capital spending by 40 percent, which it announced a couple of weeks ago. I think we are going to see more of that. We have had the biggest capital spending boom in history. But after a while, there is too much of it.
 
Q. You have been a much bigger fan of the bond market than of the stock market for at least a year. Is that still the case?
 
A. Yes, it is. The best-kept secret in the world is how well the 30-year Treasury bond has done this year. It has returned about 18 percent so far, in line with the Standard & Poor's index and much better than the average stock, which is down. I think by year-end it will beat the S.& P. That's unheard of, for a bond to beat the stock market in a period of strong economic growth.
 
Q. Is 1999 a year to buy bonds?
 
A. I think bonds will outperform stocks by a country mile next year. We think rates will fall, and could fall substantially, because there is no inflation out there. A year from now, we could see yields on the 30-year bond at 4.25 percent, possibly lower. I am not holding back.
 
Q. Is there more money to be made abroad than at home next year?
 
A. Today, nobody dares look outside the United States. But the theme for 1999 is that money will gravitate toward economies and markets that are running current account surpluses and are not heavily dependent on inflows of foreign capital.
That may point you to Asia, where countries like Korea and Thailand are already generating current account surpluses. Others will start doing the same soon. Asia could be the big story in 1999.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
The Military-Technological Complex Is Thriving in Israel

BYLINE: By JESSICA STEINBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
YOUNG soldiers with automatic rifles slung across their backs are a familiar sight here, defending the country's borders, boundaries and bus stops. With few exceptions, mainly for medical or religious reasons, conscription at age 18 is universal, and almost all Israelis serve a term in the Israel Defense Forces.
But the draft hasn't only provided manpower for national security. It has also given birth to thriving civilian industries built by entrepreneurs who gained invaluable technical skills, leadership abilities and personal connections in the military. 
 Several hundred new companies spring up every year in Silicon Wadi, as the Israeli technology sector is sometimes called. Analysts estimate that three-quarters of them grow directly out of army service.
Technology is arguably Israel's most important industrial sector, accounting for a third of the country's exports and absorbing half the foreign investment in the country. Electronics exports totaled $5.7 billion in 1997 and are growing at 17 percent a year; software exports, at $500 million in 1997, are growing at 25 percent a year. As a proportion of its population, Israel has half again as many scientists and engineers as the United States. Put them together with the country's burgeoning venture capital industry, and the result is an abundant crop of start-ups.
One example is GEO Interactive Media Group, which makes multimedia transmission software used by Web-site designers. Tzur Daboosh, 32, and Sharon Carmel, 28, two of the founding partners, met in the army in the late 1980's when both were working on multimedia combat simulators. "We gained experience in technologies that went to market five or six years later," Mr. Daboosh said.
In 1994, after several other business ventures, the men teamed up with another former army technical specialist, Eli Reifman, and began turning out software in a Tel Aviv apartment. They brought in a more experienced businessman, Naftali Shani, 49, to serve as chairman, and took the company public in 1996. Still a development-stage company, GEO lost $9.9 million in 1997 on just $3.1 million in sales. Its London-traded stock, which peaked above $3 last summer, plummeted in late July when the company warned that profits were being hampered by production delays; it closed on Friday at 26.6 cents a share.
Though its products have little direct military application, GEO continues to benefit from its army links, and vice versa. Mr. Carmel and Mr. Daboosh serve as reserve officers in technical units, teaching young draftees software design and programming. And while they teach, the two executives can scout the class for future hires.
 MOST able-bodied 18-year-old Israelis are drafted after completing high school. Women serve a minimum of one year, nine months; men spend a minimum of three years on active duty and remain in the reserves until age 45, taking time out from civilian life to serve 24 to 30 days a year.
Ambitious draftees compete furiously to gain assignment to the military units where their experience will be worth most in later life: army technology units, paratroop units and the air force. "If you get in there, it's like getting a bachelor's degree in computer science plus five years of work experience," said one programmer who served in an electronics unit and now works at an Internet telecommunications start-up.
In Israel, an impressive army profile on a resume carries weight similar to that of an Ivy League degree in the United States. Informal networks of veterans of special units open doors the way alumni networks do for graduates of American colleges.
That is how Joseph Ackerman got into the technology business. After completing army service as a flight test engineer in 1975, Mr. Ackerman was farming near Haifa when some army buddies persuaded him to join Elbit Computer, now Elbit Ltd., to oversee one of its new projects. He is now chief executive of Elbit's military electronics business, which was spun off as a separate company, Elbit Systems, in 1996.
Elbit Systems, which had $397 million in sales in the most recent four quarters and is growing at about 10 percent a year, makes a helmet-mounted display system that helps tank gunners and combat pilots aim radar and missiles. The engineers who developed the technology get to see it in action firsthand during their annual reserve call-ups, Mr. Ackerman said.
While the Government restricts exports of some kinds of military technology, it generally supports such trade. Domestic demand, after all, is not large enough to support fully an industry it wants to see thrive.
"The Ministry of Defense has a finger in this success, so it can't be unhappy with it," said Aharon Beth-Halachmi, head of Federman Enterprises, a management and investment firm. Mr. Beth-Halachmi, an electrical engineer by training, capped a 30-year army career as the ministry's chief administrator.
MILITARY technology was the first, and for many years the only sector of Israeli industry with the technical sophistication to develop globally competitive software and systems, said Mr. Beth-Halachmi, whom the army sent to graduate school in the United States in 1962.
Military experience also gives Israelis an eye for shortcuts and a penchant for aggressive innovation, said Shaul Shai, 36, a reserve major and executive vice president for marketing at Aladdin Knowledge Systems, a security software maker based in Tel Aviv.
"In the I.D.F., there's a great imbalance between the size of tasks that must be accomplished and the available resources," he said. "It's such a huge gap that one needs to think smart all the time."
But military service is no panacea, and starting a company is not the same as leading a fighter squadron, observed Shlomo Kalish, founder and chief executive of Jerusalem Global, a technology investment bank. Mr. Kalish spent five years flying combat jets in the 1970's.
"To be a great C.E.O.," he said, "you have to be a natural leader, and that can't be taught."
Army veterans can be autocratic and somewhat inflexible, especially when it comes to the culture of titles, said Eran Goren, a reserve officer and the chief executive of Nessuah-Zannex, an investment bank.
But while rank matters in the army, so does personal initiative, said Mr. Shai, of Aladdin. And that, too, can cause problems, he said, "when everyone thinks they're a general."
Still, the army's approach seems to breed success in civilian life.
"We learned how to live with constraints, and that's an added value," said GEO's Mr. Carmel.
Mr. Daboosh agreed: "We learned flexibility in the army. The I.D.F. is huge, but it listens to young soldiers. Things were always changing, which is good and bad, but very Israeli."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Oil Is Down, but Don't Count It Out

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

 BODY:
THE world of oil may appear to be falling apart, but in oil things are never quite as bad or as good as they seem. Huge mergers have thrown the industry into confusion as oil prices have dipped to historic bottoms. Yet, if history is any guide, investors who write off energy will miss opportunities.
True, there has been a wave of bad news: growth in demand has been tempered by the Asian economic crisis, winters have been exceedingly mild and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appears hopelessly unable to rein in production. 
 And yet, oil is a strategic commodity governed by some constants. "The oil business is a cyclical industry, where prices will go up and down," said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Research Industry Foundation. "But oil is also a growth industry and an essential commodity."
If you have any doubts about the growth part, just consider what will happen when every other Chinese and Indian family begins, sometime in the near future, to buy its own car, refrigerator and air-conditioner. There may not be enough energy to satisfy demand in two markets that will have more than a billion consumers each.
"Even now, all the bad news -- the mild winter, the Asian crisis and OPEC's problems -- are one-time factors," said Ernst von Metzsch, a partner at Wellington Management, a Boston money manager.
Worldwide demand for oil is expected to rise 0.5 percent this year, compared with an average annual rate of 2.3 percent over the past decade. Regardless of the bad news and predictions that West Texas Intermediate will soon trade in the middle single digits a barrel, many OPEC experts expect oil prices to rise gradually to $17 a barrel within a year, versus $11 on Friday.
In other words, when it comes to oil, think long term. And, don't be surprised if oil prices double in a relatively short period.
In the present atmosphere of excitement and confusion fostered by the recent Exxon-Mobil merger announcement and the earlier British Petroleum-Amoco deal, the best strategy is to keep a fair share of your energy portfolio in huge multinationals. Specifically, that means the big five: Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, British Petroleum, Chevron and Texaco.
"This group of big international integrated companies is the most interesting right now," said Paul Ting, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Ting predicts that Exxon's shares, now at $71.50, will hit $85 in 12 to 18 months, and that Texaco, now at $56.3125, may hit $70 in that same period. For Chevron, the target price is $88, versus $82 on Friday.
"Even if you misjudge the timing with this group, there is always another day," Mr. Ting said. "All of them have over the past year cleaned up their balance sheets, bringing debt-to-capital ratios from 40 percent closer to 30 percent, and all are still in an acquisition mode."
With the big oil stocks, investors get paid to wait for any price rise. Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have yields of 2.29 percent, 3.20 percent and 2.98 percent, respectively, versus just 1.31 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The integrated structure of these companies -- production, refining, and retailing as well as plastics businesses -- gives them a measure of protection.
"This industry has a self-correcting mechanism," said Karl Bandtel, a partner at Wellington Management.
Acquisition fever also provides opportunities. ARCO, for example, which has big oil reserves in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay as well as oil and gas in Indonesia, is one possible target. Its shares trade at $67, but Mr. Bandtel said they could climb as high as $80 the next 12 to 18 months even if ARCO isn't acquired.
More risky are small independent United States exploration companies. Many of their stock prices are off 50 percent or more the past 12 months. It's the same for oil-service industries like drilling companies. Weatherford International, for example, has fallen from over $50 a share a year ago to $17.50 on Friday. Mr. Bandtel said, however, that it could double in a year if demand for services picks up, as he expects it to.
EVEN now there are buys, mainly in companies largely involved in natural gas, which has fallen less than oil. Alberta Energy, which trades at $21.3125, could hit $26 within a year, according to Mr. von Metzsch.
In general, analysts and managers suggest avoiding higher-cost oil producers in North America -- there are scores of them in Texas, Oklahoma, California, Louisiana and Alberta. They may need oil prices of $18 a barrel to make a profit -- a level that may not be seen for some time.
Two events to watch: the fourth-quarter earnings announcements of oil companies, coming in January, and the OPEC meeting in late March. The former will show how well individual companies are coping with low oil prices; the latter will show whether a seriously weakened OPEC has the will to adopt a new strategy for cutting production.
But even if OPEC cannot discipline itself, some experts believe industry mergers and low oil prices will help it, as small companies exit the business of pumping oil in expensive places like the United States.
"If these mergers curtail production outside the OPEC area, they could in fact help, not hurt the whole energy industry," said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a Geneva-based energy strategist and a former Energy Minister of Algeria.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
Office Christmases, Grinch by Grinch

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
If the mail is any guide, Charles Dickens was surely writing from life when he created Ebenezer Scrooge, who threatened Bob Cratchit with the loss of his livelihood on Christmas Eve. There seems to be something about the season that brings out the beast in many a manager.
Scrooge was the first person to come to A. J. Lawrence's mind when she recalled a holiday season at a Park Avenue law firm. 
 "Fresh out of law school, I was very excited about my first office holiday party," she wrote from Manhattan. "Visions of sugar plums danced in my head, as well as thoughts of an open bar and lavish buffet. Anything could happen."
On the day of the party, the partners called members of the staff together beforehand for a meeting. "I assumed the partners wished to praise each and every one of us for a year's worth of good work," Ms. Lawrence wrote.
Instead, she said, the 20 lawyers, 2 paralegals, 10 secretaries and various support staff were chastised by the managing partner for failing to give thanks to each and every partner for their raises. (Ms. Lawrence uses the word "minuscule" to describe them.)
Next, she said, the managing partner berated them for not providing the partners with gifts. In closing, he informed his audience that many of them would not be employed by the firm during the coming year. He then finished by wishing one and all a "Merry Christmas" and a "Happy Hanukkah."
And the party had not yet begun.
The site was a little Italian restaurant a few blocks from the office. When the managing partner saw it, he threw a tantrum.
"This place is a dump!" Ms. Lawrence recalled him screaming. At the end of the considerably muted festivities, he dismissed the staff member who had chosen the restaurant.
The next year, Ms. Lawrence quit her job just before the holiday party. The managing partner said she could attend anyway.
She declined.
When Lorraine LaFemina was starting out as a writer, she landed a job at a small publishing company where the hours were long, the pay was scant and the employees had to punch in and out on time cards. But one day, to their surprise, the employees were told that a holiday party had been scheduled from 1 P.M. until quitting time.
"As the hour approached, we anxiously watched as catered food was brought in from a tony delicatessen: Champagne, fancy cutlery, dim sum, the works," Ms. LaFemina wrote. At last, the staff began to feel appreciated -- until a loudspeaker announcement ordered one and all to punch out at 1 P.M. before attending the celebration.
When Ms. LaFemina complained to her supervisor about being docked a half-day's pay to attend an office party, she received a quick reply: "Well, how do you think we're going to pay for all this?"
Ms. LaFemina now owns a small publishing company in Eastport, N.Y. "I give my writers a nice cash bonus at holiday time," she said.
A few years ago, when Christine Bliss, now of Shelton, Conn., was working as a payroll manager for a trucking company in New Jersey, the owners had a holiday tradition: a potluck buffet luncheon.
"Each person brought his or her special dish, the company contributed a six-foot hero sandwich and we ate happily, laughing and chatting about the upcoming holidays," Ms. Bliss wrote. "Spirits were high."
Then she received a summons to the office of the chief financial officer.
Ms. Bliss said he told her that the company was going to downsize its office staff immediately and handed her a list of 20 names. Her instructions were to bring the victims, one by one, into his office, where they would be handed their final paychecks (no severance), dismissed and escorted to the front door with no chance to say goodbye to co-workers.
Ms. Bliss set about her work. "At first no one noticed that people were gradually disappearing," she said. "For about 20 minutes, the party remained in full swing, but all of a sudden, it seemed to dawn on everyone that people were vanishing. The word of what was happening went around fast, and voices gradually died away until the room was silent.
"They terminated more than one-third of the office staff that day, and I finished the afternoon crying at my desk."
As the senior labor negotiator for a former employer, Ronald J. Rakowski of Bethel, Conn., became known one year as "the Scrooge from corporate" for pressing a contract provision that eliminated all holidays, including Christmas, at one of its larger plants. The production shutdown, management had decided, was just too costly.
"Even my normally supportive and long-suffering family sided with the workers," he wrote, with his wife and children muttering "something about my next Christmas stocking and coal."
"Then one day, during a company bargaining committee caucus, we were distracted from our deliberations by loud chanting coming from the parking lot. We peered out the windows and were greeted by a parking lot full of children, ranging from toddlers to teen-agers, holding placards which read: 'Please let Mom and Dad spend Christmas with us!'
"Fearful of a visit from Charles Dickens's Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, we did."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Big Time;
From Trustbusters To Trust Trusters

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TEDDY ROOSEVELT plotted the beginning of the end of John D. Rockefeller's oil empire at a secret meeting at the White House on a summer night in 1906. Surrounded by his Attorney General and other key cabinet members, he mapped out the antitrust suit against Standard Oil that prompted Henry Clay Frick, the steel baron, to complain on behalf of his fellow oligarchs, "We bought the son of a bitch, and then he didn't stay bought."
It took five years for Roosevelt to win his case in the Supreme Court, breaking up Standard Oil into 34 companies. And for the better part of the next 70 years, Washington's economic agenda was dominated by the high-stakes politics of curbing the power of big enterprises: The regulatory zeal of the New Deal, the oil cartel cases of the 1950's and 60's, the failed -- and now foolish looking -- 13-year pursuit of I.B.M., the breakup of the Bell System. 
 But something has changed in Washington in the past decade or so, something that has taken the issue that Woodrow Wilson called "these vast aggregations of capital" off the country's political agenda, even as it lives on in courtroom arguments about the legality of Microsoft's strategies to dominate the electronic ether.
Last week, when two of the biggest remaining parts of the old Rockefeller empire, Exxon and Mobil, were recombined in the world's largest merger, Washington yawned. Richard A. Gephardt, the pro-union, pro-consumer voice of the Democratic Party's left wing, spent the day complaining loudly -- about the Clinton impeachment inquiry, and he has yet to say anything about the deal, according to his office. In fact, scarcely a politician of any stripe headed for the cameras to question whether the $75 billion deal was good for the country, for workers or for consumers.
The same silence greeted the deal that created Citigroup, which was the largest financial services company for a few minutes until Deutsche Bank bought the Bankers Trust Corporation earlier this month, and Cargill Inc.'s move to snap up Continental Grain, one of the few huge concerns that farmers could turn to if they didn't like the prices Cargill was offering for their harvest.
President Clinton, only steps away from the room where Roosevelt held forth 92 years ago, was hardly pounding the podium. "My position on mergers," he said, "has always been that if they increase the competitiveness of the company and bring lower prices and higher quality services to the consumers of our country, then they are good, and if they don't, they aren't."
Mr. Clinton's fence-sitting reflects the odd politics of an era of prosperity tinged with uncertainty. A few years ago downsizing was a brewing political issue; though layoffs continue -- last week the Asian economic crisis claimed another 28,000 workers at Boeing -- job growth has been so strong that that the issue has been defused.
LESS than a decade ago, when Japanese corporations snapped up Rockefeller Center and two Hollywood studios, many in Congress were in an uproar over the sale of American icons to foreigners. But these days, with the Dow bobbing at record levels and analysts declaring the triumph of American-style capitalism, neither the Deutsche Bank acquisition or Daimler-Benz's purchase of the Chrysler Corporation last spring has yielded a similar furor.
Many theories have been offered to explain this new passivity about the evils of Big Everything: the pace of technological change, or the realities of borderless competition in a year of global tumult, or the confusing business currents that at once celebrate the global reach of American-based multinationals and the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses.
And perhaps it's just temporary -- if prices start going up again at the pump, or if the American economy falters, there could be a renewed clamor to reign in corporations viewed as too big, too powerful or too heartless. But whatever the reason, noted Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who is among the few in Congress still exercised about the concentration of corporate power, "Once upon a time this was a burning issue, and now it's not even on the table."
The Government's current antitrust case against Microsoft seems at first blush be the notable exception: It's hard to turn on the television these days without hearing about the company's supposed scheme to dominate the Internet browser market, or its secret strategies to flatten competitors. (Imagine the muck Ida Tarbell could have raked with access to E-mail.)
But among politicians, the case is rarely mentioned. No one ran for office on a platform of Gates-bashing the way Roosevelt once called Rockefeller's crowd "the biggest criminals in the country." At a rare high-profile hearing this year on the long-term effect of mergers, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued that the Government was inept at determining in advance those mergers that would create competitive problems and would be wiser to wait and see.
"I would feel very uncomfortable if we inhibited various different types of mergers or acquisitions on the basis of some presumed projection as to how markets would evolve, how technology would evolve," he said, "because history is strewn with people making projections that have turned out to be grossly inaccurate."
Mr. Greenspan's view was challenged at the hearing, chiefly by Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, and Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which will review the Exxon-Mobil merger and presumably force the company to divest some assets. Mr. Pitofsky noted that undoing the damage after employees of an acquired company have been fired, after its plants have been closed and after top management has moved on, "is enormously expensive."
BUT the fact remains that few lawmakers dare to venture deep into this territory, even though it sustained generations of their predecessors. "The biggest reason is the mix of money and politics," says Senator Wellstone, who is intensely focused on the issue as he decides whether to run for his party's Presidential nomination. "For both parties, these are the heavy hitters, the monied interests who have a huge impact on the tenure of people in Congress. Not too many people want to challenge them."
Of course, that was also true in Roosevelt's day, even if Frick and other monopolists came to regret their support of the President. But Senator Wellstone notes a second reason: the quiet arrival in Washington of "a set of shared assumptions about what is necessary these days for survival in a global economy."
The first is that while bigger is not always better, it may be the only way to extend one's reach abroad. "The ability to be a global player and to be competitive anywhere in the world has become more important as all the traditional walls of regulation, state ownership and time barriers have come down," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
The second assumption is that technology moves faster than antitrust cases. When the Government began its push against I.B.M in the late 1960's, the microprocessor had just been invented. By the time the case was abandoned, the microprocessor was revolutionizing the computer industry, and I.B.M. was missing the boat. It caught up, but market dominance was no longer an issue.
And the breakup of the Bell System, while leading to lower long-distance rates and helping to promote technological advances, has also driven millions of consumers up the wall. For many, the only thing more annoying than trying to figure out how to get a phone fixed is answering dinner time calls from solicitors trying to sign up customers for a new phone service nobody has ever heard of.
In the end, today's trust-busters are no longer politicians but technocrats and regulators who, over the next few months, will be reviewing neighborhood-by-neighborhood what to do about streets that have both a Mobil and an Exxon station. Almost no one is talking about blocking the merger itself, a merger that a decade ago Exxon would not have dared to think possible.

HEADLINE: He's Seen The Enemy. It Looks Like Him.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
THAT would Freud have made of the way George Soros, the world's most famous hedge fund manager, describes the tension brought on by having made a fortune as a speculator and then having reinvented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist?
"Sometimes I felt like a gigantic digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other," Mr. Soros writes earthily in the preface to his new book, "The Crisis of Global Capitalism" (Public Affairs, $26). "But in fact a considerable amount of thought connected the two ends." 
 And what to make of a man who has raked in billions of dollars through lightning strikes in free-wheeling currency markets, but now advises the world on how to clean up the messes he thinks such strikes create?
While Mr. Soros has been playing the multiple roles of trader, philosopher and philanthropist for many years, the friction has come into sharpest relief in recent months, as he has boldly prescribed cures for a variety of the world's economic ills.
It has been most conspicuous in Russia, where Mr. Soros, with more than $1 billion at stake in the country, actively lobbied Russian and American officials to accept his advice on the best way to resolve the summer's financial crisis. Mr. Soros' book includes a day-by-day account of his high-level phone contacts and memo-writing in the weeks before and after the August devaluation of Russia's currency, the ruble.
"There's a potential conflict -- I've always taken great care not to exploit it," said Mr. Soros, 68, gently tapping his eyeglasses against a conference table in his mid-Manhattan office. "And I think that people, both in Russia and Washington, knew that, and that's why they took the calls, because I think I have established a certain record in that regard."
Still, many observers wonder about Mr. Soros' straddling of so many fences in the worlds of finance, economics and politics.
"I think there's a built-in conflict between making money in public markets and improving the world," said James Grant, editor of a newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, and the author of several studies of financial markets. "Soros is out there telling you what he's done, what he's going to do and how he'll save the world. I think there's a conflict because those goals seem at cross-purposes."
"It raises questions about inside information when you're able to talk to central bankers and policy makers at the same time that you're involved in financial markets," Mr. Grant said.
For his part, Mr. Soros, dapper and attentive, defended his probity in a wide-ranging interview last week, saying he has always strived to keep separate his roles as a hard-nosed trader placing global bets and a financial guru able to rub elbows with the highest of the high and mighty. Though he had run-ins with American regulators in the 1970's and 80's, he has never been accused of insider trading or similar financial wrongdoing.
"We have to distinguish between playing by the rules and making the rules," Mr. Soros said. "Playing by the rules, one does the best one can, irrespective of the social consequences. Whereas in making the rules, people ought to be concerned with the social consequences and not with their personal interests -- in other words, not to bend the rules to their benefit or their advantage. This is a principle which I have certainly observed."
Yet Mr. Soros, who is believed to be worth about $5 billion, is uniquely positioned to help determine how the rules are made in some parts of the world, and he built his fortune in currency markets where the rules were never entirely clear.
AS the Russian crisis mounted in August, for example, Mr. Soros worked his Rolodex, summoning influential Russian politicians and United States Treasury Department officials to the telephone. He pushed for a big international bailout and a devaluation of the ruble to bolster Russia's troubled economy.
At the same time, Mr. Soros had $1 billion invested in a Russian telecommunications concern -- through a partnership with one of Russia's powerful "oligarchs" -- as well as investments in Russian stocks, bonds and the ruble. Mr. Soros was also the overseer of a philanthropic foundation in Moscow that generously financed a range of causes, including education, the arts, sciences and media, through about $61 million in annual grants.
If Mr. Soros ruled the world, he said, he would establish an international regulatory agency to rein in speculative excesses and provide financing during economic crises.
"To put it bluntly, the choice confronting us is whether we will regulate global financial markets internationally, or leave it to each individual state to protect its own interests," he wrote in his book. "The latter course will surely lead to the breakdown of the gigantic circulatory system which goes under the name of global capitalism."
That prescription reflects the fact that Mr. Soros has long harbored a certain disdain for the profession that made him rich. Indeed, his record is such that he -- along with Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha financier, and perhaps Peter Lynch, the Fidelity fund guru -- is among the few investors whose names are widely recognized by the public.
A Hungarian-born Jew, Mr. Soros was 14 when the Nazis invaded his homeland. He avoided the fate of many Jews by posing as the godson of a Hungarian official overseeing the confiscation of Jewish properties. He moved to London after the war and eventually graduated from the London School of Economics. There he came under the influence of the philosopher Karl Popper, whose "open societies" credo Mr. Soros re-fashioned as his own. Popper opposed totalitarian states; Mr. Soros believes that participatory democracy and regulated market economies are the vehicles for insuring individual freedom.
His academic training led to the fascination with abstract thinking that pervades much of his writing. "But if you get too abstract, you have nothing to grapple with and abstraction empties your thinking of content," he acknowledged last week.
Mr. Soros, at first hard up for cash and then stymied by limited opportunities in London, moved to New York in the late 1950's and became a trader. He soon carved out a niche exploiting differences between the London and New York markets, a gulch he mined through the 60's before venturing into the new world of hedge funds.
Hedge funds -- largely unregulated investment pools open only to wealthy investors and big institutions -- aim to provide consistently outsized returns on stocks, bonds, currencies or other securities while limiting losses from market downturns. Mr. Soros, an aggressive, gutsy speculator, ran one of the earliest and most successful of these -- the Quantum Fund -- for two decades beginning in 1969.
Basing Quantum in the loosely regulated confines of the Caribbean island of Curacao, Mr. Soros often racked up returns in excess of 30 percent a year and twice posted annual returns of more than 100 percent, according to the fund's most recent quarterly report. He was one of the first investors to hunt down opportunities around the world, eventually spawning a legion of imitators and fellow enthusiasts.
"George opened all of our thinking to macroeconomic theory, and he made globalists of us all by making us understand the importance of geopolitical events on the U.S. economy," said Byron Wien, chief domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who has known Mr. Soros for about 30 years.
Mr. Soros gave up day-to-day management of Quantum in 1989, but he is still consulted on major trades and is one of three supervisors of Soros Fund Management, the New York firm that oversees Quantum and his other funds. Since the late 1980's he has also been a ubiquitous philanthropist, donating money to causes around the globe to realize his vision of an open society. Last year, his foundations gave away $428 million, with Russia the single largest recipient and political reform in Eastern Europe one of his chief causes.
Along the way, Mr. Soros has become an incisive critic of the predations of unfettered capitalism, a theme that has taken on even greater resonance in the wake of the financial calamities in Asia and Eastern Europe over the last 18 months.
"Markets basically are amoral, whereas society does need some kind of morality -- a distinction between right and wrong," Mr. Soros observed. "And by allowing market values to become all-important, we actually narrow the space for moral judgment and undermine public morality. This has actually happened, and globalization has increased this aberration, because it has actually reduced the power of individual states to determine their destiny."
OF course, no one in the markets proves the point better than Mr. Soros himself. It was in 1992 that he became a household name, when Quantum and related funds, largely using piles of borrowed money, made more than $1 billion in a few weeks by betting against the British pound. Britain's central bank wasted its reserves in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's value. The episode derailed Britain's membership in a European initiative seeking to rationalize exchange rates -- and it earned Mr. Soros this sobriquet: "the man who broke the Bank of England."
Mr. Soros has also described some forms of financial derivatives -- highly volatile and complex investing products -- as the economic equivalent of crack cocaine. Yet he has used derivatives in his own speculating, explaining that his funds favor only the simplest varieties.
Such inconsistencies give pause to those who might otherwise share his views. "It's an amusing spectacle to see a guy like him who's made a fortune speculating now going around denouncing newcomers to the field," said Doug Henwood, author of "Wall Street" (Verso, $25), an examination of financial markets. "It's like he suddenly found religion late in life and now wants to be Hegel in a hedge fund."
Closet Hegel or not, Mr. Soros is still very much a market maven, intimately involved in his hedge funds' overall activities. That has created some notable flare-ups in the last year, as politicians and financiers alike grappled with understanding the causes of the recent wave of global economic turmoil.
Repeatedly, the finger has been pointed at speculators. Developing nations that had welcomed the capital of foreign investors when it flowed into their economies decried "hot money" as it whipped out. Speculators like Mr. Soros were blamed for destabilizing one nation after another that lacked the financial resources to defend their currencies when signs of economic weakness drew traders' attacks.
In early 1997, Mr. Soros' funds were shorting Thailand's currency, the baht, and Malaysia's currency, the ringgit -- that is, betting that the value of both currencies would drop. In July, Thailand dropped its defenses, devaluing the baht. That set off the wave of devaluations in Malaysia and elsewhere that marked the beginning of the current global economic turmoil.
Mr. Soros said that by the time of the devaluations, his funds had become active buyers of the currencies, believing that they had already hit bottom. But that did not shield him from withering accusations, mainly from Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia. "The Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this -- depress the ringgit," Mr. Mahathir said in blaming Mr. Soros and other currency traders for Malaysia's economic woes.
In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Soros criticized Mr. Mahathir and his policies. "He needs to be removed from power," Mr. Soros said.
MR. SOROS' manifold roles on the world stage became most apparent in August, during the Russian economic meltdown, when he leaped into the fray.
Though he had a longstanding interest in Russia -- inspired by his father's time there as a prisoner of war, followed by a brief residency, during and after World War I -- Mr. Soros said he had steered clear of investing there in the years immediately after the fall of Communism. Rather, he sank money into the country through philanthropy.
"I abstained from investing in Russia," Mr. Soros wrote in his new book, "partly to avoid any conflict-of-interest problems but mainly because I did not like what I saw."
But as early as 1994, he had been in and out of Russia as an investor. And in 1997, he plunged headlong into Russian markets when they were among the frothiest on the planet.
Mr. Soros explains now that his concerns about the country were allayed by his confidence in the young reformers surrounding President Boris N. Yeltsin.
But his largest single holding in Russia -- a $1 billion stake in Svyazinvest, a telecommunications concern -- put him into partnership with Vladimir Potanin, the young chairman of one of Russia's biggest banks. Mr. Potanin is a member of a powerful and politically influential clique of Russian businessmen known as the "oligarchs." These men deftly exploited lucrative opportunities that came with privatization in Russia and used dubious tactics to snare control of huge industrial concerns.
"I bought it on the thesis that robber capitalism was ready to turn into legitimate capitalism," Mr. Soros said of his holding in Svyazinvest.
But the transition proved bumpy. In March, Mr. Soros lent the Russian Government several hundred million dollars to help it meet overdue pension payments. By the summer, as a corrupt and debt-ridden economy was tumbling toward insolvency, Mr. Soros was Russia's biggest individual investor. Besides his investment with Mr. Potanin -- which he now describes as the worst of his career -- he also held Russian stocks, bonds and rubles.
All of this hardly made Mr. Soros a disinterested observer when he sprang into action in mid-August to try to stem the crisis.
According to the account in his book, Mr. Soros contacted both Robert E. Rubin, the American Treasury Secretary, and David A. Lipton, an under secretary who has since left the Treasury Department. He also telephoned two influential former members of Mr. Yeltsin's administration, Yegor T. Gaidar and Anatoly B. Chubais, to lobby them on how to prevent an economic collapse.
On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Mr. Soros published a letter in The Financial Times saying that the meltdown in the Russian financial markets had "reached the terminal phase." He called for immediate action, including a devaluation and the institution of a currency board -- a system fixing a nation's currency to the value of its richest trading partner. Such a plan would have taken away Russian central bankers' discretion over monetary policy.
The letter helped prompt a panic in Russian markets -- and invited a fresh bout of suspicion about Mr. Soros' motives. Later in the day, he issued a statement saying that he was not shorting the ruble, adding that his own portfolio "would be hurt by any devaluation." In his book, he added that he did not trade any Russian securities during the crisis.
By the weekend, Russia appeared headed for a default on its foreign and domestic debt. In a private meeting in Russia's White House on Sunday, Aug. 16, business leaders -- including Mr. Potanin -- persuaded members of the Yeltsin administration to add a moratorium on debt repayment to a deep devaluation of the ruble that was to be announced the next day.
That announcement caused international investors to flee Russia, touching off a global financial panic and setting in motion the events that would lead, a month later, to the near-collapse and Government-orchestrated bailout of another big hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
Mr. Soros says self-interest played no part in his financial diplomacy during the meltdown.
"In Russia, of course, I had been very involved and became more involved at the time of the crisis," he said last week. "But the advice that I gave, which I think would have avoided the breakdown, was not designed to benefit me personally."
Indeed, at the end of August, Mr. Soros' funds announced a $2 billion loss in Russia. But it is hard to imagine that the country's economic stabilization -- the goal of his activism -- could have failed to bolster Svyazinvest.
Ever philosophical, Mr. Soros acknowledges that his foray into Russia was problematic. "I have no regrets with regard to my attempts to help Russia move toward an open society: They did not succeed, but at least I tried," he wrote in his book. "I have grave regrets as an investor. It goes to show how difficult it is to reconcile the two roles."
But a former American official who has crossed paths with Mr. Soros said the speculator's many roles made it hard to weigh his advice. "The fact that one part of him is motivated by the philanthropy and another part by the investments makes it very difficult to deal with him," said the former official, who insisted on anonymity. "Sometimes the philanthropy dominates his motives. Sometimes investing does. But there's that duality, and you never know."

As Russia tumbled into financial and political disarray in August, George Soros was in day-to-day contact with key figures in both Moscow and Washington, according the account he provides in his new book, "The Crisis of Global Capitalism." In the photo above, an employee of a Moscow currency exchange posted prices on Aug. 17, when the ruble was devalued.
 
August 7, Friday
Mr. Soros calls Anatoly B. Chubais and Yegor T. Gaidar, former Government officials still close to President Boris N. Yeltsin, to propose a public-private bailout of Russia's debt-ridden Government. He says he is willing to put up $500 million through Svyazinvest, a telecom-munications company in which he has a large stake, and to help round up the rest of a $10 billion fund. Mr. Soros follows up with a call to David A. Lipton, the United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, to sound him out on the idea. Without my scheme, the Government will default with cataclysmic consequences, Mr. Soros writes.
 
August 10, Monday
Mr. Soros talks briefly with Mr. Lipton, left, who says the Clinton Administration has reached no conclusion about the Soros proposal.
 
August 11, Tuesday
Russian markets collapse. Trading on the stock market is temporarily suspended. Yields on Russian Treasury bills soar above 100 percent. Mr. Soros decides that his original plan is no longer sufficient; only a rescue package of $15 billion or more can stabilize Russian markets.
 
August 13, Thursday
Mr. Soros publishes a letter in The Financial Times, below, declaring that immediate action is required to salvage Russia's economy. He proposes a 15 to 25 percent devaluation of the ruble, followed by the creation of a board linking the ruble to sounder currencies. Russian stocks open 15 percent lower. After the markets tumble, Mr. Soros issues a statement saying he is not shorting the ruble.
 
August 14, Friday
President Yeltsin vows that there will be no devaluation. Some major banks fail to meet payments to one another. Prices of United States Treasury bonds rise as investors flee to safety. Mr. Soros talks to Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, to stress that the situation is urgent. He is approached on behalf of Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the Russian Prime Minister, about a $500 million bridge loan. Mr. Soros rejects that idea, but offers to fly to Moscow for talks.
 
August 15 & 16, Saturday & Sunday
On Echo Moskva radio, Mr. Soros says that there is no way he can benefit from a devaluation. He speaks several times to Mr. Gaidar.
 
August 17, Monday
The Kremlin effectively devalues the ruble by 35 percent and imposes a 90-day debt moratorium. Russian markets collapse.
 
August 18, Tuesday
Mr. Lipton calls, seeking a technical explanation of Russia's devaluation and debt moratorium. Mr. Soros writes a memo for the Treasury Department outlining his currency board proposal.
 
August 21, Friday
Mr. Soros says his investment funds are buyers of stocks and sellers of put options in the falling United States market. They have not traded any Russian securities during the entire period of market turmoil, he says.
 
August 23, Sunday
Mr. Yeltsin dismisses Prime Minister Kiriyenko, reinstating Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, left. Now I can't predict it anymore, Mr. Soros writes.

A Blessing and a Curse: Life Without Overtime

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: ANDERSON, Ind.

 BODY:
NOW that his weekends are suddenly free, Ronald L. Grissom is not sure how to spend the idle time. He slept a lot on that first free weekend, in November, and he and his wife, Stephanie, decorated the Christmas tree last weekend. They have been talking about the various movies they would like to see, and if the weather stays warm they will probably go bicycling in the flat, open countryside.
Mr. Grissom is not unemployed. He is not, at age 57, one of the thousands of manufacturing workers who have been laid off around the country because of global economic turmoil. In fact, he has been employed as a blue-collar factory worker in this industrial and agricultural area northeast of Indianapolis for 36 years without ever being laid off, even for a day. 
 Rather, the time on Mr. Grissom's hands results from a first cousin of downsizing. He has suddenly lost the overtime that had kept him at work nearly every weekend and every holiday for five years. And so the Grissoms find their income and purchasing power sharply reduced and their everyday lives altered -- both for better and for worse.
For better, the Grissoms will spend more time together. Mrs. Grissom lists the ways: They will take more day trips and vacations, and they will work together on the 15-acre farm they bought and moved to three years ago. "I had only helped her with the tomatoes and beans," Mr. Grissom said. "Now we will till the land, and I will have time to paint the barn and do other neglected repair work."
BUT would he go back to all the overtime if he could get it? Absolutely, they both said: The money is irresistible. "When I worked a Sunday, I got double time, $40 an hour, and on holidays, triple pay, $60 an hour," Mr. Grissom said. The extra pleasures this money bought and the extra retirement savings must now be sacrificed. "I have never known anyone our age," said Mrs. Grissom, who is 45, "who has turned down overtime."
Her husband's wage history over the past decade helps to explain why the current economic expansion has featured such robust consumer spending -- and why, even now, Mr. Grissom and many other American factory workers, most of them unionized, are still among the nation's better earners.
As the economic expansion unfolded, Mr. Grissom's annual income more than doubled, reaching $117,000 last year, thanks to overtime, which manufacturers have piled on their existing workers to avoid hiring more people.
Mr. Grissom was headed for another six-figure year when the overtime all but stopped last month. Now he calculates that he will finish 1998 at $97,000, and next year at about $60,000 -- $43,000 in base salary and the rest, he hopes, in overtime.
His experience, though dramatic, reflects a national trend. Overtime for the nation's 18.6 million manufacturing workers has fallen to 4.5 hours a week on average over the last three months, from 4.9 hours in January. The 8 percent drop in so few months is unusually sharp, the Labor Department said.
Mr. Grissom, who dropped out of Indiana University after three semesters, has spent most of his career working for General Motors in several of its auto parts plants in this area. Today he works in a former G.M. plant now owned by Magnequench International Inc., a Chinese company.
The factory produces tiny magnets for computers, anti-lock brakes, ignition switches and the like. It also produces a special powder from which the magnets are made. Mr. Grissom works in the powder-making process.
Magnequench sells both the powder and the magnets, and some of the powder has been exported to Asia. But the powder is also produced now in China, cutting into the Indiana plant's exports. That is one reason that overtime has suddenly been curtailed at the plant -- although Mr. Grissom did manage to work on Thanksgiving Day, at triple pay.
THE curtailment translates into an altered life style. A high-powered telescope is mounted on an aluminum tripod near a dining room window in the Grissoms' bungalow-sized home. They had paid $700 for the telescope as an early Christmas present to themselves and they have looked at the stars a couple of times. That sort of purchase won't happen again, they said, and their practice of buying a new car each year is also on hold.
By January, Mrs. Grissom plans to be working full-time again as a freelance legal secretary. She hopes to earn $20,000 in 1999, up from $7,000 this year as a part-timer. And Mr. Grissom, who plans to retire in four years -- if he is not laid off first -- is reconciling himself to a $7,500 contribution to his 401(k) plan in 1999, down from $10,000 this year. He now has $100,000 saved up.
"I am one of the last of the wealthy blue-collar workers," he said. "I am a dying breed."

HEADLINE: The World;
The French Aren't Alone in Having Gall

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
WITH allies like France, does the United States really need enemies? Put another way: With allies like Britain, who needs France?
More often than they like to admit, exasperated American policy makers have asked themselves questions like these over the years. 
 But as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright heads for Brussels and Paris this week for meetings with allied foreign ministers and a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, she might reflect that American disagreements with Britain over the past half century have sometimes been as rancorous as those with the French.
The United States and Britain clashed over a joint French and British attempt to grab the Suez Canal in 1956, and did not see eye to eye about what should be done to stop the fighting in Bosnia until 1995.
But ever since two soul mates named Churchill and Roosevelt commiserated about their dealings with an individualist named de Gaulle, the strong underlying assumption of trust that exists between Washington and London has simply not been there to the same degree between Washington and Paris.
Americans tend to think the world of the British, and the worst of the French. Even when France and the United States are in basic agreement, as they are at the moment on Iraq, there's always somebody like Senator John McCain of Arizona to throw a monkey wrench into the works.
Senator McCain, whom the French consider no friend, appeared to suggest on an American television news show that the reason Saddam Hussein had been able to avoid Anglo-American bombing last month might have been that France had tipped him off that the bombers were on the way.
Never mind that the United States itself had warned Iraq repeatedly that it faced imminent bombing if it didn't back down and comply with United Nations resolutions on arms inspection. Mr. McCain denied accusing the French, and officials in Britain later confirmed that nobody had given the exact timetable to them anyway.
Even when Britain and the United States are in basic disagreement, as they were during much of the war in Bosnia until 1995, American Anglophilia tends to rewrite history. This left the impression that it was actually the French who didn't want the United States to start bombing in Bosnia to stop Serbian aggression and halt attacks on lightly armed United Nations peacekeepers from Britain and France.
FRANCE did indeed have to overcome sympathies for Serbia that date from World War I, but as recently published memoirs by a British commanding general of the United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia, Sir Michael Rose, confirm, Britain was strongly opposed to heavy NATO bombing raids that the Americans kept wanting to launch against the Bosnian Serbs.
Prime Minister John Major's conservative Government feared that the Serbs would retaliate by attacking the peacekeepers. The impasse was not broken until President Jacques Chirac came to power in France in 1995 and mobilized British and American support for a policy with more military muscle, after the Serbs overran the United Nations "safe area" in Srebrenica and massacred Muslim civilians.
NATO did go ahead with a strategic bombing campaign and the Serbs, after suffering other setbacks on the ground, agreed to a cease-fire and a beefed-up NATO peacekeeping operation that finally put American troops, along with others, on the ground alongside the French and British.
The Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has begun moving closer to French ideas for making Europe capable of an autonomous defense within NATO, but it has also made privileged British relations with the United States a declared strategic objective.
That is much too abject a policy for France, French officials say. After all, Louis XVI gave the Marquis de Lafayette 6,000 troops to help George Washington in 1777 not because the King shared Lafayette's enthusiasm for the revolutionaries but to make trouble for the British, who were his enemy.
Ever since, French-American relations have been like a long-running marriage, frequently warmed by frictions.
De Gaulle restored pride to a nation humiliated by defeat in World War II, often at American expense. "The French need to take pride in France," de Gaulle explained to his acolyte Alain Peyrefitte in 1962. "Otherwise, they fall into mediocrity, fight with each other and head for the bistro."
Henry Kissinger understood. "De Gaulle was not anti-American in principle," he wrote in his book "Diplomacy" (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster). "He was willing to cooperate whenever, in his view, French and American interests genuinely converged. Thus during the Cuban missile crisis, American officials were astonished by de Gaulle's all-out support -- the most unconditional backing extended to them by any allied leader."
DE GAULLE dominated Europe, but he didn't want anyone else to -- not the Soviet Union, certainly, but not the United States, either.
Even today, French leaders tend to see the United States in Steinbeckian terms, as a strong, friendly but unsophisticated giant whose full embrace might be fatal.
So when the United States says that it really does want a united, prosperous Europe, and doesn't feel threatened by plans for the euro, the new common European currency that will used next month, the French either don't believe it or suspect that what the United States must really want is a Europe led by Britain.
The French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, also worries about a world in which there is only one superpower -- the United States -- overwhelming all other countries with its military, economic, technological and cultural strength. "Their weight carries them towards hegemonism, and the idea they have of their mission is unilateralism," he told the daily Liberation recently. "And that is not acceptable."
French diplomats tell their American friends that frank advice, not sycophantism, is the mark of true friendship. By that measure, France is indeed the most stalwart of allies.

Finessing Your Freedom

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. I'm a part-time contractor at a high-technology company. Recently, my supervisor asked if I would be interested in a full-time job, at less pay per hour but with stock options and other benefits. The truth is that I'm not interested -- I like the freedom and my current pay -- but I worry that if I reject his offer, he'll replace me with someone committed to the long haul. Any negotiating suggestions?
 
A. Freedom or security: It's a stark choice -- and one that your employer may not realize is a tough call for you. Because the company wants you full time, it clearly likes your work. Nevertheless, before deciding on a bargaining approach, talk with your boss about exactly why he made the offer. 
 "It may be that the company is looking to cut expenses or reduce its number of consultants," said Bob Deissig, president of recruiting services for the Ayers Group, a human resources consulting firm in New York. If so, you should seek ways to maximize your value -- like increasing your work load but not your fee -- that would make the company more willing to keep you on your terms.
Alternatively, your boss may simply be dazzled by your technical prowess and is afraid of losing you. Employers are often much more worried about your taking off than you are about being replaced -- particularly in this tight job market, said Robin Ryan, a Seattle-based career counselor and author of "Winning Resumes" (John Wiley & Sons, 1997).
In either case, the operative word is tact. By turning down a full-time gig, you are saying, in essence: "I really like you guys, but not enough to commit." Think about how that line played in your last personal relationship. Employers tend to take rejection about as well as insecure girlfriends or boyfriends, so when breaking the news to your supervisor, let him down easy.
Blame it on the money, Ms. Ryan advised: "Go to your employer and say, 'I just can't take a salary cut at this time.' " This puts your rejection in practical, hard-dollar terms that most business types can grasp. After all, stock options are a nice perk, but they can't pay the rent, and they often have no value until you have been with a company for 3, 5 or 10 years.
But no matter how practical your reasons, you need to make your rejection as flattering as possible, Mr. Deissig said. "Tell your supervisor how honored you are by the offer," he said, "and stress how terrific you think the organization is." Emphasize that you have no intention of abandoning the firm. "Assure them that the offer makes you even more committed to the organization," he added, "and ask what you can do to make everyone more comfortable with your consultant status."
If you do plan to stay, Mr. Deissig said, consider negotiating a long-term contract.
Of course, if your employer is desperate to hire you, he may counter with a second offer at your current pay -- or higher. At that point, you'll have to re-evaluate just how much you want to stay footloose and freelance.

Markets Battered, Then Bolstered

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
Perhaps investors overindulged during Thanks-giving week, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a record of 9,374.27, for last week seemed to be the post-party hangover. Shares were repeatedly battered, and a 185-point tumble on Thursday left the Dow nearly 500 points below its record.
 But on Friday, recovery set in. A strong employ-ment report buoyed spirits and led to hopes that robust consumer spending would bolster the economy and corporate profits. The Labor Department said unem-ployment in November fell to 4.4 percent, and the Dow closed at 9,016.14, up 136.46 points, or 1.54 percent, for the day but down 3.3 percent for the week. Among the big gainers were Microsoft, Intel, Compaq Computer, Lucent Technologies, regional banks and auto makers. 
 Despite the move by 11 European nations on Thursday to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, generally to 3 percent, European stock markets also fell for the week. In London, the FTSE 100 was down 262.3 points from a week earlier, closing at 5,581.9;in Frank-furt the electronically traded DAX ended at 4,802.76, down 356.45. In Paris, the CAC-40 closed at 3,738.59, down 212.35; the blue-chip Swiss Market Index was at 6,822.7, down 393.7.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
For Homeless Youths in New York, A Search for Happy Endings

BYLINE: By ADAM GERSHENSON 

 BODY:
David Hilton, the star point guard for the Hyde School Phoenix, never despairs when his basketball team falls way behind.
He has been down before, and he knows how to engineer a comeback.
Three years ago, at age 16, David was thrown out of his home and shunned by his family after he disclosed some of his family's problems to his high school guidance counselor. 
 As one of an estimated 20,000 homeless youths living on the streets of New York City, he had no interest in school, no hopes for the future, and nowhere to sleep except for an asphalt basketball court near his grandmother's house in Jamaica, Queens.
"I heard gunshots almost every night while I was sleeping," he said. "I was sure I was going to be just another statistic."
David's experiences on the streets were harrowing, but far from rare. Although homeless populations are difficult to measure, experts say there may be as many as two million homeless youths in America. This population has expanded rapidly, in part because the first generation of children born into families ravaged by the twin epidemics of the 1980's, crack cocaine and AIDS, is just now coming of age.
In past years, New York City earned a reputation as a magnet for these lost youths. Today, though, most experts agree that the overwhelming majority of youngsters sleeping on rooftops and in tunnels around the five boroughs are not small-town runaways.
"These kids are not from Utah; these are the children of New York City," said Tom Bundrick, a social worker at Safespace, a drop-in center for homeless teen-agers in Times Square.
One local agency, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, is determined to help these children of the city.
The Jewish Board, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation, relies on The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to support two centers in New York City that help homeless teen-agers from all religious backgrounds.
One is Kaplan House, a group home on St. Marks Place in the East Village. There, 25 young men, ages 17 to 21, from broken or nonexistent homes live together and receive counseling, tutoring and job training while they learn what it takes to become a successful adult. The other is Break Free, an outpatient psychiatric center in southern Brooklyn that offers therapy and drug treatment programs to keep boys and girls off the streets.
Carl Siciliano, director of homeless-youth services for Safespace, said the need for such programs is urgent.
"There are no services for most of these kids," he said. "They are too old for foster care and too young for adult shelters, so they fend for themselves any way they can. A lot of them end up on Rikers Island, or in the city morgue."
With the help of the Jewish Board, David Hilton instead wound up in prep school.
He arrived at Kaplan House in October 1996 after a year on the streets. By June 1997 David had developed emotionally, academically and athletically to the point where he earned a scholarship to the Hyde School in Woodstock, Conn. David did not become a statistic, but his statistics shine, both on his report card and in the box scores. On the court, he averages 32 points per game. In the classroom, he averages 80 points per test.
David will almost certainly receive an athletic scholarship to college in 2000, and he has the potential to one day become an All-Star in the National Basketball Association, coaches from New York City say.
Such happy endings for homeless teen-agers are hard to find. The teen-agers themselves, however, are everywhere.
 
Fleeing Abuse at Home For a Life on the Street
Theresa T., a 17-year-old from the Bronx, arrived at Break Free in October 1997, four years after leaving home because she could no longer tolerate the daily abuse.
Theresa, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used, said her mother beat her with belts, spoons and the cords of the Nintendo machine. Her uncles and cousins raped her repeatedly from the time she was a little girl, she said. Her father, who left when Theresa was 3, let Theresa stay in Brooklyn with him and one of his girlfriends occasionally, but after a few days, he always sent Theresa back to her mother's house. She ran away when she was 13, just two weeks before Christmas.
Theresa grew up quickly. At an age when other girls were still receiving weekly allowances, she earned pocket money baby-sitting the children of crack addicts. While other girls cuddled up with stuffed animals, she slept in abandoned buildings. And while other eighth graders strove to be accepted into the right clique, Theresa joined a street gang of women in their 20's. As part of her initiation, she allowed them to burn her with cigarettes.
"It was peaches and cream compared to home," she said.
But street life was no cure for Theresa's depression, and she tried marijuana and hallucinogens like LSD and PCP to help her forget her present and her past.
"As long as you get high, you're not thinking of what happened to you, who raped you, who molested you, how your family is, and how nasty and ugly you feel," she said, "and for a little while, everything's O.K."
Yet even in her most abject moments, Theresa did not give up on herself entirely. She never used crack or heroin, and she never prostituted herself for a place to stay, she said.
Her refusal to engage in these risky behaviors may sound like common sense, but it is uncommon for youths living on the street. In desperation, many rely on a street economy that revolves around petty crime, drug dealing and prostitution.
"To feed themselves, clothe themselves and find a place to sleep, these kids are selling their bodies," said Michael C. Clatts, an AIDS expert at the National Development and Research Institutes, a nonprofit research and service agency based in Manhattan. "It's survival sex."
But survival sex can be deadly. A July 1997 report by the institute estimated that 6 percent to 30 percent of homeless youths in New York City are H.I.V.-positive. The enormous range can be attributed to the difficulties in finding and testing young people who are most at risk, those who never make it to shelters.
Nor is AIDS the only threat. The New York City Police Department said it had no statistical breakdown on homicides of homeless teen-agers, but Mr. Clatts said that he personally knew six homeless youths who were killed on the streets this year.
Even when homeless teen-agers try to avoid crime and get jobs, they often find themselves stymied, because they lack job skills and have no telephone, permanent address or forms of identification.
For these reasons and more, Theresa is relieved that she found Break Free. "They helped me with everything," she said.
She needed the help. Although Linda V., one of her father's former girlfriends, took an interest in Theresa and welcomed her into her apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Theresa had developed a drinking habit, swallowing a bottle of rum a day.
At a friend's Sweet 16 party in October 1997, she drank so much that she later passed out in the subway and was taken by the police to Long Island City Hospital.
Linda retrieved Theresa and called the Jewish Board, which recommended Break Free. It meets at 2020 Coney Island Avenue, in what was once a Con Edison substation. Today, a different kind of power surges through the building: the power of people who desperately want to change their lives.
"The program worked because Theresa was really ready," said Deborah Rivera, one of her counselors. "She knew she was sick, but she saw a chance for a stable life and a decent future, and she took advantage of everything we offered."
Theresa and Linda underwent family therapy, and Theresa also attended individual and group therapy. Talking revived many painful memories, but Theresa finally faced them without drugs or alcohol. She tried to cleanse her spirit through dance therapy, and channeled her anger and sadness into poetry.
Theresa has not taken a drink or used any drugs in over a year. Now a high school senior with an 84 average, she hopes to attend the State University of New York at Plattsburgh in the fall. She has left the gang and found new friends at school. Instead of hanging out all night, she comes home at 5 P.M. during the week, and at midnight on the weekends. In August, Linda became her legal guardian.
Theresa has no intention of drinking again, or going back out on the streets. "There's more to life," she said. "Why would I want to take a step back when I've made it all this way?"
 
Finding a Sense of Self Through Basketball
Two weeks ago, David Hilton took a rare trip back to the old neighborhood.
He pointed out his grandmother's old house, one of 18 places he has lived in his 19 years. He remembered his teen-age uncle Timothy Hilton dragging him to the basketball court at the end of the block. David wanted to play baseball instead, but his uncle was in charge. David's mother was only 14 when David was born, and she was often absent during his childhood.
Perhaps because he never met his father, David revered his uncle. Timothy hung out at the basketball court, and he made David compete against the park regulars while he sold drugs on the court's periphery.
David was skinny, small and easily dominated. He thought Timothy was just trying to embarrass him.
Then, in 1993, Timothy was shot in the head and killed. David threw away his baseball glove and devoted himself to the sport his uncle had wanted him to play.
David was still at home then, but he is reluctant to talk about what life was like there because the consequences of speaking to his guidance counselor were so severe. He will say only that there were "problems." When his mother threw him out, he was confused. Even his grandmother would not let him in, because he had shared family secrets. He found some security at the basketball court, where he was determined to live up to Timothy's expectations.
David rarely had enough food in his stomach, but he pushed himself nonetheless. He played full-court against one friend at a time for three hours a night to improve his stamina. He fired jump shot after jump shot through the iron rim, then chased the ball down because there was no net.
When David was 17, a friend helped him get into a shelter for adults. For six weeks, he slept on a cot in a gymnasium with two dozen men, scores of rats and thousands of roaches. "I wasn't comfortable there, and I didn't feel safe," David said.
One day, he volunteered to work in the shelter's soup kitchen. As he fed the grizzled old men in their ragged clothes, he remembered something his mother had told him.
"She always told me I'd be nothing but a bum, but when I saw it in front of my face, I knew I wanted more for myself," he said.
When he learned about Kaplan House, David moved there from the men's shelter. At Kaplan House, he had his own room with a comfortable bed and found a nurturing staff.
"We gave him a good foundation and let him know he could get advice, get counseling and basically get whatever he needed to help carry him into the future," said Vic Butler, a counselor at Kaplan House for 15 years.
David made the most of his new home. He talked to Mr. Butler constantly, and rarely missed any of the free meals there.
David joined the Boys Club of New York, where he played basketball for a team called the Academic All-Stars. He saw it as his ticket to prep school and a chance to escape the city. To remain on the team, he had to maintain a better than C average at John Bowne High School.
He was smart, but he had never been a great student, and a stutter made it hard for him to speak in class. But he studied with the same determination he had shown on the basketball court night after night.
David improved his grades and became a dazzling player. He was almost 6 feet tall now, and growing. With incredible quickness and a developing jump shot, he started dominating the competition.
"He can be one of our future stars of the N.B.A," said Jim Couch, a summer league coach from Inwood who has helped tutor N.B.A. All-Stars like Mark Jackson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Last summer, David received his scholarship to the Hyde School.
He arrived with little knowledge of mathematics, but consistently strode to the blackboard and tried to solve problems. By the end of last year he was tutoring classmates in algebra. Last month, without a stammer, he delivered an eloquent speech on the philosophy of Henry David Thoreau.
After he graduates in 2000, David wants to attend college in Utah or Montana, although he cannot quite picture their landscapes. He would love to play in the N.B.A., but that is not his top priority.
On a recent cloudless day, as he walked across the basketball court, he looked to the future and said: "My goal is to be a good father. I don't need a million dollars. What's important is that whether I'm a lawyer, a doctor or a basketball player, my children will know they've got a home."
 
After a Childhood Lost, Seeking a Place to Belong
Angel, 20, is still out on the streets.
At 6, she lost her home in Nyack, N.Y., when her mother, father and twin brother, Adam, were killed by a drunken driver.
Child care agencies shifted Angel from foster home to foster home. "I always wanted to stay," she said. "I used to make pictures and hang them on the walls."
Angel, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, attended eight high schools without ever getting her diploma and has been on the streets since she was 18. Her last home was in a vacant building on Canal Street. She shared it last winter with 20 other young people. On cold nights, she put on all the clothes she had found on the street or had been given at local churches.
Angel said a police officer occasionally ducked into the building to give them blankets and food. "That felt great, because I knew somebody cared for me," she said in a near whisper.
Now the building is boarded up. Angel learns secretarial skills at Safespace and hopes they will one day find her a place to live. Unfortunately, most transitional housing is reserved for people with income from jobs or government benefits, and Angel has neither.
She cannot move into Kaplan House because she is a woman, and the services at Break Free are tailored to young people with drug problems. But when a spokeswoman for the Jewish Board learned of Angel's plight on Friday, she promised that the agency would try to help her.
For now, Angel spends her nights either on a friend's couch or in a chair at an adult drop-in center. When daylight comes, she visits libraries, often in search of "Homecoming," a book by Cynthia Voigt about a mother who abandons her children in a car. Angel said she has read it seven times.
For lunch she goes to Safespace on West 46th Street, then heads for the record shops in Times Square, where she listens to music for free. She likes "Runaway Train" by Soul Asylum, a song about "finding all the runaways and throwaways," she said.
When the shops close, the days start to feel long "because when you're homeless, it's like you have nowhere to go, nowhere to stay," Angel said. "You're like a nomad, wandering from place to place."

HEADLINE: A Census Man Retires After 6 Decades (but Who's Counting)

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Milton Kaufman never planned on a Government career when he was growing up in Coney Island in the 1920's. Working at Steeplechase amusement park, he dreamed of becoming a mathematics teacher. But after he graduated from the City University of New York with a master's degree in mathematics in 1933, the Government was the only place hiring. Schools could not afford to hire new teachers in the Depression.
"When I graduated from college, I couldn't get a job anywhere else," Mr. Kaufman said. 
 A tall, gentle man, who wears a suit and tie on the job and off, Mr. Kaufman retired this fall after 64 years of service at the Census Bureau. He shared the distinction of having the longest tenure of any active Federal employee, according to the Commerce Department.
With a sharp memory for dates and, not surprisingly, numbers, he is quick to recount his years of service in the Government, recalling specific days and months from the 1940's as if they were the day before yesterday.
His first job in 1933 was for the Works Progress Administration, an agency created under President Franklin D. Roosevelt to preserve job skills and lower the country's unemployment rate. Mr. Kaufman and about 100 other mathematicians conducted actuarial work for the Government, at $18 a week.
On July 1, 1934, he was hired by the Census Bureau, part of the Commerce Department, and officially became a Government employee. His 64-year tenure is counted from then.
While he worked at the Census Bureau, the United States' population more than doubled, rising to 270,913,356 when he retired from 126,373,773 in 1934. More than 80 percent of the current population was not yet born when Mr. Kaufman, now 87, was hired by the bureau.
Mr. Kaufman moved to the bureau's newly formed Foreign Trade Division in 1942. During World War II, one of his first assignments was to help prepare a classified report with a detailed listing of export cargo on vessels sunk by the enemy.
"Most of the operations during the War were part of the Lend-Lease program, giving cargo to allies," he said. "Russia still owes us billions of dollars they haven't paid back."
After the war, Mr. Kaufman's files were photographed and sent to Russia and archives in the United States. The United States Government hopes that someday the report will "be used to get the payment back," Mr. Kaufman said, "but I won't live to see that."
The bureau's statistics, then, were tabulated by a machine, the Remington Rand tabulator, a predecessor to the I.B.M. computers statisticians use now, Mr. Kaufman said. In the 1950's, the Census Bureau made calculations on a Univac computer that took up an entire room.
Mr. Kaufman's work at the bureau focused on economic indicators to calculate the balance of trade in goods and services. He collected numbers to compile indicators of the country's exports and imports. He rose to the rank of senior foreign trade statistician.
After working for nearly two-thirds of a century, Mr. Kaufman seems surprised to find that he enjoys his retirement, and his wife, also in her 80's, is getting used to having him around the house more. But if he had not had a heart attack almost a year and a half ago, he says, he probably would have continued to work. "I'd have no reason to stop," Mr. Kaufman said. "No Florida for me."

HEADLINE: American Colleges Begin to Ask, Where Have All the Men Gone?

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Slowly but surely, college campuses that for decades were dominated by males are becoming the place where the boys are not.
In a trend that is reshaping everything from recruiting to social life, women increasingly outnumber men at colleges and universities. Even if the imbalance never becomes extreme, it raises concerns about the consequences of fewer men getting advanced education, and the sense that the liberal arts education may become a women's domain. 
 "I don't know why there are more women here, but I know that in high school I always felt women did better and cared more about doing well," said Catherine Gang, a sophomore at New York University, where there are nearly six women for every four men, a ratio shared by, among others, Fordham University, the University of California at Santa Cruz, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Beloit College.
Nationally, the population of students enrolled in higher education tipped toward women more than a decade ago, and the skew is growing, year by year. Although census figures show that there are slightly more college-age men than women, according to United States Department of Education statistics, there were 8.4 million women and only 6.7 million men enrolled in college in 1996, the last year for which statistics are available.
The number of men enrolled in college has declined each year from 1991 to 1995 but rose in 1996, while the number of women has risen steadily. And by 2007, the department projects, that gender gap will be larger, with 9.2 million women and only 6.9 million men.
Women outnumber men in every category of higher education: public, private, religiously affiliated, four-year, two-year. And among part-time students, older students and African-Americans, the skew is much larger.
"Men are just not as interested in higher education as women," said Alan McIvor, vice president of enrollment services at Beloit in Wisconsin, who two years ago began urging the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, a group of 14 liberal arts colleges, to study the issue. "They have these nonacademic interests: the butcher, baker, the candlestick maker. But at a residential liberal arts college, where kids learn as much from each other as from their professors, I think we should be concerned about the mix of students, about gender balance, about attracting more young men who are as strong as our women applicants."
There is no clear consensus on what men are doing instead of college, and why they are less committed to higher education. But education experts say it is probably a confluence of factors, from girls' greater success in high school to a strong economy that may give boys a sense that they can make their way without higher education, whether in computer work or the military.
And at a time when the country's high school graduation rate is lagging behind the rates in other industrialized nations, boys are more likely to drop out than girls.
"You start with who does well in high school, and girls are ahead there, which some people say is because they tolerate boredom better," said Patricia Albjerg Graham, president of the Spencer Foundation of Chicago, which specializes in educational research, and past dean of the Harvard School of Education. "Then there are racial and ethnic differences; black girls persist in school more than black boys. Those differences account for part of what's going on, but I think the larger difference is that men feel it easier to get a job that can support them. This tilt to women has a great deal to do with what people of modest means do or don't do educationally, and whether they see higher education as necessary to their future."
Given the widening income gap between high school graduates and those with advanced degrees, though, many education experts worry that men's failure to pursue higher education will seriously limit their life choices.
"We need to be concerned that higher education is losing poor and minority men, that more African-American men are going to prison than to college," said Arthur Levine, the president of Columbia University's Teachers College. "It's also worth thinking about what it means if our broadest education, the liberal arts, is increasingly being reserved for one sex."
For college admissions officials, the underrepresentation of men poses a challenge. Most say they are aware of the gender imbalance, but not overly concerned -- yet.
But there seems to be a consensus that somewhere beyond a 60-40 split, there comes a moment when a school ceases to be a comfortable place for both sexes. "We do have some concern about the skew going too far," said Jerry Lucido, director of admissions at the University of North Carolina. "How far is too far? I guess that would be if students here thought it was a problem. We certainly don't want the reputation that Chapel Hill is not a place for men, because that's not true."
The threshold at which colleges start to worry has shifted in the last few years, said Dr. Levine, a former liberal arts college president.
"It used to be that you worried at 55 percent women, but the new wisdom is that anything up to 60 percent is O.K.," he said. "Probably nobody will admit it, but I know that lots of places try to get some gender balance by having easier admissions standards for boys than for girls. Recently, at a school where I was giving a speech, I asked 'How far down the list are you going for boys?' and the answer was 'All the way.' The problem is that if you take men who are not of the same caliber as the women, the highest-performing women leave, because the men aren't as interesting."
Admissions policies are not the only ways to address the issue, though. Many schools are repackaging themselves to attract more male interest.
"We've had researchers, in-house and independent, help us shape the messages we use in our letters to the individual candidates we contact through the College Board," said John Buckley, the dean of admissions at Fordham University. "For women, the messages we're stressing are small classes, personal attention and access to professors. For men, we're talking about internships and intercollegiate sports."
When Mr. Buckley arrived at Fordham 15 years ago, the student body was split evenly between men and women, but a skew became noticeable about five years ago, and now incoming freshman classes, he said, run about 59 percent women, 41 percent men.
Baylor University in Waco, Tex., which like Fordham is religiously affiliated, has also taken steps to entice male applicants.
"We're a liberal arts school with a large education school and we know we're heavy toward women, so we've fought it a little, by adding some majors that we thought would appeal to guys, and an engineering school," said Stan Madden, vice president of university relations. "We're having our recruiting literature redesigned, and we've been thinking about what's a feminine look, and what's a masculine look. We had a picture of a library with a lot of stained glass, and people said that was kind of a feminine cover. Now we're using a picture of the quadrangle."
While the colleges that were formerly for men only have had no trouble finding large numbers of female students, many former women's colleges are still struggling to attract enough qualified men to reach the 40-60 threshold.
"We talk about it a lot, that we're at 33 percent and until we reach the 40 percent threshold, we haven't completely made the transition," said Gail Berson, the dean of admissions at Wheaton College, in Massachusetts. "You need to have that critical mass."
And some, like Vassar and Sarah Lawrence, admit a higher percentage of male applicants than female ones.
"We have no preset criteria for men or women, and we review them one at a time, but we do take slightly more men," said David Borus, director of admissions at Vassar, which accepts not quite 40 percent of the women who apply, and slightly more than half the men. "Because we want to try and have some gender balance, I think there is a bit of a mindset that may be a bit more generous to the men."
At most engineering and technical schools, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon, men are still the majority. Harvard, Yale and Princeton still have a male edge, as do the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University.
But at most liberal arts schools, women are the majority.
"There may be a bias against the liberal arts, a feeling that real men don't speak French, that in the 20th century these are women's topics and men do economics and engineering," said Catharine R. Stimpson, a feminist scholar who is dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at N.Y.U.
At N.Y.U., Matthew Santirocco, the dean of the College of Arts and Science, said he was untroubled by the gender ratio.
"It's a very diverse, very inclusive environment," Mr. Santirocco said. "I'd only be troubled if it got to the point where it was a majoritarian environment, where the minority was afraid to raise their hands."
While the feeling may be absent at N.Y.U., Ms. Stimpson said, some schools develop a sense of unease as women become the majority.
"At some places, I've seen trustees worry about the skew," she said. "Male trustees get worried if the gender balance goes to 48 to 52, and the female trustees say, 'Are you crazy, were you worried when it was 48 to 52 the other way?' I think it's about money and prestige and an old atavistic fear of tipping. Some people still believe that if you're a women's institution, you're a lesser institution."
Students at N.Y.U. express mixed feelings about the gender imbalance, with many male students saying they thrive on it.
"I knew there were more girls than boys when I applied," said Hugh Curnutt, a junior, "and I thought it was a positive thing, because if there's more girls, the dating possibilities go up. I feel more comfortable in classes where there aren't so many guys. It's less competitive and intimidating. Guys always want to take you on. They're really quick to say, 'He's all wrong.' Girls might disagree but they'll say something like, "He might be right, but I think. . .' In my communications class I think there's 29 girls and 2 guys. I love it."
The women tend to be less enthusiastic.
"There aren't many guys to date, and the ones there are have their pick of so many women that they have a tendency to become players," said Ms. Gang, a drama student. "I've fallen in love with more gay guys than anyone should. And in scene classes, we have to do a whole lot of two-women scenes. But it's not so bad, because we're in New York City, and you can always find a way to meet people off campus."

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Rush to Invest In College Plan

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
When state officials announced the creation of New York's College Savings Program in September to help parents pay for their children's educations, it sounded like a narrow -- if nice -- election year initiative.
But thousands of investors, some with children who have already graduated from college, have signed up, drawn by the program's unusual flexibility and a tax break that is the largest in the nation for such plans. 
 Since the program began, more than $15 million has poured into more than 5,000 accounts, and many more are likely to be created this month to beat the Dec. 31 deadline for getting the tax breaks this year; 75,000 information packets and applications have been mailed out, according to TIAA-CREF, a private company managing the program.
State officials say they are encouraged by the early response to the program, which has not been widely advertised. "This much in two months -- wow," said Robert J. Maurer, president of the state's Higher Education Services Corporation, which administers grants. By this time next year, he forecast, the program will have about 50,000 accounts and $350 million in assets.
The program puts New York on the leading edge of a nationwide trend, as states try to come up with new ways to help middle-class residents pay for higher education. More than a dozen states have similar programs, and at least seven more are developing them, using New York as one of their models.
New York's program is open to people with a lot of money and people with just a little, people with a lot of children and people with none. Investment accounts can be set up for grandchildren, godchildren, friends, even for the investors themselves. And the money in these accounts can be spent at any accredited school, anywhere in the country, so it can be used for an undergraduate degree, law school or courses in creative writing or cooking.
If the money is not used for education, it will be fully taxed and incur a 1 percent penalty on the earnings.
A couple can put up to $10,000 a year into these accounts and deduct that money from the income on which they pay state taxes. People in the highest state tax bracket could cut their tax bills by almost $700, and those who live in New York City could save almost $1,000.
As long as the money stays in the account and is ultimately spent on education, the state will not tax it or the investment profits. In addition, Federal taxes on the profits will be deferred until the money is withdrawn. There is no limit on how much anyone can contribute, though no student-to-be's account can receive more than $100,000 in contributions.
State officials say that they did not intend to create a stealth tax break, but admit that they may have soft-pedaled the program a little. "All of us have been so involved in campaigning, and we didn't want to give the impression that this was a campaign gimmick," said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who won re-election last month.
More than 40 states have adopted some kind of tuition savings plan, according to the National Association of State Treasurers. And while they include the more common, limited programs -- allowing parents to prepay tuition at a state school, for example -- many of the newer ones are like New York's and a similar program that began in New Hampshire in July.
Peter Mazareas, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Finance Authority, sees those two states' programs as setting a standard. "I think something between New York and New Hampshire is going to be the model," he said
Massachusetts is among the seven states known to be developing one of these educational investment plans; the state already has a more common prepayment plan.
Congress passed legislation authorizing the states to set up such plans in 1996. It also gave them a key piece of Federal tax relief: the investment earnings of money in these plans are not taxed until the money is withdrawn, and then it is taxed not at the rate of the giver, but at the presumably lower rate of the student.
State legislatures, including New York's, began passing bills to create the plans in 1997, but many are just now getting under way, in part because the Internal Revenue Service put out the regulations governing these plans only over the summer.
States justify these programs by saying that it is in their economic interest to have a well-educated work force. But elected officials acknowledge that there are political benefits, too.
"It's what people want, as the soccer moms of America have been telling anyone who will listen," said Marshall G. Bennett, Treasurer of Mississippi. "I've gotten more public reaction to this than anything else that I do."
The investment programs are open to people with very limited means -- New York's, for example, accepts annual contributions as low as $250, which can be paid in $25 installments. But because these programs rely on tax breaks, they appeal most to those who pay taxes but find them burdensome: middle-class voters.
And that troubles some critics, who complain that these programs do nothing for young people whose parents are too poor or too troubled to save for their educations.
"It gives a good deal of help to people who really don't need it," said Edward C. Sullivan, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Higher Education, and who voted against New York's program. "How many single mothers working as waitresses can put aside a significant amount? Those are the people we should be helping."
Mr. McCall dismisses this criticism of the program's appeal to middle-class voters. "People can always find some reason to be critical," he said, "but this is being marketed to everyone."
And many backers of such plans say they help the people who need it most. "If you've got a lot of money, you can afford to go to college, and if you're lower-income, you can get grants and fellowships," said Georgie A. Thomas, Treasurer of New Hampshire. "It's the middle class that gets taken to the cleaners."
The $5,000-a-person tax deduction in New York's plan appears to be the most generous in the country, although at least one other state, Missouri, has announced plans to allow an $8,000 deduction. Some states, like Connecticut, do not give tax deductions for contributions.
Nevertheless, the cost to the state is low -- it will forgo between $20 million and $30 million of the $15 billion it collects in personal income taxes. The administrative costs are covered by an annual charge to the accounts of less than 1 percent, about half that of a similar mutual fund.
Legislators decided to use the tax deduction because they thought it would entice people to start saving, said Paul D. Tonko, a Democratic Assemblyman who represents Amsterdam, near Schenectady, and who is the original sponsor of the plan. "That way, it is not only a savings vehicle, but also a springboard to encourage savings," he said.
It is the immediate tax deduction, rather than the long-term savings for college, that is drawing people into the plan, said Ed Slott, an accountant in Rockville Centre who specializes in taxes and estates. "The things people do to save a buck on taxes," he said. "If the state gave us a tax deduction for building a new Yankee Stadium, it would be up already."
But in this case, Mr. Slott said, the tax incentive is pushing people to participate in a good program that has other benefits. One of them is that the money in these accounts must be used for education -- tuition, room, board, books, supplies -- and cannot be spent on, say, a car.
This has a big appeal for grandparents, Mr. Slott said, because "they like to give money to kids that the kids can't spend" on other things.
Some private firms that sell investment products and services complain that they will not be able to compete against the state's program because they cannot offer a tax deduction. "The tax benefit is so compelling, it will crowd out competition in the New York market," said Peter A. Roberts, who runs the College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J.
But some accountants say the wealthy and the financially sophisticated may not find the state program very appealing. The tax deduction, though a great benefit to the average consumer, is not big enough to be significant to millionaires, said Michael A. Kilgallen, a senior supervisory tax specialist at KPMG Peat Marwick, the big accounting firm.
And the program does not allow the donors to control how their money is invested, Mr. Kilgallen noted. To comply with Federal rules, TIAA-CREF handles all the investing, and has set up a system under which about half the money in an account is invested mainly in stocks when the beneficiary is young; the investments become less risky as the child gets closer to age 18.
The program's managers say it is still too early to tell exactly who is going to participate in the plan. But they do know that the biggest group of accounts -- a fifth of the total so far -- are being opened for people who are 16 or older, said Timothy Lane, vice president of TIAA-CREF. Although the exact breakdown is not yet clear, some of these are adults opening accounts for themselves, he said, while others are parents with teen-age children, for whom "college is more than a theoretical reality."
Or the same account may serve both purposes. Mr. Maurer, of the Higher Education Services Corporation, said he had opened an account for his son, who just graduated from college and may want to go to graduate school. But if his son decides against it, Mr. Maurer said, he hopes to use the money himself, to take courses at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park.
 
How the Accounts Work
Here is how New York's College Savings Program works:
The donor opens an account by filling out a form and sending in a check for at least $250, or by agreeing to have $25 a month deducted from his checking account. The donor names a beneficiary, who can receive up to $100,000 in contributions.
The money goes into three funds managed by TIAA-CREF, private pension managers, who divide the account based on the beneficiary's age. As of January, accounts opened for newborns will have 45 percent invested in bonds and 55 percent in stocks, and those for anyone over 16 will have 40 percent in bonds, 10 percent in stocks and 50 percent in money market funds. TIAA-CREF takes 0.65 percent of the assets each year to cover its costs.
The donor can deduct up to $5,000 of his contribution from the income on which the state levies taxes. Married couples must open accounts separately, but can deduct up to $10,000 from their joint tax return.
The money must remain in the program for three years. During that time, there are no state or Federal taxes on the investment gains.
When the beneficiary is ready to use the money, it can be withdrawn and sent to any accredited school in the nation; in many cases, it can also be used for room and board, as well as books and equipment. The beneficiary must pay Federal taxes on the money used, but there is no state tax.
If the money is withdrawn early, or not used for education, the donor must pay state and Federal taxes, as well as a program penalty of 1 percent of all investment gains. But there is no limit on how long money can remain in the program, and the beneficiary can be changed to another member of the same family.

HEADLINE: Queens Sculpture Garden Is Made a Permanent Park

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
New York City has sided with artists and their allies over developers and will make Socrates Sculpture Park in Astoria, Queens, a permanent park.
The park's future was unclear until last week. Developers had long been eager to build on the four-and-a-half-acre site, a former marine terminal with stunning views of Manhattan, Oz-like across the East River. Though the site has been a park for 14 years, since artists first teamed up with neighborhood residents to remove trash and began erecting massive sculptures of stone, wood, steel and plastic, its status was only temporary. 
 Last week, after the park's five-year lease ran out, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took the final step and declared the site, on a knoll where Broadway and Vernon Avenue meet, a permanent city park.
"This is a major acquisition, a major new parkland commitment," Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said. "It is a spectacular setting for major works of sculpture."
The city's decision to preserve the park came in the face of a private proposal by a physician, Angelo Joseph Acquista, to spend $100 million to build luxury apartments and a marina. Many in the community had supported the plan as a way to bring life to a pretty dreary area. "They don't even have a delicatessen in that neighborhood," said George Delis, the district manager of Community Board 1 who pushed strongly for Dr. Acquista's idea.
But officials decided a stunning cultural attraction was the better bet. "I have a lot of other land on the East River to develop," said Claire Shulman, Queens Borough President. "The truth of the matter is that they cleaned that whole area up and made it beautiful. It's like an oasis on the New York City waterfront."
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said that making Socrates a park was part of the Giuliani administration's drive to promote cultural tourism as an economic development tool, but that the basic reason was simpler: "This was the right thing to do."
It is particularly a victory for Mark di Suvero, whose enormous steel sculptures are in the collections of museums worldwide. He and the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, both of whom had studios nearby, had looked at the scruffy waterfront lot and envisioned what they called "an ongoing experimental narrative in the medium of sculpture."
Socrates has come far from its improbable start as a modest sculpture garden whose artworks were painted with help from neighborhood children. Twice a year it stages an international show of 15 or more pieces of immense sculpture, startling contortions blossoming on a modest knoll directly facing the Manhattan skyline.
It is an incongruous spot -- unique in this region because it is the only place where artworks so monumental are both built and shown. On the river, just south of Hell Gate, where the East and Harlem Rivers converge with swirling force, barges glide past laden with fuel oil and other cargo. Down the street is the elegant Noguchi Museum, which draws busloads from Manhattan.
For Socrates, there were steps forward and steps back: foundations and arts groups were captivated by the odd enterprise and sent checks, even as developers kept proposing riverside housing and commercial developments on the site.
Formalizing the park's status begins with transferring its municipal ownership from one city agency, the Department of Business Services, to another, the Parks Department. The Parks Department will then shepherd the process of legally mapping the park as parkland, which requires approval by the state Legislature. Mr. di Suvero's nonprofit organization will then lease the park at no cost, probably for five years at a time, from the parks agency.
Mr. Stern said a number of improvements are planned, including the building of a new pathway, the installation of a sprinkler system and lighting enhancements. He also said he would plant some hemlock trees to commemorate Socrates' death by poisoning from the herb also called hemlock. "They will testify to the fact that some of history's greatest figures might be unappreciated by their own people," he said.
Late Friday afternoon, the scene at Socrates was appropriately surreal in the pale orange light. Two salesmen from a used car lot across the street were strolling about. One of them, Bill Huppert, said he felt himself "being relaxed." The other, John Sylvester, said he felt transported. "This takes me way back," he said. "It makes me think of my youth."
Some of the sculpture grabs and almost overpowers the viewer. Some is delicate, whimsical, witty. Some, like the wind chimes, make noise. Others, like the figures of youths dressed in hip-hop clothing, one with a boombox and the other with a pit bull, portray the city's street life.
In the current show, "All That Is Solid," you can look through a giant kaleidoscope at the Manhattan skyline. There is a big steel skeleton of an upended steed, "Fallen Horse" by Wendy Klemperer: it looms vertically, but the head seems to be smashing violently into the ground. A monumental work by Mr. di Suvero, last shown along the River Seine in Paris, towers over everything.
Near the water's edge, Robert Hickman's "Roosevelt Island Shuttle" is a frisky parody of the tramway. A battered wooden chair is mounted on an inclined rail supported by a wooden trestle. It is equipped with a dummy propulsion lever that seemingly could zoom its rider clear across the river. It is aimed directly at Gracie Mansion.
There is a carousel of found objects that local children christened "Clown House." Here are some pieces of frayed wood nailed together with gargantuan nails, meant to evoke a South American shantytown. On the waterfront boulders are the ruins of an imaginary cityscape. Quixotic clay figures line the garden bed.
Altogether, it can be a bit boggling, but, for many, it is clearly captivating. "I don't think I'm in touch with art or anything," said Don Alexander, a musician who lives in Brooklyn's Greenpoint section and was visiting the park for the second time with his wife, Rachel Ford. "I just like the spectacle of it."

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Landfills Want the Right Stuff

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Like New York City, New Jersey has a trash problem these days.
But there's a big difference. In some parts of the state there isn't enough of it. 
 Almost half of New Jersey's 21 counties now have landfills or incinerators that are operating far below capacity. And, as a result, many counties are having trouble paying off the $1.6 billion that was borrowed over the last two decades to pay for them.
On its face, then, the needs of New Jersey's counties would seem to be a perfect match for the needs of New York City, which must begin exporting all its trash by the end of 2001, when it plans to close the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
But the plan that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani unveiled this week to move most of New York City's residential garbage through transfer stations in Newark and Carteret will apparently do little to address New Jersey's fundamental trash woes.
In the highly competitive world of garbage, New York City officials say it is still cheaper for the state to ship its trash to Virginia than to bury it or burn it in New Jersey.
"It is ironic, because one problem could solve the other," said Mark R. Rosen, a lawyer from Cherry Hill who has battled New Jersey in court over its solid-waste disposal laws in recent years.
"By using New Jersey's land to build transfer stations," Mr. Rosen added, "Mayor Giuliani is simply saying, we want to change lap lanes in New Jersey; we want to transfer our garbage from small trucks to big trucks in your state but we do not want to do business there."
The local landfills and incinerators were built after the state began requiring municipalities to dispose of their waste within their own borders. But that arrangement fell apart last year after the courts overturned New Jersey's trash collection and disposal laws, clearing the way for haulers to shop around for lower-cost alternatives. Some New Jersey towns opted to send their trash out of state.
Stranded with under-used trash centers and hundreds of millions of dollars of debt, local officials are demanding that the Whitman administration and state lawmakers come up with a $1.6 billion bailout or take the blame for large property-tax increases.
Last month, voters approved a statewide ballot question to forgive $175 million in state loans to county governments to help them recover some of the cost of building the incinerators and landfills. And legislators and Whitman administration officials are still trying to come up with a plan -- without breaking the state's budget -- that appeases local officials and environmentalists, who want the state's five incinerators shut down.
New York City now sends a small part of its 5,900 tons of trash a day to incinerators in Camden and Newark. The Essex County incinerator in Newark, which is the only one operating at capacity, burns about 985,000 tons of trash a year. About half of that is from towns in Essex County, and half is from New York City.
Under Mr. Giuliani's plan, an unspecified amount of garbage would go to the incinerator in Newark from the proposed transfer stations. The rest would be shipped by barges and larger trucks out of state, south and west.
John Carlton, the executive director of the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Warren County, said he was amazed that Mr. Giuliani's plan did not take advantage of the large amount of disposal capacity within the region.
While Giuliani administration officials said there was nothing in their plan that would prevent the city from disposing of trash in New Jersey, the private companies that won the city's competitive bid did not propose that.
New Jersey has among the highest disposal fees in the nation. Before the court ruling, the average disposal fee in the state was $87.97 a ton, according to Solid Waste Digest, a trade publication. The national average is $37.76 a ton. New York's average cost is $76.58 a ton, while Connecticut's is $65.36.
"These facilities need more trash," said Pete McDonough, chief spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. "But New Jersey does not necessarily need more trash. What the county facilities need is to be more competitive and to attract trash that does not require open barging to get there."
Since the courts overturned New Jersey's solid-waste system, incinerator and landfill fees have fallen, and Mr. Carlton argued that, in the long run, New York could save money disposing of garbage in New Jersey."It would make sense to put it on the open market and see where it goes," he said.
Even so, New Jersey's public officials are likely to face opposition from their constituents about that prospect. Cliff Zukin, a pollster and professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said that garbage from New York presents politicians with a tempting political opportunity.
"It's a classic Us versus Them issue," Mr. Zukin said. "Most policy choices you have to make as a governor divide people in your state. This is a fat pitch down the middle, a chance to represent the whole state together against the evil that is New York."
That it why the Whitman administration reacted so negatively to Mr. Giuliani's plan. The image of gigantic barges cruising along the New Jersey coastline, leaving a trail of debris in their wake, is enough to make any New Jersey elected official balk at Mr. Giuliani's plan. It was only a decade ago that state officials were blaming the city for the trash that was washing up onto beaches, threatening to destroy the tourism industry.
"It is not going to happen," said United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey. "Garbage can not be transported on barges off of beaches without impacting the quality of life in New Jersey and severe economic loss."
But New York trash might be welcomed by some counties and by anti-tax groups concerned that a state bailout or higher debt might drive up state taxes or lead to higher property taxes.
Sam Perilli, the founder of United Taxpayers of New Jersey, said that he would be in favor of burning or burying the city's trash for a fee: "We would save millions of taxpayer dollars. If New York sends over garbage and pays for these plants to handle it, the people who own the burners will be able to pay off their own debts instead of asking taxpayers to bail them out."
But Middlesex County officials have already pledged to fight Mr. Giuliani's plan to construct a transfer station in Carteret, where barges would unload 4,000 tons a day from Queens and Manhattan onto larger barges and big trucks to be shipped out of state. They also said that they do not want any of New York City's garbage, even if it could mean lowering landfill operating costs.
"We don't need their garbage or their money," said David B. Crabiel, the director of the Board of Freeholders. "All because they have a landfill closing in Staten Island and he didn't plan on what was gong to happen when it closed? We are a county of 700,000. We take care of our own. Our landfill will will go 25 years. Let him take it to Albany."

The Losses Pile Up For Season Yet to Start

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
They say they are not bluffing, that the season could be terminated in the next few weeks. But as players and owners stare down each other at the bargaining table, how likely is it that the National Basketball Association's 82-game schedule will be permanently wiped away?
"The first time the players hear someone say the season is gone will be the day we decide to do it," said David Stern, the league commissioner. "I will not prematurely cancel the season. That's not fair to anyone." 
 The league's hesitancy to issue a deadline for an agreement to be reached in the five-month-old lockout suggests there is room and time for compromise. The union's executive director, Billy Hunter, struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying he was confident a settlement could be reached.
But with not one key economic issue resolved and no further bargaining sessions planned after a session that lasted more than 10 hours on Thursday, the prospects are looking grimmer by the day.
Few believed that the stalemate would go this long. Yet instead of the Knicks making their first trip to the Meadowlands last Thursday or Stephon Marbury, Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves making their annual visit to Madison Square Garden yesterday, the most calamitous labor dispute in league history continues.
By yesterday, teams had lost only 18 to 20 dates from their 82-game schedules. But because nearly a month is needed after an agreement is reached to resume the season, the two sides are toying with playing fewer than 50 games.
Observers of the National Hockey League lockout view Stern's tactics along the same lines as those used by N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman during the 1994-95 lockout. A settlement was not reached until Jan. 13 after more than a month of no bargaining. The shortened season resumed two weeks later.
But unlike the N.B.A., the N.H.L. did not have more than 200 free agents waiting to be signed by teams. That dilemma and the need for at least a three-week training camp dims the possibility of a rushed settlement in mid-January.
On Friday, Hunter deemed Jan. 1 as the cutoff date for reaching an agreement, a date that would put the start of the season on or about Super Bowl Sunday. Though NBC lost its Christmas Day doubleheader, the network does not begin regional weekly coverage until Jan. 16.
If a deal was signed near the first of the year, NBC would lose three weekends of telecasts.
Meanwhile, the players are beginning to talk candidly about losing an entire season.
"I'm hoping for something to happen," said Minnesota forward Tom Gugliotta. "But I also know that in the back of my mind losing the season is a distinct possibility. We hope it won't happen, but we know the reality is at this point, and we can't rule it out. It's something that could happen. If it does, it would be difficult for everyone. But we know we tried."
Added Michael Curry, a member of the union's negotiating committee and Milwaukee Bucks guard: "I've thought of the worst-case scenario. So the worst-case scenario would be to cancel the season. All you can do is to give 110 percent to make sure that doesn't happen. Mentally, you have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario."
For Patrick Ewing, the union president and the Knicks center, that means forfeiting $18.5 million, the highest salary in the N.B.A. this season. Ewing loses $243,924 per game, a figure that already brings his estimated loss to more than $4 million. Karl Malone, the All-Star forward of the Utah Jazz, will lose his biggest payday, $6 million.
"I think other players should prepare themselves to say the season is over," Malone said. "I think we should get with our people and go out and start playing games on our own. We should be playing and putting money away for those less fortunate. I'll lend my name to games, whatever it takes."
The agents Arn Tellem and David Falk have finally put the finishing touches on their All-Star exhibition game, to be played Dec. 19 in Atlantic City. They scheduled a news conference for tomorrow about the game, which features members of all four Dream Teams -- the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World Championship teams.
It was unclear whether Michael Jordan would play or coach, but he is expected to be in attendance. The proceeds will go to players on the low end of the league's salary scale.

After Deals and Signings, What's Left for Winter Meeting?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In the span of three days, 35 free agents signed contracts worth $225 million, and there went the winter meetings. This was in December 1992, in Louisville, Ky., and the free-agent frenzy sent officials home reeling. Never again, they said, vowing not to provide agents with that kind of opportunity in subsequent Decembers. It was like shooting fish in a barrel, the officials decided, the general managers being the overmatched swimmers.
The agents, however, have not suffered in the absence of the winter meat market. In just one recent week this off season, five free agents signed contracts worth $330 million. Inflation and escalation contributed to the cascade of dollars, but clubs proved they did not have to be a captive audience to spend lavishly. 
 Perhaps most interesting about the signings of Mo Vaughn, Bernie Williams, Randy Johnson, Albert Belle and Rafael Palmeiro was that the agents did not wait for this week's return of the winter meetings to stir up another feeding frenzy.
Yes, the meetings are back, six years later, officials having decided that enough time has passed to make it safe to go into the water again.
The one thing the sport could always count on was that the meetings would generate a week's worth of talk about baseball. Teams would make trades that would command huge amounts of newspaper space and television time, and even if they did not complete player swaps, speculation about possible trades would serve the same purpose.
Without the meetings, general managers became accustomed to making deals before December, and this year, players like Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson, Todd Hundley, Ron Gant, Bret Boone and Denny Neagle have already been traded. Roger Clemens will join that group if the Toronto Blue Jays meet their own timetable.
That is not to say that general managers will not find trades to make at these meetings, which will begin Friday in Nashville and run through the following Tuesday. When they gather in one place, general managers spend most of their time talking with each other -- in pairs, of course, as they feel each other out to determine whether they have a match for a trade. But there is always far more talk and speculation than business conducted.
Some clubs may not have any business to conduct at the revival meetings. Assuming Clemens is traded before Nashville, the Yankees figure to be observers. They have already had a solid off season because they have kept their World Series championship team together while their chief competitors have stumbled and bumbled their way out of contention.
If the Mets sign Rickey Henderson in the next few days to be their leadoff hitter and left fielder, they will join the Yankees on the sideline except for perhaps some money-saving moves, like the Willie Blair trade Friday.
The Mets have had a good off season because they retained the players they wanted to keep (Mike Piazza, Al Leiter, Dennis Cook) and they have added two run producers (they hope) in Robin Ventura and Bobby Bonilla, and a hard-throwing relief pitcher, Armando Benitez, who someday could grow into John Franco's closing role.
The Arizona Diamondbacks have had a good and expensive off season, adding six free agents, including Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Steve Finley (to be announced), but committing about $119 million in doing it. If the dollars don't translate to vast improvement, the expansion team will be viewed as the epitome of excess.
Some teams have had a dreadful six weeks since the World Series. The San Diego Padres, who played in the World Series, have lost third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Finley and are on their way to losing Kevin Brown, their No. 1 pitcher. The Chicago White Sox have lost Belle and Ventura, who drove in 28 percent of their runs last season.
For awful off seasons, though, who can top the Yankees' rivals? The Baltimore Orioles have signed Belle, B. J. Surhoff, Delino DeShields and Will Clark, but the last three after they failed to sign three free agents they preferred, Ventura, Brian Jordan and their own Palmeiro. Roberto Alomar and Eric Davis also departed as free agents.
The Orioles, though, at least had various plans. The Boston Red Sox incredibly let Vaughn walk away without having a reasonable alternative plan in mind. They tried to sign Williams as Vaughn's replacement in their lineup, but they had to know he would be a long shot at best, and they had no clue where to go once Williams took the Yankees' $87.5 million instead of theirs.
With the Orioles beating Boston to Clark, the Red Sox continue to look aimlessly for someone to play first base and someone to replace Vaughn's 40 home runs and 115 runs batted in.
Although anything is possible, it is highly unlikely that the Red Sox can trade themselves out of their plight at the meetings, but they will try because they don't want to concede the division to the Yankees this early.
The Orioles, for their part, may even be tempted to overpay for Kevin Brown, the best free agent still on the market. For six years and more than $80 million, the dominant pitcher could be theirs.
 
Should the Mets Have Waited?
The Mets traded Todd Hundley to Los Angeles last week, liberating their loyal catcher and themselves from a sticky situation. Should they have waited until spring training so that Hundley could have demonstrated that his elbow was sound and perhaps have brought a better price? No.
The Mets in no way could have gone to camp with Hundley still on the team. First, he could not have demonstrated anything by playing an occasional exhibition game. Mike Piazza, after all, will have to prepare for the season because he is the team's catcher. The Mets could have scheduled 'B' games for Hundley to play, but for teams to see what they would have wanted to see, it would have required a steady diet of 'B' games, and teams just don't play that many.
Second, Hundley's presence at Port St. Lucie, Fla., would have created a major distraction that could have undermined the Mets' chances for starting the season smoothly and successfully. Piazza and Hundley in camp together? It might have been reminiscent of the Yankees' good old days. The same people who have criticized the Mets for trading Hundley now would have criticized them then for creating the distraction.
Third, the idea that the Mets could have secured a better package for Hundley had they waited until next spring sounds good, but it is flawed. Teams seeking a catcher might have made other moves in the meantime, and they might also have spent their money and had nothing left to pay Hundley's $5.2 million salary.
Finally, the Mets owed Hundley, and by trading him now instead of making him wait until a few days or weeks before next season started, they did the right thing.
 
Clemens Has Strings Attached
Finding the right trade for Roger Clemens will not be as easy as it might seem. Because he would be traded in the middle of a multiyear contract -- he has two years left on his Toronto contract -- Clemens would have the right to demand a trade after next season, unless his new team signed him to a new contract or a contract extension.
"I have assumed all along if this scenario played out, part of it would be a contract discussion," said Gord Ash, the Blue Jays' general manager. Some general managers suspect that by asking to be traded, Clemens wants to boost himself onto the $12.5 million-plus salary level populated by Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson and, soon, by Kevin Brown.
Compounding Ash's task, Clemens also has the right to veto a trade. He has already said he does not want to play for a West Coast team. "Gord is supposed to do the best deal he can," another general manager said. "Then when it's done, he calls the Hendricks brothers" -- the pitcher's agents -- "and says, 'I have a deal to go to this city; are you O.K. with it?' They say yes or no."
 
Avoiding Collusion II
 In trying to solve the growing problem of payroll disparity, Commissioner Bud Selig has to avoid leading the owners into Collusion II. Ten years ago Collusion I cost the owners $280 million (which still has not all been paid out to affected players), and any future collusion would result in treble damages.
But Selig did tell owners in Chicago last Thursday that all clubs had to begin complying again with the 60-40 rule. That rule requires clubs to have a ratio of no less than 60 percent assets to 40 percent liabilities, or debt.
Selig, who proposed the 60-40 ratio about 15 years ago, has not enforced it in recent years. He did not portray it to the owners as a panacea, but that is where he is going to start.
The players association filed a grievance against the rule in 1983, feeling it could inhibit salaries, but an arbitrator allowed it.
Another instrument that was aimed at discouraging lavish spending was the luxury tax that emerged from the 1994-95 labor dispute. High-spending teams, however, remain high-spending teams.
The final assessments for last season have not been sent to the clubs, but preliminary figures show Baltimore owing $2.9 million, Boston $2.2 million, Atlanta $696,000, the Yankees $651,000 and Cleveland $39,000.

HEADLINE: Libya Rebuffs U.N. Chief on Bomb Trial

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, gambled on an unusual trip to Libya yesterday but apparently failed to persuade Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to turn over two suspects wanted in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
After keeping Mr. Annan waiting nearly all day at the Libyan coastal town of Sirte, Colonel Qaddafi met for an hour and a half at an undisclosed location with the Secretary General, who said afterward that the talks were "fruitful and positive." Mr. Annan's aides said he left Libya in good spirits but indicated that obstacles remained in the path to a trial in the Netherlands. 
 "Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem," Mr. Annan said at a news conference in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. "Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues related to this matter."
But a trial in a third country, specifically the Netherlands, was not the main issue Mr. Annan went to Libya to discuss. That compromise was agreed to with the United States and Britain in August after the Libyans balked at a trial in either country.
The problems that have arisen since come from Libyan demands that the two suspects, if convicted, not be imprisoned in Scotland. Libya also wants more assurances that United Nations sanctions, imposed for its failure to hand over the two suspects, will indeed be lifted when it turns the men over.
Mr. Annan, whom aides describe as a born conciliator, flew to Sirte at some political risk, saying he wanted to try to break the decade-long deadlock in the case by getting Colonel Qaddafi's agreement to stop delaying the transfer of the two suspects to the Netherlands for a trial by Scottish judges.
When Mr. Annan arrived at Sirte, he was left talking with Libya's Foreign Minister, Omar al-Montasser, and Libya's representative to the United Nations, Abu Zeid Omar Dorda, as well as the visiting President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore.
Mr. Annan detoured from a trip between Tunisia and a meeting of Persian Gulf leaders in Abu Dhabi to go to Libya, despite the skepticism of diplomats and United Nations officials, and he could have met either lower-level Libyan official at his office in New York. His trip to Libya was premised on talks with Colonel Qaddafi, although there was no assurance in advance that the Libyan leader would show up.
This is the third time in his first two years as Secretary General that Mr. Annan has taken political risks to try to reach a compromise with a dictatorial leader.
He agreed two years ago to reconstitute an investigation team looking into allegations of massacres in Congo when the new President, Laurent Kabila, whose troops were accused of the killings, refused to work with the group set up by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
In February of this year, he went to Baghdad to persuade President Saddam Hussein to resume cooperation with arms inspectors.
In both cases his agreements were not honored.
There were no details immediately available on his talks with Colonel Qaddafi, whom he met in a lavish desert tent, which a television crew was permitted to film. Expectations for the meeting were never very high, but the United Nations had a plane on standby in Italy in case the two suspects were released.
It is still possible that this could happen, since Libya's Parliament has been summoned into a rare session on Tuesday.
Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people, including 11 on the ground. An investigation by British and American law enforcement and intelligence agencies concluded that two Libyan agents had planted an explosive disguised as a radio-cassette player planted on the plane.
The Libyans are also accused of plotting the explosion that destroyed a French jetliner over Niger in 1989, killing 171 people. That case is also unresolved.
Colonel Qaddafi is eager to see the end of sanctions, imposed on Libya in 1992 and toughened in 1993. These sanctions have barred international air travel to and from Libya as well as the sale of arms and spare parts for aviation and for the oil industry on which the Libyan economy depends. Libyan assets have been frozen abroad and diplomatic representation has been limited.
Mr. Annan had to apply to the Security Council's Libyan sanctions committee on Thursday for permission to fly to Libya from the Tunisian resort island of Djerba.
In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy, said last night: "We are disappointed that Libya is still not in compliance. . . . this has been going on for far too long."
An American diplomat who has been working on the Libya issue in the Security Council said on Thursday that the Clinton Administration had viewed Mr. Annan's trip as a way to "advance the handover of the suspects," and nothing more.
"We would expect his travel to Libya to achieve that end," said Nancy Soderberg, the acting deputy representative at the United Nations. Several diplomats said that Mr. Annan had gone to Libya with no room for negotiation.
"The United States and Britain have gone the extra mile," Ms. Soderberg said.
Before Mr. Annan's trip, which he planned in close consultation with British and American officials, Libya had been sending mixed signals about its intentions, as Colonel Qaddafi tried to set conditions on the release of suspects to protect his intelligence network and his political position, Arab diplomats said. One of the suspects belongs to a clan in Libya that is, at best, lukewarm in its support of the Government.
According to Jana, the Libyan news agency, Colonel Qaddafi, who has ruled Libya since a 1969 coup, did not have the power to turn over the two men, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. The agency said the Libyan people, through 500 "popular committees," would have to decide the fate of the two, who were indicted by Britain and the United States in 1991. The move seemed to imply that Colonel Qaddafi wanted political cover.
Calling a Tuesday meeting of the General People's Congress, Libya's top legislative and executive body, could provide that. The body usually endorses major policy decisions.
Publicly, the Libyan Government had been saying for some time that it objected to the prospect that the suspects, if convicted, would have to serve jail sentences in Scotland. British officials said this week that they had assured the Libyans that they could send diplomats to Scotland to monitor the prison conditions and that all Islamic strictures would be followed.
The two suspects are now under loose Government supervision in Libya, still being paid by the national airline, Libyan Arab Airways, but unable to travel abroad since their passports were confiscated.
Western diplomats said here this week that Libya was also concerned that the United States will not agree to a lifting of sanctions if the two men are sent to the Netherlands for trial, but will instead move the finish line to other issues.
These diplomats seemed to confirm Libyan suspicions by saying that the sanctions would be suspended when the suspects were in custody, but that a final lifting of the embargo would not take place until Libya had met other goals, like ending support for terrorism. American allegations that Libya has been behind attacks on Americans led to bombing raids on Libya in 1986. Some Arab diplomats say the attack on Pan Am 103, if Libyans were responsible, was probably retaliation for the American bombing.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Capital's Elite Mostly Shrug At Mention of Impeachment

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Things were odd enough here when the roses started blooming in December. But then the White House started complaining that people were not paying enough attention to the possible impeachment of President Clinton.
"People aren't taking it seriously," fumed Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. 
 They are not. The House of Representatives may be gearing up to vote as early as midmonth on the impeachment of a President -- for only the second time in history -- but history does not exactly hang heavy on the air.
"What are you talking about?" asked Patrick Sabatier, the United States bureau chief for the French newspaper Liberation, when asked whether he thought Americans were paying sufficient attention to the weighty doings. "The N.B.A. lockout?"
After 10 months of hype, the impeachment hearings are drawing mostly shrugs and yawns from Washington's mandarins: political operatives, journalists, lawyers, lobbyists and even Clinton Administration officials. Chastened by the Democrats' strong showing in the midterm elections, elite Washington appears to have caught up with the views held by most Americans for months.
Not everyone is indifferent. Many conservatives in Congress are bent on impeachment, trumpeting their outrage over what they consider to be President Clinton's lies under oath and abuse of power. And as a result, the strategists who are paid to be terrified for the President worry that while Washington rolls its eyes, the House may actually vote against him. The Senate would then try him, a potentially lengthy process that would require a two-thirds vote to remove him from office.
But there are few outward signs of this inward turmoil. No candlelight vigils flicker outside the White House, no horns honk in demand of the President's resignation -- the hallmarks of an uprising that Leonard Garment remembers from his days as counsel to President hallmarks of an uprising that Leonard Garment remembers from his days as counsel to President Nixon.
"So what else? Who cares?" said Mr. Garment, a lawyer here, as he described the attitude today. "That's the general sentiment."
A lone sign-toting protester who appeared outside the White House this week was gone by Friday, when Cassie Waite, 15, jostled with her ninth-grade government class for a photograph against the tall iron fence. Visiting from McKeesport, Pa., she had expected to see demonstrators handing out leaflets, but instead saw only badged Government workers and tourists strolling.
"It's on the news constantly, and it makes it seem like everything's going on here," Cassie said. "And we get here -- and there's nothing. People are going on about their lives."
She paused and, although moments before she had been criticizing Mr. Clinton as a lawbreaker, added, "And I think that's the way it should be." She was, she said, "sick of hearing about it."
Before a reporter raised it, the subject of impeachment hearings had not come up during the government class's visit to Washington, said Cassie's teacher, Ray Beard.
On the other side of the fence, one official said he and his colleagues were not following the hearings. It was as though, he said, "there's something you don't want to watch on your favorite channel but you know it'll be over. Every now and then you flip over to see, 'Hey, is that thing off yet? C'mon already.' "
Among some officials, the mood is light enough that they are dancing in the halls. At the senior staff meeting at the White House on Friday, Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, and Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, used a novel approach to announce that unemployment had dropped to 4.4 percent in November: They stood up, put their hands over their heads and spun around in a synchronized shimmy that one White House official called "The Nerd."
But for the strategists who are trying to devise Mr. Clinton's legal and political defense, impeachment is a darkening cloud.
"It's eerie," a White House official said of the environment in Washington. Few take the hearings seriously, he said, but "next week we're going to have these final days, and it's going to be very reality-based in this country that this is happening."
Mr. Lockhart, the press secretary, described the attitude in Washington as "kind of suspended disbelief."
"They'll wake up and they'll find out that their elected representatives have for reasons well short of legitimate moved to take a step to remove the President," he said.
Tom Korologos, a Republican operative who was Mr. Nixon's Senate liaison, said that as the House impeachment vote drew close in 1974 the Senate had already devised plans for its subsequent duties. Mr. Nixon resigned before the House vote, after becoming convinced that the Senate would convict him.
"I don't have the sense that anybody is taking it that seriously at the moment," Mr. Korologos said.
Several causes lie behind the new indifference: fatigue from multiple, mutating investigations; resignation in the face of the public's defiant liking for Mr. Clinton; a belief that no stirring revelations are in the offing, and impatience with the bewildering swerves by the hearings and the President's defenders.
So when the unpleasant subject of the hearings comes up -- and this is not often -- Washington's wealthy and powerful cluck and invoke Marx, saying history is repeating itself as farce. Those who are more knowing wonder how many more times it might repeat itself this way, with these hearings as the new precedent.
The issues that provoked this clash between the executive and legislative branches are less threatening to the Constitution than those in Watergate, say some who lived through both. "There was a sense of awe and of great drama," recalled Elizabeth Drew, a journalist who covered Watergate for The New Yorker. Now, she said, "the issues involved are nowhere near the scale."
Mr. Garment, the lawyer, saw something deeper, an anesthesia and amnesia producing a "dazed Disneyland" in modern politics.
"The end of the cold war ended a sense of apprehension that major political events can affect our lives in a very serious way," he said. "There's a collapse of a sort of emotional memory about vital, energetic, pointed, pungent politics. It's just all games, dirty jokes."

HEADLINE: HOFFA WILL LEAD TEAMSTERS AFTER CHIEF RIVAL CONCEDES

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., Dec. 5

 BODY:
James P. Hoffa won election today to the presidency of the teamsters' union, the job that his powerful father held for more than a decade, after the younger Hoffa's main opponent conceded defeat.
With the concession from Tom Leedham, Mr. Hoffa, a labor lawyer from Detroit, will take the helm of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the nation's largest unions. 
 The victory returns the Hoffa name to the head of a union that Federal officials had long called the nation's most corrupt, particularly when Mr. Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, led it from 1957 to 1971.
Michael Cherkasky, the Federal election monitor, said that with slightly more than half of the ballots counted here in Alexandria this evening, Mr. Hoffa had 125,008 votes, or 55 percent, while Mr. Leedham, head of the union's warehouse division, had 89,950 or 39 percent. A third candidate, John Metz, a St. Louis teamsters' leader, had 14,021 votes, or 6 percent.
In conceding defeat, Mr. Leedham said: "The returns have made it clear that our campaign for rank-and-file power ran out of time. Hoffa Jr. campaigned for four years, spent $6 million and had a famous name, but in six short months we came from nowhere to build a grass-roots campaign for rank-and-file power."
Mr. Hoffa's lead was expected to expand on Sunday as votes are counted from the Midwest, which is Mr. Hoffa's home turf and was his father's stronghold. About 420,000 votes were cast, with counting expected to be finished on Sunday or Monday.
Mr. Hoffa won the race in his second attempt, having lost narrowly in 1996 to Ron Carey, the incumbent. That election was overturned and a new one ordered when a Federal monitor found that three Carey aides had misappropriated more than $700,000 from the teamsters' treasury to help the Carey campaign. Mr. Carey was later expelled from the union and Mr. Leedham replaced him as a candidate. Mr. Hoffa will serve the remaining three years of Mr. Carey's five-year term.
This year, Mr. Hoffa received 65,196 votes in the East, Mr. Leedham received 43,611 and Mr. Metz, 7,192. Ballots from the West were being counted today and ballots from Canada are to be counted late Sunday or Monday.
Mr. Hoffa, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, ran on a platform promising to reunite the badly splintered union and to give back more power to state and local teamster organizations.
Mr. Leedham styled himself as an anticorruption reformer in the fashion of Mr. Carey when he first won the union's leadership in 1991, and Mr. Leedham promised to involved the rank and file far more in negotiations and other union activities.
Mr. Hoffa flew to Washington from Detroit today, and his campaign aides said he was not planning to speak publicly until Sunday or Monday.
At a news conference today, Tom Pazzi, Mr. Hoffa's campaign manager, said, "I would characterize our attitude as a continuation of what it's been, which is a quiet non-hysterical confidence, We are looking forward to, not merely winning, but to running the union in an effective way and making some progress. That prospect is a sobering one."
Jody Rodriguez, a ballot observer who works at a Yellow Freight trucking terminal in Columbus, Ohio, offered this assessment: "We feel like Jimmy's the messiah of the labor movement. He's for the working-class people, and he's the guy who's going to rebuild this union. There's nothing wrong with having an educated attorney heading the union instead of truck drivers because that will help us even the playing field with companies."
It will not be easy to restore the teamsters to their power of old, largely because the union's membership has slipped to 1.4 million from 2.3 million in the 1970's and the overall power of the labor movement has declined.
But Mr. Hoffa's supporters say they hope that he is the man who will lead the resurgence of labor and attract hundreds of thousands more workers to the teamsters banner.
"I think he'll do the same thing his father did, build up this union," said Danny Moussette, a teamsters' official from Chicago who began driving trucks in 1960.
The Hoffa camp and the Leedham camp demonized each other. The Leedham forces called Mr. Hoffa a corrupt tool of the teamster old guard, which provided him with much of his campaign support. The Hoffa supporters called Mr. Leedham a corrupt Carey lieutenant because he was part of the 1996 Carey slate and Mr. Carey had named him head of the warehouse division.
"I think we've done well enough that we've shown the reform movement will stay alive," said David Eckstein, a Leedham slate member who was director of field services under Mr. Carey.
The estimated number of votes cast this year, 420,000, was down from 480,000 in the 1996 election. Teamster officials attributed the decline to two factors: cynicism arising from the Carey scandal and the fact that the current campaign did not have the same heat and fury as the battle between Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Carey.
The teamsters union has long been considered one of the nation's most powerful labor organizations not just because of its size but also because its members handle goods that affect every nook and cranny of the economy.
Its members include long-haul truck drivers, police officers, warehouse workers, food-processing workers, garbage collectors, flight attendants, even the actors who play Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck at Disney World.
This year, the Hoffa camp spent almost $1 million, while the Leedham campaign spent about one-fourth that amount.
Mr. Hoffa narrowly won the South, with 14,282 votes to 13,197 Mr. Leedham and 1,062 for Mr. Metz. Mr. Hoffa ran more strongly in the East, after having lost it by 21,000 votes to Mr. Carey in 1996.
Federal officials have played a role overseeing the union since 1989 when the teamsters signed a consent decree allowing Government oversight to settle a lawsuit charging that the union had made a "devil's pact" with organized crime.
James R. Hoffa became the nation's most famous union leader not only because he greatly expanded the teamsters size and clout but also because he won the first nationwide master freight contract and helped double the wages of many teamsters.
But Mr. Hoffa was also widely known for his ties to the underworld. He was convicted of mail fraud and jury tampering, and law-enforcement officials say he helped arrange for the teamsters' pension and welfare funds to lend tens of millions of dollars to organized-crime figures.
Mr. Hoffa disappeared in 1975, in what was widely viewed as a mob killing. His son has denied any ties to organized crime and has repeatedly insisted that as far as he knows, his father was framed by the Government and did not have dealings with crime figures.

HEADLINE: BACK FROM THE BRINK;
Lessons of a Long, Hot Summer

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
TODAY, with stock markets stronger and bond markets quietly going about their workaday business, it hardly seems possible that less than three months ago some of Wall Street's smartest and most powerful people thought the problems of one giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management L.P. of Greenwich, Conn., might push the world's markets to the brink of disaster.
In fact, the 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage houses that pumped in $3.6 billion and took 90 percent ownership of the fund when it was only hours away from collapse may now see windfall profits on what seemed like a desperate roll of the dice, a daring bailout encouraged by nervous regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 The fund's recovery does not itself resolve the argument over whether the Fed should have brokered the arrangements that rescued Long-Term Capital from bankruptcy on Sept. 23. Supporters say the Fed saved the day and laid the groundwork for the current rebound, while critics say the rebound proves that markets do just fine without such heavy-handed interference (article, page 13).
But the larger lessons of Long-Term Capital's crisis may not be as fleeting as the recent dip in the Dow. The fund was once so impressive that it garnered billions of dollars from some of the biggest names in finance. When it almost collapsed, it tested some fundamental assumptions of the investment world -- and found them severely flawed:
* Diversification, the elementary precaution of not putting all of one's eggs in a single basket, failed utterly. The fund had spread its bets among many markets in various countries around the world. But the strategy did not protect it from the chain reaction that hit global markets in August. Indeed, the complexity and diversity of its holdings made the last-minute rescue effort complicated and difficult. In the aftermath, hedge fund managers and other professional investors have been left wondering whether a diverse portfolio offers any protection from future financial storms.
* The markets for financial derivatives and many other new kinds of investments, which have been hailed as ways for global investors and multinational corporations to offset many of the risks of doing business, suddenly behaved like gawky adolescents -- big enough to seem mature but clumsy and prone to panic when things go awry. Investors who expected to be able to exit these new markets as easily as they had entered them found that the only way out was through a fire sale that devastated the value of their assets.
* Most worrisome, the use of borrowed money for speculation, a mainstay of many professional investors in today's markets, occurred on a scale so much larger than most anyone thought possible, and involved credit arrangements so Byzantine, that none of the players -- not lenders, not trading partners and not regulators -- could respond to the fund's troubles as they had expected.
"We have had a whole series of structural changes in the financial markets in the past 20 years so that today, when you come to the edge of risk-taking, you find the old formulas no longer work," said Henry Kaufman, the independent market strategist. "That is what this crisis was about."
Despite the return of confidence and liquidity to most markets, both Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William J. McDonough, president of the New York Fed, have suggested in recent speeches that an emergency like the one at Long-Term Capital could occur again.
The return to more normal market conditions in the last month "leaves unanswered the question of why such episodes erupted in the first place" and why they spread so rapidly, Mr. Greenspan recently told a gathering of Wall Street executives.
He offered his own theory: "It has become evident time and again that when events become too complex and move too rapidly, as appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstrably less able to cope."
Because Long-Term Capital was hardly unique in its approach to investing, the risks of the global marketplace look far sharper today than they did before that long, edgy week in September when so much suddenly seemed to depend on the fate of one giant fund in Greenwich.
 
Broken Eggs In Every Basket
Long-Term Capital -- established in 1994 by John Meriwether, a legendary bond trader formerly with Salomon Brothers, and his partners, including Robert C. Merton and and Myron S. Scholes, who shared the Nobel Prize for economics in 1997 -- is often described these days as having been speculative and risky.
But from the beginning, it tried to reduce its risks by spreading its investments around. It held almost every major type of security and many minor ones, from blue-chip American stocks to Danish mortgage-backed securities to Latin American government bonds. Thus, by every traditional measure, Long-Term Capital hedged its bets -- across markets, currencies and types of assets. In theory, losses on one investment would be offset by gains in another, providing ballast that would allow the fund to ride out any financial storm.
It did not turn out that way.
"As markets around the world moved in the same direction at the same time, the diversification on which Long-Term had previously relied failed it utterly," said Mr. McDonough, in subsequent Congressional testimony about the fund's rescue.
The fund's core investment specialty -- a technique called convergence trading, used primarily by large banks and brokerage firms -- was also a supposedly low-risk strategy. But it, too, did not turn out to be impervious to market gyrations.
Rather than betting that stocks or bonds will go up or down, convergence traders bet that the prices of certain related securities will move closer together. They identify securities whose prices have deviated slightly from their historical relationships to one another and place bets that those prices will return to their normal patterns. The strategy can be applied to many investments -- stocks, government securities, corporate bonds, options, foreign currencies.
In one common convergence trade, Long-Term acted after spotting a Treasury bond that matured in 30 years and another maturing in 29 years that were trading at prices slightly further apart than usual. Since Uncle Sam's ability to pay his debts is unlikely to change between 2027 and 2028, that price gap would no doubt narrow, the partners believed.
The fund bought the 29-year bonds, betting that their price would rise. It also bet on a price decline in the 30-year bonds by selling short -- borrowing the bonds from a big institution and selling them, wagering that they could be replaced later for less money. If the price gap closed, the fund would make money on both trades. If the gap did not close, the fund had some protection, because it had bet on both declining and rising bond prices.
Other opportunities for convergence trades were found in foreign bond and government securities markets, including the markets for Latin American debt, Italian bank notes and British Government securities. In theory, the fund had further reduced its risks by scattering its investments among so many markets and among so many different types of investments.
But in real life, anxiety began to spread through most foreign markets after Thailand's currency collapsed in the summer of 1997. Prices fell and businesses failed all along the Pacific Rim. In response, by early 1998, investors worldwide began seeking a haven in United States Treasury markets.
That remarkable flight to safety had unexpected consequences for Treasury bonds, the bread-and-butter market for Long-Term Capital. Playing to form, the 30-year bonds climbed in price, but the nearly identical 29-year bonds did not share in the rally; their lower trading volume made them look riskier to nervous investors. The divergence hurt Long-Term Capital, of course, because the fund had bet heavily that the bonds' prices would move closer together.
In Europe, too, investors sought safety. That affected Long-Term Capital's bets in Italy, where it had been anticipating that the prices of Italian Government securities would move closer to those of securities issued by Italian banks. Instead, the prices moved even farther apart as investors flocked to the Government securities.
Then, when Russia decided to halt debt payments this past August, developing markets around the world went into a tailspin. Long-Term Capital had bet millions on the convergence of garden-variety bonds issued by Brazil, Mexico and other Latin American governments and so-called Brady bonds, issued by the same nations but secured by United States Treasury securities. Those convergence bets also became losers, as issues backed by the Treasury took on more appeal.
The allergy to risk quickly afflicted the markets for corporate bonds, mortgage bonds and junk bonds. Again, Long-Term Capital was directly in the line of fire. It had a collection of securities, for example, that entitled it to collect the future interest payments from a pool of home mortgages. The prices plummeted on these instruments, which are considered highly risky because of their sensitivity to changes in mortgage rates, and the value of Long-Term Capital's holdings went down. Prices and trading volume also fell in the junk-bond market, where Long-Term Capital had invested several hundred million dollars.
By the end of August, investor nervousness had spread to stocks, with sharp market declines in the United States and elsewhere. Despite its reputation as a bond specialist, Long-Term Capital had an estimated $6.5 billion in the stock market.
Part of that money was in the stocks of companies involved in mergers. Some was invested in a convergence trade on the stock of Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport. Because each company relies for income on a third, related company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the fund had bet that the prices of those two stocks would move toward each other. As the stock market tumbled, though, Shell Transport's stock fell faster and further, causing the gap to widen.
The stock market turmoil also created losses in the fund's multibillion-dollar collection of total-return swaps, a form of financial derivatives. (Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is based on the value of another asset -- for example, a stock option whose price is derived from an underlying stock.) In a typical swap of this kind, the fund entered into a contract with a bank or brokerage firm that owned a block of stock. The bank agreed to pay the fund all future gains and dividends on that stock, and the fund agreed to pay the bank a fixed fee equal to a small percentage of the initial value of the stock.
If the stock rose, the fund kept the gain; if it went down, the fund owed the bank the difference between the original price and the new one. The swaps allowed the fund to benefit from rising stock prices without actually owning the stocks. But stock prices fell and remained unsteady into September.
By mid-September, the only things converging on Long Term Capital's partners were their losses -- losses so diverse that they made it harder for the fund's creditors and their regulators to respond, because the fund's troubles were affecting so many far-flung markets.
Regulators got their first look at the scale of the portfolio on Sunday, Sept. 20, when a team from the New York Fed drove to Greenwich to meet with the beleaguered fund's partners.
It was then, Mr. McDonough of the Fed later testified, that officials "came to understand the impact which Long-Term Capital's positions were already having on markets around the world."
Long-Term Capital's experience, Mr. Kaufman said, shows that "international diversification works in bull markets, but it fails in bear markets."
"We now live in a much more homogeneous financial world," he said. "We all talk to each other and share the same information and have the same biases." As a result, Mr. Kaufman explained, world markets now tend to move in lock step -- a line dance that tramples on the basic concept of portfolio diversification.
 
Teen-Aged Markets In a Grown-Up Crisis
Putting money in mature, well-established markets with lots of investors, like the market for 30-year United States Treasury bonds, is one thing. Placing bets in younger, less mature markets -- those in developing countries and those for complicated financial products -- is quite another, as Long-Term Capital soon discovered. Indeed, the markets for some products in the fund bore little resemblance to traditional forums for trading securities.
While stock options and some other standardized derivatives are traded on exchanges, Long-Term Capital favored swaps and other custom-tailored contracts that were designed specifically for its own investment strategies. These customized contracts change hands only in private transactions -- making the market in them more like the market for homes or luxury yachts than the one for stocks, or even for stock options.
In addition to arranging its total-return swaps in the stock market, the fund also made heavy use of a derivative called an interest-rate swap, in which one investor agrees to pay another a sum equal to the amount that, say, $100 million would earn if invested at a floating interest rate for three years. In return, the second investor agrees to pay the first the amount that the $100 million would earn if invested at fixed rates. Neither party owes the other $100 million; that amount, called the notional value, simply provides a tool for measurement, since it is unknown in advance how much money will actually change hands under the swap agreement.
The scope of Long-Term Capital's use of swaps and other financial derivatives was remarkable. Its derivatives portfolio had a notional value of $1.25 trillion, representing one-thirtieth of the worldwide notional value of these investments, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
One person with firsthand knowledge of the fund's portfolio said the reliance on these exotic derivatives was based on the assumption that Long-Term Capital could quickly and easily sell its holdings whenever it wished. But that assumption was profoundly flawed.
To be sure, the markets for swaps and other privately traded derivatives have grown enormously in the last 15 years; businesses and investors use these tools to offset risks from things like interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. But the trading value of these markets still pales in comparison with that of the stock and bond markets, and it can shrink sharply in times of uncertainty. These markets have fewer participants than the traditional ones and no public disclosure of prices or volume; they also lack a clear regulatory structure.
The ability to absorb large volumes of business quickly without experiencing substantial swings in prices -- a quality Wall Street calls liquidity -- is one good measure of a market's maturity, and it is a quality that relies in part on the presence of speculators like Long-Term Capital.
In the stock market, for example, when buyers and sellers are abundant, an investor can easily sell 10,000 shares of a $50 stock on a single day without pushing down the price more than a few pennies. In a market with fewer buyers, the price might plunge to $25 before the shares were all sold. If a market becomes completely illiquid, there is simply no one willing to buy that much stock that quickly. That is where speculators like Long-Term Capital come in. When many people want to sell, the speculator steps up to buy, contributing to the liquidity of the marketplace by taking the unpopular side of transactions.
But in many small, specialized markets for swaps and other exotic, privately traded derivatives, Long-Term Capital's scale of operation had made it the dominant speculator. Thus, when it needed to sell in the shaky days of early September, speculators who were willing to buy were scarce. "Some of these more exotic swaps were already trading by appointment only," one investment manager said.
Reflecting the economic crisis that swept Asia, the volume of worldwide swaps activity fell nearly 40 percent in the second half of 1997, compared with the first half, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. Activity in the markets for swaps recovered somewhat in the first half of 1998, but when Russia shocked world markets by stopping payments on its debt, liquidity in these markets quickly evaporated again. Exact figures will be months in coming, but one industry newsletter, Swaps Monitor, estimates that trading revenues -- a figure closely tied to trading volume -- fell as much as 24 percent during the third quarter of this year.
A result was a market in which swaps and other derivatives could be sold quickly only at fire-sale prices -- a condition that apparently had not been anticipated by Long-Term Capital or other participants in the market.
Before this crisis, few people even focused on the issue of liquidity in the swaps market, said Paul Spraos, editor of the Swaps Monitor newsletter in New York. "It's not a question of whether it was less liquid than anybody thought," he said. "It's a question of whether people ever sat down and thought about this issue at all. And a lot of people didn't."
But that hardly lets Long-Term Capital off the hook, one Wall Street risk manager said. "They should have realized they would not have the liquidity they needed," this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "In many of these markets, they were the liquidity."
By the third week in September, as the markets reeled and Long-Term Capital's losses grew, regulators and Wall Street executives began to worry. Mr. McDonough, the New York Fed president, later told Congress that he feared that a number of these already nervous markets "would experience extreme price moves and possibly cease to function for a period of one or more days and maybe longer" if Long-Term Capital failed. "This would have caused a vicious cycle," he continued, in which panic-driven selling would push down prices, causing further losses and increasing the risk that the panic would spread.
Moreover, thousands of hedge funds were active in these markets. Their lenders were growing nervous, and lines of credit might have been cut if Long-Term Capital collapsed. At the very least, these funds would have temporarily abandoned their important role as speculators; at worst, many might have failed -- tipping over a new row of dominoes.
 
New Forms of Debt, New Breeds of Risk
Long-Term Capital would never have posed such a threat to the financial markets if it had not found easy ways to speculate by using borrowed money -- an amount borrowed in such intricate ways that the results defied the investment world's assumptions about the limits on credit and the protection of lenders in today's marketplace.
Speculation with borrowed money has been a flash point for regulators since the eve of the 1929 market crash. In 1928, the Federal Reserve tried to discourage stock market speculation by pushing up interest rates on loans made for that purpose, but it met open defiance from some Wall Street lenders who simply refused to raise their rates. After the crash, the Federal Reserve was put firmly in charge of regulating how much stock could be bought on credit -- on margin, as it is called on Wall Street. Today, no more than half of the purchase price of a stock may be borrowed.
But those Depression-era rules do not address loans made to those who speculate in foreign currencies, government securities, bonds and derivatives markets. Hedge funds and other speculators can borrow as much as they dare, and brokerage firms and banks are free to lend as much as they wish within broad regulatory limits.
Besides the fund's considerable reliance on traditional loans, its use of derivatives contracts had the same practical effect as investing with borrowed money. The total-return swaps, for example, allowed the fund to control considerably more shares of stock than it could have bought outright with the same amount of money. Similarly, interest-rate swaps allowed the fund to speculate on changes in bond prices just as if it had owned the bonds, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.
Though Long-Term Capital was not alone in its use of credit, known on Wall Street as leverage, it appears to have borrowed far more than its lenders or their regulators thought plausible or even possible. Some hedge funds use leverage to double or triple the size of their bets; Long-Term Capital used leverage to increase its bets 25 times over. Of the fund's $125 billion in assets, more than $120 billion had been acquired with borrowed money.
Lenders of all types were so eager for the business of the star-studded firm that they lent freely and on generous terms, without much apparent concern about how much others were lending to the fund. They viewed the vast majority of their loans as safe, because they held collateral -- the securities involved in the fund's various trades -- that they assumed they could sell if necessary. But in fact, if they had all tried to dispose of that collateral quickly, they might have had billions and perhaps tens of billions of dollars in losses, as they sold into illiquid markets that Long-Term Capital dominated.
The fund's bankers had also waived their usual requirement for something called initial margin, an up-front deposit similar to the down payment on a car. Most bankers require a down payment; if borrowers cannot repay the loan, the banks rely on the down payment to cover any decline in the value of their collateral.
But people who have studied Long-Term Capital's trading practices said the fund usually got 100 percent financing for its purchases, the equivalent of buying a car with no money down.
The fund did pay its banks money to cover day-to-day declines in the market value of its investments, and it had to post cash collateral on its stock investments. As markets moved against it, the fund satisfied those obligations by drawing down most of the $4.7 billion nest egg it had held at the beginning of 1998. By mid-September, it was dangerously close to running out of cash. If the fund had run out of money and collapsed, the bankers would have had to seize its stocks, bonds and derivatives. And because they had not required Long-Term Capital to pay initial margins, they would have had no cushion if the value of those securities had continued to decline.
The lenient borrowing arrangements that Long-Term Capital had enjoyed caused other migraines for its bankers. Most hedge funds have a banker or two to arrange their trades. Long-Term Capital had dozens -- at least 75, according to Mr. McDonough of the Fed -- because it shopped relentlessly for the best derivatives contracts. The sprawling network of lenders served the fund well, but it created a portfolio filled with what bankers call unpaired trades.
When banks lend money to finance the purchase of two related investments in a convergence trade, they encourage borrowers to finance both legs of the trade through one bank. For example, a bank that finances a hedge fund's purchase of 29-year Treasury bonds would prefer to handle its short sale of 30-year bonds, too. That way, if the hedge fund collapsed, the bank could step into its place, relatively secure in the knowledge that it now controlled bets on both rising and falling bond prices.
But because Long-Term Capital had clout, bankers allowed it to spread its business widely in search of the best prices. That left most of the banks financing single legs of two-way bets. Long-Term was the only glue holding together a puzzle-like portfolio, increasing bankers' anxiety in the dark days of September. A sudden collapse of Long-Term Capital would have left many of them with risky one-way bets on their own books.
As the fund's losses grew, its managers tried desperately to appease bankers by pairing up trades -- persuading the bankers who had financed one part of a trade to get together with those who had financed the rest of it. But the task proved fiendishly complicated. Consider the difficulty if three banks had financed the bet on 30-year Treasury bonds and five banks the 29-year Treasury bet.
"We quickly discovered that getting them to pair up the trade could take something like six months, and we had more like six days," one Long-Term Capital manager said.
 
A Blip, or a Sign Of Crises to Come?
When Fed officials arrived in Greenwich, they identified unpaired trades as one of the most worrisome problems.
And if the fund had failed to make good on even one small payment to a single banker, it would have effectively defaulted on its entire $120 billion in borrowing, thanks to cross-default provisions in its contracts. A cross-default provision requires that a borrower remain current on all its debt repayments, not just on those to the lender itself.
If a default had occurred, some lenders would have been able to seize collateral and sell it, but not all.
The fund's trading partners, the parties with which Long-Term Capital had contracted for its swaps, would have been in trouble, too. They would have almost certainly sought to reduce their risks by doing offsetting transactions with other speculators. At the moment of a Long-Term Capital default, those offsetting contracts themselves would have become unbalanced risks on their books.
When that happened, a senior Wall Street banker said, "it would be sensible in the extreme to go out and get the contracts you need to replace those defaulted ones."
The effect of such a sudden scramble on the various swaps and derivatives markets would have been, at least, extremely disruptive and, at worst, more than those markets could have handled.
Those were the fears that prompted the rescue of the giant hedge fund in late September -- fears that have since faded with each upsurge of the Dow.
But even as markets grew calmer, Mr. Greenspan and other regulators, including Mr. McDonough, continued to worry aloud that broad structural changes in the financial marketplace -- including the spread of derivatives, the increasingly global nature of investment and the immaturity of some developing and specialized markets -- encourage financial panic to spread from market to market and from country to country.
This time, at least, people coped. And if Long-Term Capital was simply a casualty of a once-a-century financial storm, the crisis may well deserve to become a footnote to financial history. But if what happened was, as some regulators fear, a result of developments that have permanently changed how modern markets work, then investors ignore the lessons of the crisis at their own peril.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 13, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with an article about the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management misidentified the three banks that had the highest levels of debt in an industry ranking earlier this year. They were Bankers Trust, with $33.01 borrowed for every dollar of equity; J. P. Morgan, $23.15, and the State Street Corporation, $20.88. The banks in the chart -- Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bancorp and Marshall & Ilsley -- had the lowest debt levels.

HEADLINE: World Bank's Offensive

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Decisions by U.S. and I.M.F. Worsened Asia's Problems, the World Bank Finds" (news article, Dec. 3): One of the World Bank's claims is that the actions of the International Monetary Fund have heightened the prospect of a recession in 1999, delayed recovery in key Asian countries and reduced investor confidence. What motive does the World Bank have for "going public" in this dispute? More important, why is an organization that is charged with promoting growth and development taking actions that will undermine investor confidence?
The World Bank openly disputes how the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund are pursuing their roles. How does that further the cause of financial stability? Without the restoration of confidence, there can be no broad-based recovery.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: Prospectus;
Especiallyin technology, an acquisition is not just a financial deal. Success requires merging two cultures.

BYLINE: By Janet Stites 

 BODY:
IN 1995, Nick Kramer, then a 25-year-old wine seller turned technology entrepreneur, joined three friends and started Spacelab.net, an Internet service provider. Within three years, the company grew to a staff of 22 and was one of the leading such services in New York City for businesses, listing among its customers Allen & Company and Hollinger International.
Last spring, the four founders sold the company to Verio Inc., a company based in Englewood, Colo., that had built itself into a nationwide Internet service provider by acquiring smaller companies. 
 The men found themselves with some money in their pockets, but they were also suddenly reporting to a manager on Long Island, who had to report to a manager in Colorado.
Seven months later, Mr. Kramer is the only one of the original founders still working for Verio. His new title is indirect channel sales manager.
Reflecting on life post-acquisition, Mr. Kramer observed: "The hardest adjustment is going from the top of the pyramid to middle manager. And for the rank and file, it's difficult to go from being somebody -- an integral part of the company -- to being one of 1,000."
Aside from the departure of his partners and one employee, the staff remains intact. But some companies are not so lucky. In the information age, acquiring a company is not just about product or revenue, but about intellectual property and talent, as well. The trick is to hang on to both.
Scot Sedlacek, managing director of Broadview Associates, an investment bank in Fort Lee, N.J., said: "With technology-oriented companies, the asset you are buying is the people. An adviser can run the numbers front and back, but the most difficult aspects of a successful merger are the post-integration issues."
Aside from holding on to managers, companies have to deal with innate issues of corporate culture -- or simply culture clash. A prime example is the planned merger of the New York-based music Web site N2K and CDNow of Jenkintown, Pa., to create a single super music-playing-CD-selling Web site. The merger solved a lot of financial problems. Both stocks had plummeted earlier this fall with the overall market drop.
But culturally, the two companies are as diverse as their geography. N2K's management hails from the music industry, as do many of its employees; CDNow is known more as a storefront rather than an influence in the music industry, and its young founders are considered E-commerce prodigies. CDNow has a basketball court; N2K has a house band.
Craig Marino, an associate of Mr. Sedlacek's at Broadview, said of such mergers generally: "You can't just slam the two companies together and hope they are going to work. You need to spend the same amount of time working with the people as you do working on the valuation."
Broadview advises clients to outline expectations up front so that there is no confusion about what roles the top employees will be playing in the new entity.
"Good buyers in technology do a lot of due diligence up front to make sure cultures do mesh," Mr. Sedlacek said.
As chairman and chief executive of the Web development company Think New Ideas, Ron Bloom has had a lot of experience dealing with acquisitions. The company, now public, was forged in a roll-up of six companies and then acquired six more. He does not take the acquisitions game lightly.
"You have to have a cultural plan to match your fiscal plan," Mr. Bloom said, adding that a cultural plan has to take into account profit and loss, return on investment and cost of opportunity, just as a financial plan does.
Mr. Bloom does not disclose his company's entire strategy, but he says that Think New Ideas generally finds a way to work with a company before acquiring it. "We'll do a joint venture to test quality and the strength of relationship," he said.
Once Think New Ideas has made an acquisition, it sends in a "culture" team, which goes over operations, sales strategies and the like. "We want to send a clear message that they are part of a family and they can benefit from the family," Mr. Bloom said.
Even so, he said, "You need to prepare for culture shock; you have to look for a six- to nine-month period to optimize performance as the cultures get to know each other."
Mr. Bloom also has a plan for acquisitions that end up not working. "We deploy a team to get to the heart of the problem," he said. "Usually, we can work it out. The trick is to keep the entities on both sides focused on growing the business."
Like Verio, iXL, a Web development company based in Atlanta, has built itself through acquisition. Since being formed in April 1996, it has acquired 34 companies, including two New York-based Web design shops.
That said, iXL's president, Bill Nussey, said, "We don't think of ourselves as being in the acquisitions business." Rather, Mr. Nussey said, acquisitions are a way to acquire talent.
"We're trying to get talented people more rapidly than we can hire them," Mr. Nussey said.
To do this, iXL looks for a company with a vision and a culture that are similar to its own. "We have walked away from people who have tons of revenue but had management teams which we didn't think would be a good part of this company," Mr. Nussey said.
"We don't have any assets," he added. "If our people aren't really happy, we have nothing."
To keep talent, Mr. Sedlacek and Mr. Marino advise empowering employees and building in financial incentives.
"If you put a wad of money into people's pockets and don't do due diligence in the way of people, six months later they might be off to the next start-up to do it again," Mr. Sedlacek said.
Back at Verio, Mr. Kramer, who at age 28 has already built and sold a company, says he is now building a career.
"At first it's a blow to the ego not to be in charge," he said, "but the opportunity is so much better now. It's an education to see how a larger, national company works."

HEADLINE: Mexico Weighs Voting by Its Emigrants in U.S.

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Dec. 6

 BODY:
It is the year 2000. Millions of Mexican immigrants line up outside improvised polling places, not only in Los Angeles, Brooklyn and other major locations in the United States where Mexicans have settled but in hundreds of towns across the country, preparing to vote in Mexico's presidential elections.
Thousands of Mexican election officials have fanned out across the United States to supervise the balloting, which caps a campaign in which candidates have barnstormed through Mexican population centers in dozens of American states, lambasting United States immigration, narcotics and other policies unpopular in Mexico. 
 Fiction? No, this is the scenario that emerges from a recent Mexican Government study, which, at the request of the Mexican Congress, offers detailed logistical options and budget estimates for extending the vote to the estimated 10 million Mexicans living in the United States.
"It is viable," the report concludes.
Millions of potential votes are at stake, perhaps 15 percent of the Mexican electorate, and the Mexican Congress must decide in coming months whether to approve any of the options the report outlines.
In the month since the report's publication, opposition leaders have praised its proposals as a long-overdue attempt to extend suffrage to migrant workers who have been disenfranchised both in Mexico and in the United States. But President Ernesto Zedillo's allies in the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, have lampooned them as too costly and complicated.
The political loyalties of Mexicans north of the border is a matter of dispute, although the conventional wisdom holds that their vote would favor the opposition because many migrants are thought to blame the PRI for the economic debacles that forced their emigration.
The debate gained volume on Friday, as prominent American academics joined Mexican leaders on both sides of the fray during a conference in Tijuana at Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a Government-financed research organization.
"The implications of all this are frightening," said Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a professor of government at the University of Texas, contending that an extended display of Mexican politicking on United States soil would provoke a nativist fury in the United States directed not only at migrants but also at Mexican-Americans. "When the rocks start flying, xenophobic Americans are not going to ask for an ID card."
Emilio Zebadua Gonzalez, the counselor in the Federal Electoral Institute who coordinated the study, shrugged off the criticisms. "We have to decide whether Mexicans who live in the United States have the rights of other Mexican citizens," he said.
The institute's voting study was set in motion in July 1996 when Mexico's Congress deleted a clause from the Constitution requiring Mexicans to vote in their home districts and mandated the Electoral Institute, which organizes Mexican elections, to study ways of extending the presidential vote to Mexicans overseas.
A number of other countries allow their citizens living in the United States to vote in their presidential elections, but none of the operations are on the scale that would be needed for voting by Mexicans here.
The institute impaneled 13 distinguished demographers and other social scientists, and on Nov. 12 they published their 14-volume study.
Nearly 10 million potential Mexican voters live north of the border, including 7.1 million Mexican-born immigrants and 2.7 million adult children of Mexican-born parents, who could also exercise the right to vote under the Mexican Constitution, the report said. In addition, 100,000 Mexicans live in third countries, it said, and if voting rights were extended, they could apply to this group as well.
Three out of four Mexican immigrants live in 33 counties in California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Illinois, Georgia and New York, it said. The others are widely dispersed throughout the rest of the country, including Alaska and Hawaii, with only 11 American states having few or no Mexican residents, it said.
The report lists various procedures that would allow Mexicans in the United States to receive credentials complying with the exacting electoral standards that have allowed Mexico largely to eliminate ballot fraud in recent years.
And it describes six possible ways Mexicans could cast ballots in the United States. Most would involve establishing thousands of polling places in consulates, churches, Mexican-owned businesses and immigrant homes. The report also outlines the possibility of voting by mail or telephone.
Extending Mexico's vote north would cost between $76 million and $356 million, the report said, depending on how closely the authorities attempt to duplicate registration procedures used in Mexico. The latter figure is roughly equivalent to the Government's entire yearly anti-poverty budget.
Considerable debate at the conference on Friday centered on how much interest Mexicans living in the United States might have in voting in Mexican elections. Citing opinion samplings collected among migrants passing through border cities and Mexican airports, the study reported that 83 percent of Mexicans living north of the border want to help choose the Mexican president, but that many said they could spare little time to register or to cast ballots.
Wayne A. Cornelius, a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego, said an increasing number of migrants lived permanently in the United States but remained interested in Mexican politics because they finance construction of churches and other public works in their Mexican hometowns.
"I consider these voting proposals to be of fundamental importance for the democratic transition in Mexico," Mr. Cornelius said.
Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., also praised the report but questioned why Mexico would consider allowing the 2.7 million children of Mexican parents living in the United States to vote.
"Many don't speak Spanish and have never been in Mexico," he said.
Clark W. Reynolds, an economics professor at Stanford University, said the proposals would anger many Americans and undercut efforts to involve Mexican immigrants more fully in United States politics.
"This will cause a political explosion, trust me," Mr. Reynolds said. "I know the United States, and we've not had a very happy 10 years in U.S.-Mexico relations. If you go forward with these plans, there will be a huge conflict."
Much discussion centered on the 2.7 million potential voters who live in the United States with no immigration documents. The report suggests that Mexico might seek to negotiate guarantees from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service that undocumented Mexicans would not be arrested while waiting to vote. But Roger Diaz de Cossio, a diplomat who devised Foreign Ministry assistance programs for migrants, scoffed.
"The I.N.S. has laws to obey, and they're going to obey them regardless of whether Mexicans are going to the polls," Mr. Diaz said.
Ernesto Ruffo Appel, whose 1989-95 tenure in Baja California made him Mexico's first non-PRI Governor in the modern era, accused the authorities of whipping up opposition to the voting proposals out of fear that migrants would vote against the PRI.
"I think that fear is well-founded," Mr. Ruffo said. "So for the good of Mexico, it's important to get going on this now."

Thanks to an economic boom in the last few years, Ireland is the 19th richest country in the world, with the fastest growth rate of any European Union nation. Immigration by people looking for work here now exceeds the perennial emigration to Britain and America.
The average wage has risen to about $24,000, and the Government announced late last month that it had taken in a record $1.4 billion in revenue in 1998, and expected the upward trend to continue next year. 
 But the gap between the poor, estimated at 20 percent of the population of 3.6 million, and the well-to-do is apparently widening. And there is a growing feeling in the grubby public housing projects, especially in Dublin, that the Celtic Tiger, as the boom is widely known, is the same old fat cat that ignores them.
The educated professionals and middle class administrative and technical workers are thriving, cramming the streets of Dublin with thousands of new cars, and their prosperity has pushed up the cost of housing by about 100 percent.
But that only makes life more bleak for people like Helen Delaney, 48, a single mother of six children who has lived for 20 years in the Ballymun high-rise public housing complex on the northern edge of the capital.
"If I found the Celtic Tiger, I'd take him down to the Dublin Corporation office and get them off their backsides, up here to do what they're supposed to be doing -- fixing my flat," she said recently.
The poverty and resentment of Ballymun, where 20,000 people live, received brief attention in the outside world in the 1991 film, "The Commitments."
National unemployment has fallen from 20 percent, when the film was released, to about 8 percent, well below the European Union average. But in Ballymun and other poor areas of Dublin, like the Docklands, unemployment averages about 40 percent. And there are pockets where 90 percent of the people are out of work, many of them for several years.
They survive on welfare payments, called the dole, averaging a little less than half the average wage for a family of four. The official poverty line, based on European Union criteria, is half the national average.
"People on the dole don't think about the Celtic Tiger as relevant to their future," said James Hargis, manager of an employment training program in the Docklands, near the River Liffey.
"They find that the Social Welfare people are chasing them more," he added, to see if they are taking welfare payments and at the same time have found jobs in the underground or "black" economy.
"We have Trinity College literally on our doorstep," he said, but "very few people in the Docklands would ever get there."
One of the main problems that keeps people here from profiting from the boom is that about 40 percent of men over 35 are functionally illiterate, descendants of dock workers whose jobs disappeared 25 years ago with the arrival of huge containerships.
Some of the Trinity students help tutor children from the area through the St. Andrew's Resource Center, operated with Government and private funds.
The center finds work for about 200 people a year, mostly women, who are more open to training programs than the men, many of whom are ashamed to admit they cannot read a newspaper.
Brendan Walsh, an economics professor at University College Dublin, does not take an entirely pessimistic view. "It's not as if the Celtic Tiger zoomed ahead and left the elderly, the unemployed, the disabled and single parents without support," he said. "Support has increased with inflation."
Welfare payments have risen, he said, though they have not matched the level of increased national income. "Like many developed or booming economies," he said, "the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. If you are a pessimist, you can say that's terrible. If you are an optimist you can say everyone has drifted up a little."
He noted that because there is a cash-producing boom, there is more begging on the streets of Dublin, some of it by immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe and Africa.
A little is not enough for the Rev. Sean Healy, director of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, a gadfly group that prods the Government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to increase welfare payments and expand employment programs.
Father Healy, a former missionary in Africa who has a doctorate in sociology from Fordham University, wants Ireland to become the first country in Europe to establish a guaranteed annual income for all citizens -- at an amount above the average public assistance level.
He concedes that this is unlikely, but he noted that Mr. Ahern, who has been Prime Minister for 18 months, has recently begun to acknowledge "poverty and social exclusion" in his public speeches, and promises to do more to eliminate them.
He noted that traditional Irish "begrudgery," a widely acknowledged national trait of resenting the success or good luck of a neighbor, may be part of what makes people with jobs unwilling to give more help to the unemployed.
"Begrudgery is beatable," he said. "From the point of view of Christian teaching, everybody is their brother's keeper."
His optimism is not in evidence at the Ballymun public housing project, though. In the 15-story housing towers, the corridors reek of urine and the elevators are often out of order. There are scores of heroin addicts, and the principal amusement of many children is riding and caring for the often scrawny horses that have long roamed the grounds, to the dismay of city officials and animal rights groups.
The Government has said that it hopes, in the next several years, to do what some American cities have done with high-rise projects -- tear them down and replace them with low-rise housing more conducive to family life.
Ms. Delaney, the mother of six children, who lives on the fifth floor, said: "When the lifts are broken I have to take my young one out of school because I can go down the stairs with her, but I can't come back up. She really needs to be in school at this stage, since she's only starting. If I keep her out of school now she'll think, 'Great! The lifts in Ballymun let me stay home.' "
She said that the economic boom has only made things harder for Ballymun residents and has made it even more difficult to contemplate moving to private housing. Large food store chains have beaten out smaller supermarkets, reducing competition, and food prices have gone up.
And a private house in the neighborhood that might have cost $30,000 before the boom is now worth $200,000, putting escape from public housing even farther out of the residents' reach.
Jackie Lee, 35, an unemployed hairdresser who runs a child care program at the community center in Ballymun, said she is still looking for an outside job, but the project has become a symbol for poverty and crime in Ireland. "If you're from Ballymun you won't even get a reply," she said.
Ms. Lee contends that many of the people in Ballymun have the skills and education to take advantage of the economic boom if it were not for the bias against them. "It's like that film, 'Escape From New York,' where they made New York a prison," she said. "That's what Ballymun is like -- just dump everybody out there that has any problems. Don't worry about the people who want to do anything about themselves."
She said that unemployment becomes an accepted way of life at Ballymun. Her father, once a roofing contractor, was unemployed for years. "It was very depressing because you've lost your role model," she said. "There's a 10-year age gap between me and my younger brother and sister. I've always worked, but my sister is unemployed, and they don't want to work, because for them Dad never worked."
She said she would stay at Ballymun, though, waiting for the Government to fulfill its promise to tear down the high rises and put people in new houses.
But, she added, "It's terrible to have to turn to your child and say 'No' you can't have that doll, it's 50 pounds" -- about $75 -- "and I can't afford it.' I take her into town to show her all the toys in the shops and it breaks her heart."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seems Ready to Accept a U.N. Review of Iraqi Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Just weeks after it went to the brink of military action against Iraq, the United States now appears willing to go along with a consensus on the United Nations Security Council and grant a comprehensive review of the sanctions against Saddam Hussein even if he has not cooperated fully with arms inspectors, diplomats say.
For months Washington has insisted that Iraq must show full cooperation with arms inspections before Baghdad can have any hope of such a review. But now, while Iraq is still far from total compliance, both the Iraqis and their strongest critics have apparently decided that there is more to gain in staging a review than in igniting a new confrontation. 
 Iraq has doggedly pursued the idea of a review in hopes that it will accelerate the lifting of a crippling oil embargo. Yesterday the official Iraqi press repeated the demand that the review begin soon, since inspectors have been back at work on routine tasks in Iraq for more than two weeks. They had been idled for months by Iraqi noncooperation.
On the other side, the United States and Britain believe that a review will prove yet again that Iraq still has much to answer for about its banned weapons programs. Such an outcome would strengthen the American policy of keeping sanctions in place indefinitely.
The decision to authorize the review could come as early as next week, when Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, which has been charged with disarming Iraq, reports to the Council about recent inspections. Diplomats say the review would then probably begin in January, although details have yet to be decided.
The review would be the first of its kind and be devised to look at all relevant resolutions and requirements set on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Previous reviews were narrowly focused to assess Iraqi compliance at six-month intervals. It is also likely to be used to spell out exactly what more the Iraqis must do so before sanctions can be lifted.
The Iraqis are hoping that once the Security Council takes the broad view it will see in effect that Iraq has met a majority of requirements, no longer poses a threat and can be dealt with through far less intrusive, long-term monitoring regime.
The American view, diplomats say, is that the review will backfire on the Iraqis. If the Iraqis want as "comprehesive" review, they note, that is exactly what they may get.
Such a review would provide an opportunity to hold Baghdad accountable for a broad range of transgressions since the gulf war, including the failure to pay compensation to Kuwait or to return stolen Kuwaiti property, and a deplorable human rights record. These grievances are in addition to the charge of harboring programs to make weapons of mass destruction.
The Iraqis, on the other hand, will focus on a narrow definition of compliance aimed specifically at the lifting of the oil embargo.
The shift is taking place despite Iraq's refusal to hand over documents demanded by Mr. Butler's commission. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iraqi nuclear programs, has also been denied documents, independent arms control experts say.
But one Western diplomat noted last week, "It's pretty clear that nobody wants to go to war over documents." On Friday, Russia's envoy, Sergei Lavrov, added that he thought a number of Security Council members had serious questions about the importance, or even the existence, of some of the documents being sought.
Envoys from a cross-section of Council members say no nation wants a conflict during the year-end holidays and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Neither does anyone want to conduct the review, which is expected to be a complicated survey of Iraq's relations with the United Nations, during the same period.
The Iraqis are also prepared to accept a January timetable, Mr. Lavrov said, because despite their calls for an immediate review, the Iraqis want the Security Council's full attention and many diplomats take time off during the holidays.
Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz of Iraq arrived in Moscow on Sunday for talks with Russian officials, two days after Mr. Butler visited Moscow at Russia's request. Russia is expected to take the lead in pressing Iraq's case at the United Nations.
Since President Saddam Hussein allowed the inspectors to return last month, they have expanded their activities in Iraq. But the inspectors have so far avoided provoking a showdown over any one of a number of sites the Iraqis consider sensitive.
No Security Council member is pressing for a confrontation, prompting Scott Ritter, the American concealment expert who resigned from the Special Commission in August, to write in an article in the current issue of The New Republic that the resumed inspections are a "sham."
In this atmosphere, threats from the United States and Britain, countries that went to the brink of war to force Mr. Hussein to back down in mid-November, have all but ended, although officials in both countries continue to warn Iraq that an attack can never be ruled out.
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has made the same point in recent days during a tour of Arab nations.
The Iraqis have apparently decided to postpone accounting for disputed documents until a review takes place, when they can argue with the support of Russia, France, China and several countries that hold rotating Council seats that the documents are unimportant or irrelevant.
The Americans and the British, on the other hand, say that they have recent history on their side. For more than a year, Iraq has been demanding reviews of its biological, chemical and missile programs. On every occasion, international experts, including Russian, Chinese and French scientists, have refused to accept Iraqi explanations for missing material.
If a comprehensive review ends with similar results, the Americans and British will be in a stronger position to keep sanctions in place without resorting to military action, at least in the short term.
Iraq hopes to see a review end with the lifting of the oil embargo imposed after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Other sanctions like bans on air travel could be lifted later as other requirements are met.
Security Council resolutions say, however, that all prohibited weapons systems must be adequately accounted for before the oil embargo is removed. Even if nuclear, chemical and missile systems are cleared of major suspicions, the Iraqi biological weapons program poses huge problems, and these are not likely to disappear quickly.
While American and British statements on Iraq have been subdued lately, the two governments are working hard at the same time to undermine Mr. Hussein's confidence if not his Government by pressing Iraqi exile groups to step up and coordinate their activities against Baghdad, leaders of those groups say.
The United States, exiles said in interviews this week, is also broadening its appeal to Mr. Hussein's opponents by trying to bring Shiite Muslim opponents who operate in southern Iraq from bases in Iran into a concerted effort to undermine the Baghdad Government, along with Kurdish groups in northern Iraq.
Some exiles are skeptical of that plan, saying Iran is not ready to give the Iraqis based there the go-ahead to join a movement that will be assumed to have the support of the United States.

HEADLINE: The Fight to Cover Infertility;
Suit Says Employer's Refusal to Pay Is Form of Bias

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: MAHOPAC, N.Y., Dec. 6

 BODY:
On Thursday morning, after a fitful night's sleep, Rochelle Saks had her last artificial insemination. Her medical plan does not cover infertility treatments, she owes her doctor almost $10,000 and she can afford to pay only a few hundred dollars a month to retire the debt. Thus, he has refused to continue treating her.
"I've been up since 2:30 in the morning, thinking this is our last try," Ms. Saks said before that final visit to the doctor. "We cannot afford to go any further on our own." 
 But a bold decision to sue her employer could turn the tide for Ms. Saks and others like her. She is among a small but growing band of plaintiffs who have filed class action complaints with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging that denying medical coverage for infertility treatments is unlawful discrimination.
The argument for coverage, closely watched by the estimated six million infertile couples in the United States, was bolstered by a Supreme Court ruling in June, not directly related to infertility, that declared that reproduction was "a major life activity" and that, therefore, those who could not procreate were protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
That decision has led to an increase in such complaints to the commission and "sends a clear message to employers" that denial of infertility coverage will come under new scrutiny, said a lawyer with the commission who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The complaints could lead to settlements brokered by the commission or wind up in Federal Court, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the newer Americans With Disabilities Act.
"Now we have a leg to stand on," said Mark G. Sokoloff, one of Ms. Saks' lawyers.
The idea of requiring coverage of infertility treatments is fiercely contested by insurance company advocates, business groups and some academics.
Ms. Saks, 37, is an unlikely standard-bearer, a soft-spoken store manager who until recently discussed her quest for a child only with her closest friends and relatives. But she said she was galled by what she called the hypocrisy of her employer, the Franklin Covey Company, which sells motivational books and educational materials based on the Mormon principles of its owners, who say that family is their No. 1 priority.
One of those books, "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Families," by Stephen R. Covey, sits on the coffee table in the Sakses' modest town house in this Putnam County village. The book is dedicated to "all children, our common mission" and begins with the author's unqualified assertion that "family is what I care the most about."
In the Franklin Covey store that Ms. Saks manages in White Plains, the shelves are filled with parenting guides. And at company management conferences, there are frequent discussions of policies to help employees balance work and family.
Yet Ms. Saks and her husband, Joel, a salesman of hair products, said they received no support from company executives during their wrangle with the insurance company that administers the Covey medical plan. That plan explicitly excludes coverage for "surgical impregnation procedures," including artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization, and for injectable drugs that assist in conception. It also excludes coverage for "complications arising from noncovered surgery," a footnote that would haunt the Sakses.
Ms. Saks, an employee of the company since 1995, began treatment for hormonal imbalance and infertility in June 1997, using a physician approved by the plan. She was prescribed a standard regimen of oral medication and was artificially inseminated with her husband's sperm.
Last September, Ms. Saks became pregnant, but miscarried a month later. Virtually all her medical claims were denied by the insurer, including those related to her miscarriage, which was deemed a "byproduct of an uncovered procedure."
Ms. Saks appealed the plan's denial of coverage and spent many months fighting over medical bills, which then totaled about $9,500. Two months ago, Ms. Saks was informed that $1,458 worth of services rendered between her positive pregnancy test and her miscarriage would be covered. But beyond that one month of care, her appeals were denied.
But Ms. Saks remained optimistic that the company's family-centered ethos would prevail if she brought her predicament to someone's attention. Among the many letters she sent was one to Sean Covey, the company's vice president. "I would hope that a company that puts so much emphasis and value in family would see the need to help its employees achieve what matters most," Ms. Saks wrote.
That letter, and many others, went unanswered.
"It was shocking," Mr. Saks said of the company's silence. "We thought they practiced what they preached."
Last month, with the help of Resolve, an advocacy organization for infertile couples, Ms. Saks was put in touch with two Manhattan law firms that were willing to take her case free of charge. Ms. Saks' complaint was filed late in October by the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Firm and the firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann , and the E.E.O.C. notified Franklin Covey of the action. Several calls last week to Franklin Covey's corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City seeking comment went unanswered.
A second equal-opportunity complaint, also organized by Resolve, has been filed on behalf of a couple denied infertility treatment by the Long Island Rail Road. The second couple was not willing to be interviewed or identified. According to Resolve, the railroad paid for a procedure to remove sperm from the man, who has fertility problems. But the second half of the procedure, the injection of sperm into his wife, was not covered because the woman, also a railroad employee, is healthy.
Although complaints of this kind are just now gaining ground in New York, they have already succeeded in Chicago. A police officer there won a $1.5 million class action settlement last year from the city for coverage of infertility treatment. And several other complaints to the E.E.O.C. have recently been settled, including one against a suburban police department and another against a consulting company.
Despite these recent victories for infertile couples, there is ample disagreement about whether insurance coverage for assisted reproduction is realistic, or required under the law.
George J. Annas, the chairman of the health law department at the Boston University School of Public Health, thinks that infertile couples have a much stronger claim for time off for treatment and other "reasonable accommodations" in the workplace than they do for medical coverage, since employers have no "affirmative obligation" to provide any insurance.
Not long ago, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law issued a 462-page report on assisted reproductive technologies and concluded that there is "no persuasive reason" for requiring insurance coverage of infertility treatment when so many people have no health insurance at all or have coverage that excludes other conditions, including mental illness and dental problems.
That report was a blow to New York State lawmakers sponsoring a bill to mandate insurance coverage for infertility. That bill died in a committee last year but is expected to be reintroduced, with amendments that would put limits on the number of procedures, the total cost and who would qualify as a patient. Two states, Massachusetts and Illinois, already mandate infertility coverage, but self-insured companies are exempt.
Proponents of insurance reimbursements for infertility treatments, which are rarely covered, make an economic as well as a moral case. A study in Massachusetts, based on actual experience, found that the additional cost of such coverage was $1.71 a month per member. Other studies, based on projections, put the cost at about $3 a year.
The current situation encourages women to have expensive and often ineffective gynecological surgery that is covered by insurance, advocates say, rather than more appropriate and effective procedures, including in vitro fertilization, which is generally not covered, but has a much higher success rate. And when women do choose in vitro procedures without insurance, they are more likely to implant many embryos to increase the odds that the expensive procedure will succeed. But that also raises the odds of highly expensive and dangerous multiple births.
The issue of insurance coverage dominates the agenda of Resolve, the advocacy group, which continues to recruit potential plaintiffs for legal action, even as it lobbies lawmakers in Albany for a state mandate. On Thursday, at Resolve's annual holiday party, Ms. Saks received a rousing ovation for filing her complaint.
She acknowledged the applause from the safe circle of her mother-in-law's embrace, her cheeks streaked with tears and mascara. Ms. Saks was clearly debilitated from a long day that began in the doctor's office. But she spoke optimistically about the artificial insemination.
"This time I was on a lot more drugs and I responded well," said Ms. Saks, who will learn in a few weeks whether the procedure was successful.
Her lawyer, Mr. Sokoloff, and Resolve's executive director, Pamela Madsen, prowled the room where the party guests included some of New York's leading infertility doctors. They were searching for someone who would take Ms. Saks as a patient, despite her inability to pay.
But by Friday morning, that hope had evaporated. "As of now, there's no new doctor," Ms. Madsen said. "She's cut off. That's it."

HEADLINE: Ideology Aside, Tough Choices on Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The debate over how to prepare Social Security for the next century has been cast all year as a philosophical clash between those who would keep the system intact and those who would rebuild it to allow individual investment in the financial markets.
Regardless of which path Congress and the Clinton Administration choose, they will be forced to select from the same unappetizing menu of benefit cuts, tax increases and trade offs between risk and investment return to assure that Social Security will be able to weather the baby boom generation's retirement. 
 When President Clinton brings together members of Congress, economists and public policy analysts on Tuesday and Wednesday for a White House conference on Social Security, the focus will be as much on those politically excruciating choices as on the sweeping debate over the system's structure.
"No matter which ideological side you're on, you still have to make painful choices," said Ron Gebhardtsbauer, a senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, who will participate in the conference.
Administration officials hope the conference will be a springboard for legislative action to shore up the program, which without any changes will run short of money to pay all promised benefits starting in 2032. But the officials said that the most they can hope for out of the conference is to find some common ground as a first step toward bipartisan legislation next year.
Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, said that by bringing together Administration officials and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, the conference would be "an opportunity to build some bipartisan trust in an area that has often been typified by very partisan and very harsh rhetoric in the past."
Trust and bipartisanship will be essential because the options that the conference will be examining are as explosive and subject to demagoguery as any on the domestic political agenda.
Should the nation raise the retirement age, a step that would in effect be a benefit cut for most people?
Many economists say the answer is yes, because people are living longer and healthier lives. Organized labor, however, is vociferous in its opposition, saying it would be cruel to anyone doing physical labor. Moreover, many people do not realize that the age at which full retirement benefits can be claimed is already being increased to 67 from 65 over the next 24 years.
Should the relatively well off have to pay more in taxes to help keep the system afloat?
Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax -- split equally between employers and employees -- on earned income up to a certain level, now $68,400. Some proposals call for the income cap to be substantially increased or even eliminated, steps that would amount to a tax increase on middle and upper income workers. Such an increase would help close much of the financial gap facing Social Security, but would make the system a worse deal for those paying the higher tax.
Those are just two of the more straightforward ideas on the table. Others include reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments and reducing benefits for wealthy recipients. Some are complicated, like reducing the lifetime average earnings used in setting benefit levels by increasing the number of years used in calculating the average.
Some seem relatively straightforward, like requiring all new state and local government employees -- many of whom are not now covered by Social Security -- to be brought into the system, helping to increase payroll tax revenues.
Some ideas have more or less been ruled out. There is no serious discussion of a straightforward, across-the-board benefit cut. And President Clinton has all but promised not to raise the payroll tax rate, although he has left open the option of increasing revenues through other means, like raising the cap on taxable earnings.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle say the most likely outcome is a compromise that includes some limited use of private accounts, a variety of benefit cuts and tax increases, and use of the projected Federal budget surplus. One approach favored by some Republicans would use all of the surplus to avoid benefit cuts or tax increases, although that plan, critics say, would only delay the day of reckoning.
Mr. Clinton is seriously considering support for some version of individual accounts for Social Security, although his advisers insist that he has made no decisions yet and that the most likely outcome is a compromise between the competing visions. Mr. Clinton has remained silent about which of the specific benefit cuts and tax increases he might support.
"I think he is wrestling with some of the difficult issues," Mr. Sperling said. "I do not feel that he has locked in on one specific proposal at this point."
Republican leaders all support some version of the individual accounts plans, most of which call for diverting a portion of payroll tax revenues into accounts that would be owned and controlled by the worker.
They have support from several prominent Democrats, including Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. But most liberal Democrats, especially those in the House, strongly oppose individual accounts and say the current system, under which payroll taxes go to pay benefits to current retirees, can and should be maintained.
The challenge underlying both approaches is to close a long-term gap between Social Security's revenues and its promises to pay benefits. Starting in 2032, unless changes are made, the system will take in enough money from the payroll tax to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits.
Proponents of individual accounts say the solution is to harness the power of financial markets. Allowing a portion of their payroll taxes to be invested through personal accounts will generate much better returns for workers than the current system, they say, and will give workers greater control over their own finances.
"The fact is that when today's 30-somethings start to retire we will not be able to pay the tab," said M. Anthony Burns, the chairman of Ryder System Inc., who headed a study of the issue for the Business Roundtable, an organization of large corporations. "We must bolster our current social safety net by increasing individuals' abilities to own and grow their retirement funds."
But shifting payroll taxes into private accounts creates a problem. That money has already been earmarked to pay benefits to current retirees. Current workers, therefore, would effectively be called on to save for their own retirement and to support current retirees simultaneously. As a result, individual account plans require deeper cuts in guaranteed benefits for current workers than those required by plans that would not establish individual accounts.
Advocates of private accounts say the cuts in guaranteed benefits will be more than offset by high returns on individual investments. Opponents, however, say the result will be to leave many retirees at the mercy of the markets, especially those most vulnerable in old age.
"We have seen an unprecedented level of outrage among working families when they learn of the benefit cuts and tax increases being proposed by those who would turn Social Security over to Wall Street," said John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Some liberals say that the threat to Social Security is exaggerated and that if the system assumes even moderate economic growth in coming decades most of the problem will disappear.
Most liberals, though, are less sanguine, and the plans they are advancing generally rely, just like those of conservatives, on Wall Street. The difference is that liberals want the Government rather than individuals to do the investing, by putting as much as 40 percent of Social Security's reserves into stocks and bonds. They say that such an approach allows the system to benefit from the power of the markets without exposing individuals to the risks of Wall Street's ups and downs.
Moreover, most plans advocated by liberals also call for benefit cuts and tax increases.
A plan developed by Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings Institution calls for accelerating the planned increase in the retirement age to 67 and continuing to raise it gradually as life expectancy increases; reducing spouses' benefits; computing average lifetime earnings in a way that reduces benefits, and subjecting a greater portion of benefits to income taxes.

HEADLINE: Managers of Care, Not of Costs

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WEST CHESTER, Pa.

 BODY:
Nick Polidore, a state gymnastics champion with bangs, dimples and baggy blue jeans, would seem as robust as any other 11-year-old. But he has asthma, so ragweed or a simple cold can propel him to an emergency room, gasping for breath.
Once, an asthma attack would keep him in a hospital for a day or two. But since his family doctor here, Brandt S. Loev, took up disease management, a system for controlling chronic conditions like asthma, the big emergencies have stopped -- and so have the big bills to his mother's health insurance company. 
 Disease management sounds familiar, even common-sensical. On each office visit, Dr. Loev checks Nick's breathing and health completely and then an aide teaches him how to avoid attacks, how to use inhalers, how to test his lungs himself.
Once upon a time, this is what managed care was supposed to do: cut costs by keeping people healthy. Instead, health management organizations and insurance companies concentrated on cutting costs, especially by reducing doctors' fees.
But now that those methods have played out and in many cases profits have evaporated, some health care organizations are looking to better medical practice as an answer. The new remedy is managing chronic diseases, which account for 60 percent of medical costs in the United States.
"The next phase has to be managing care better, and disease management is another word for that," said Uwe S. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
The movement is breeding a new industry of as many as 300 companies that contract with H.M.O.'s and employers to supervise the care of people with chronic diseases. The revenue of these companies is expected to double over the next year, to $348 million, said Al Lewis, a broker who negotiates contracts for the companies with H.M.O.'s.
Among the 1,000 H.M.O.'s that belong to the American Association of Health Plans, at least 150 are collaborating with the American Diabetes Association in a 10-year disease management program that aims to reduce blindness and foot amputations among diabetics by 40 percent and kidney failure by 30 percent.
One leader in the movement is the University of Pennsylvania Health Center, which offers management programs for 20 chronic conditions through its 85 clinics in and around Philadelphia, including Dr. Loev's clinic in West Chester. In September, it licensed V.H.A. Inc., a group of more than 1,200 nonprofit hospitals, including Columbia Presbyterian in New York, to use its programs.
"Everybody's talking about it," said Dr. Joseph Carver, disease management medical director for Aetna U.S. Healthcare, which has enrolled nearly 59,000 members in programs for ailments that include congestive heart failure.
 But disease management is still a small part of health care, and it is not clear whether it will gain wide acceptance among doctors, some of whom belittle it as "cookbook medicine," and who see their control of health care threatened.
Consumer advocates warn that disease management can be abused, most obviously by H.M.O.'s and the disease management companies that are thriving by taking on chronic conditions like asthma that promise quick savings while shunning those like hypertension that can take a decade or more to yield savings.
"I see a lot of enthusiasm for this as a way of solving some serious problems," said John M. Eisenberg, administrator of the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and a proponent of disease management. "What we all have to be worried about is whether the emperor has any clothes."
Scholars like Mr. Reinhardt say the University of Pennsylvania's two-year-old program is promising. Disease management permeates the university's Mayfair Family Practice in northeast Philadelphia, which serves an aging population of patients.
"I would say 90 percent of the people who come in here have some form of chronic disease," said Winifred Waters, the nurse-manager. "We have a lot of nuns who are on Medicare, and every nun has severe osteoporosis."
For 18 years Mrs. Waters and her husband, Dr. Patrick T. Waters, a family practitioner, operated the clinic alone. But as managed care spread and cut their fees for treating patients, their income plunged. They had to see more patients, faster, which left little time for comprehensive treatment of chronic diseases.
Four years ago, they sold the practice to the University of Pennsylvania Health System and became salaried employees, with two younger doctors. Early last year, they began working under the system's disease management guidelines, or protocols.
As an example of how the arrangement works, Dr. Waters said, he pointed to a package of a medication, Niaspran, which a drug company's salesman had left as a sample of a new prescription drug to lower cholesterol.
Niaspran is a form of niacin, which is sold over the counter, but releases over an extended time in the body. Niacin can cause severe flushing, making people feel hot. The salesman said Niaspran had less severe side effects.
In his own practice, Dr. Waters said, he would not have prescribed Niaspran until he had enough research to support its use. But he E-mailed a University of Pennsylvania expert on the management of high cholesterol, asking about the drug. The expert checked with the Food and Drug Administration, which had endorsed it, so Dr. Rader added it to the university's protocol for niacin therapy.
But the biggest change brought by disease management, Dr. Waters said, is the advent of the university's circuit-riding nurse educators, each specializing in specific diseases. On a recent Thursday, five older patients were gathered in the clinic's kitchen for a noon class on diabetes, led by Patricia Bourne, diabetes educator and disease manager.
Ms. Bourne conducts these classes and individual counseling sessions with new patients and those who need special attention. Patients can call her for help, and every month or two, University of Pennsylvania nurses call patients. If a nurse detects a problem, she calls in Ms. Bourne.
"This is very new," said one patient, Audrey Grubman. "I met with Pat on a one-to-one basis in June and July. My doctor told me a lot of these things, but she reinforces it. She keeps it in front of your mind to take better care of yourself."
Dr. Waters says Ms. Bourne is a boon to him, too. He still sees patients in quick 10- and 15-minute visits. "But this allows me to do more of what I'm best at doing," he said. It also pays. Dr. Waters's bonus depends in part on holding down his patients' need for surgery and emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes.
The secret to both improving health and reducing costs, says Dr. David S. Shulkin, the University of Pennsylvania's health system medical director, lies in making good medicine, not cost cutting, the priority. "We're implementing best practices," he said, "and letting the economics sort itself out."
So far, disease management seems to work. Of 1,547 university patients with hypertension, Dr. Shulkin said, only 19 percent had blood pressure readings at or below 140/90 when they enrolled in the program, but 53 percent achieved those levels afterward. Of 1,497 with adult diabetes, 40 percent had safe levels of blood sugar before enrollment; afterward, the figure was 60 percent.
Some management programs that affect large numbers of people, like one for high cholesterol, can cost more to operate than they save. "But when you balance out the winners and losers," Dr. Shulkin said, "it turns out to be a significant cost-saver over all."
Pediatric asthma care seems to be a winner at the university's West Chester clinic. Before Dr. Loev examined Nick Polidore, the resident disease management coordinator and patient educator, Wendy York, retrieved the boy's chart. It had a blue dot for asthma pasted on it, which told her to collect specialized forms to guide Dr. Loev through his examination.
Then Ms. York takes over. "I'd like to get a pulmonary function," she tells Nick. Wiry, weighing about 80 pounds, Nick is a little lethargic three days after a mild attack. He stands, takes a deep breath and blows into a spirometer. His reading is a little worse than his best.
Ms. York counsels him, as she does on each visit, in using inhalers, nebulizers and bronchodilators and in giving himself emergency epinephrine shots to open breathing passages. She has him show her how he blows into a peak flow meter, a plastic pipe that measures his breathing.
Nick has mastered his part in managing his disease. "He's a classic case," Dr. Loev said. "Our emergency room costs are lower. Our hospital costs are lower. Our specialist costs are lower. The patient is much more in control. And the patient who comes in isn't as sick."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
To Neighbors: Stop Trashing And Get Along

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
SINCE Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani unveiled his plan to ship New York's trash across the harbor, New Jersey's politicians have had a wonderful time promising to stop it. They think they can insult New York -- "Drop Dead" was a headline in Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's news release -- and repel our trash barges from their shores without suffering any consequences.
They are naive. New York has a weapon in reserve if they continue the garbage war. But before revealing it, before escalating tensions, let's peacefully reach across the river and try to understand what this fight is all about. 
 It's not about garbage. It's about self-esteem.
New Jerseyans are understandably sensitive about their state's image, which for most outsiders is the one glimpsed along the New Jersey Turnpike: swamps, junkyards, smokestacks and refineries. Unlike New York, where highway builders stupidly intruded on lovely parks and shorelines and neighborhoods, New Jersey's planners had the sense to preserve their scenic areas by running their main highway through the state's underbelly.
It was excellent environmental planning but terrible public relations, which is why New Jerseyans living in beautiful surroundings far from the turnpike must endure taunts from New Yorkers living in squalor. No wonder New Jerseyans' first instinct is to resist any new trash from their tormentors.
But this trash is actually an opportunity for New Jersey to profit at New York's expense. New Jersey would gain jobs and tax revenues from the private companies that would unload the barges, routing some of the trash to a local incinerator (New Jersey's incinerators need more business) and packing the rest in sealed containers for shipment to out-of-state landfills.
New Jersey's politicians worry that New York's garbage would despoil the state's beaches. But the city's barges would be unloaded in new enclosed plants far from any beach, on the old industrial waterfronts of Carteret and Newark. The Newark site is near a garbage incinerator, the Pulaski Skyway and a plot of land contaminated by dioxin from a factory that made Agent Orange. Club Med will not be opening a resort there anytime soon.
NEW JERSEY'S politicians could learn from officials in Virginia who gladly accept trash from both New York and New Jersey. Instead of whining about being a "dumping ground," these politicians have used the revenue from their landfills to lower property taxes and build new schools. When Congress was considering a bill to ban the interstate shipment of trash, these Virginia officials pleaded to keep it flowing.
Of course, it was relatively easy for them, because Virginia does not have New Jersey's image problem. Virginians look down on the rest of America. They can pocket New York's trash money without suffering an identity crisis.
But with a little courage, maybe New Jersey could learn to acquire that same confidence. Imagine if a brave politician announced: "Let's take the boors across the river for everything they've got. New York's garbage money will make the Garden State yet greener! To take trash is not to be trash!"
All right, that is tough to imagine. Maybe there is no stopping this garbage war. But before they go any further, New Jersey's politicians should at least be warned of the weapon at New York's disposal. We too can refuse to be a dumping ground.
Every day, New Jersey's capitalists send trucks across the river with loads of materials destined for our trash heaps. Their farmers inflict fresh blueberries and tomatoes, knowing full well that some of them will rot. Millions of disposable items are sold in New York by companies based in New Jersey -- drugs from Hoffman-LaRoche and Merck, toys from Toys "R" Us, groceries from A.& P. and Pathmark.
Why should we keep buying from economic warriors who think interstate commerce should flow in only one direction? If they won't take our garbage, why should we take their sources of garbage?
New Yorkers would probably be glad to start buying from companies in friendlier states, especially if the boycott gave them an excuse to walk around wearing "I Hate NJ" buttons. That would not be good for New Jersey's industries or its politicians. And it is definitely not going to do anything for their self-esteem.

HEADLINE: Increase Seen in Number of Foreign Students Here

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The number of foreign students attending American colleges and universities is on the rise after four years of stagnation, according to a study released today by the Institute for International Education.
The study, "Open Doors, 1997-98," reports an increase of 5.1 percent for the 1997-98 school year, with a total of 481,280 foreign students now studying in the United States. 
 The study comes on the heels of a report issued in September indicating that although American colleges and universities remain the world leader in attracting foreign students, the United States is losing its dominance in international education.
That report, issued by the United States Information Agency and the Educational Testing Service, showed that five years ago about 40 percent of all international students studied in the United States, whereas in 1996-97 the figure was 32 percent.
The education institute's study used 1997-98 figures, which were not available for inclusion in the September report.
"In a year when we thought there would be no increase, it's genuinely surprising," said Allan Goodman, president of the institute. He pointed to several possible reasons for the increase, including energetic overseas recruitment by American universities and the appeal of the lower cost of two-year community colleges because of the Asian economic crisis.
The institute's study found that foreign enrollment in two-year colleges had jumped 20 percent in the last five years, far outpacing growth in other types of institutions of higher education.
"The first thing that foreign people learn about the American educational system is that it's expensive," Mr. Goodman said. "And now they've discovered that our community colleges are a bargain, costing only one-half to one-tenth as much as the four-year institutions. Foreign students realize they can use those first two years to learn the language and get acclimated to living in the United States, and then they can transfer to a four-year institution."
Fluctuations in the number of foreign students attending colleges in this country are watched carefully by education administrators because many of these students do not seek financial aid and therefore constitute an important source of revenue.
Marianne Craven, deputy director for academic programs at the United States Information Agency, called the new findings encouraging. But she added, "Based on just one year you can't say if it's a trend."

HEADLINE: Downsizing Comes Back, but the Outcry Is Muted

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
When Rhoda Wright learned that the television assembly plant where she had worked for 27 years would close, she did all the right things. She helped to counsel fellow workers through their shock. She used her $13,000 in severance to pay off a car loan. And once the plant shut in April, she enrolled as an accounting student -- hoping to one day get back to her old wage of $10.60 an hour.
But for all her energy and determination, a bleakness creeps into Ms. Wright's story. Her unemployment insurance will run out by next December, six months before she graduates. She expects to land an accounting job quickly enough, even at age 49, but only at $8 an hour. "I don't have a clue anymore what our income is going to be," she said, "but we'll get by. We always have." 
 She has told her two grown daughters not to come to her for help any more. Her big concern is that her husband, Ronald, who is 53 and just back at work as a metal worker after suffering a mild stroke, will fall ill again. "I would probably have to quit school and take one of those $6-an-hour jobs," she said.
Ms. Wright is hardly alone in the difficult choices she must make after losing a job she had counted on to sustain her until retirement. Plant closings, layoffs and forced early retirements are rising sharply again. The cutbacks announced recently at Bankers Trust, Boeing and Johnson & Johnson, and threatened at Exxon and Mobil, are only the latest examples. But the outcries and conflict that characterized the waves of downsizing in the 1980's and early 1990's are largely gone now.
Rather than protest, unions are more likely to help laid-off members make the transition to other jobs, often working in tandem with the very managers who did the laying off. For their part, corporate executives no longer call attention to downsizing as healthy for profits and stock prices. Much more often they express regrets, blame global forces beyond their control, fatten severance packages for workers and announce layoffs well in advance of the final day.
The downsizing is coming just when a strong job market, mainly in the service sector, offers new jobs more quickly than in the past, softening the blow considerably. Unemployment has fallen to 4.4 percent nationally and less than 3 percent in central Indiana. The layoffs are concentrated in manufacturing, both nationally (245,000 jobs have disappeared through layoffs and attrition since March) and here in central Indiana. More than three dozen companies have announced or carried out layoffs here in recent months.
"You would see a more militant and adversarial relationship come back if the unemployment rate were two or three percentage points higher than it is today," said Larry Gigerich, president of the Indianapolis Economic Development Corporation. "There are plenty of unfilled jobs, and although they are at lower pay, people feel they can take them and work back up to their old wage, or they feel that another job will soon open up like the one they lost. Such expectations are not necessarily realistic."
Certainly Ms. Wright is far from regaining her old wage, and so are most of her former colleagues at Thomson Consumer Electronics. Thomson gave 14 months' notice to 1,100 workers that its television plant in nearby Bloomington would be closed last April, and the operation moved to Mexico. Since then, only 100 have matched or bettered their old pay -- at a General Electric Company plant in Bloomington that makes a popular double-door refrigerator and has been adding staff at $10 to $12 an hour. Thomson had paid $10.50 to $11 an hour.
Still, labor unions and workers seem more willing than in the past to accept, as beyond anyone's control, the reasons offered by corporate America for a plant closing or a layoff -- the main reasons lately being the Asian crisis and too much production capacity.
"Let's be realistic," said George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America. "If it is inevitable that a place is going to go down and there is nothing that can be done to save it, if there is no way to compete or there is no market for the product -- if that is going to happen, we are going to negotiate with the company."
Federal subsidies, channeled through the states, also ease the pain, making layoffs seem more routine. The money goes not only for retraining but increasingly for counseling, often on the shop floor right after a layoff is announced. Some of the Federal money pays the wages of labor union staff members involved in retraining. But despite all the help, regaining the old wage rarely happens.
The largest group of former Thomson workers, more than 500, has taken early retirement, accepting lump-sum pension payments of $80,000 or less instead of the $90,000 or more they would have received at full retirement. Ms. Wright is in a group of 200 men and women who are either unemployed or going to school to qualify for new careers, according to the company and the union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. And finally there are 200 ex-Thomson workers who have found new jobs at lower pay.
Many in this group joined Cook Inc., a nonunion shop that makes medical catheters in Bloomington, and pays $6 to $8 an hour. But some, like Martie Hammer, a 46-year-old divorced woman with no children, were more adventuresome.
Ms. Hammer, who drove a forklift at Thomson for 17 years, took a four-month course in truck driving, and now drives a tractor-trailer cross-country for the Celedon Corporation, one of numerous truckers here, all of which seem constantly short of drivers.
Her life has changed. Instead of being home every evening -- she owns a house on the White River near Bloomington -- she is on the road for 10 days, sleeping in a bunk in her tractor cab, then at home for two days. That is a disruption, she says, to her social life. And her pay is less: Not quite $400 a week, compared with her Thomson wage of $424, excluding overtime, which in her case averaged 15 hours a week.
"I don't mind driving a truck," she said. "A lot of people would not do it, but I am trying to get back to where I was at Thomson. It takes away from your self-esteem until you find something as good, or better. You know there has to be something better."
Maybe. Thomson's ex-employees have been engaged in this odyssey to regain their old wages for only eight months. Six hundred former Maytag Corporation employees have been struggling for two years, with little more to show for it. Their Maytag jobs ended in December 1996, when the company closed a stove factory in Indianapolis and, to cut costs and improve efficiency, moved the operation to a nonunion Maytag stove factory in Tennessee.
"We had 400 of the 600 workers placed in jobs in less than a year; we were happy about that," said Mr. Gigerich, who worked with the Private Industry Council, a local group of union and corporate representatives that lent a hand. But today few of the former Maytag workers earn the $34,000 annually they averaged at Maytag.
The best paid, roughly a third of the old work force, earn about $25,000, mostly at the numerous machine tool shops in this area, Mr. Gigerich said. Another group found work at about $22,000 in warehouses and distribution centers, as forklift drivers or loading trucks. And a third group earns about $20,000 in retail stores or at the telephone customer service centers and data processing operations that have proliferated in this area.
In hindsight, the Maytag layoff -- announced in February 1996, nine months before the plant closed -- was a turning point, the first significant example in greater Indianapolis of the softer approach to downsizing. A year earlier, the First Data Corporation, which employed 1,000 people at a telephone service center here, had closed the operation on short notice without first notifying the local government. Downsized workers told hardship stories in television interviews, and city officials were publicly critical.
The officials wanted less confrontation. And Maytag obliged. Apart from the nine-month lead time, Maytag sweetened the severance package beyond what the contract with the Sheet Metal Workers Union required. The company also piled on overtime in the final months to stockpile stoves and to give workers extra money to pay off debts and build up nest eggs -- an opportunity most took. Finally, the company participated in a worker-management committee that supervised retraining and counseling. A $1 million Federal grant financed the endeavor.
"We were trying to tell that work force that you could not have done anything to prevent the move," said Thomas Schwartz, a Maytag spokesman. "That plant closing, and the way we worked with the city, and the employee group, that is as close to a model as I can come up with."
That still leaves Margaret Edens and her husband, Clifford, struggling. Both had worked at Maytag, she assembling stove counters at $12.50 an hour, he repairing damaged stoves at $13.13 an hour. Both lost their jobs. They finished up in a marathon of overtime and then, when the end came, they used some of the accumulated pay to finance a week's vacation in the Southwest -- the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Nev., Monument Valley -- before facing their new, diminished life.
Mrs. Edens, who is 44, is the sort of worker that corporate managers and union officials point to as ideal in a downsizing situation. She is among a minority, they say, with the self-discipline and focus to benefit from job training, and also among a minority with the emotional fortitude to overcome the trauma of losing a pay package she cannot easily replace, and yet get on with life.
After Maytag announced the closing, Mrs. Edens became a union representative on the transition committee. For a while, she drew a Federally subsidized salary as a case manager, counseling laid-off workers, including some from Maytag -- work she loved. Now she is a part-time claims taker in the state employment office, earning $8.05 an hour, without benefits. Her goal is to work full time in the employment office, with benefits, although the pay, she says, will probably be less than what she earned at Maytag.
"We used to make money and our life style just rose," Mrs. Edens said. "Now when I get up, it is, 'How much do we have to earn to get by?' And that is $8 or $9 an hour for each of us just to maintain a middle-of-the-road life. We are just managing to do that."
Clifford Edens, also 44, reacted to the downsizing the way many workers do. He shunned job training or counseling, and did not accept, until months later, that he would probably never match his Maytag earnings and company-paid health insurance. "You work so long for a company, you lose touch with the job market," he said. He had entered the factory in 1972, right out of high school.
Mr. Edens had hoped to shift into social work, but without more schooling, he said, the pay was an "unrealistic" $7.50 an hour at best. He took a job at a Goodwill Industries factory, as a group leader at $9 an hour, helping disabled workers keep an assembly line going. But the work was too stressful and he soon left.
Finally, he learned from a friend of an opening at Flexalloy Inc., as an inspector of the giant bolts and other fasteners the company supplies for bridge and building construction. There was an on-the-job training requirement, and a Federal training grant helped for a while to pay Mr. Edens's starting wage of $9.25 an hour. That was in September of last year; he now earns just over $10, and pays $12 a week for health insurance.
"I am treated very well at this company," Mr. Edens said, allowing himself a little optimism. "There are positions there that pay $13 an hour or more that I could possibly attain."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Media Executive Bullish on Spending

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Fears that economic turmoil in Asia, Brazil and Russia may cause an advertising spending recession in 1999 are "well overdone," according to the head of a leading media services agency.
"The message from our worldwide network is clear: advertisers feel good about the future," said John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, a joint venture of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C. and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. Mr. Perriss is to discuss his predictions this morning at the opening session of the annual Paine Webber media conference in midtown Manhattan. 
 Though worldwide ad spending in 1998 will show the slowest rate of increase since the recession early this decade, Mr. Perriss said in remarks prepared for the conference, growth will accelerate in 1999, 2000 and 2001. He attributed the expected gains to stronger spending by advertisers in Western Europe and North America as well as improvement in Asian markets.

HEADLINE: Big Problem, Big Problems: Getting to Work on Global Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, representatives of more than 150 nations faced a midnight deadline in Kyoto, Japan, for talks on an agreement to cut emissions of the gases that scientists warn may be warming the planet. After delegates caucused, argued, slumped and snored through the night -- and toward lunchtime, a pact was reached when the session's chairman decreed that an important conflict would be dealt with later.
In November of this year, delegates from the same nations gathered in Buenos Aires to set a timetable to carry out the pact. Afterward, delegates were heartened by the progress they had made; they broke up in time for breakfast, with a firm agreement to work a few more years on the pact's biggest obstacles. 
 Such is the current status of the international effort to limit global warming: the work that has been done has produced a consensus that something will come of the Kyoto gathering. But the conflicts that clouded the accord have not grown easier to resolve, and time is racing by.
The United States, long the leading emitter of greenhouses gases, is caught up in this delay. To be sure, the highlight of the Buenos Aires conference was the Clinton Administration's signing of the Kyoto accord. But the American representatives made it clear that they would not submit the agreement to the Senate for approval until many of the Administration's demands are met. Negotiators at the conference settled on an ambitious two-year timetable for resolving those and other sticking points. But that means approval cannot come until after the 2000 elections, if it occurs at all.
"Kyoto is not dead," said Eileen Claussen, a former State Department negotiator who is the executive director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a public-interest group. "But I don't know if this can be done in two years."
Michael Oppenheimer, a climate expert for the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group that favors the treaty, said: "If significant progress is not made by the year 2000, we will never make the 2008 deadlines of the treaty. We have to get the rules in place, or the time will slip away."
Groups representing fossil-fuel producers and users are even more skeptical. "I don't think the protocol is ever going to be ratified," said Connie Holmes, the chairwoman of the Global Climate Coalition, which opposes the agreement. "In about 2001 or 2002, people are going to say, 'My God, we can't do this, let's stretch this thing out.' You need more time if you are going to change as radically as this."
Without the United States on board, the world will not meet the targets of the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for industrial countries to drastically cut their greenhouse gas emissions between 2008 and 2012. The United States is supposed to cut its emissions by more than a third, to a level 7 percent lower than 1990. But the Americans are insisting on commitments from the developing world, and on a complex scheme for trading emissions permits and credits. "On all these issues, the biggest obstacles are political, not technical," Ms. Claussen said. "Technical people could sit down and work out the details. But it all boils down to politics and sovereignty."
Here are the main issues that need to be resolved in the Kyoto Protocol:
 
The Third World's Role
 
PROBLEM: The United States and other developed nations account for about 60 percent of industrial greenhouse gases given off each year. But developing nations, led by China and India, are expected to catch up in about 15 years. By mid-century, they will account for most of the long-term buildup of gases that threaten the climate.
 
SOLUTION: The United States says that the least expensive way to head off global warming may be to cut future emissions in other countries overseas. To entice third-world nations to pursue such a path, America favors a "clean development mechanism," which would give donor nations credit for foreign aid or investments that cut emissions in developing countries.
 
OBSTACLE: China and India are still resisting calls for big developing countries to promise emissions cuts. African and Latin American countries are more interested, but they want guarantees that they will get their share of the aid.
 
OUTLOOK: "The monolithic phalanx that we saw in Kyoto in opposition to any and all participation has completely broken down," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the chief American negotiator. In Buenos Aires, Kazakhstan and Argentina agreed to commit themselves to reductions.
 
International Trading
 
PROBLEM: It will cost a lot of money to control greenhouse gases -- especially on the rapid timetable that the United States is being asked to meet. If these costs are too high, the Senate will not support the treaty.
 
SOLUTION: Many economists say the way to keep costs down is to let countries buy and sell emissions quotas, making the deepest cuts where it is cheapest to do so. The United States would be able to buy its way into compliance with the treaty by paying other industrial countries, like Russia, to cut emissions more than the treaty required.
 
OBSTACLE: European nations are the biggest opponents of unfettered trading in emission credits. They are demanding that the United States achieve at least a majority of its emissions reductions within its own borders. Many third-world nations, too, have objected that it is unfair for rich countries to buy their way out of treaty obligations.
 
OUTLOOK: Mr. Oppenheimer at the Environmental Defense Fund, which favors emissions trading and other market-based pollution controls, says that other nations, realizing how important trading is to the United States, are "holding it hostage" as a bargaining chip. But schisms among developing nations are weakening their resistance, and Europeans are recognizing that they need to make concessions to the Americans if the treaty is to work.
 
Credit for Early Action
 
PROBLEM: Every year that goes by without controls on greenhouse gas emissions makes it harder for the United States and other industrial nations to comply with their targets. Emissions in the United States are currently 10 percent higher than they were in 1990; they rose 1.4 percent in 1997, and the Energy Department expects this trend to continue for another 20 years.
 
SOLUTION: Many companies have already invested in energy saving and other approaches to cut their emissions, or are planning to do so soon. To encourage early reductions, legislation has been introduced to give these companies credits for their reductions, which could be used or sold if binding limits on emissions were imposed.
 
OBSTACLE: Many treaty opponents in Congress have fought policy measures, like tax cuts. They have even fought voluntary steps that suggest back-door implementation of an unratified treaty.
 
OUTLOOK: Big companies, even some that would prefer no binding limits on emissions, are lobbying hard to get credits for early action, just in case. "This is really the one area involving the whole issue of greenhouse gases where I think everybody ought to be able to agree," said Todd Stern, the White House official who coordinates the Administration's climate policy.
Finally, participants are wondering how the American Presidential elections will affect the negotiating timetable -- especially the aspirations of Vice President Al Gore, the world leader most closely associated with the fight against global warming.
"How does the process of moving toward the year 2000 play with the Presidential election campaign, and with President Clinton's known desire to make progress before he leaves office?" Mr. Oppenheimer asked. "Those questions are not imponderable, but they are very big factors, and they make it very hard to figure out where the process will be two years from now."

HEADLINE: Battle Beside the Levee: Hold Back Big Muddy or Let It Roll

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: MAYERSVILLE, Miss.

 BODY:
EVERY day, the runoff from 31 states and two Canadian provinces washes past Juarine Wallace's simple blue house in a drainage ditch that is better known as the Mississippi River. Snow melt, rainwater, agricultural chemicals, ground water -- in all, 41 percent of the runoff in the United States passes en route to New Orleans and, finally, the Gulf of Mexico.
The only guardrail protecting Ms. Wallace's house and the rest of this tiny town from the Mississippi's water highway is a wall of dirt, a levee, which the United States Army Corps of Engineers has deemed eight feet too low to protect against catastrophic floods. So the corps wants to raise the levee not only in Mayersville, the most vulnerable spot along the river, but also along 263 more miles of river running through five states. Each 10-mile stretch will require as much as 1 million dump trucks of dirt. 
 Piling dirt onto dirt seems like fairly dull business, but this project is part of an escalating dispute in the Mississippi Delta over how to coexist with the river. For decades, the corps has been welcomed in the delta, the alluvial plain of rich agricultural soil between Memphis and Vicksburg, Miss. Here, farmers and politicians have considered the corps' flood-control projects as an indispensable line of defense to protect fields and towns.
Now, environmentalists and conservationists nationally and in Mississippi are challenging those projects, promoting an approach to flooding that is radically simple: leaving the river alone. Groups like the National Wildlife Federation want to restore thousands of acres of lost wetlands in the delta by paying farmers (through Federal subsidies) to plant hardwood trees like cottonwoods and oaks on flood-prone crop land. Farmers could harvest the trees every decade or so; conservationists say farmers would also benefit from the sale of hunting and fishing rights to the restored wetlands.
"Some people believe the Mississippi River is a wild river, and there is a certain amount of reverence they have for that wild river," Gerald Barber, the president of the National Wildlife Federation, said. "Then there's another school that considers the Mississippi River a challenge, that it is there to be harnessed."
But the divisions run deeper than a philosophical spat over water policy; they touch on race, class and culture. With a quasi-feudal economy in which an affluent few own much of the land, the delta has been long sundered racially. Although whites dominate the economy, blacks too own land, and both groups scoff at becoming tree farmers. Here in Issaquena County, one of Mississippi's most impoverished, many farmers regard conservationists as yuppie outsiders who want to turn their land into a playground for hunting and fishing camps.
Conservationists like Mr. Barber, who is also a tax assessor in a suburb of Jackson, the state capital, agree that conservationists' ideas would change the delta economy and culture. They say, however, that decades of Federal flood-control projects have benefited mostly wealthy farmers for whom taxpayers have spent billions of dollars to keep their land dry. Flood-control policies, they argue, have therefore damaged the environment and preserved an economic model that provides few jobs and has made the delta one of the nation's poorest regions.
The rhetoric of the debate seems pretty far removed from Mayersville. The town has 70 buildings -- about 40 are trailers -- built on a patch of ground between the levee and cotton fields. The new county jail in the town is about the only industry around.
"Nothing comes here," said Roosevelt White, standing near the levee recently. Mr. White, who is 50 and survives on Federal disability checks, recalled that as a boy he had disobeyed his mother and skipped out after church to watch the corps cut channels through the river to speed water flow. "I've seen the water up on the side of the levee," he said, but he has never seen a flood.
Juarine Wallace has. She was 9 in 1927 when, after months of rain, the river broke through the levee about 35 miles north of Mayersville. A brown sea spilled over the cotton fields of the delta and beyond, snapping cottonwood trees and carrying off dead cows and hogs as if they were fallen leaves. Five hundred people died, and 700,000 were left homeless in what remains the worst flood in the nation's history.
"This place was just covered everywhere with water," said Ms. Wallace, 80, who watched her mother fish for catfish from the front porch. But the water rose and her family had to live for weeks on the levee's high ground. Her neighbor, Beulah Matthews, 86, says she is still "scared of water; I don't put too much water in my bathtub."
Responding to the crisis, Congress authorized the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project in 1928, making flood control a Federal responsibility and cementing the alliance between delta planters and the corps. Seventy-one years later, the corps has spent billions of dollars on projects in the delta like levees, pumping stations, navigation locks and dredging. A master flood-control plan conceived and approved by Congress in 1941 was never completed, and Issaquena County farmers cling to the promise that the plan's remaining projects will be built.
"It's real aggravating to live here and experience the problems we have every year," said Roy Nichols, a partner in the Esperanza Planting Company, which farms 4,400 acres near the river. "We have had high water the last five years in a row."
The seasonal flooding experienced by Mr. Nichols and other farmers is partly caused by flood-control solutions created by the corps. The southern part of the delta is a V-shaped bowl wedged between levees and floodgates built on the Mississippi and its tributary, the Yazoo River. In the spring, rainfall is trapped at the confluence of the rivers at the bowl's southern end, and floodgates prevent the rain from draining into the Mississippi. The long-planned but unfinanced solution is a station to pump rainwater over the floodgates and into the river.
While the farmers' attitudes are shaped by the legacy of the 1927 flood, the 1993 flood resonates with environmentalists. Inundating 15 million acres of farmland and displacing 36,000 people in eight Midwestern states, it never reached the delta. Seizing on the problems of rebuilding in the Mississippi flood plain, environmentalists have pushed for "nonstructural" approaches to controlling its waters -- in essence, getting out of the way. The town of Vermeyer, Ill., population 900, did just that, moving about two miles to a bluff.
Without local support, environmentalists have sought redress in Federal courts. Two years ago, eight environmental and conservation groups sued to stop the levee-raising projects, saying the corps would destroy thousands of acres of wetlands beside the levee to get the needed dirt. Under a consent decree, the corps has improved the way it collects dirt, saying the loss of wetlands from the project will be minimal.
But Melissa Samet, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental legal-defense organization in San Francisco, said plaintiffs in the levee case are planning to take the corps back to court this month, charging that even the new methods would destroy up to 7,600 acres of wetlands. Saying that environmentalists don't oppose raising the levee, Ms. Samet has suggested that the corps dig up farmland instead, a notion that alarms farmers.
THE proposed pumping station, called the Yazoo Backwater Project, may trigger the biggest legal fight of all. Mr. Barber says it will not eliminate seasonal flooding, just reduce it. T. Logan Russell, the president of Delta Land Trust, a nonprofit conservation group in Jackson that restores hardwood wetlands, says it will also shore up what he calls the "third world country" that other flood control projects have helped foster in the delta.
Mr. Russell said that much of the land that floods should never have been planted. He argues instead for the plan to pay farmers to plant hardwoods on this "marginal" land and allowing seasonal flooding to restore the natural wetlands.
Farmers like Clifton Porter say hardwood trees will not grow fast enough in wet conditions, and bristle at the idea of creating wetlands to become recreation havens for city people. Saying that he cannot find "a fair-minded, unbiased environmentalist to come and sit down with us," Mr. Porter insists that without a water pump, "There's nothing you can do in the south delta."
Mr. Russell, a descendant of James Lusk Alcorn, an antebellum Mississippi Governor, disagrees. "This is the last chance for the ecological integrity of the Mississippi Delta," he said. "Build these projects and very little is going to change, and taxpayers are going to be out a lot of money."

HEADLINE: In Peru's Shantytowns, Cholera Comes by the Bucket

BYLINE: By WENDY MARSTON; Wendy Marston is a health and science writer who lives in New York.

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
UP in the Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, a shantytown sprawled over the arid mountainsides south of this city, Natalia Choccna Flores, who is 4, tells a public health official that she has diarrhea. Natalia, with her three siblings, two dogs and a goat in tow, leads the nurse to the place where she went to the bathroom -- directly in front of the family's water tank. The nurse collects the girl's feces in a container, asks about the health of the rest of the family and moves on to the shack next door.
The nurse's weekly visit is part of Peru's strategy of tracking cholera, the bacterial infection that was a global terror for much of the last two centuries. The disease has made a resurgence in South America and through much of the developing world. But cholera is also symptomatic of a larger problem: as population in the developing world surges, poor water quality and limited availability become more pressing. Peru's epidemic, though now mostly under control, foreshadows other health threats. 
 The modern science of epidemiology began when a London doctor, John Snow, tracked an outbreak to the Broad Street pump and ended the epidemic by removing its handle. Cholera and water quality remain intertwined, and scientists are realizing that to fight the disease, they must track the bacterium as it travels across oceans.
But even early warnings may not be enough. Ismail Serageldin, the vice president for environmentally sustainable development at the World Bank, says that water issues have reached a crisis, and they will worsen without drastic measures.
"Already, we have over a billion people with no access to clean water, and about 1.7 billion with no access to sanitation services," Mr. Serageldin said in a telephone interview while on business in France. "Before the population stabilizes, there will be three billion more people on the planet, and almost all of them will be in cities in developing countries."
Cholera, which is transmitted through tainted water and uncooked food and causes acute diarrhea, severe dehydration and, occasionally, death, finds its niche in areas with rapid population growth, poor infrastructure and lack of government resources. The disease came to Peru in January 1991, most likely in a Chinese ship that dumped its sewage into the bay. Within three weeks, cholera spread up and down the coast. Three months later, about 1 percent of Peru's population had the disease. The disease has since spread south to Chile and north to Mexico. The World Health Organization has recently reported outbreaks in Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras as a result of the disruption to water supplies wreaked by Hurricane Mitch.
Peru was an ideal target for cholera, vulnerable because of its coastal location and its poor water system. (The same cholera bacteria have been found in the Chesapeake Bay, for instance, but the water infrastructure in the United States makes an outbreak virtually unthinkable.) In 1991, there was little chlorination in Peru; even today the water system frequently shuts down and existing pipes don't reach all areas. Water pressure often drops, allowing pipes to take in sewage from lines nearby.
One of the most exposed areas is the Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, a neighborhood of rural people new to Lima, who live in houses without running water and use the outhouses that dot the hillsides above. Perched on the top of each hill are concrete water tanks emblazoned with the sign: "Agua Es Vida. Cuidala," or Water Is Life. Take Care of It.
In a situation common to most of the developing world, families in the Pampas use 10 times less water than families with running water but pay nearly five times more for it, and are forced to store it in private cisterns or garbage cans. Most pay $1.50 for about 20 gallons a week to use for their entire family. The dearth of water contributes to the health problem. "Sanitation is always the first thing to go," said Robert Gilman, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University who has worked in Lima for the last eight years. Compounding the problem is the presence of farm animals.
"Cholera is a scary thing," Mr. Gilman, said. "The toxin produced by the bacteria makes the pump in your body switch, and pump everything out instead of in, so you can't take in any water and you go into shock. Twelve hours ago you were fine, and now you are lying on the floor." But treatment is simple: oral rehydration, or in extreme cases, intravenous rehydration and antibiotics.
During the first year of Peru's epidemic, there were 320,000 cases and 2,902 deaths. The 1997-1998 cholera season had 34,000 cases and 265 deaths.
Peru responded quickly to the first outbreak, converting entire sections of urban hospitals into cholera wards. Mr. Gilman said: "In a way, cholera came here at a great time. There was already a clear understanding of how to treat it. It's a true success story."
To stay ahead of the next outbreak, Mr. Gilman's team monitors the presence of the disease in the population and the bacteria in the sewer system. Neither has been found so far in this year's rainy season, although health workers predict that within weeks that will change. The approach ideally allows a month's warning before an epidemic.
While Mr. Gilman follows cholera by land, Rita Colwell, a marine microbiologist who this year became the director of the National Science Foundation, follows it by sea, before it can become a health issue.
Until recently, scientists thought that Vibrio cholera, the bacterium that causes the disease, lives only a few days outside the human intestine.
Dr. Colwell's work makes it clear that cholera is more complicated and durable than experts thought, but it also offers clues as to how the bacteria can be traced.
Her research team takes samples from the sea and from fresh water in Peru. "When the sea surface warms, the plankton blooms," Dr. Colwell said. "Cholera bacteria are part of natural ecology; they are in the environment, and this wasn't accepted by the medical community for years. They thought it was person to person, but it is much more complicated than that."
During the rainy season, plankton and bacteria are carried up rivers from the sea, contaminating the water supply. People drink the water, get sick and recontaminate their water. The disease gains momentum.
Since sewage in poorer countries flows back into the ocean, there is an endless supply of the bacteria in sea water, continuing the cycle. "This is a practice that will have to be rectified," Dr. Colwell said. "Water is going to be the most important resource in the next century."

HEADLINE: Between Two West Coast Cities, a Duel to the Last Drop

BYLINE: By BRIAN ALEXANDER; Brian Alexander, based in San Diego, frequently writes about evironmental matters.

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
IF Pirandello had written a play about water, he might have set it in a place where the London Bridge looms in one of the driest deserts on earth, where a $250-million water plant was built to desalt a supposedly freshwater river, and where huge pipes, like giant silver straws, rush water to gleaming cities hundreds of miles away.
In other words, Pirandello might have set his play near the Colorado River, where fights over water have provided a real-life theater of the absurd for years. States, cities and agricultural districts are trapped in this world through a Byzantine set of agreements, court decisions and legislation known as the law of the river, which has been hammered out, sometimes after guns were drawn, over the last 75 years. Today, it is difficult to find anyone in the seven states governed by the law who thinks it is fair or that it reflects late-20th-century reality. At the same time, no one is willing to toss it out and start over. 
 "I do not think it is the work of our generation to try to revisit this river constitution" is how Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt puts it.
Rather than changing the water rights outlined by the law of the river, Mr. Babbitt favors allowing those areas with water rights to sell, lease or trade them to those that want or need more. Such markets, his argument goes, will help water, which is often artificially cheap, find its true price and will encourage conservation.
The Secretary may be right, but when the city of San Diego put that notion to the test, a nasty, two-year feud with Los Angeles ensued. It is a quarrel that could serve as an object lesson in the kind of paranoia, civic posturing and heated rhetoric that frequently accompanies water disputes in this part of the country.
The feud began as a straightforward deal. San Diego wanted water -- more precisely, it wanted control of its source of water. The Imperial Irrigation District in the Imperial Valley, the largest user of the Colorado River, had so much water that it was apparently wasting it. So, in 1996, the two agreed that San Diego would buy water from Imperial, and Imperial would spend the money on conservation measures. It looked like a win-win arrangement -- but when it comes to Colorado River water, there is no such thing as win-win.
San Diego has long felt it has lived in the shadow of the larger metropolis to the north, Los Angeles. When it comes to water, that perception is accurate. Though San Diego considered taking its own supply of Colorado River water over the mountains years ago, fate interceded in 1941 when the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District of Southern California finished its aqueduct, which is about 240 miles from the river.
At the instigation of the United States Navy, which was anchoring a major part of its fleet here, San Diego joined Metropolitan as a member in 1946. Today, with 27 members, the state-chartered Metropolitan is the largest supplier of water in the United States, serving about 16 million people in six Southern California counties. San Diego, which imports up to 95 percent of its water, is by far the biggest customer.
This has not made allies of the two cities. For one, votes on Metropolitan's board are weighted in favor of Los Angeles, which has an independent water supply from the Owens Valley in the Sierra Nevada foothills hundreds of miles north of the city, and does not use its full allocation of Metropolitan water. Therefore, Metropolitan has been able to sell the water to other users, which has kept the district's coffers full and has expanded both its system and its power. San Diegans, whose city has grown on borrowed water, have known that in the event of a shortage, Los Angeles could cut the flow.
"In the chamber of commerce in Los Angeles, they would tell C.E.O.'s looking to locate in Southern California that even though San Diego is a nice place, they do not have any water," said Joseph Parker, the incoming chairman of the San Diego County Water Authority. (He starts on Jan. 1.)
The Los Angeles chamber of commerce denies this, and representatives of the Metropolitan District point out that the agency has never cut off San Diego's supply. David S. Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, calls San Diego's concern "a red herring to rally the troops around."
In 1991, however, which was a drought year, Metropolitan came very close to causing a virtual shutdown of San Diego's economy when it announced that the city's water supply would be cut in half. Fortunately for San Diego, a series of rains ended the threat.
But after that, San Diego sought a source of water it could control and found it on the desert farms of the Imperial Valley, in the southeast corner of California. The Imperial district agreed to sell water to San Diego for $233 an acre-foot (about 360,000 gallons, or enough to cover one acre to a depth of one foot), not a bad markup on water for which Imperial pays the Federal Government an administration fee of 25 cents an acre-foot. It was also a good deal for San Diego, which pays Metropolitan $349 an acre-foot.
The agreement was applauded by the seven Colorado River states (besides California, these are Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming) and by Mr. Babbitt's office. But Metropolitan was furious. Along with the other desert irrigation districts that tap the Colorado, its board thought it had a right to any water saved by Imperial. And if San Diego stopped buying so much water from Metropolitan, it would mean a loss of income.
So, Metropolitan unleashed a legal and public relations blitz. It advised local black civic leaders that Mr. Parker, who is African-American and was then the vice-chairman, was being passed over for the chairmanship of the San Diego authority. Metropolitan, which regarded Mr. Parker as more conciliatory than Christine Frahm, the outgoing San Diego water chairwoman, "wanted to make a big racial issue out of it," Mr. Parker said.
Metropolitan also had a more direct card to play, since the water was not going to be physically shipped from the Imperial Valley to San Diego, but instead would be flowing from the Colorado -- through Metropolitan's pipes. So the agency tried to impose a charge for transporting the water to San Diego that would turn the deal into a money loser. A state court judge threw out the plan.
Such tactics led to an investigation -- still going on -- by the state legislature. Metropolitan's chief of operations, Jay Malinowski, said that while "some cheap shots were taken at Metropolitan, it is undeniable the district's reputation was damaged" by its strategy. On Aug. 12, it agreed to deliver the Imperial water to San Diego.
Mr. Babbitt calls the San Diego-Imperial arrangement a major achievement, but cautions that the deal is not done. The Coachella Irrigation District, next to Imperial, has threatened to sue to stop it, arguing that it should receive water that Imperial does not use. And Patricia Mulroy, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water District, says that a provision allowing Metropolitan to continue to take more river water than it is entitled to is "a choker" for the other Colorado user states.
"Everything relates to everything else," Mr. Babbitt said wearily, referring to his own negotiations to settle disputes within California over the Sacramento River delta, the state's water hub.
"The delta process affects entitlements to Southern California," he said, "which in turn relates to their demands for Colorado River water, which in turn relates to river regulation, which in turn relates to river issues in Colorado and Wyoming."
Mr. Babbitt said that feuds like the one between San Diego and Los Angeles "are about history, political concepts, a lack of flexibility in institutions and local pride, rather than reality."
"With so much water in the system," he said, "if we move in a rational and coordinated way, there will be no serious long-term economic impacts."
But he admits that he has not seen much rationality or coordination so far.
"We are getting there," he said with a sigh, "but it is trench warfare."

HEADLINE: Soaring Prices Spur a Revolt in Scientific Publishing

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
Esoteric and highly technical, scientific journals have never been viewed as a hot publication market. In recent years, however, scientific journals have become big business, with large commercial publishers entering a scene once dominated by nonprofit scientific societies whose only goal was to disseminate scientific information. It is a change that many academics say has sent prices skyrocketing -- with some journals now costing libraries more than $15,000 a year.
But scientists, whose universities are often unable to afford the very journals to which they are giving their research findings, are now teaming up with irate librarians to fight back. They are creating their own journals to compete with expensive commercial publications, and offering them at one-half to one-twentieth the price. 
 Fomenting this revolution is Sparc, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, a group of more than 100 major research libraries helping these rebel journals get established by committing to buy them.
Many of the new journals are coming out of scientific societies, but the poster child of the movement is Evolutionary Ecology Research. It was created by a professor who was so fed up with the price increases of commercial publishers that he abandoned a journal he helped create, starting the new journal with his own money and the editorial assistance of his wife.
"The original deal was that the journal would be available as inexpensively as possible," said Dr. Michael Rosenzweig, a professor at the University of Arizona whose entire board of editors defected along with him. "This has got to stop."
Although the battle is being fought over subscription prices, what is really at stake, researchers say, is the scientific process itself, which depends so heavily on the ready exchange of scientific information.
"These prices have been a complete disaster," said Ken Frazier, director of the general library system at the University of Wisconsin and chairman of Sparc's steering committee. With many journal prices increasing 20 to 30 percent a year, Mr. Frazier said his libraries were forced to drop half their physics journals in the last decade.
"How can you repeatedly increase prices and not understand that you're damaging scholarly communications?" he asked. "What must they be thinking?"
Commercial publishers insist, however, that their publications are high quality and remain a good value. "The goal of any business is to make money," said Dr. Peter Sheperd, managing director of Elsevier Science in Switzerland, a division of Reed Elsevier, one of the biggest commercial publishers of scientific journals. "I don't see that as incompatible with serving the needs of scientific communication."
The real problem, many say, is that commercial publishers have discovered they can raise prices with impunity, since universities must buy the most important journals, no matter what the cost. And scientists will continue to publish their best work, even in journals neither they nor their libraries can afford, because prestigious publications are crucial to getting grants, promotion and tenure.
"Commercial publishers began to realize the gold mine that they had and that everything was working to their advantage," said Mary Case, director of the Office of Scholarly Communications at the Association of Research Libraries in Washington.
In fact, researchers say, academia is a paradise for publishers. First the public pays for most scientific research through, for example, the National Science Foundation. Then universities pay the salaries of scientists who do virtually all the writing, reviewing and editing. Universities sometimes even provide free office space to journals. Finally, authors typically sign over their copyright to publishers, who can sometimes bring in many millions of dollars a year in subscriptions for a single high-priced journal -- subscriptions paid by university libraries supported by tax dollars and tuition.
Commenting on the profits being made by commercial publishers, Dr. Mark McCabe, an economist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is one of the few researchers studying this unusual market, said, "It is clearly dramatic."
Librarians say that what happened with Dr. Rosenzweig's journal was typical. Twelve years ago, Dr. Rosenzweig, a professor at the University of Arizona, came up with the idea for the journal Evolutionary Ecology and began publishing it with Chapman & Hall. Then Chapman & Hall was bought by International Thomson Corporation and the journal was then sold to Wolters Kluwer, an international publishing company based in Amsterdam. At each turn, Dr. Rosenzweig said, despite his objections, the price went up and the number of scientists to whom it was available went down.
When Dr. Rosenzweig quit, to found Evolutionary Ecology Research, his entire board of editors came with him. With their backing, Dr. Rosenzweig, who has called the new movement a "slave revolt," said authors had been supportive of his new journal, submitting high-quality manuscripts. Dr. Rosenzweig, who spent Thanksgiving weekend working on the first issue of his new journal with his wife, Carole, said Evolutionary Ecology Research would cost libraries about one-third of the price of the Kluwer journal, which is about to go up to $777 a year. Peter Katz, a lawyer for Kluwer Academic Publishers, declined to discuss the journals, saying he did not want to jeopardize discussions being held between himself and Dr. Rosenzweig's lawyers.
Sparc's other efforts include three new journals from the American Chemical Society and an electronic journal -- a cheaper, quicker form of publication that some say may be Sparc's best hope -- from the Royal Society of Chemistry called PhysChemComm. Selling to libraries for $353 a year, PhysChemComm is intended to compete with Elsevier's Chemical Physics Letters, which costs more than $8,000.
In explaining their higher prices, commercial publishers say they have additional costs that scientific societies do not have, including supporting an international network of offices. They also note that societies receive additional income from members' dues. Publishers are also quick to point out that there can be other reasons for increased prices than merely increasing profits, like increases in the quality or quantity of articles.
But Dr. McCabe said that quite often there was no such explanation. From 1992 to 1996, Dr. McCabe said, there was no increase in the quality or quantity of articles in the journal Brain Research, a publication infamous among librarians for its high cost -- more than $15,000 year -- yet the price of the journal nearly doubled.
"How do you explain the price increase, except as taking advantage of the situation?" Dr. McCabe asked.
And while publishers have suggested that currency exchange rates might explain the rising dollar prices for foreign-produced journals like Brain Research, Dr. McCabe said that fluctuating exchange rates simply did not explain such spiraling prices.
Dr. McCabe said that publishing mergers, however, did result in journal price increases, as did decreasing circulation. That is, when libraries drop high-priced journals, publishers often raise the prices of their other journals even higher in an effort to recover the same revenue from fewer subscribers.
At the moment, there is no sign of prices flagging, and similar pricing practices have already begun showing up in the social sciences and humanities. In the meantime, Mr. Frazier said Sparc would press on, urging libraries and scientists to support the new journals. "If we can demonstrate that we can help the good guys," he said, "then there is hope."

Costumed in Ralph Lauren colonialist garb, slenderized in health clubs, body-sculptured by plastic surgeons and coached on life style by Martha Stewart, ordinary Americans, he says in "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality" (Knopf), are appropriating the trappings of celebrity to carve out prime roles in their own life movie. 
 In the fame-driven future he envisions, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes, but Mr. Gabler, looking every bit the cultural critic (Armani black, stubbly salt-and-pepper whiskers), doesn't seem overly worried. "Anyone who writes seriously about American culture is not in danger of becoming a celebrity," he said.
Still, Mr. Gabler, the author of books on Walter Winchell and Hollywood, does not protest when lunch is arranged at Jean Georges on Central Park West. It is, after all, a locale in Woody Allen's new movie, "Celebrity," featuring Judy Davis, Kenneth Branagh, Joe Mantegna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Bebe Neuwirth, Winona Ryder, Gretchen Mol, Isaac Mizrahi, Erica Jong, Anthony Mason, Andre Gregory, Donald Trump, Donna Hanover and Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco.
Unfortunately, or fortunately, none are in sight this lunchtime as the 48-year-old Mr. Gabler settles onto a banquette and, forgoing wine as too enervating at midday, orders a sparkling water.
"If by my theory the movie never ends," said Mr. Gabler, "right now we're doing the interview scene."
Contemporary American culture may be the first in history to permit its citizens to live entirely within their own manufactured realities, said Mr. Gabler, citing the social historian Daniel J. Boorstin. Increasingly, Mr. Gabler said, Americans are altering their lives to conform to their movie fantasies, whether it means shopping in entertainment zones or vacationing on entertainment farms or retreating completely into richly fabricated cyberidentities on the Internet.
Where once movies were judged by how closely they approximated life, now life is rated by how closely it conforms to the movies. Even celebrity criminals from Timothy McVeigh to the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, and John Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, seemed consumed by how their acts would play for a movie-addicted society, Mr. Gabler said.
News, too, he said, is increasingly packaged as entertainment, with wars and Presidential crises getting pithy rubrics ("Crisis in the Gulf," "White House Under Siege") like movie titles.
"We always thought that politics and economics are the crucial forces of our time, but entertainment is the most inexorable force of the 20th century," Mr. Gabler said, lofting a morsel of chevre-and-salmon mousse in a pastry shell.
"We export it and the world eats it up. It's the best hunger-satisfier that man has ever devised."
Wondering if anything could resist this force, he said, he thought that perhaps Tibetan monks might be immune. But when Mr. Gabler said he ventured the thesis to a friend involved in Tibetan causes, the man laughed. He had once run into the Dalai Lama at the Formosa Cafe, a landmark movie-star haunt in West Hollywood.
A waiter arrives with tureens of spicy carrot soup with shrimp and ceremoniously whisks off the lids. "In the Republic of Entertainment, all are equal," Mr. Gabler said, eyeing the starring dishes. In the life movie, places celebrities go become celebrities themselves.
And what about him? Wasn't he a player in the life movie too? Mr. Gabler did not deny it. "To describe this and not implicate yourself is to be duplicitous," he said. "There's no way you can theorize and say you're not in the movie." But at least, he said, he was acknowledging it.
His life is hardly in the limelight, however. He lives with his wife and two daughters, 11 and 14, year-round in Amagansett, N.Y., venturing into Manhattan only intermittently. He runs seven miles each morning and spends most of his day closeted with his writing, including a forthcoming biography of Walt Disney.
Waiters arrived bearing platters of halibut and clams. Mr. Gabler ordered another sparkling water.
"Life the Movie" follows his two books on popular culture, "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood" (1988) and "Winchell: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity" (1994). The latest book grew out of an essay he wrote, "Now Playing: Real Life, the Movie," for The New York Times Arts & Leisure section in 1991. He waited until he had finished the Winchell book and then spent three years on "Life the Movie," two years longer than he expected.
"Nothing is ever short in my movies," he said, likening his life, too, to a film. "They're like 'Lawrence of Arabia.' " His method is to read omnivorously and keep voluminous notes on index cards, one thought to a card. That way, "as Hitchcock said, by the time you start to shoot the film, it's done," Mr. Gabler said, as the fish course gave way to venison.
Mr. Gabler traces the rise of entertainment culture to the nation's beginnings and an affinity for lowbrow amusements. "Trash was deliberate," he said. "Americans were literate. They chose trash because it was a glorification of the democratic impulse."
So this is bad, right? Not necessarily, Mr. Gabler said, calling his ambiguity the most wrenching part of his survey. In an abrupt turnabout at the end of his book, written amid a continuing yin-yang internal debate, he declines to condemn the trend, citing studies that have found "positive-illusionists" to be in better mental health than realists.
"We can't live without illusions," he said. "If a person can help himself by buying Ralph Lauren pants and Martha Stewart makeovers, what's wrong with that?" He derided what he called an old Marxist mantra: "You don't know how bad you have it."
On the other hand, he said, "there is something to be said for the grief and suffering we go through. Life is traditionally defined not by how pleasant it is but what Isaiah Berlin called 'the grit in the oyster.' "
Still he said, as the meal ended with a pear sorbet and sliced pear, chocolate balls and coffee, "life in which you approximate your dreams is not a bad life."
He anticipates a happy twist to his life movie, too, he said, a scene in which a filmmaker options his book for a documentary, to be called perhaps "Life the Movie, the Movie."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Two forecasters see record spending for ads in 1999, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE light at the end of the tunnel may not be an approaching freight train after all, two respected forecasters of advertising spending predicted yesterday in offering optimistic outlooks for 1999 despite the recent concern about worldwide economic turmoil.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A. in New York, and John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, presented their upbeat assessments at the opening session of the 26th annual Paine Webber Media Conference. The conference, at the McGraw-Hill Building in midtown Manhattan, continues through Friday. 
 The peaks and valleys of advertising expenditures by marketers in the media are carefully followed because they are considered an important gauge of the strength of the economy. The global financial difficulties since the summer -- particularly in Asia, Latin America and Russia -- had thrown into doubt earlier forecasts made by Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss about the robustness of ad spending next year.
But in their presentations, Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss agreed that barring any drastic worsening of the world economies -- particularly disruptions in the United States or Europe -- ad spending ought to reach record levels in 1999. And Mr. Perriss predicted accelerating rates of growth through 2001.
"We think 1999 will be a pretty good year for advertising," Mr. Coen said. "Not as good as 1998, but still a good year."
Even though the percentage gain for 1999 will be the lowest in six years, he added, "the overall trend certainly looks better than any of us thought possible" during the steep stock market slump in late summer.
The primary reason for the improved outlook, said Mr. Coen, who has been tracking advertising and media trends since 1948, is that American consumers "will be in a position to feel fairly secure and spend" as a result of low inflation rates and low unemployment. Ad spending closely tracks consumer spending and as American ad spending goes, so usually goes worldwide ad spending.
Mr. Perriss, who sometimes differs with Mr. Coen in his forecasts, echoed him.
Though "there are some cautionary clouds on the horizon," Mr. Perriss said, "broadly, I'm not going to say anything to contradict Bob's pretty great outlook."
"In September, we were looking for pretty grim times in 1999 and 2000," he added. "Thankfully, I am able to stand here today and say that's not our view."
"We think the very worst has now passed in Asia," Mr. Perriss said. "Nineteen ninety-eight was our 'soft landing' and in 1999 we will go forward virtually everywhere."
Mr. Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $212 billion in the United States next year, an increase of 5.5 percent from the $200.8 billion that he now forecasts for 1998. The 1998 figure represents a 7.1 percent gain from the $187.5 billion spent in 1997.
The 5.5 percent increase for 1999 would be the smallest in percentage terms since a 5.2 percent increase in 1993. Still, advertising as a percentage of gross domestic product in 1999 would reach 2.40 percent. That would set a record, beating the figure of 2.36 percent for 1998. Before this year, the record had been 2.35 percent in 1987 and 1988.
Mr. Coen's figure of $200.8 billion for 1998 marked the third time he had raised his forecast for the year since an original prediction in June 1997 of $196.5 billion. That was increased to $198.4 billion in December 1997 and to $200.3 billion in June. Mr. Coen adjusts his figures every time he makes a semiannual forecast, based on updated data.
Among the national media that Mr. Coen predicted would do particularly well in 1999 are cable television, radio, syndicated television and newspapers. Among the local media, he cited radio and television, fueled by growth in retail advertising from store openings.
Overseas in 1999, Mr. Coen forecasts ad spending of $223.9 billion, up 3.5 percent from a revised figure of $216.3 billion for 1998. The figure for this year marked the third time that Mr. Coen revised downward his total for international ad spending.
The figure of $223.9 billion is lower than a prediction of $228.2 billion made by Mr. Coen in June. That reflects continued ad-spending weakness in countries such as Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea, which he said would offset strength in, say, Hungary and Poland.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for 1999, then, is $435.9 billion, which would represent an increase of 4.5 percent from a revised worldwide total of $417.1 billion in 1998 -- the first time world ad spending has exceeded $400 billion. The 1998 figure marks an increase of 4.9 percent from the $397.5 billion spent in 1997.
Mr. Perriss, who uses a different methodology than Mr. Coen, tracking only major media, said that the Asian economic tumult had caused him to shave about $3 billion off his prediction for 1998 worldwide ad spending, which now totals $300.3 billion, and about $7 billion from his forecast for 1999, which now totals $312.9 billion. Last December, he predicted that the 1998 total would be $317.8 billion and the 1999 total would be $336.8 billion.
Still, he added, his revised forecasts are "pretty optimistic against where we thought things would be" at the deepest point of the summer gloom when "great horrors" were foreseen.
To illustrate that, when Mr. Perriss mentioned Russia, he said, smiling, "That's a word I've hardly heard mentioned in the last six months."
Yet "all forecasts are highly dependent on the United States continuing to grow," Mr. Perriss said. "A hiccup here, a loss of consumer confidence here, and it will change around these forecasts."
The worldwide total of $300.3 billion for 1998 from Mr. Perriss is up only 1.9 percent from the 1997 total of $289.1 billion, which he said was the smallest gain since the recession of the early 1990's. But the gains are then to increase from year to year in constant prices, he added, to 2.2 percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000 ($329.5 billion) and 2.7 percent in 2001 ($348.7 billion).
Among reasons listed by Mr. Perriss for those gains were accelerating economic growth in Continental European nations like Germany and Italy and recoveries in some economically battered Asian markets. There will be a stronger second half in 1999 than a first half, he said, as Asia gradually recovers from the problems of 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Values Rose in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
United States home values rose in the third quarter as low mortgage rates and a growing economy helped home buying and refinancing, a survey by Freddie Mac showed.
The conventional mortgage home price index, which measures both sales prices of existing homes and the appraised values of homes being refinanced, rose at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the three months from July through September. That compares with a rise of 4.2 percent in the second quarter and a 4.9 percent increase in the first three months of the year. 
 "Historically low interest rates and strong labor markets continue to support a healthy housing market," said Amy Crews Cutts, an economist at Freddie Mac, the No. 2 buyer of United States home loans.
Home prices showed the largest regional increase in New England, where they posted an annualized gain of 8.2 percent in the third quarter. Pacific Coast states registered the second-largest third-quarter rise, increasing at a 7.2 percent pace.
The benchmark United States mortgage rate fell last week for a third straight week to the lowest level since early October. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.71 percent from the previous week's 6.78 percent.
Sales of new United States homes rose eight-tenths of a percent in October to an annual rate of 851,000 units, the Commerce Department said.

HEADLINE: Rise Is Reported in Announced Job Cuts

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The number of planned job cuts by United States businesses rose in November from a year earlier, putting the annual total on track for the largest number of planned cuts in five years, a survey showed today.
Announced job cuts rose 9.3 percent last month to 51,642 from 47,241 in November 1997, according to the monthly survey by the employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
 "We could see more pre-Christmas job cutting over the next 15 days, as companies finalize 1999 budgets," John Challenger, the company's chief executive, said.
Among the industries showing the largest rises in planned cuts this year are electronics, industrial goods and computers, the survey showed. So far in 1998, United States businesses have announced plans to cut 574,629 jobs, the firm said, about 40,000 behind 1993's total of 615,189.
But November's total planned dismissals was 43.6 percent below October's 91,531 -- a 33-month high.
Multinational corporations are doing most of the cutting, while hiring by small and midsized companies helped lower the November unemployment rate to 4.4 percent -- just shy of a 28-year low -- from 4.6 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Climbed in October

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
American consumers increased their borrowing in October at the fastest pace in more than two years, providing a solid spending base for holiday sales.
Credit outstanding grew at a 9 percent annual rate, to a seasonally adjusted $1.29 trillion, the Federal Reserve said today. That was up from rates of 4.9 percent in September and 3.9 percent in August. There has not been a faster increase since July 1996. 
 Economists said the gain was significant, coming during a month when Wall Street was in turmoil and the Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates to restore confidence in the economy.
The borrowing helps to explain why the personal savings rate was negative for a second consecutive month -- the first such occurrence on record. The personal savings rate is savings as a percentage of after-tax income. Another factor is that in addition to borrowing more, consumers are spending part of their stock-market gains.
Growth in consumer credit in October was led by a catchall category that includes loans for education, vacations, mobile homes and boats. It shot up at a rate of 19 percent, the most in three months.
Revolving credit, primarily credit cards, advanced at a rate of 8 percent, the fastest in four months.
Auto lending increased at a moderate rate of 3.5 percent after three months of strong gains.
The report does not include home-equity loans.

A Cautionary Note on Mergers: Bigger Does Not Mean Better

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
A year ago, the stock of U.S. Office Products was a star. The company had just reported surging sales and earnings for the quarter. The shares had more than quadrupled since going public two and a half years ago.
It was a magnificent performance from a company selling the mundane: paper clips, note pads and swivel chairs. U.S. Office Products had wanted to be the leader in its field, and so it had followed the lead of much bigger companies in industries as varied as retailing, banks or health care. It bought the competition. To acclaim from investors, U.S. Office Products acquired hundreds of mom-and-pop office supply stores, and in one year, its sales rocketed to $2.8 billion from $702 million. 
 But bigness has lost its luster at U.S. Office Products. Sales growth has slowed, and the company just announced a quarterly loss of 11 cents a share. Its stock has tumbled to nearly half its offering price.
In a month already dominated by mergers of already giant banking and oil companies, not to mention the America Online-Netscape Communications liaison, the story of U.S. Office Products is a small but cautionary one. For even as the executives of Exxon and Mobil and Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust contend that their marriages will create a best of breed, the history of mergers is often not pretty for shareholders.
Although the stocks of some acquirers may rise on the news of a combination, a variety of studies show that over the longer term -- one year or more -- most mergers result in stocks that lag behind those of other companies in their industry. And many mergers result in actual losses for their shareholders.
Furthermore, the odds of shares underperforming in current mergers are almost certain to increase going forward, given today's sky-high stock prices. When the price of premiums to the acquired company's shareholders and the costs of integrating two companies are added, such lofty prices make it almost impossible for these deals to perform.
"In some individual mergers, it could be that size is helpful in meeting world market demand," said Richard Sylla, professor of economics and financial history at New York University's Stern School of Business. "But a lot of history shows us that bigger isn't necessarily better."
The merger wave is particularly risky to shareholders because many deals are not only about what they can deliver to the customers or the shareholders but also about what they provide, directly and indirectly, to top management.
That's because the deals often help executives keep their companies' stock prices high -- at least early on -- by increasing revenues, essentially making the companies grow faster than they could ever have done internally, some analysts and academics contend. And among more aggressive managements, acquisitions allow them to perform accounting that helps make their financial statements appear sounder than they actually are.
That does not mean, of course, that a number of mergers are not driven by necessity. In a world awash with $10-a-barrel oil, for example, combining Exxon and Mobil to cut costs is seen as perhaps the only way an integrated oil company can thrive.
Outside the oil patch, many of today's corporate combinations are necessitated by too much competition. Too many goods produced by nations around the world that are embracing capitalism for the first time means that more and more American companies are finding it hard to increase their sales or profit margins. The solution has been to get bigger, even if it means joining forces with a company that used to be a competitor.
To the degree that mergers reduce excess capacity, they do provide a benefit. But since these combinations also usually involve huge layoffs, these benefits do not come cheaply.
These forces have made 1998 a banner year for mergers. So far this year, 23,926 deals have been announced or completed worldwide for a total value of $2.31 trillion, breaking last year's previous record of $1.6 trillion worth of deals. In 1994, there were 19,166 deals with a value of $560.3 billion, according to the Securities Data Company.
Much of this growing appetite has been whetted by the stock market. Chief executives' obsessions with ever-rising stock prices, and the rewards those stock prices deliver, play an ever larger role in merger mania today, some academics say.
Indeed, today's high-priced stocks make mergers easier than ever. For chief executives faced with slowing internal sales growth, an easy solution is to jump-start revenues by buying another company.
And so, 70 percent of the value of mergers and acquisitions today is made with stock, according to Mark L. Sirower, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. Ten years ago, 90 percent were all-cash deals.
Proof that higher stock prices drive merger activity can also be seen in the value of deals done during September, when the stock market was falling. Then, a mere $51 billion in deals was done, down from about $200 billion a month in the spring.
As merger decisions become driven in part by higher stock prices, it is almost certain that more combinations will fail. For shareholders, that is bad news, given that most mergers of the recent past are already producing dismal returns.
In a study of 100 large deals completed between 1994 and 1997, Mr. Sirower found that two-thirds resulted in immediate and outright losses to shareholders and wound up underperforming their industry peers over the long haul.
The trend is almost identical to one found in a similar study Mr. Sirower did in the 1980's. Even during a bull market, mergers can undermine stock values. A recent study by Mitchell Madison, a consulting firm, found that between 1995 and 1998, a period of great gains for the market over all, stocks of merged banks underperformed their peers 82 percent of the time.
Such rates of failure are likely to increase in the future. Why? Expensive stocks make it even more difficult for executives running the huge combinations to succeed in their marriages.
"Today, acquisitions require more discipline than ever before because of the overall market value of the firms," Mr. Sirower said. "We're looking at companies now that are so highly valued on their own that they already have to run very hard just to stay in place."
Indeed, with price-earnings ratios on many big-capitalization stocks at dizzying heights, investors are clearly expecting great improvements from these companies in the future. Add a takeover premium to these prices and you get expectations that even the most brilliant manager could not hope to meet.
History also gives ominous news to shareholders in today's megamergers. In the past, the larger the target was, the lower the return to the buyer generally was.
"If you overpay for a company that is equal to 1 percent of your overall revenues, whether you overpaid is not going to have a big impact on shareholders," said Eli Ofek, professor of finance at N.Y.U.'s Stern School. "But if you overpay in an Exxon-Mobil case, it will have a huge impact."
Indeed, most acquisitions fail, academics say, because the post-merger business cannot support the price paid to forge the combination.
Consider two cases from 1994. One was Novell's $1.4 billion purchase of a rival software producer, Wordperfect. Less than two years later, Novell sold the company for $200 million to another software maker. Also in 1994, Quaker Oats bought Snapple, a beverage manufacturer, for $1.7 billion. Three years later, Quaker sold its acquisition for $300 million.
One reason that stocks of the acquirer may underperform is that investors realize sheer size by no means translates into higher profits. Take the drug industry, one that America dominates. Three of the biggest drug sellers -- Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson -- have generated earnings below the 16 percent average growth for the group. The two hottest players at the moment are smaller: Schering-Plough, with earnings growth of 22 percent so far this year, and Warner-Lambert, with 41 percent growth.
Bigness also has a habit of thwarting innovation. Consider the great innovation that has transformed the telecommunications industry since the breakup of AT&T in 1982.
Despite the potential burdens of pricey acquisitions, they do, at first, provide another way for executives to keep their stock prices high -- through aggressive accounting tactics that make their financial statements appear to be stronger than they actually are.
"Mergers give companies an opportunity to take very sizable write-offs, creating a camouflage to clean up a lot of things on the balance sheet," said Howard Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville, Md. "Does that drive the acquisition? Probably not, but it doesn't hurt."
Taking sizable write-offs today can make earnings look rosier tomorrow. And some companies use huge restructuring charges that typically accompany mergers as a place to dump regular business expenses, increasing earnings in the process. Since earnings drive stock prices, big write-offs and expense reduction tricks can be mighty valuable in the short term.
Companies sometimes use acquisitions to pick up a new source of revenue. For instance, FPA Medical Management Inc., once the country's third-largest physician management company, agreed in July 1996 to buy some operations of Foundation Health Systems for $220 million. As part of the deal, Foundation Health agreed to pay FPA $26 million a year in so-called guaranteed access payments.
"Rather than adjusting the purchase price, FPA picks it up as a source of revenue," Mr. Schilit said. "Those are the kind of interesting tricks that can happen when companies bundle things with an acquisition. Mergers make it easier for companies to create these smoke screens. As a result, it's more difficult for investors to see write-offs or one-time infusions to revenue."
The tactic used by FPA Medical helped the company for only so long. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July.
Acquisition of another company's revenues can bolster a stock another way, at least temporarily. The bigger a company's market value is -- the stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding -- the more likely that it will attract institutional investors. The huge and growing pools of capital -- pension funds, mutual funds and hedge funds -- need places they can go to generate returns.
If a company has billions of dollars in market value, it means getting in and out of the investment is relatively easy for large investors. And ease of entry and exit is increasingly crucial to these investors.
So the flood of money in gives the stock a boost. But big institutional investors can be fickle and such money can flee the merged company when earnings growth appears to slow.
For the executives in a company being acquired, a merger can mean enormous, instant wealth. For example, Lucio A. Noto, the chairman of Mobil, stands to collect at least $6 million just by leaving if a sale to Exxon goes through and the board approves his "golden parachute" pay package. A company spokesman has said that Mr. Noto's deal to sell Mobil to Exxon was "in the best interests of the company."
But chief executives of the merged companies can also reap a rich reward from an acquisition because their compensation is typically tied to earnings or revenue growth or the performance of the stock.
And a study of 152 companies in 1995, James K. Seward, now a professor at Dartmouth, and James P. Walsh, a professor at the University of Michigan, found that a company was much more likely to be acquired if the chief executive of the concern held a big stock option package.
Graef Crystal, an executive compensation expert, notes that the chiefs of companies being acquired get a nice premium on the shares they hold, plus all their stock options and restricted shares automatically vest and become free to trade. Frosting on the cake: a bonus is typically given that may be the highest ever.
"In the old days, you had hostile takeovers with C.E.O.'s fighting them," Mr. Crystal said. "Now C.E.O.'s are walking around in front of their buildings with sandwich boards that read 'Company for sale, Inquire within.' "

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Swings His Ax (Then Retreats to His Hospital Bed)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 7

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin came to his Kremlin office today just long enough to dismiss four top aides and proclaim that he is retaking control of his Government's skidding tax-collection and crime-fighting agencies.
Then he returned to a Moscow hospital, continuing a recovery from pneumonia that has stretched to 15 days and seemingly rendered him an asterisk in the Kremlin power structure -- at least until now. 
 Oleg N. Sysuyev, a senior aide who often channels Mr. Yeltsin's view of things to reporters and television viewers, told the Itar-Tass news agency later that his boss had other moves in mind, but gave no specifics.
Mr. Yeltsin's official spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said the President gave his staff a blunt explanation for the shake-up. "Things are not going too well," he quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying.
The highest-ranking aide dismissed was Valentin Yumashev, the head of presidential administration, whose job is roughly equivalent to chief of staff in the Washington White House. He was replaced by Nikolai Bordyuzha, a onetime chief of the federal border guards who most recently was secretary of Mr. Yeltsin's top advisory body, the security council.
Mr. Bordyuzha will keep his security council job, an apparent attempt to insure that the defense and security officials on the security council work in lockstep with the rest of the administration.
Mr. Yeltsin, 67, also said that the heads of the federal Justice Ministry and tax-collection agency will now report directly to him instead of to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov. Mr. Yakushkin said the shift was coordinated with Mr. Primakov and does not signal any unhappiness on Mr. Yeltsin's part with his latest second-in-command.
Mr. Yeltsin changes underlings more often than many people change their motor oil, having announced three prime ministers and dismissed countless lesser aides since last spring. Outsiders were reluctant to attach any special importance to the latest dismissals, which were limited to Mr. Yeltsin's inner circle.
The moves nevertheless addressed a rising perception that influence over events here -- social, political and economic -- is slowly slipping from the grasp of the pro-democracy forces that Mr. Yeltsin long represented. In response, Mr. Yeltsin appears to be trying to stanch the bleeding away of his political authority.
The economy continues to work against Mr. Yeltsin. Tax revenues have been slipping since August, forcing the Government to print more rubles, which are worth less.
Officials said today that the central bank pumped 10.5 billion new rubles, or more than $525 million, into the economy last month, triple the rate in October. The ruble traded at 6.3 to the dollar four months ago but dipped below the 20-per-dollar mark today.
Once content just to mock him, the President's many critics in the Communist Party and among nationalist movements have begun testing their own strength lately, to some effect.
Members of both factions have refused to condemn attacks by one Communist in the Parliament on Russian Jews, many of them rich businessmen who have supported the current Government. Some legislators have openly endorsed the attacks, drawing a rebuke from Mr. Yeltsin but little else.
Last week the Communists stunned many Muscovites by proposing to restore to downtown Moscow a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the first head of the despised Cheka secret police, which later became the K.G.B. The Cheka and its successors oversaw the arrest or execution of millions of innocent Russians during Stalin's purges in the 1930's.
The agency also created a forced-labor program that sent Russians to build huge dams and canals, mine gold and perform other state tasks, often under horrific conditions and with high mortality rates. Finally, the agencies created and ran the now-famous gulags in which political opponents and dissidents were imprisoned and forced to work.
The Dzerzhinsky statue, which stood in Lubyanka Square outside K.G.B. headquarters near Red Square, was toppled from its pedestal by celebrants after Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, ordered it removed in 1991. A Communist legislator proposed restoring the statue as an anti-crime symbol, saying it memorialized a man with "cold hands" and a "warm heart."
The resolution eventually passed, and while the statue's future remains uncertain, the vote is widely viewed as evidence of the Yeltsin Government's fading authority.
The country's powerful criminal bands are increasingly brazen, too. The recent assassination of a leading advocate of democracy in the Parliament, Galina Starovoitova, has underscored their efforts to muscle their way from control of business into politics.
Mr. Yeltsin reportedly held a consultation with his daughter and adviser Tatyana Dyachenko, 38, and with Mr. Yumashev before spending three hours at the Kremlin today.
Mr. Yakushkin quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying that his aides' conduct of the battle against corruption and political extremism "undermines trust in presidential authority in general, and that is inadmissible."
"In the present conditions," Mr. Yeltsin was quoted as saying, "power should be concentrated in one hand."

HEADLINE: Amerada Hess Plans Wide Cutbacks

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Amerada Hess Corporation said yesterday that it planned to cut back sharply on capital expenditures, curtail oil exploration and production spending and reduce its work force by 20 percent in this division, resulting in a $150 million quarterly after-tax charge. The New York City-based independent oil and gas company said it would be cutting 400 jobs, or 20 percent of the total work force of about 2,000, in its United States and British exploration and production division.
Hess said the cuts, driven by the sharp decline in oil prices in the last year, would mean a 40 percent drop in planned 1999 exploration and production spending, to $250 million. 
 Hess also said the $150 million after-tax charge was in addition to a $150 million charge announced at the end of October, bringing to $300 million the total charges for the year. Accounting for the rest of the new $150 million charge, Hess said it would take a $77 million charge to reflect the value of fixed-price contracts for oil rigs, which are now worth much less; $35 million to write off a North Sea oilfield that will not now be developed, and $23 million to write off other exploration and production assets.
 Hess also said it would put up for sale oil storage terminals along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and along the Colonial Pipeline in the Southeastern United States.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Rises 37.48 Points as Technology Shares Surge

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index set a record yesterday as stocks rose for a second consecutive session, led by software, computer and telecommunications equipment companies such as Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Lucent Technologies on expectations they will have the fastest earnings growth in the coming months.
"You're seeing a return to leadership among large technology firms," said Eric Wiegand, a money manager in Philadelphia who helps manage $50 billion for the First Union Corporation. Particularly where computers are concerned, he added, "There is good consumer demand out there, and there isn't a lot of inventory." 
 The Nasdaq climbed 37.48 points, or nearly 1.9 percent, to 2,040.64. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.33 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 9,070.47, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.96 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,187.70.
Bonds, meanwhile, gained for the eighth time in nine sessions as a rising dollar and expectations for quiescent inflation bolstered the appeal of Treasuries.
Compaq rose 3, to 41 11/16, and was the session's most active stock, with more than 30 million shares changing hands. Analysts expect Compaq's earnings to almost quadruple next year, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. A glut of personal computers pushed prices down this year and depressed Compaq's earnings, easing the way for it to post big percentage gains in profit next year.
Michael Kwatinetz, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said that PC sales were strong during Thanksgiving week and continued to look bright for next year. He raised his 1999 earnings forecast on Compaq yesterday to $1.75 a share, from $1.70. "Worldwide PC industry demand appears healthy, with strength in Europe and in the U.S.," he said in a report to clients.
I.B.M. shares rose 2 15/16, to 167 3/16, accounting for almost a quarter of the Dow's gain.
The rally extended to all segments of the computer business. Microsoft surged 6 3/16 a share, to 133 9/16, after South Carolina dropped out of the antitrust case against the software giant. William H. Gates, the company's chairman, said yesterday that the Government was trying to destroy his company and bolster its rivals with its case.
Shares of Intel, the world's biggest computer-chip maker, rose 2 5/8, to 118 15/16.
The stock of producers of equipment that link computers into networks also surged. Cisco Systems gained 1 15/16 a share, to 80 3/16. Lucent rose 4 1/4, to 100, adding to the 8.4 percent surge on Friday. Lucent, the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, told some analysts and investors on Friday that demand for its products was strong and that all its major plants were running at capacity.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing posted the biggest decline in the Dow, falling 3 3/16 a share, to 77 1/16, as the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. The company gets more than 50 percent of its revenue overseas, with a big chunk of that coming from Asia.
Warner-Lambert dropped 2 9/16, to 75 7/8, after Federal regulators reported that at least 33 people had died after taking the company's diabetes pill, Rezulin. The treatment is a key drug product for the company.
Oxford Health Plans rose 3 3/16, or 27 percent, to 14 7/8, as analysts said that the managed health care company's new management had been able to hold onto more members than expected while raising premiums. Oxford, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., is trying to turn itself around after problems with its billing system caused it to underestimate its medical costs, leading to more than $900 million in losses during the last five quarters.
Shares of other health maintenance organizations also rose. United Healthcare rose 1 3/16, to 47 15/16; Humana rose 1 5/16, to 20 15/16, and Aetna gained 2 1/2, to 82 1/16.
In the bond market the price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 103 13/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.03 percent, from 5.04 percent on Friday.
Two-year notes declined, pushing yields up two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.46 percent, amid fading hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut this month.
 Bonds received a lift as the dollar posted its biggest gain in four weeks against the yen. A rising dollar makes Treasuries more attractive to foreign investors that will eventually convert their holdings into their home currencies.
Also helping bonds are expectations that sagging prices of oil and other commodities will keep inflation from accelerating, allowing bonds to retain more of their value.
So far this year, 30-year bonds have provided investors returns of about 19.5 percent when price gains and interest are taken into account. That compares with a year-to-date rise of 14.7 percent in the Dow industrials.

HEADLINE: Schroder Tries For Consensus In Fight to Cut Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BONN, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Consensus was long the backbone of Germany's postwar economic boom, and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder set out today to prove that it could form the basis of a fight against the country's cripplingly high unemployment.
With more than four million Germans jobless, or 10.6 percent of the work force, Mr. Schroder summoned labor unions, employers and several members of his Cabinet to a first meeting of a much-vaunted "alliance for jobs." But the alliance looked tentative at best, and its initial achievement little more than a list of good intentions. 
 As global competition has increased, while wage costs remained high here, the economy -- based on both the free market and a high level of social protection -- has frayed. The rich have grown richer, but unemployment has risen to levels not seen since 1945. Mr. Schroder, who took office in October, will be judged largely on his ability to get people back to work.
His chosen method -- elaborate negotiations among unions, employers and politicians -- amounts to an attempt to demonstrate that the German model that has had great difficulty responding to the challenges of the 1990's can be revived.
With the introduction of a common European currency, the euro, now imminent, Mr. Schroder also wants to show that Europe's largest economy can generate employment while preserving a high level of social benefits and avoiding the wholesale deregulation that has helped spur rapid job creation in America.
"The excellent atmosphere at the talks makes me optimistic," Mr. Schroder said after the meeting. "This alliance is necessary to meeting the challenges of an increasingly globalized economy and will prove anything but a flash in the pan."
A statement said the parties, who will meet again next Feb. 25, had agreed to strive to lower labor costs, to reform the broad but costly social welfare system, to create more workplace flexibility, to provide better access to venture capital for small companies and possibly to lower the retirement age, now 65.
All these measures have already been talked about for several years in Germany -- former Chancellor Helmut Kohl started a similar round of meetings in 1996 that led nowhere -- and it was not immediately clear why there should be more success this time. In practice, reform of the pension, health and unemployment systems, the cost of which add more than 40 percent to wage bills, has met strong resistance from unions.
The only concrete steps agreed upon today were to move up tax reforms for small and medium-sized companies to 2000 from 2002 and to create 100,000 training positions for young people. How those positions would be found, and how they would be paid for, was not specified.
A real test of the will to compromise is likely to come in the next few weeks as employers and unions confront each other over wages. IG Metall, the union that has more than 2.7 million members in the auto and engineering industries, has called for a 6.5 percent pay increase.

HEADLINE: 2 Utility Deals Could Speed Consolidation

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Two precedent-setting merger deals were announced yesterday in the American electric power industry that could greatly accelerate the consolidation among utilities. The deals are certain to receive careful regulatory scrutiny.
The proposed takeover of Pacificorp, a major utility in the Northwest, by Scottish Power P.L.C., one of the largest utilities in Britain, would mark the first purchase of a major United States utility by a foreign company. Scottish Power has slashed thousands of jobs at its own operations and analysts expect it to make cuts at Pacificorp. 
 The proposed merger of BEC Energy, the parent of Boston Edison, which serves the Boston area, and Commonwealth Energy System, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., would be the first between adjacent utilities that only transmit and distribute power.
How the combinations would affect consumers is unclear. Some analysts, economists and leaders of consumers groups said yesterday, however, that the combinations could lead to strong new competitors that would become more efficient and eventually be able to pass more savings on to consumers and higher returns to shareholders.
Scottish Power said yesterday that it was acquiring Pacificorp in a stock swap worth $7.9 billion based on Scottish Power's closing price Friday, when its shares cost 675 pence in London. The company said it would pay 2.32 Scottish Power shares for each Pacificorp share, worth about $20.75 at Friday's closing price. Scottish Power's shares fell 66 pence yesterday, to 609 pence, and Pacificorp shares ended down 18.75 cents at $20.5625.
Under the proposed merger of BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy System, the companies will form a new holding company in a transaction valued at $950 million.
BEC shareholders can choose to get one share of Commonwealth Energy stock, or $44.10 in cash, for each share that they own. Commonwealth shareholders can choose between $44.10 in cash or 1.05 shares of the new company for each share they now own.
BEC stock closed yesterday at $41, down $1, and shares of Commonwealth Energy closed at $39.875, up $2.0625.
Robert Rubin, an analyst with Bear, Stearns, said the Scottish Power acquisition of Pacificorp would face "an arduous regulatory process." If it goes through, he said, other large European utilities such as Powergen P.L.C. of Britain and Tractebel of Belgium would likely pursue acquisitions here.
"The difficult part is that it would be precedent setting," said Robert K. Johnson, the executive director of the Electric Consumers Alliance, an umbrella group representing 260 consumer groups around the country. "Who owns essential infrastructure in the United States is an acute issue."
Both transactions will lead to reductions in duplicate staff and offices.
Ian Robinson , the chief executive of Scottish Power, which has cut its staff in the last four years to 5,000, from 10,000, said that reductions in the staff of Pacificorp, based in Portland, Ore., would be a key component of improving efficiency.
Pacificorp, with 1.4 million customers in Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California, has one of the largest transmission systems in the nation and owns coal-fired and geothermal plants that can produce 8,300 megawatts of power. It is one of the biggest sellers of wholesale power in the nation. Earnings have been reduced recently because of losses in trading in the wholesale market, where prices have been very volatile.
Scottish Power was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Pacificorp was advised by Salomon Smith Barney International.
Under a deregulation plan carried out by Massachusetts, BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy have had to sell their generating plants and become companies that only transmit power and service their customers.
Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said that while the merger would lead to further cost savings and a more efficient system, the benefit to customers would depend on how regulators oversaw the utilities.

HEADLINE: Castro Criticizes an Old Friend, Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Fidel Castro has long kept a special place in his heart for Mexico.
In the 1960's, Mexico stood alone among Latin American countries, defying Washington's entreaties to break relations with Communist Cuba. 
 In the first two decades of Mr. Castro's revolution, Mexico was the only major Latin country whose guerrillas he refused to train. Mr. Castro even held his tongue in recent years, as Mexico has mostly abandoned its "anti-Yankee" foreign policy in favor of closer economic integration with the United States.
But last week Mr. Castro suddenly abandoned his discretion.
Addressing an economic conference in Havana, he derided contemporary Mexican policies, criticizing the North American Free Trade Agreement, accusing the Mexican Government of turning its back on the third world and of letting American culture overwhelm Mexican traditions.
"When they ask Mexican children," Mr. Castro said, " 'Who is the father of your country?' it's possible that many don't know."
"But they sure know Mickey Mouse," he added, to the nervous titters of diplomats and economists.
Foreign Minister Rosario Green, who recently made a cordial visit to Havana, called in the Cuban Ambassador, Curbelo Padron, to express "deep puzzlement" over the outburst and called the Mexican envoy in Cuba back here for consultations.
A Congressman from President Ernesto Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, Francisco Javier Santillan Oceguera, called Mr. Castro's remarks an intervention in Mexico's internal affairs.
The president of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress, Julio Faesler, urged Mr. Castro to "keep in mind that we Mexicans feel sorry about the lack of success he's had with his own economic development."
Some analysts suggested that Mr. Castro had aimed his remarks at former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who engineered the Nafta accord. But there was little evidence of that, because Mr. Salinas visited Havana recently and seems to enjoy excellent relations with Mr. Castro.
Other experts suggested that Mr. Castro, sensing the PRI's potential defeat in presidential elections in 2000, was currying favor with opposition parties.
Edelmiro Castellanos, a Cuban journalist here, saw a wider motive, that Mr. Castro was seeking to rebuild bridges to leftists all over Latin America, many of whom have grown disenchanted with him. "His image with the left is in tatters," Mr. Castellanos said.
A Brazilian Socialist, Luiz Inacio da Silva, whose movement has included some of Mr. Castro's most enthusiastic supporters, criticized Mr. Castro this fall because the Cuban has forged cozy relations with the Brazilian Government, which Mr. da Silva views as conservative.
Mr. Castro's backing among prominent Mexican intellectuals has cooled in recent years. A political scientist, Sergio Aguayo, traced leftists' irritation from 1988, when Mr. Castro was one of the few world leaders who supported PRI claims that Mr. Salinas had legitimately won presidential elections.
When Mr. Castro attended Mr. Salinas's inauguration, Mr. Aguayo and other intellectuals were invited to meet him at dinner. Mr. Castro launched into a long monologue about the time that he spent in Mexico in 1956, preparing his insurgency.
"It was an offensive situation," Mr. Aguayo said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Nudges Onstage

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Even as his legal team heads to Capitol Hill to present his defense against impeachment, President Clinton will open a two-day conference on Tuesday morning with an appeal for bipartisanship in shoring up Social Security, a goal that would be a stretch in the most tranquil of political climates.
That this of all weeks is the one bringing together Republicans and Democrats to deal with so highly charged an issue is just one of the complications facing the effort to strengthen Social Security, which will otherwise run short of money as the baby-boom generation retires in coming decades. 
 Democrats are fighting with Democrats over whether they would be repudiating their most deeply held values if they supported a revamped system under which individuals would save and invest for their own retirement. Mr. Clinton, who is hinting that he might support individual-account plans, has to keep an eye both on his own political survival and on how the outcome of the Social Security debate could affect Vice President Al Gore's ambitions for the Presidency.
Then there is the deeply ingrained and well-justified fear among Republicans, nearly all of whom favor individual accounts, that Democrats will find a way to bludgeon them with the issue, as they have so often in the past.
The Administration was advised over the past year by Speaker Newt Gingrich not to make a specific proposal, saying that to do so would draw so much partisan fire that the effort to find a compromise would founder. But with Mr. Gingrich stepping down, Republican leaders are ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. Clinton to put forward his own detailed plan, saying it is up to him to lead on an issue that will almost certainly require politically painful benefit cuts and tax increases.
"He's going to have to show some courage," the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said in an appearance on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" on Sunday.
Mr. Clinton has managed to reach compromises with the Republican-controlled Congress on big ideological issues like balancing the budget. In this case, though, his own party could be a problem. Some prominent Democrats are bucking the party's orthodoxy to argue that individual accounts would allow even low-income workers the opportunity to build wealth in the financial markets.
"There is no more Democratic idea than building a generation of wealthy Americans who participate in our economy rather than feeling isolated from it," Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, one of the Democrats supporting private accounts, said in a speech last week.
Mr. Kerrey warned, though, that those who advocated changing the current system would draw considerable fire from the left. Two days later the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of many liberal leaders who have banded together to oppose individual accounts, suggested that he would mobilize against fellow Democrats as quickly as he would take on Republicans over the issue.
Some Democrats "argue that we must dare to privatize Social Security, that it takes courage to choose moneyed interests over the common good," Mr. Jackson said, maintaining that the real winner in privatization would be Wall Street. "There are adjectives for that choice, but courage is not one of them."
For Mr. Clinton, Social Security is probably a last chance to leave a lasting legacy on domestic policy. Yet Democrats think they can recapture the House in 2000, and some liberals would like to keep Social Security alive as an issue to use against the Republicans. Many of the groups that helped Mr. Clinton and the Democrats in the Congressional elections this year, including organized labor and liberal black groups, are dead set against private accounts.
Should Mr. Clinton endorse private accounts -- and Republicans say he must if he hopes to get legislation through Congress -- then he might give Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, an ideal opportunity to rally support from the left with which to challenge Mr. Gore for the Presidential nomination.
Republicans have their own reasons for wanting to get a deal done. They would like to neutralize the issue before the 2000 election, and to move on to their tax-cutting agenda, which Mr. Clinton has thwarted for the last year by declaring a need to preserve projected Federal budget surpluses until Social Security's problems are addressed.
But Republicans have yet to agree among themselves on the best way to finance individual accounts. Some of them argue that painful steps can be avoided through use of the budget surplus, but others say tax increases and benefit cuts will be necessary to keep the system solvent in the long run.
Both sides understand the limits of bipartisanship.
"I want to see this happen," Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, told a news conference today, repeating his desire to work closely with Mr. Clinton as both of their careers in elected office draw to a close. "This is my last two years in Congress; it is his last two years as President. I would like both of us to be able to leave Washington having saved Social Security."
A reporter quickly asked Mr. Archer if that meant Mr. Clinton should not be impeached until Social Security is saved.
"That," Mr. Archer said, "is another issue."

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: Possible Solutions for Social Security"
Here are the major options to shore up Social Security, with their pros and cons:
 
Individual Investment Accounts
 
PROS -- An opportunity for nearly all workers to build wealth by investing in stocks and bonds. Higher expected rates of return than from the current system. Still receive a guaranteed benefit payment but lower than under the current system.
 
CONS -- Individuals face the risks of financial markets. Unequal benefits depending on investing skill or luck. Costs of administering 140 million accounts would be steep. Would require deep cuts in guaranteed benefits or large tax increases.
 
Government Investment in Stocks
 
PROS -- Much lower administrative costs than individual accounts. Market risks would be spread across income levels and generations. Returns could close a substantial portion of the financial gap facing the system.
 
CONS -- Makes Government a major force in stock market, raising the possibility of Washington's meddling in corporate decisions.
 
Raising the Retirement Age
 
PROS -- Would reflect increased life expectancies. Further increases would keep constant the portion of adult life spent in retirement. Could eliminate some long-term problems.
 
CONS -- Already scheduled to rise gradually over the next two decades, to 67. People who do physical work cannot be expected to continue working longer than they do now. Raising the age would hurt older workers who lose jobs.
 
Raising the Cap on Taxable Earnings
 
PROS -- Raising the amount of income taxed, from the current limit of $68,400, would put much of the burden for fixing Social Security on those who can afford it most. The current cap leaves a greater portion of total earnings untaxed than in the past.
 
CONS -- Amounts to a substantial tax increase. Social Security is already a relatively bad deal for upper-income people, and raising the cap would make it worse.
 
Cutting Cost-of-Living Adjustments
 
PROS -- Many economists think the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation and gives Social Security recipients a bigger increase than is justified.
 
CONS -- Some economists think the Consumer Price Index understates the cost of living for the elderly.
 
Cutting Benefits for the Wealthy
 
PROS -- Places the burden on those who can most afford it, either through tax increases or benefit reductions. Cutting benefits by 30 percent for people with retirement income above $60,000 a year and by 85 percent for people with retirement income over $110,000 a year would eliminate three-quarters of the program's long-term problems.
 
CONS -- A big tax increase. Taxing benefits might unduly hurt people who get high levels of benefits but have little or no other income.

HEADLINE: Dollars Are Weapon of Choice in the War on Bacteria Peril

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER with WILLIAM J. BROAD 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In Russia's scientific despair, the United States has sensed great danger and opportunity.
American officials have been worried about Russia's weapons programs from the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Initially, the focus was on improving security for nuclear weapons and scientists. The germ warfare program was hardly considered. 
 That changed after several top Soviet germ warriors defected to the West and told intelligence officials that Moscow's germ program was far more lethal and ambititious than had been suspected during the cold war.
At the Pentagon's request and with its money, the National Academy of Sciences began a program in 1995 to expand cooperation between Russian and American biologists. Eager to stem the brain drain, discover more about the Soviet germ arsenal, and learn from the Russian strides in germ defenses, the Clinton Administration has now greatly intensified the effort.
In addition, Washington is paying $1.5 million now and plans to spend up to $6 million to upgrade security at Vector, which is Russia's germ bank for all strains of smallpox, which has been eradicated from humans.
While fewer than 120 of the more than 15,000 strains in Vector's virus collection are highly lethal, scientists say any theft or diversion of the most dangerous ones could be catastrophic.
Washington has also persuaded Europe and Japan to join the United States in financing the International Science and Technology Center, based in Moscow, which tries to find peaceful work for former weapons scientists.
Randall L. Beatty, the center's deputy director, said about 1,055 of the 17,800 scientists receiving payments of $300 to $500 a month for joint research are biologists. That proportion has grown sharply from less than 1 percent of the center's payments to about 15 percent this year, and Mr. Beatty said it "will inevitably grow further."
While less than what the Iranians are said to be offering, American officials say the stipends are attractive because they allow Russian scientists, who earn an average of less than $100 a month, to stay in Russia with friends and family and to collaborate with respected Western researchers on peaceful work.
American officials said such contacts and exchanges are providing valuable information about both the Soviet Union's germ activities and the current situation in Russia. "There has been a quantum leap in their openness in the past 18 months," Mr. Beatty said.
The Clinton Administration is spending millions of dollars on more than a dozen programs essentially intended to make former Soviet scientists and research institutes "a better offer" than Iran or other rogue nations, official say.
"It's up to them to chose," said Anne M. Harrington, the State Department's coordinator for threat reduction programs, "and many of them are deciding they want to work with us."
 American officials say the rudimentary programs have already achieved some successes.
*The scientific institute at Obolensk, the heart of the program to produce deadly germs, has had no contact with Teheran since last year when the United States greatly expanded its financial support.
 
 *In the last 10 months close to a hundred Russian scientists from the former Soviet germ warfare program have visited American labs and institutes, and more than a hundred American scientists and officials have visited, many of them regularly, once-closed Russian germ institutes.
 *The Department of Agriculture, at the Pentagon's request, succeeded in buying samples of Uzbekistan's entire collection of plant germs, helping to track strains and create antidotes.
 American officials say that the threat remains significant, and that they are learning every day about new efforts by rogue states to capitalize on Russia's economic crisis and scientific brain drain.
"I'm like the little Dutch boy running around with my fingers in the dike," said a Pentagon official during a recent field trip. "Every time we visit a new Russian institute, we find another Iranian business card."

LIZ CLAIBORNE PLANS TO DOWNSIZE AND CLOSE STORES

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Faced with sagging sales and profits, Liz Claiborne Inc. said yesterday that it would eliminate about 400 jobs, close 30 retail stores and try to improve its ailing business at department stores. The company, the New York-based women's clothing maker, said the restructuring would cost $13 million to $17 million and would reduce the company's fourth-quarter earnings by 20 cents to 26 cents a share. The shares rose $1.3125, to $32.125. The price has slumped from more than $50 this summer.
