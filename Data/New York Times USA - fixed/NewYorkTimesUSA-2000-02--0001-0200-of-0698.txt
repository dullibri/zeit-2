The Seventies Give Nostalgia A Bad Name

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
OF all the decades to get nostalgic about, why the 1970's? You could pick a better era out of a hat.
How can anyone get misty over a decade that gave us Watergate, Kent State, gas lines, economic recession, double-digit inflation, soaring crime rates, Pol Pot, Son of Sam and American hostages in Iran -- not to mention leisure suits, men's ties wider than the Lincoln Tunnel, some of the worst hairstyles since scissors were invented and -- hold your angry letters -- disco? 
 Yet the 70's have slammed into our millennial consciousness with all the subtlety of Charles Bronson blasting his way through "Death Wish," that 1974 Hollywood vision of urban hell.
A stage version of "Saturday Night Fever" is playing on Broadway. Studio 54 is back from the dead. So are lava lamps and bell-bottoms. (Can fondue sets as wedding gifts be far behind?)
Recent movies have explored the 70's in ways satiric and straight. We have had "The Ice Storm," "Boogie Nights," "Summer of Sam," "Man on the Moon" and, for those who wish they still had Nixon to kick around, "Dick." Television has chimed in with "That 70's Show," a Fox sitcom.
Bill Bradley's presidential campaign trades on his fame from his championship seasons with the New York Knicks in the 70's. Even 70's crime is back, now that Michael C. Skakel has been charged in Connecticut with bludgeoning Martha Moxley to death 25 years ago.
Topping all that off -- the glitter ball above the dance floor, so to speak -- the New-York Historical Society opens an exhibition today on one of the lowest points in New York history: the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, which almost tipped the city government into bankruptcy.
The three-month show at the society, on West 77th Street, includes photographs, posters and artifacts from those dark days. Not the least of them is a blowup of the front page of The Daily News from Oct. 30, 1975. Its headline remains one of the greats:
Ford to City:
Drop Dead
In fact, President Gerald R. Ford never quite said that. What he said was that he was prepared to veto any bill that included a federal bailout to keep New York from default. Pretty dry stuff. The News got to the point with more pop than a wad of bubble gum, so much so that millions thought the president had actually uttered those nasty words. Some believe the headline contributed to his political demise a year later, when the voters told him to drop dead.
All right, what gives? Why all this looking back?
"There's a spotlight always focused on the period that is 25 or 30 years before the present," said David Frum, who examines the 70's in a new book, "How We Got Here" (Basic Books). Many find it especially painless to return to the 70's, he suggested, because they now enjoy good times. "We went through a process and came out the other end, and it turned out O.K.," he said.
MR. FRUM, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, the conservative research center, is himself no 70's fan. To him, they were worse than the 60's in transforming America into a less responsible, more hedonistic, less law-abiding and more illiterate society. But he understands why young people may be fascinated with that era.
"If you're 20 now, you must feel like you live in a police state," he said. "The drinking age has been raised. It's harder to buy cigarettes. Drugs are treated savagely, and you're told sex will kill you. Abstinence is in. Schools have metal detectors. So they look back on that time as the golden age of teenage liberty."
For Betsy Gotbaum, president of the historical society, one reason for the fiscal-crisis show is the ticking clock. Those who helped rescue the city then are not exactly kids, including her husband, Victor Gotbaum, the labor leader. The former mayor, Edward I. Koch, she said, had proposed that "we do this while we're all still alive."
That sounds reasonable. Still, it means returning, if briefly, to a time when New York hit bottom -- to the brutal blackout of 1977, garbage strikes, exposes of systemic police corruption and the nightmarish Times Square of "Taxi Driver." Let's not even discuss the Bee Gees.
Those days were not all bad, said Kathleen Hulser, the exhibition's curator. Artists flourished in a city that was far more affordable, she pointed out. Also, Ms. Hulser said, "the 70's were when the idea of public and private partnerships took off."
Quite right. All in all, though, you get the feeling that nostalgia is not what it used to be.

BYLINE: By Terence Neilan

 BODY:

THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: RIGHTIST'S UNITY PLAN -- Canada's leading conservative politician, Preston Manning, embarks this week on a nationwide tour to unite the political right, bolstered by a 75 percent endorsement at the Reform Party convention for his plan to create a new national party, the Canadian Alliance. The Liberal Party has governed Canada on the federal level since 1993, largely because conservatives have been split along regional lines. James Brooke (NYT)
 
CANADA: ONTARIO GETS TOUGH -- Starting Monday, the police in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, can arrest people for aggressive begging and offering to clean windshields at traffic lights. In December, Ontario's Conservative-controlled legislature banned intimidating panhandling after complaints from the mayor of Toronto. It is now illegal to beg anywhere there is a "captive" audience -- at bank machines, bus stops, or in a line of vehicles stopped at a red light. James Brooke (NYT) 

MEXICO: SCHOOL STRIKE PROTESTED -- Several hundred law students opposed to a nine-month strike at the National Autonomous University of Mexico tried to get into the law school by tearing down barricades at the entrance, but were repelled by strikers with rocks and blows. Othon Perez Fernndez, a law professor who encouraged his students to charge the barricades, was knocked out by a rock and briefly hospitalized. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
ECUADOR: TEXACO RULING -- A Manhattan federal judge says he is leaning toward ruling that an environmental lawsuit against Texaco by Ecuadorean Indians should be tried in Ecuador, as Texaco prefers, rather than in the United States. But Judge Jed S. Rakoff, citing Ecuador's recent coup, asked the parties and the Ecuador government for more comment about whether Ecuador's courts "might reasonably be expected to exercise a modicum of independence and impartiality" if the suit was sent back there. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: VATICAN TELLS OF INTIMIDATION -- Beijing has stepped up its intimidation campaign against Catholic clergy loyal to the Pope, the news agency of the Vatican's missionary wing reported. The agency, Fides, said church buildings had been destroyed and priests and bishops abducted in the last three years, including an 80-year-old bishop, James David Lin Xili, who has been missing from Shanghai since September. Beijing recognizes only the official, state-backed church. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
CHINA: 2ND GROUP REPORTED CLOSED -- China has closed down 100 offices of a group with similarities to the banned Falung Gong spiritual movement after declaring it a cult, a rights group based in Hong Kong said. The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said the police began the crackdown last November after President Jiang Zemin attacked the Zhong Gong group, which has more than 10 million practitioners. (Reuters)
 
PAKISTAN: CHALLENGE ADJOURNED -- A constitutional challenge to the army coup in October was adjourned until March 1 by the nation's new chief justice of the Supreme Court, Irshad Hassan Khan. The court's new leader was given the job after his predecessor, like several other judges, refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new military government. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: SWISS AID SOUGHT ON SUHARTO -- Indonesia is preparing to ask Switzerland for new help in tracking down huge sums of money said to have been deposited in Swiss banks by former President Suharto, said the current president, Abdurrahim Wahid. Jarkarta said it is seeking the return of $9 billion thought to have been diverted to the accounts of Mr. Suharto, who has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Suharto's successor, B. J. Habibie, made an initial request for legal help last June. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
FRANCE: TRUCKERS START PROTEST -- Three weeks after their bosses set up blockades to protest the government-imposed shorter workweek, truck drivers retaliated with blockages of their own. The drivers said concessions made by the government had robbed them of some of the main benefits that employees in other sectors would enjoy in the transition from a 39-hour to a 35-hour workweek. The protests, focused on blocking truckers from entering France, are expected to go on for two days. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
NETHERLANDS: BELGRADE LAWYER FINED -- Raising suspicions of Yugoslav meddling in its proceedings, a United Nations war crimes tribunal found a Belgrade lawyer in contempt of court for manipulating witnesses with bribes or other forms of persuasion in the murder trial of Dusan Tadic, a Bosnian Serb sentenced to 20 years in prison. Milan Vujin was fined about $7,000 and barred from appearing before the panel. The ruling lent credibility to allegations that Yugoslavia and Bosnian Serbs had tried to prevent the fingering of higher-ups. (AP)
 
BRITAIN: DOCTOR KILLED 15 WOMEN -- A general practitioner from near Manchester, Dr. Harold Shipman, was given 15 life sentences after he was found guilty of murdering 15 female patients, most of them elderly, with heroin injections. Prosecutors are considering bringing murder charges involving as many as 23 other patients who died in his care. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: UNIONS BEGIN PROTEST -- The Congress of South African Trade Unions began a three-month campaign of lunch and teatime demonstrations and worker forums to highlight the government's failure to create jobs. The campaign, which will not disrupt business for the time being, was kicked off by the South African Textile and Clothing Workers' Union and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa. Some estimates put unemployment as high as 40 percent. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
ZAMBIA: DOCTORS END STRIKE -- Striking public hospital doctors returned to work after a court refused to grant an injunction ordering the government not to fire them. Calling their work stoppage a leave of absence, the senior doctors walked off the job in support of hundreds of striking junior doctors who were fired for protesting hospitals' poor working conditions and lack of drugs. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: TRIAL OF JEWS NEARS -- The trial of 13 Jews accused of espionage will begin in a few weeks, an Iranian radio report said. The decision to start the trial soon was made at a meeting of senior judicial officials led by the judiciary chief, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, Tehran's Radio Payam quoted a spokesman as saying. If convicted, the suspects could face the death penalty. (AP)
 
CYPRUS: TALKS WITH ANNAN BEGIN -- Leaders of the divided island began negotiating separately with Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations in an attempt to break a long-running impasse between Greece and Turkey. The two sides never met. First, the Greek Cypriot delegation trooped into the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva to meet with Mr. Annan. Then the Turkish Cypriot delegates arrived, led by Rauf Denktash, above. Mr. Annan said he thought a deal could be reached within the year. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)

HEADLINE: Consumers Kept Spending In December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose in December at the fastest rate in four months, a sign that the economy may be picking up speed as it nears a record for the longest expansion in the nation's history.
Spending grew 0.8 percent in December after rising 0.7 percent in November, the Commerce Department said. That helped lift the increase for 1999 to a 10-year high of 6.9 percent, after a 5.9 percent gain during 1998. 
 "Spending growth has been strong and it looks to be strong unless the stock market comes unglued" or Federal Reserve policy makers continue to raise interest rates in multiple steps, said Greg Jones, chief economist at Briefing.com in Jackson, Wyo.
Incomes rose 0.3 percent in December after climbing 0.4 percent in November. For all of 1999, incomes rose 5.9 percent, the same as a year earlier.
A separate report by Chicago-area purchasing executives suggested that the regional manufacturing economy grew for the 12th consecutive month. While the January index issued by the Chicago affiliate of the National Association of Purchasing Management showed it slipped to 55.6 from 56 the month before, readings higher than 50 indicate businesses are expanding.
The reports give the last snapshots of the economy before Fed policy makers begin two days of meetings on Tuesday to determine how much to raise interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and keep inflation in check.
January is the 106th month of economic expansion, matching the record.
The report showed that last year's spending gains were led by a 7.7 percent increase in demand for nondurable goods like clothing or food. It was the largest yearly increase for that category since 1981.
In December, spending on non-durable goods rose 1.3 percent, the largest monthly gain since February 1994. Spending on durable goods like cars, computers and washing machines rose 0.8 percent in December after increasing 2.2 percent in November. For the year, spending on durable goods rose 8.6 percent, the same as in 1998.
The Commerce Department report also showed that the nation's savings rate fell to record lows for the month and for the year. The December savings rate of 1.5 percent was down from 2 percent in November. The annual savings rate declined to 2.4 percent, from 3.7 percent in 1998.
Signs point to continued increases in spending. Two consumer sentiment indexes rose to record highs this month, and jobs remained easy to find, recent reports showed.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent in December, more than the 0.1 percent increase in November. Average weekly earnings rose to $464.37 in December from $462.30 a month earlier.

HEADLINE: A Citizenship Incubator for Immigrant Latinos

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif., Jan. 28

 BODY:
At one time, Pacific Boulevard was where the residents of this hip-pocket city in southeast of downtown Los Angeles came to realize their fondest middle-class desires. The boulevard was the apotheosis of the postwar California dream, an all-white working-class Beverly Hills with swank department stores, auto dealerships and first-run cinemas.
Jack Zagha recently sat in the home-furnishings store his family has run on Pacific Boulevard for nearly 50 years and recalled those days as so distant as to be almost an illusion, all but blotted out by memories of how white flight and indoor shopping malls later turned the once-vital street into a cliche of urban despair. Then he interrupted his reverie to exchange a few words in Spanish with a busy sales clerk and marvel at the new California dream taking shape around the racks of towels, curtains and bedspreads. 
 Today, thick crowds again stroll past his store, the Home Shop, but they rarely get past the maze of $2 and $5 tables clustered near the doors. The steady flow of sales is transacted almost entirely in cash. Conversations are in Spanish, still carrying the accents of the regions in Mexico from which most of Huntington Park's new residents emigrated.
"We're still in business, but just about everything else has changed," Mr. Zagha said. "Times aren't bad."
If there is a vantage from which to observe the concluding chapters of Los Angeles's transformation into the country's largest Hispanic-dominated metropolis, Huntington Park may be it. It provides a glimpse into the region's rapid ethnic makeover not because it is a reflection of the city as it will be, but because it is the gateway to that future.
Indeed, Huntington Park is not a perfect mirror of the Los Angeles region; incomes are generally lower and it is far more homogeneous -- it is close to 100 percent Hispanic -- than the diverse, increasingly affluent neighborhoods in the surrounding areas. But it plays a central role in the region because it is one of several neighborhoods where Mexican immigrants often come first, one of the places where they begin their pursuit of the dream that brought many here, a middle-class way of life. Huntington Park has become a sort of citizenship incubator.
And the impact is being felt. As of 1998, Los Angeles County had 9.6 million residents, of which 44 percent were Hispanic and 33.5 percent non-Hispanic white. Government experts predict that in 2010 the Hispanic population will make up slightly more than half of the expected population of 10.6 million.
"What you learn from looking at a place like Huntington Park, and I'm not sure people appreciate this, is how upwardly mobile most Latinos are," said Jack Kyser, the chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization. "This city is where the newcomers learn how to do that. It is a stepping stone into the future of Los Angeles, and that's not something you would have expected if you looked at the city a couple of decades ago."
Jose Legaspi, a major real estate broker and developer in this part of Los Angeles, added: "This is a point of entry for the Latino population in Los Angeles, not a destination. This is where the education begins for a lot of people. Huntington Park has been where people aspiring to the middle class get a leg up."
Decades ago, Huntington Park thrived because it was the terminus of an electric streetcar line -- since shut down -- and had a wide downtown boulevard that attracted shoppers from all over the region. It was where people, many of them white immigrants from the Midwest, spent weekend afternoons.
It was, however, a residential oasis amid one of the most heavily industrialized areas of Los Angeles County. Just to the west was the Watts section of Los Angeles, which was traditionally a large, and largely poor black community resting, literally, on the other side of a double set of railroad tracks that for years defined the borders of ethnic peace.
Then 30 to 40 years ago Huntington Park went into a steep decline, a victim of industrial cutbacks, white families' nervously fleeing the proximity to a suddenly restive black community and the devastation on the boulevard caused by the emergence of indoor shopping malls. When the car dealerships left, the city's tax base went into a tailspin.
Tom Jackson, a resident for more than 40 years and a City Council member for 31 years, said that many white families left reluctantly but that when they did were often more inclined to find Hispanic home buyers, rather than black ones. "You're talking about 30,000 people who just pulled up and left," Mr. Jackson said. "It was a racism thing."
Huntington Park's subsequent phoenix-like rise has taken off with the soaring numbers of immigrants from Mexico. The city, which covers a little more than three square miles, saw its population swell to more than 70,000 people today from about 30,000 people two decades ago. It is perhaps 98 percent Latino. (Even nearby Watts is now dominated by Latinos, not blacks.)
The median age, which had risen to more than 60 in the 1970's, is now about 24, the city estimates. Reflecting its working-class status, the city's median household income is about $28,000 a year, below the county's average of $40,300. Its main elementary school and middle school each has more than 4,000 students. Pacific Boulevard It has become a cut-rate retail bazaar of shoe stores, dress shops, travel agencies, taquerias and dental clinics.
"The boulevard is back again, even better than it used to be," said Frank MacLean, the president of the local merchants association.
Elena Martin, who said she had been a resident for six years, was strolling with her three young children on Pacific Boulevard recently, looking at the ostrich-skin cowboy boots she said her husband coveted, but probably would not buy. She said she had little interest in malls, in part because she has to rely on public transit and in part because she did not feel at home at them.
Jacob Givertz, who has owned a clothing store, Buy Rite, on the boulevard since 1974, agreed that the immigrants had provided a solid new retail base. "I don't think the malls are competition for me," he said. "This boulevard reminds them of the way things were in the old country."
Rosario Marin, the city's mayor, said: "The people who move here are often new arrivals, but they really want to make it. Truthfully, they don't want to stay here. It's their first stop."
Still, Mayor Marin conceded, the city's transformation has also created enormous challenges.
Ms. Marin estimated that perhaps 40 percent of the population consisted of people who had lived in the country less than 10 years and that perhaps 20 percent were here illegally. That means that few vote, and many shield themselves from the authorities.
The number of new immigrants has also created enormous challenges for the city's schools. Ms. Marin said roughly 60 percent of the parents of the children in the city's schools read English at a level of third grade or lower.
"We've become a safe harbor for new immigrants, a place where they can come and feel at home right away," she said. "When it's time to move on, they move on, but I hope they remember Huntington Park and what they got from this place."

1 Davos, 3 Seattles

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DAVOS , Switzerland

 BODY:
Every year at the World Economic Forum there is a star or theme that stands out. The star of Davos 2000 was, without question, Seattle. Seattle was talked about everywhere. The only problem was that the business and government leaders here were actually talking about three different Seattles -- the Seattle that is afraid of the future, the Seattle that is demanding a slice of the future and the Seattle that is building the future.
All three were at play here, and it is important not to forget that, because there are some activists and politicians who want you to believe that there is only one Seattle that counts -- the Seattle of protesters against trade and globalization and the World Trade Organization, who trashed Seattle last November. Nonsense. 
 Yes, the Seattle of the backlash against globalization is real. This backlash was spearheaded, and financed, by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the steelworkers and dockworkers, who oppose more free trade because it means a churning of jobs. Alongside these unions in the streets of Seattle were many serious environmentalists, who are legitimately concerned about what more trade means for turtles and trees. But the environmentalists and the unions -- and the stone-throwing anarchists who joined them -- are not organic allies, with a shared agenda. (God save any turtle that gets in the way of the dockworkers unloading a boat. You wouldn't want to be that turtle.)
The unions that drove this first Seattle want you to think that they represent the world and the poor, and that they are all rising against free trade. Oh, really? Africa is begging to increase its textile exports to the U.S., and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is blocking the African trade initiative. Why? Because Africa might increase its share of total U.S. textile imports from its current level of 0.8 percent. The notion that this first Seattle represents all the downtrodden is a pure fraud.
Just ask the second Seattle. This was the Seattle of the populous developing countries -- India, Mexico, China -- who know that the reason they have all grown so fast lately is because of trade and foreign investment. They came to Seattle not to wreck the W.T.O. but to get a better deal from it, and they resent the protesters who want to keep them out by imposing impossible labor and environmental standards. Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, denounced these "globophobics -- a curious alliance of forces from the extreme left, environmentalists and other self-appointed critics in a common endeavor to save the people of developing countries from development."
Egypt's economy minister, Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who was in Seattle, said: "The world was not represented on the streets of Seattle. The truth is, most of the world's population was inside the conference room in Seattle, not outside. It was developing countries, like us, who want a fairer share of the pie, not to destroy the pie. I can't grow unless I integrate with the global economy, but the trade rules by the developed countries are unfair. . . . We open to you, but you don't open to us."
The third Seattle was the Seattle of Amazon.com, Microsoft and the Internet revolution. This high-tech Seattle is creating an enormous number of jobs, and has captured the imagination of youth all over the world, but it has also terrified every C.E.O. Internet commerce has been described as "Darwinism on steroids." And John Chambers, head of Cisco Systems, unnerved a packed hall in Davos of business execs from Europe and the developing world by telling them that survival in such a world required radical restructuring and moving their companies online -- from customer service, to relations with suppliers, to in-house education. If you haven't started yet, said Mr. Chambers, it's probably too late. You're soon to be road kill. His speech was delivered at Net speed, and so convincingly that the moderator promised the wide-eyed audience to play back the tape of his lecture at half speed.
As I said, there are three Seattles -- those who want to slow down the world so they can get off, those who want to slow down the world so they can get on, and those who want to speed up the world so they can stay ahead. Can they live together? Only if there is real dialogue and hard trade-offs, and only if there is a recognition that the moral high ground isn't the monopoly of just one Seattle.

HEADLINE: Ads Lift Gannett Profit by 14%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Gannett Company, the largest newspaper publisher in the United States, said here today that fourth-quarter profit increased 14 percent, spurred by more growth in advertising sales at USA Today.
Gannett, which also owns 21 television stations, said profit from continuing operations rose to $284 million, or $1.01 a share, from $248.9 million, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 13 percent, to $1.50 billion from $1.33 billion. 
 The gains stemmed mostly from USA Today, where ad revenue jumped 14 percent, driven by national ad sales. Revenue at Gannett's TV group rose 1.7 percent.
Income of $10.6 million, or 4 cents a share, from discontinued operations, resulted in net income of $294.6 million, or $1.05, in the latest quarter.
Gannett had been expected to earn $1 a share, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
Publishers like Gannett are profiting from a robust American economy, which is helping to finance new- media companies. These Internet companies, in turn, are promoting themselves with ads in print newspapers and other traditional media.
"As long as the stock market remains buoyant, I'd expect this kind of ad spending to flow through," said Mark Zadell, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, who recommends buying Gannett shares.
Gannett also benefited from an 8 percent decline in newsprint costs, typically a paper's second-largest expense after salaries. Newsprint prices fell an average of 12 percent in 1999. This year, Mr. Zadell said, prices are expected to rise about 6 percent, meaning that newspaper companies will face tougher financial comparisons.
Gannett shares rose 93.75 cents today, closing at $69.50. They are down 16.5 percent from a 12-month closing high of $83.25 on Dec. 28.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
2 U.S. Institutions Separated by an Uncommon Bond Policy

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
It is hard to believe that the United States Treasury would do anything to make Alan Greenspan's job of effecting monetary policy more difficult than it already is. But that is exactly what is happening today.
The Federal Reserve's policy makers are widely expected to vote to raise short- term interest rates at the end of their two-day meeting scheduled to begin in Washington today. But some of the tools that Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, has to cool the economy in coming months have been dulled considerably, thanks to the United States Treasury. As a result, the central banker may have to be even more aggressive in raising rates than planned. 
 Policy makers at the central bank are in a highly unusual situation today. The economy is strong by almost every measure and in recent weeks, some inflation indicators have begun to stir. So the Fed has tried to slow things a bit by raising short-term interest rates three times and signaling that further increases were likely.
Even as they have done so, yields on long-term bonds have fallen, the opposite of what normally happens in an escalating- rate environment. The move has created what is called an inverted yield curve, where long-term yields fall below those on short-term issues. Such an occurrence is atypical because investors who take on additional risk by investing in long-term bonds are typically paid more to do so than those who have taken on less risk by investing in shorter-term issues.
The 30-year bond yield has dropped from around 6.75 percent on Jan. 20 to 6.48 percent yesterday. At the same time, the yield on the two-year note has raced from 6.49 percent to 6.58 percent.
Behind this oddity is the Treasury's aggressive plan to reduce the nation's debt. Its two-pronged plan to cut back on issuing long-term debt and to buy back as much as $45 billion in long-term bonds has made institutions like insurance companies and pension funds stampede into the long end of the bond market buying anything they can. These companies need long-term bonds to offset their extended obligations; the perception that there is going to be a shortage of long-term United States Treasuries has brought these investors into the market with a vengeance, causing yields on long-term bonds to plunge.
What worries some bond market participants is that this plunge in yields will blunt the impact that the Fed's interest rate increases will have on the economy. By raising rates, the Fed hopes to curtail economic activity by making it more expensive to borrow. But with long-term rates so low, shrewd borrowers who might typically have tapped the short-term market for capital will simply issue long-term debt. Easy access to cheap, long-term debt will help to keep the economy hot, while the Fed wants it to cool.
"Raising the Fed funds rate has a much more powerful impact when the yield curve is steepening than when it is inverted," said Timothy Irwin, principal at Irwin Capital Management in New York. "And if it is the Treasury's actions that are causing the yield curve to invert, these actions are effectively making Greenspan's job more difficult."
Fed policy makers consider many things, of course, when they contemplate raising interest rates. They weigh economic data to analyze the strength of the nation's output and scour the numbers for evidence of inflation. But they also rely very heavily on the behavior of the bond market to assay whether credit is too easily available to companies issuing bonds or too tough to get.
The bond market's moves have become a more critical consideration for the Fed today than they had been to past central bankers. That's because while banks once extended most of the credit to issuers across the economy, now the capital markets are responsible for the bulk of it. In 1975, banks accounted for 55 percent of total credit extended across the economy while capital markets accounted for the rest. Now banks account for 30 percent, while the capital markets dominate.
So the Fed watches the bond market closely. In the late summer of 1998 as Russia defaulted on its debt, the bond market's seizures persuaded the Fed to cut rates aggressively.
Today, the inverted yield curve and the mixed signals that it is sending to the Fed are troubling. "It's a difficult situation because the Fed has relied more upon capital markets to determine how tight or tough credit terms are becoming," said David M. Jones of Aubrey Lanston & Company. "I would say anything north of 6.5 percent on Treasury yield might have a chance of slowing down the economy. Now suddenly we're back below 6.5 percent but you don't know what that means."
As long as the Treasury's buyback of debt continues to distort the bond market, the Fed will have to find other signals to monitor whether credit is too lax or too tight.
In addition to making current credit conditions more difficult for the Fed to measure, the recent behavior of long-term bond yields carries significant risk to financial institutions and consumers if it continues. Anyone with an adjustable-rate mortgage will suffer because short-term rates are high, for example. And banks, which borrow in short-term credit markets and lend for longer terms, will be badly hurt.
"The real risk in the marketplace is a massive inverted curve for a long time," said Stan Jonas of Fimat U.S.A., a brokerage firm in New York. By raising rates, he added, the Fed may invert the yield curve even further with short-term rates escalating while yields on longer-term issues continue to fall. "This would be good for pensioners, but bad for people with adjustable mortgages. And it would kill the banks."
And yet, many of the recent economic figures point to a growth rate in the United States that is much hotter than Mr. Greenspan would prefer. So short-term rates are expected to get a bump tomorrow, possible inverting the curve even more.
Nobody said being a central banker was easy.

HEADLINE: Study Documents Homelessness In American Children Each Year

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
About 1.35 million children in the United States -- nearly 2 percent of the nation's total -- are likely to become homeless at some point in the course of a year, a new analysis of national census and survey data being presented today has found.
The children are among an estimated 3.5 million people nationally who become homeless at least once in the course of a year, according to the analysis by the Urban institute, a Washington research group. The work was done by the team that prepared a recent federal report on homelessness released last month by the secretary of housing and urban development, Andrew M. Cuomo. 
 About 65 percent more Americans had an episode of homelessness annually in 1996, during a sustained economic boom, than in 1987, the institute found.
"Having been homeless as a child is a predictor of being homeless as an adult, so you're building the next generation here to an alarming extent," Martha Burt, director of social service research at the institute, said yesterday. She noted that nearly 10 percent of poor children annually experience homelessness.
In 1987, at the time of the previous national survey, Ms. Burt estimates that about 1.8 million people became homeless at some point in a year.
"The people who are doing well are pushing the price of housing up and taking over more space, and they're doing that all over the country," she said to explain the rise.
The national report found deep poverty and illness among the homeless served in shelters and soup kitchens, though almost half were in their first episode of homelessness.
The new projections are consistent with studies based on several years of complete, computerized shelter data in New York and Philadelphia, and with more recent data in eight other metropolitan areas.
Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said shelter data show that 1 percent of the population in New York and Philadelphia uses a homeless shelter for some period each year, with the rate about 10 times higher among young poor children and highest among poor African American children under 5.
Most poor families, Professor Culhane added, are paying 60 percent and 70 percent of their income on rent, twice what it was 25 years ago.
Ms. Burt said the impact of homelessness may be longlasting. About 21 percent of homeless adults experienced homelessness as children.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CHALLENGER;
In the Final Round of Rallies, It's Bill Bradley, the Professor

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: HOLLIS, N.H., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Senator Paul Wellstone, a former college wrestler who knows a thing or two about cheerleading, got a crowd of nearly 1,000 Bill Bradley supporters here fired up this morning in his high-energy style, pumping his arms and screaming at the top of his lungs, "We're going to win in New Hampshire!" over and over again.
The crowd stood and cheered wildly. Then came Mr. Bradley. And for the next 25 minutes, he calmed them back down with a speech that was part lecture on the global economy and part sermon on human goodness. 
 So it went for Mr. Bradley today. On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, a time when presidential candidates typically dash from photo opportunity to photo opportunity, rallying crowds with thundering stemwinders, Mr. Bradley returned to the relaxed, soft-edged, professorial approach he perfected in front of small audiences months ago.
Yet if he was not always rousing on the day before the primary, Mr. Bradley was clearly connecting with many people in his audiences, all of which were large and enthusiastic. And it was precisely Mr. Bradley's unwillingness, or inability, to deliver a tub-thumping, end-of-the-campaign speech that made him seem appealing to many people.
"He's just straight, and that's what we like here," said Barbara Schwartz, 60, who came to hear Mr. Bradley at the high school here. "We're New Hampshirites. We don't like the rah-rah stuff."
The closest Mr. Bradley got to sounding like a conventional candidate on the brink of a critical election was during a late-afternoon speech before hundreds of charged-up campaign workers in Manchester. Yet even there, the most electrifying speeches were delivered by his surrogates, particularly Cornel West, the Harvard professor.
For much of the day, Mr. Bradley's style and speech were reminiscent of his campaign events of the fall. His voice rarely reached Wellstone-like decibels. His sentences rambled through thickets of complex clauses, only occasionally landing on punchy applause lines. He dwelt on spiritual issues as much as bread-and-butter ones. He seemed almost apologetic about asking for votes.
And after having spent nearly a week bashing his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, as dishonest, he barely mentioned Mr. Gore today.
Mr. Bradley had come under criticism recently for his new, more combative style. But his aides asserted that polls indicated that the attacks had been working and that Mr. Bradley had shifted tone today not because of concerns about alienating voters but because he wanted to finish with an uplifting message.
Indeed, there was inspirational oratory aplenty at every stop. "I want to be the president of the United States to use the power of that office to do good," he told the audience at Oracle, the software company.
After that speech, the audience gave Mr. Bradley a spirited ovation that lasted nearly a minute. But rather than basking in the applause, Mr. Bradley looked almost sheepish, stepping backward on the podium and then trying to quiet the crowd like a father with a noisy child, gently repeating, "O.K., O.K."
Yet it was Mr. Bradley's low-key approach that Roy Swonger, 35, an Oracle manager, found most attractive about the candidate. "There was no part in the speech when he was looking for applause," he said. "I'm happy to see that in a politician."
Never comfortable with the scripted gestures of campaigning, Mr. Bradley missed several photo opportunities today. In the morning, he bought a shovel in Concord and went to work clearing part of a walkway. The display seemed intended to demonstrate that Mr. Bradley, who occasionally suffers from an irregular heartbeat, is in good shape.
But few camera crews were around. Later, his bus stopped and an aide jumped off with the shovel. But Mr. Bradley never got off the bus. He was concerned, apparently, about getting to his next speech on time.

HEADLINE: Republicans Offer Tax Cut For Couples

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
House Republicans unveiled their own proposal today to give a tax cut to married couples, stepping up pressure on President Clinton and Democrats to agree to an election-year compromise on taxes.
The Republican plan, laid out by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was intended in part to reduce the so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples and represented a counteroffer to a more narrowly drawn provision proposed last week by Mr. Clinton. 
 Mr. Archer said his plan, which would give a tax break to nearly all married couples, would be worth $182 billion over 10 years, more than four times as much as Mr. Clinton's plan.
The benefits of the Republican plan would go to couples across the income spectrum whether or not they pay a marriage penalty and would include couples where only one spouse worked.
The president's proposal, valued by the White House at $45 billion over 10 years, would limit benefits largely to two-income couples who claimed the standard deduction on their federal income taxes, nearly all of whom are in low-income and middle-income brackets and most of whom pay some marriage penalty.
Mr. Archer said his bill would be taken up by the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday and would come to the floor for a vote by the full House in two weeks.
It is the first in a series of separate tax cuts, each with powerful constituencies, that the House leadership intends to bring up this year in a change of strategy from the last few years, when Republicans assembled catchall tax bills that the White House and Democrats cast as fiscally irresponsible.
"Fixing the marriage penalty would be the best Valentine's Day present we could give to millions of couples," Mr. Archer said today.
Democrats said Mr. Archer's approach was too expensive, and they criticized the Republicans for not seeking a bipartisan deal before moving ahead with their own bill.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the bulk of the tax relief under Mr. Archer's bill would go to the most affluent 25 percent of taxpayers. And he said the $180 billion cost of the tax cut would drain the projected federal budget surplus before Congress and the administration worked out plans to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
Republicans have long made reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty a goal of their tax-cutting efforts. The penalty mostly hits couples in which the two partners have similar incomes.
In some cases, the penalty arises when the combined income of the partners pushes them into an income tax bracket higher than they would be subject to if single and filing separately. In other cases, couples pay the penalty because the standard deduction for couples filing jointly is less than half the standard deduction for a single filer.
But not all couples pay a marriage penalty. Last year, of 51.4 million joint returns filed, 24.8 million, or 48 percent, paid a marriage penalty, according to a study by the Treasury Department. Another 21 million, or 41 percent -- mostly couples in which only one partner worked, or in which one partner made much more than the other -- actually got a marriage "bonus," meaning a lower tax bill than they would pay if single.
Mr. Archer's bill would raise the standard deduction for couples so that it is twice that for single taxpayers. Most high-income couples itemized deductions and would not benefit from that change. Mr. Clinton's proposal is built around a similar increase in the standard deduction.
But Mr. Archer also proposed to expand the 15 percent income tax bracket to higher income limits than under current law. Under his plan, the 15 percent bracket for married couples, which is adjusted for inflation each year and currently ends at $43,850 of taxable income, would rise gradually until 2008 when it would reach twice the level of single filers, currently $26,250.
Mr. Archer's plan would also increase by $2,000 the income level at which married couples lose the earned income tax credit, a cash payment made by the government to working families below and just above the poverty line.
Because of the way it is structured, Mr. Archer's plan would help all couples, not just those paying the marriage penalty, making his plan as much a broad-based tax cut for families as a marriage penalty bill.
"We're basically trying to help people also who are at home with a single earner," he said. "We certainly should be encouraging that homemaker who stays at home and takes care of the children."
The bill would provide no tax cut for single people.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Baseball Suspends Rocker Till May for Comments

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Commissioner Bud Selig, saying John Rocker had dishonored Major League Baseball by disparaging many groups of society with his harsh comments in a magazine interview, suspended the Atlanta Braves' No. 1 relief pitcher yesterday for 73 days, marking the first time a baseball player has been disciplined for speech.
The players' union said that it would file a grievance challenging the suspension and suggested that the disciplinary action was a public relations move. 
 Selig said that Rocker could not participate in spring training with the Braves, a 45-day period, and could not play during the first 28 days of the season. The commissioner also fined Rocker, a 25-year-old Georgian, $20,000 and ordered him to undergo sensitivity training.
Under baseball practice, Rocker will not lose any of his salary while he is suspended. He has yet to sign his contract for 2000.
"Major League Baseball takes seriously its role as an American institution and the important social responsibility that goes with it," Selig said in a statement. "We will not dodge our responsibility. Mr. Rocker should understand that his remarks offended practically every element of society and brought dishonor to himself, the Atlanta Braves and Major League Baseball."
Rocker, who initially gained notoriety by lashing out at Mets fans during the National League Championship Series last October, expanded his target group in a Sports Illustrated article in December. He disparaged an assortment of foreign people -- "I'm not a very big fan of foreigners," he said, adding, "How the hell did they get in this country?"-- as well as gays and others. He also called a black teammate "a fat monkey."
Talking about playing for a New York team, he said: "Imagine having to take the 7 train to the ballpark, looking like you're riding through Beirut next to some kid with purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing."
When Marge Schott was the owner of the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990's, she was suspended more than once for her public statements on blacks and Jews, but no player whom anyone could remember was ever disciplined for his public comments. Players have been suspended for drug use, and Denny McLain, a well-known pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, was suspended for the first half of the 1970 season for his relationship with gamblers.
Rocker will not be permitted to begin formal preparation for the season until April 3, when, he was informed, he can participate in extended spring training and/or minor league activities. He cannot play for the Braves until May 1.
"I do not believe it is appropriate that I should be harshly disciplined for my misguided speech unaccompanied by any conduct on my part," Rocker said in a statement released by his agents. "I have previously apologized for my unfortunate remarks and stand by my apology."
Rocker had previously been ordered to undergo psychological evaluation under baseball's employee assistance plan. The announcement yesterday said he had completed that evaluation but did not provide further information.
Rocker's remarks triggered an outcry from the Atlanta community, as well as from Braves officials and players.
As unpopular as Rocker's comments were, even with his own teammates, the magnitude of the penalty is prompting the players association to challenge it, Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. A grievance would be heard by Shaym Das, baseball's arbitrator.
"It seems fairly obvious to me," Orza said, "that they imposed this penalty in almost defiance of but certainly with an eye toward the arbitration process. You wash your hands of it and let others worry about the propriety of what you've done. I just don't think they're going to fool anyone with what they're trying to do here."
While acknowledging that the Constitution's freedom of speech provisions do not relate to private industry as they do to governmental action, Orza said: "Speech which harms the business is subject to discipline. The question is whether the harm is real or just a function of the belief. You have to actually demonstrate the harm. Even assuming that, the magnitude of the penalty has to be taken into account."
The Braves were quick to link Rocker's remarks to potential economic harm. "It has been a very difficult time for the Braves' front office," Stan Kasten, the club's president, said at a news conference in Atlanta. Saying the Rocker issue generated the most calls and mail he could recall on a single issue, he added: "It has been difficult for us businesswise because all of these people had strong feelings. It's been difficult for the sales department, the promotions department, the community relations department."
John Schuerholz, the team's general manager, said Braves players had expressed the view that if Rocker were "suspended, punished in some way, probably fined for his comments, they would be willing to give him a second chance as a teammate. They would be willing to see him get a chance to redeem himself."
One of the first players who criticized Rocker publicly was Tom Glavine, an Atlanta pitcher, who is the union's National League player representative. He might have been one of the people Orza had in mind when he said, "Even the people who are offended by what Rocker said should see the stakes in this."
"All players," Orza added, "who work in an industry that encourages them and sometimes insists that they talk to the press have a stake at not being penalized for pure speech unaccompanied by bad conduct, particularly when the penalty for that pure speech is as enormous as this one has been."
The suspension, Orza said, is longer than that imposed on some players who were found to have been drug users.

HEADLINE: The Silicon Godfather;
The Man Behind Taiwan's Rise in the Chip Industry

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HSINCHU, Taiwan

 BODY:
The assembly lines at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation were running full tilt after midnight last Sept. 21, when the floor began to heave. A huge earthquake had struck central Taiwan 60 miles south of here. But for the luck of geography, this futuristic technology park could have resembled a scene from the most expensive disaster movie ever made.
Although the quake cut off power and jostled the company's delicate silicon wafers -- ruining 28,000 of them -- it did little structural damage to Taiwan Semiconductor's five factories. The main problem was lack of electricity, which left Taiwan's largest chip maker becalmed when worldwide demand for its semiconductors was running at a fever pitch. 
 For Morris Chang, the founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor, the solution was obvious: he placed a call to Taiwan's prime minister, Vincent Siew, requesting power be restored. Within three days the lights started coming on, and less than 10 days later, Taiwan Semiconductor's factories were humming at 95 percent capacity.
Taiwan's earthquake was a jolting reminder to the computer industry of its reliance on this island nation. Leading American manufacturers like Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard blamed quake-related shortages for depressing third-quarter earnings.
No company better symbolizes Taiwan's role as quartermaster to the world computer industry than does Taiwan Semiconductor. And few have had more to do with putting Taiwan there than has Mr. Chang. At 68, this mainland Chinese-born, American-educated executive is one of the titans of Taiwan industry.
"People call Morris Chang the godfather of high technology in Taiwan," said Benny T. Hu, the president of the China Development Industrial Bank. "He created the semiconductor industry here."
Mr. Hu's kind words come as no surprise, given that he is also vice chairman of Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing, Taiwan's third-largest chip maker, which Mr. Chang agreed to buy last month in a stock deal worth at least $5 billion. That was two weeks after Taiwan Semiconductor agreed to merge with TSMC-Acer Semiconductor Manufacturing, its joint venture with Acer.
In a single month of deal making, Mr. Chang expanded Taiwan Semiconductor's production capacity to 3.2 million silicon wafers a year from 2.8 million. That is still far short of demand, which Mr. Chang estimates will be more than 4 million wafers this year and 5.5 million in 2001.
"These last six months have really been the most painful in our company's life, because there were so many customers who depended on us," said Mr. Chang, a courtly, white-haired man who was born in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, spent three decades as an executive in the United States, and came to Taiwan for the first time in 1985 to start a new career.
"The central part of our corporate culture is to give customers what they want," Mr. Chang said. "And we couldn't give them enough."
It is Mr. Chang's happy problem to be caught in one of the chip industry's periodic booms. After slumping for three years in the late 1990's, demand rebounded in the second half of 1999. That was because of the end of the Asian economic crisis and the proliferation of new digital devices -- from set-top boxes to cell phones.
 Analysts estimate worldwide demand for chips will grow 30 percent this year, while Taiwan Semiconductor's sales will double. The company reported 1999 earnings last week. Even with the week of lost production in September, sales rose 45.6 percent, to $2.43 billion, while net income jumped 60 percent, to $816 million. The company's shares, which trade here and in New York, have risen 80 percent since Dec. 17, giving it a market capitalization of $51 billion.
Taiwan Semiconductor is growing even faster than the rest of the industry because Mr. Chang has discovered its sweet spot. Rather than design and produce integrated circuits as do Intel, Motorola and I.B.M., Taiwan Semiconductor acts as a contractor, making chips based on the designs of its customers.
Mr. Chang's insight was to recognize that a growing number of small chip designers could not afford to build their own semiconductor factories. Known as fabs, these space-age complexes take at least 18 months to complete and cost from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, depending on the size.
"It's hard to justify that kind of capital expenditure," said Calvin Chang, a semiconductor analyst at Jardine Fleming in Taipei. "There aren't that many companies who can afford to build new fabs."
Even for full-service producers like Motorola or NEC, the cost of manufacturing a wide variety of chips in their own factories has become prohibitive. Increasingly, the semiconductor giants are farming out part of their work to contractors like Taiwan Semiconductor. Motorola has said it plans to contract 35 percent of its chip production to these so-called foundries by 2002.
At the moment, foundries produce roughly 15 percent of the total output of the $160 billion semiconductor industry. But by 2010, analysts say, they will produce half. Taiwan Semiconductor's share of the foundry market is 35 percent. Its main competitor, United Microelectronics, has a 30 percent share. It is also based in the teeming Hsinchu technology park. Together, these companies have made Taiwan a sort of country-for-hire to the semiconductor industry.
Mr. Chang's personal odyssey is a chapter in the story of Taiwan's emergence as a technology power. The son of a prosperous Chinese banker who fled the Communists in 1949, Mr. Chang was sent to the United States to be educated, first at Harvard and later at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
After earning his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Mr. Chang joined Texas Instruments and ended up running its semiconductor division. He left in 1983 after a falling-out with his bosses and joined General Instruments, where he served a brief, disillusioning spell as president.
"I had enough money not to work for the rest of my life, and I had gotten a little weary of the corporate rat race," said Mr. Chang, who is an American citizen. "At that time, Taiwan beckoned."
The Taiwan government, eager to turn this island into a technology redoubt, initially recruited Mr. Chang to head an industrial research institute. But given his pedigree and experience, it was a matter of time before the government persuaded Mr. Chang to join Taiwan's drive into the semiconductor industry.
In 1987, the government staked him $100 million and took a 49 percent share in what would become Taiwan Semiconductor. That, along with $58 million from Philips, the Dutch electronics company, allowed Mr. Chang to set up shop. The government still owns 15 percent of the company, while Philips owns 26.7 percent.
Mr. Chang has cultivated ties with senior officials and financiers like Mr. Hu, who are close to the governing Nationalist Party. But he says he has no allegiance to the party and prefers to stay out of politics.
Mr. Chang's concept of the foundry was born of an appreciation of both the virtues and limitations of Taiwan. He said he believed the country had an advantage in making wafers -- likening Taiwan to Japan, which also excels at churning out high-quality chips. Both countries, he said, had plenty of highly trained, skilled line operators, technicians and production engineers.
Unlike Japan, however, which developed a design capability, Mr. Chang said he doubted Taiwan's ability to compete in the more rarefied business of designing integrated circuits.
"I don't think we have enough creativity," he said. "Our educational system is state-run. We are very successful at turning out engineers with basic skills, in fact better than the engineering graduates from U.S. universities. However, they are not as entrepreneurial and not as creative."
Taiwan has become a pace-setter, , cutting costs to the bone and turning its factories into supple operations capable of producing a range of chips in a single factory. At one of Taiwan Semiconductor's fabs in the Hsinchu Science Park, the manager pointed out a conveyor belt that rushed silently overhead.
The belt, he explained, was used to correct imbalances in the fab's two assembly lines. Wafers were shuttled from one line to the other to ensure that both were running at capacity. Movable racks in a glassed-in storage room held boxes of wafers bound for NEC, Motorola and a dozen other companies.
Still, Taiwan remains a minor player in the world of chip design, which is dominated by the United States and Japan. Even Mr. Chang's efforts to develop memory chips, which are less complex than logic chips, have come to naught. In 1994, he started Vanguard International Semiconductor, with the goal of producing dynamic random access memory, or D-RAM, chips without relying on foreign technology.
But after losing more than $200 million in 1998 and 1999 and failing to make a dent in the memory-chip market, Mr. Chang recently decided to scale back Vanguard's ambitions. Now, like Taiwan Semiconductor, it will turn out chips on a contract basis. Taiwan Semiconductor owns 25 percent of Vanguard, and analysts expect the two will be folded together.
"Vanguard has been a thorn in the foot of Taiwan Semiconductor," said Dan Heyler, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch in Taipei. "Investors have always wondered why T.S.M.C. spent as much time with Vanguard as it did."
For Mr. Chang, however, Vanguard was not merely about money. "Vanguard was going to be the second stage of creating a really powerful industry in Taiwan," he said wistfully. "It was sad."
Despite the setback, Mr. Chang said he was confident that Taiwan would retain its edge in the chip industry over emerging Asian rivals like Singapore and Malaysia. In addition to five working factories in Hsinchu, Taiwan Semiconductor is building new plants here and in southern Taiwan, as well as joint venture plants in Singapore and Washington State. One will produce wafers with diameters of 12 inchs, which hold far more chips than the traditional 8-inch wafers.
With a stake in the company that is worth nearly $250 million, Mr. Chang can afford to take the long view. A few years ago, he stepped back from the day-to-day management of Taiwan Semiconductor, freeing up time for a role he seems to relish: the elder statesman of industry, helping to propel his adopted country to the next rung on the technology ladder.
"I have been pushing for the need for innovation, for more creativity," he declared, with the confidence of a man who gets Taiwan's top leaders on the phone with little trouble. "We need to reform the educational system. It's very slow, but it's going to happen."

HEADLINE: With Fanfare and a Delay, Amtrak Unveils a Faster Train

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Amtrak unveiled new fully electrified train service between Boston and New York yesterday, but the day was marred by technical problems that seemed symbolic of the difficulties the company has faced in a $2.6 billion high-speed rail venture.
The improved service was the first step in a project to introduce 150-mile-an-hour trains that would reduce travel time to Boston to three hours from five and cut about 15 minutes off travel time to Washington. But yesterday, as Amtrak officials boasted about the superiority of the service, called Acela (pronounced ah-SELL-ah), mechanical problems delayed the first train. 
 As a news conference concluded in Boston about 9:30 a.m., engineers rushed to fix the problems that caused a 20-minute delay. The setback, which company officials blamed on an engine problem, did not seem to faze Amtrak officials.
"This is exciting," Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin said. "It is a passion I have" to build a national high-speed railroad system, "and within that system to build regional high-speed corridors, and the first step has got to be the Northeast," he said. "What this really means," headded, "is that we will be able to become really competitive with airlines."
The train, which left Boston at 9:51 a.m. and arrived at Pennsylvania Station in New York at 3:30 p.m., was delayed as officials stopped for news conferences in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
The service introduced yesterday, Acela Regional, shortens the trip between Boston and New York to about four hours. It was made possible by extending electricity along the entire corridor between the two cities; previously, electrified service ended at New Haven, where train crews switched to slower diesel trains.
A faster service, Acela Express, which would reduce the trip to just over three hours, has been delayed by problems with the manufacture of high-speed trains. Both yesterday's train and the express train had been scheduled to begin service in September, but Amtrak officials now say it is unclear when the contractor will deliver the express train.
The contractor, Alstom SA, a French company, is redesigning the express train's suspension after problems with wear on the wheels. That train, which is being tested in Pueblo, Colo., was delayed after the wheel problems made it difficult for the trains to make curves.
The delay has caused problems for Amtrak, which hopes to generate $180 million a year in profits from the new train service. Those profits are needed to help the railroad meet a cutoff in operating subsidies at the end of the 2002 fiscal year.
Amtrak officials said that the delays would not cause budget shortfalls because of a contingency plan and fines that could be assessed against the manufacturer.
Amtrak officials hope the express service will help cut into the airline business between Washington, Boston and New York. Amtrak now carries only about 15 percent of the combined air-rail traffic between Boston and New York.
Over the last decade, Amtrak replaced nearly a dozen bridges and installed 115 miles of electrified rail between South Station in Boston and New Haven. Much of this work was paid for by Congressional appropriations. Amtrak's president, George D. Warrington, said he hoped to see rail improvements and speedier trains, similar to the Acela, the name Amtrak invented by combining "acceleration" and "excellence," traveling soon to transportation hubs like Richmond, Va., Chicago and Atlanta.
Electrification of rail lines between New Haven and Boston was proposed in 1912, but never attempted by the private railroads that ran passenger services at the time. In the late 1970's the idea was revived, but stalled during the Reagan administration, which opposed more subsidies for Amtrak, officials said.
But in the early 1990's, a bipartisan coalition of business leaders, academics and environmental advocates won reluctant approval from the Bush administration, which helped secure funds for the electrification that was completed last year.
Electric trains cannot run all the way from Maine to Washington yet, officials said, because of a small section of track missing between two Boston stations.
James P. RePass, the president and chief executive of the National Corridors Initiative, an organization that has advocated for the improvements, said his group is lobbying for direct service from New York City to New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts.
Mr. Warrington, the Amtrak president, said he saw economic benefits for cities along the corridor. "We have turned the Northeast corridor into a powerhouse of an engine that will help power the economy in the region," he said.

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Curcic on His Way Back to Europe

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:

METROSTARS
 The new regime of the MetroStars is apparently determined to renovate the struggling team more drastically than expected. People in Major League Soccer with knowledge of their plans said yesterday that the MetroStars have asked the league to find a team elsewhere for Sasa Curcic, whose tattoos and behavior make him the team's version of Dennis Rodman.
 The MetroStars contend that Curcic is more of a playmaker than a goal scorer, and a goal scorer is what they need to play alongside Henry Zambrano, their main striker. It appears that Hernan Medford, a Costa Rican playing for Leon in Mexico, may be the allocated foreigner the MetroStars will get in place of Curcic. 
 Curcic was in Europe yesterday when the MetroStars left for Florida to begin training for the coming season. People familiar with the team's plans said Curcic would be removed from the team's roster for salary cap purposes.
 Last Friday the club acquired 38-year-old Thomas Dooley. Dooley played for Columbus in M.L.S. and for the United States national team beginning in 1992 after it was discovered that his father was a United States Army veteran who married a German woman.
 The MetroStars have also changed their training plans. Instead of going to Brazil after returning from Florida on Feb. 19, they will go to Portugal for a week starting on Feb. 23.
 
FIFA
 Sepp Blatter, president of the sport's worldwide governing body, speaking on French television on Sunday, called for a worldwide annual break in December. Blatter said that FIFA would present its plan next month for a new, harmonized calendar that would take effect from 2004.
 "It is vital that soccer should stop for a month," Blatter said of the plan, which has been in the works for over year. Blatter also said that all club soccer would stop between June 15 and July 15 to allow national team competitions to take place. Blatter also reported that FIFA had dropped its restriction for games played on artificial turf, saying that even the World Cup could be played on the plastic grass.
 The FIFA president also repeated his support for African bids to stage the 2006 World Cup, which is being hotly pursued by England, Germany, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.
 
GERMANY
 The crisis at Eintracht Frankfurt deepened yesterday after the resignation of Rolf Heller, the club president. The club is currently 17th in the 18-team Bundesliga, which will resume action Friday after its winter break.
 Eintracht faces crises both on and off the field. The club has debts of about $7 million that it must pay or have its license stripped by the German Football Association, which runs the Bundesliga.
 Heller, 56, was hailed as a savior when he arrived at Eintracht three years ago after the club's previous financial crisis when it was relegated to Second Division. Eintracht fired coach Jorg Berger two months ago and appointed the former German World Cup player Felix Magath in his place.
 Bayern Munich, which will be losing Lothar MatthAus to the MetroStars next month, is expected to extend the contracts of midfielders Thorsten Fink and Michael Tarnat, both members of the national team, who joined Bayern from Karlsruhe in 1997. Bayern is currently on top of the Bundesliga and a challenger for the title in the European Champions' League.
 
ITALY
 A second-minute penalty kick by Sinisa Mihajlovic of Yugolsavia sent Lazio to a 3-1 triumph over Bari that left the Roman team only a point behind league-leading Juventus. Juventus was held to a 1-1 deadlock at home by lowly Cagliari. Like Lazio, Juventus made a perfect start with a first-minute goal by Filippo Inzaghi but failed to capitalize and conceded a 13th-minute equaliz0er to Giovanni Sulcis.
 The Ukrainian Andrei Shevchenko scored a hat trick in seven minutes, his second hat trick of the season and league-leading 14th goal, in a A.C. Milan's 3-0 triumph at Perugia. The victory pushed defending champion A.C. Milan to third, tied with neighboring Inter Milan, whose challenge for the title was revived in a 2-1 triumph over A.S. Roma thanks to a superb goal by Roberto Baggio.
 
CORNER KICKS
 The United States federation will announce an agreement on a new contract with the women's national team at a news conference today in midtown Manhattan. ... A week after signing a $40 million deal with a cable company to have its games televised, Aston Villa of the English Premier League signed a $10 million sponsorship deal yesterday with the Italian sportwear company Diadora. ... England will meet Ukraine May 31 at Wembley Stadium in London in the first match between the two countries. ALEX YANNIS

HEADLINE: Suit Accuses Sony Music of Unfair Online Acts

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Sony Music Entertainment was sued by retailers who say the company illegally steers customers to its online stores by including hyperlinks on music compact discs.
The National Association of Recording Merchandisers filed suit today in federal court in Washington. The suit accuses Sony music of copyright misuse, false advertising, unfair competition and illegal price discrimination in favor of Sony's own record club and online retailer. 
 "This gets a lot of these issues into the court," said Paula Horovitz, president of the trade association, which represents more than 1,000 music retailers, wholesalers and distributors. "We hope we can get the ground rules laid out as we get into an Internet age."
A new generation of compact discs, called enhanced CD's, includes video images and interactive features that appear when played on a personal computer. Sony and its competitors typically include a hyperlink on these video images that connects Internet users to an online store.
The retailers say they are being forced, in effect, to direct their own customers to a competitor: Sony's retail operation.
While Sony is not the only company that engages in the practice, Ms. Horovitz said, it was singled out because of its "economic power." She said legal action against other music companies had not been ruled out.
Ms. Horovitz said the questions the lawsuit raises would become more important as such new technologies as DVD's and direct online downloads of digital-quality recordings increase their shares of the home entertainment market.

HEADLINE: Signs of Iraqi Arms Buildup Bedevil U.S. Administration

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Satellite photographs and American intelligence reports have shown that Iraq has in the last year rebuilt military and industrial sites damaged by American and British air strikes in late 1998, officials say.
The recent intelligence findings have raised concerns among Defense Department and other officials in the Clinton administration that in the prolonged absence of international weapons inspectors, whose job would be to search those structures, President Saddam Hussein's government has continued its pursuit of biological and chemical weapons. 
 Despite those concerns, the administration's policy has been allowed to drift, leaving the United States unable to force Iraq to accept a resumption of inspections even after resolving an impasse at the United Nations Security Council.
Iraq's refusal has now left the administration in a quandary over how to respond at a time when international support for its policy and for sanctions against Mr. Hussein is waning.
"There is concern in intelligence circles that he has begun to rebuild buildings that could enable him" to produce chemical or biological weapons, a senior administration official said. "He has had a lot of time to operate without inspections."
Although the intelligence reports have not provided concrete evidence that Iraq is producing chemical or biological weapons, the officials said, the reports have raised the possibility of renewed military confrontation, because the administration has repeatedly warned that any effort by Iraq to produce the weapons would prompt new American air strikes.
The concern has given urgency to the new inspection program created last month by the Security Council. But for the administration, the latest Iraqi defiance has been met with frustration, uncertainty over how to proceed and even fatigue.
In his State of the Union address on Thursday, Mr. Clinton devoted exactly six words to Iraq. The American representative to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, a diplomat noted for his tenacity, barely involved himself in the Security Council's negotiations over inspections, leaving them to his deputy, James B. Cunningham, who arrived in New York just last month.
Despite a policy of "containment," punctuated by American-led strikes in 1993, 1996 and 1998, Mr. Hussein remains as much a thorn as he was when Mr. Clinton took office. And Iraq's defiance comes in a year when any action by the administration would have political ramifications in the presidential campaign.
Nearly a year and a half after Iraq blocked the last team of United Nations inspectors, administration officials said that getting inspectors back into the country remained the best way to determine if Baghdad's weapons programs were continuing.
Last week, after months of diplomatic wrangling, the Security Council agreed to nominate Hans Blix of Sweden to lead a new inspection team in Iraq, having rejected a candidate supported by the United States, Rolf Ekeus, also of Sweden.
Russia and France vetoed Mr. Ekeus's nomination after consultations with Mr. Hussein's government, diplomatic officials said.
But while Iraq has been less hostile toward Mr. Blix, Iraqi officials have said they will not accept any resumption of international weapons inspections under the terms of the latest Security Council resolution.
Even if Mr. Hussein eventually relents and allows Mr. Blix's team to enter the country, it will take at least three or four months before inspectors can resume work inside Iraq. Administration officials expressed their concerns when asked to assess the state of Washington's policy toward Iraq. Some officials defended the administration's approach, but others, including Pentagon officials, criticized the policy out of concern that it has left the United States few viable options.
Thirteen months ago, the United States and Britain launched four nights of air and missile strikes to punish Mr. Hussein after he expelled the last team of weapons inspectors. At the time, senior commanders estimated that the operation had set back Iraq's ability to produce chemical or biological weapons -- and the missiles needed to launch them -- by one to two years. "We're marching toward that point" now, a senior military officer said.
Pentagon and other officials declined to discuss the recent intelligence findings in detail, but they said Iraq had rebuilt many of the 100 installations damaged or destroyed in the American and British raids in December 1998.
Of those targets, 12 were missile factories or industrial sites that commanders said were involved in Iraq's efforts to produce weapons of mass destruction. The officials said significant reconstruction had been seen at those sites, including Al Taji missile complex north of Baghdad.
In the wake of the diplomatic wrangling, administration officials defended their policy toward Iraq. They said they remained determined to contain Mr. Hussein militarily while maintaining the economic sanctions first imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and while supporting Iraqi opposition groups.
Officials emphasized that a new American attack did not appear imminent. They said they wanted to see if the new inspection program would eventually get off the ground before taking any action that could further erode international support for the American stance toward Iraq.
But the officials said there remained three "red lines" that the United States would not let the Iraqis cross: a threat against a neighboring country like Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, an attack on the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq or a reconstitution of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs.
Critics of Washington's handling of Iraq said the administration appeared to have no clear plan on how to force an end to Iraq's defiance. "There is no adult supervision of our policy," said Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
And despite American efforts to unify Iraqi opposition groups, factions remain. The administration has provided only a small part of the $97 million that Congress authorized to support those bent on overthrowing Mr. Hussein's government.
Also, international sanctions are fraying. To win Russian and French support for the new weapons inspection program, the United States and Britain agreed to offer Iraq an opportunity to end the sanctions. Under the new Security Council resolution, the United Nations will suspend sanctions if Iraq cooperates with the new inspectors.
But one reason for the continued Iraqi defiance may be that the sanctions are already leaking. Iraq is allowed to export $10 billion a year to buy food and other essential goods, and while the proceeds are closely monitored by the United Nations, the Iraqis have been able to divert some of the money, administration officials said.
Mr. Hussein's government has also been able to earn millions of dollars in smuggling. Since August, Iraq has steadily increased illicit shipments of oil from the Shatt al Arab waterway, much of it flowing through an installation near the port of Basra that American warplanes attacked and damaged in 1998, the officials said.
Last month, Iraq's illicit trade reached the highest level since the Persian Gulf war. More than 130 ships, some of them Russian, left the port and skirted the Iranian coast, staying in Iran's territorial waters to evade American ships trying to intercept them. "The Iranians are at least tacitly involved in this," a senior administration official said.
In the same month, Navy warships boarded only 36 ships and seized only 4. According to American intelligence estimates, Iraq was able to smuggle out a record amount of 317,000 metric tons of oil, or more than 2.3 million barrels, in December alone. At today's price of about $27 a barrel, the shipments were worth more than $62 million.
A recent intelligence report concluded that the smuggling was undermining the sanctions. Pentagon and other administration officials say they increasingly worry that the proceeds may be intended to finance weapons programs.
But another senior Administration official said the amounts of illicit profit were not enough to allow Mr. Hussein to produce nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. "What's inside the buildings is much more expensive to put up than any walls and roofs," the official said.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2000, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the Clinton administration's policy on Iraq misstated the circumstances under which international weapons inspectors left that country before American and British air strikes in December 1998. While Iraq had ceased cooperating with the inspectors, it did not expel them. The United Nations withdrew them before the air strikes began.
The article also referred incorrectly to the value of the oil Iraq is allowed to sell under a program monitored by the United Nations. There is no longer a limit. Although at one point the value was set at $5.2 billion for every six months, it is not now limited to $10 billion a year.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS;
Contented Electorate Is Also Happy With Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: PEPPERMINT CORNER, N.H., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Vivian Poirier, a 44-year-old massage therapist, smiled broadly today when asked at the post office in Portsmouth, on the eastern edge of the state, to judge how this year's primary campaign for president had been conducted. "There doesn't seem to be as much -- what's the word I'm looking for? -- viciousness," she responded. "They aren't as vicious, which is nice."
In Derry, to the southwest, Grant Benson, 71, a hardware store owner, said after years of being forced to chose the lesser of two evils, he has never been as pleased with the candidates this time. "I think it may even be better today than it was 30 years ago," he said. 
 And here in this tiny enclave farther south, Joanne Tramontozzi, 52, a sales clerk, said she could not remember as detailed -- if perhaps at times dry -- an examination of the issues by the candidates. "It's been a nicer campaign," she said. "They're sticking more to issues. In the past, it was all personal."
Indeed, in a marked break from the tenor of presidential campaigns over the past two decades, New Hampshirites -- in dozens of interviews across the state on the eve of the nation's first primary -- said today they were pleased with the choice of candidates and heartened by what they described as an unexpectedly uplifting discourse by candidates of both parties, at least until this past weekend, when Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the two Democrats, began squabbling.
They also described themselves as largely pleased with the state of the nation, and, most important, the economy, in a part of the United States that has long suffered. The almost single-minded focus on economic decline that for so long dominated interviews here with voters -- and shaped the appeals of presidential candidates from both parties -- has been replaced with a broad new set of issues, including health care, education and campaign finance reform.
The voters' comments came on a day when this tiny state's fascination with politics, as well as its arguably disproportionate influence on the presidential selection process, was on display.
Caravans of candidates barreled along the state's highways, while on street corners, young volunteers, many of them bused from New York and Boston, hoisted placards bearing the names of their candidates and waving to motorists driving by, some honking in support. And more than ever, voters here, voicing a parochial pride, said they were confident that this state serves a valuable role in inspecting, even educating, the Democrats and Republicans who have put themselves forward to be president of the United States.
"What do you people in New York City think? Those country bumpkins up there, right?" said Ernest Desjardins, a clinical neuropsychiatrist from Rye. "But in some ways, we make or break a candidate."
The upbeat politicking reflected a campaign season that voter after voter today described as "nice," and the candidates as "substantive." It offered a particularly striking contrast to presidential campaigns in the past decade, when voters, here and elsewhere, always seemed unhappy with the candidates before them -- and often blamed them for their own discontent.
An important reason for the collective smiles among the electorate here may be that voters also said they were not consumed by any single looming issue and were relatively pleased with their own lives. "There aren't any that stand out," said John Prendergast, 36, a landscaper from Portsmouth. "There's nothing broken specifically."
As a result, voters said, they were not searching for candidates eager to change things in Washington. "This is the most prosperity we've ever had," Dr. Desjardins said. "I don't think anyone is anxious to have any change. It would be nice to keep this going for a while."
Andy Bouley, 51, the owner of Shute's Corner Country Store near here, said that although he was concerned about the nation's health care system, he mostly wanted things to stay the way they are. Thus, he said, he is voting for Mr. Gore. "I'd like the economy to stay the way it is," he said. "I wouldn't want to gamble with it."
The issues raised by voters today reflected, for the most part, what is being discussed by candidates from both parties. "Campaign finance is a big one for me," said Jeff Burton, a 29-year-old computer programmer from Dover, and a supporter of Mr. Bradley. "There's too much money in the system."
Megan Hall, 21, a student at University of New Hampshire, said she was concerned about the viability of Social Security, a topic that has been debated by both Democrats and Republicans. "I want it to be there when I'm ready to retire," she said.
And then there is taxes: an evergreen issue here in New Hampshire. "The government takes too much from us," Ms. Hall, and her sister, Amanda, 20, joined her in chanting the second part of a common refrain in a state that is known for anti-tax sentiment.
Yet it was the tone of the debate that drew the most remarks from voters today.
"This is the cleanest campaign I can remember -- it has been nothing like in the past," said Kelly Taaffee, 42, a legal assistant as she chatted over lunch in Keene. "The candidates have stuck to the issues for the most part. It's been a gentleman's race so far -- really." A clerk at the camera store up the street, Robert Hale, 21, said: "In general, politics are too bitter. But all the candidates have handled themselves well this year. I'm happy to see it."
Michael Donah, 55, who is retired and lives in Portsmouth, said he watched both presidential debates, and was impressed by what he described as the candidates' demeanor and depth. "We have had some intelligent debates," he said. "The consistency of the debate was pretty good. I felt they were both civil. I felt they were both civil. We did not get into a contest of stupidity."
And among voters who expressed concern with the attacks that have marked the closing days of the campaign, the blame was mostly affixed to Mr. Bradley, who stepped up his attacks on the final weekend. "It does bother me that Bradley had started to become negative in the last few days," said Mary Ann Kristiansen, 36, and a Democrat who said she had been leaning toward voting for Mr. Bradley. "It only hurts the Democratic Party. I thought he'd stay away from it."
Unlike past years, voters offered relatively little criticism of other candidates in expressing their choice. Again and again, they said they would be satisfied with a number of choices. "McCain, Bradley and Gore -- they all would make good candidates," said Al Souma, 68, a local retired manufacturing manager.
Irving Sheppard, who was having breakfast at Mary Ann's Diner, said he was voting for Senator John McCain, but added: "I feel quite good about my candidate, and not that he's the best of a bad bunch."
Finally, as politicians in other states question New Hampshire's oversized influence in the political process, most voters said they were not about to abdicate their position -- and pointed to the events taking place outside their windows in explaining why.
"In the Washington area, you never see the candidates, you just get stuck in traffic behind them," said Mike Ward, 53, an administrator at Keene State College, who moved here from Virginia last year. "The access here is phenomenal."
"Live free or die," declared Charles Butterfield, 83, a retired postmaster who lives near here as he repeated the state slogan. "In New Hampshire, you don't push us around."
Brenda Canada, a violence mediator from Portsmouth, said: "We are an eclectic people. We are highly intelligent. We are highly educated."
For all their satisfaction over how the run-up to the primary has played out, many voters here said they were ready for it all to end on Tuesday.
"I like it -- as long as it doesn't go on too much longer," said Al Dimmock, 62, a retired truck driver from Derry. "After a while it gets pretty boring."
Ms. Tramontozzi said she was eager for the politicking to end. "It seems like the only thing you see on television is campaign, campaign, campaign," she said.
Doug Crooker, 54, a machinist who is on disability and lives near Peppermint Corner, said he had been besieged for weeks by mailings and telephone calls from campaigns. As a mail carrier tried to jam more literature into his mailbox this afternoon, Mr. Crooker, who was shoveling the snow from his sidewalk, waved him off: "No political mail. Please."
The mail carrier commiserated with an understanding chuckle. "I don't blame you," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
A Day's Surge in Shares Can't Erase a Weak Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended their first losing month since September with a rally yesterday, as investors bought beaten-down telecommunications and financial shares.
Investors are betting that after the Federal Reserve raises interest rates as expected this week, "they're probably going to be on hold for a while," said Mark Tincher, chief investment officer for stocks at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, which manages $65 billion. "Earnings growth still looks pretty good, and the market should be O.K." 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 34.30 points, or about 2.5 percent, to 1,394.46, as telecommunications stocks gained. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 201.66, or nearly 1.9 percent, to 10,940.53, led by American Express and J. P. Morgan. The Nasdaq composite index erased a 139-point loss, closing at 3,940.35, up 53.28, or almost 1.4 percent, as the shares of Qualcomm, the most-active issue, surged more than 15 percent.
The Nasdaq began its turnaround about 2:15 p.m. with a so-called short squeeze: investors who bet on short-term declines in stocks by selling borrowed shares were forced to buy back the shares when it became clear that stocks were not going to tumble further.
"If the market is going against you, you're going to scramble to cover," said Joseph Keating who oversees $6.5 billion at the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The Nasdaq had plunged early, as investors unloaded shares on concern the Fed would increase interest rates more than expected in coming months, crimping corporate profit. The Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting today.
Financial stocks, which are normally hurt by higher interest rates, gained in part because they have lagged the rest of the market for most of the last year. J. P. Morgan, down almost 7.5 percent over 12 months, climbed 4 7/8, to 122 15/16.
American Express advanced 6 1/2, to 164 3/4. It has dropped 4 percent since reaching a high on Dec. 12.
Qualcomm climbed 16 3/4, to 127, paring the Nasdaq's loss, after the developer of digital mobile phone technology said it was very close to an agreement with China United Telecommunications, which could lead to widespread use of its products in China.
That gain helped trim Qualcomm's losses so far this year to 37 percent. Qualcomm was the S.& P. 500's biggest gainer in 1999, rising 27-fold.
Earlier, the Nasdaq had fallen more than 10 percent from its record, its second correction this month. The index lost more than 10 percent in intraday trading on Jan. 4-6, closing with a loss of just under 10 percent. It then rebounded to a record 4,235.40 on Jan. 21. The index has yet to close at 10 percent below a high this year.
For the month, the Nasdaq declined 3.17 percent, the S.& P. 500 fell 5.1 percent, and the Dow dropped 4.8 percent.

Treasury Rally Stalls
 
By Reuters
Long-term Treasury securities snapped a six-day rally and traded lower yesterday.
The Federal Reserve's policy-setting body meets for two days on today and tomorrow and is widely expected to raise its short-term federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32, to 95 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.48 percent from 6.45 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of a three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.595	97.116	High Rate	5.56%	5.70%	Investment Rate	5.73%	5.97%	Low Rate	5.47%	5.60%	Median Rate	5.54%	5.67%	Total applied for	$30,205,838	$24,987,918	Accepted	$12,551,458	$10,585,918	Noncompetitive	$1,448,432	$1,118,326	
 
Both issues are dated Feb. 3, 2000. The three-month bills mature on May 4, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 3, 2000.

 CORRECTION:
The introduction to a chart in Business Day on Feb. 1 tracing the performance of the Nasdaq composite index during years in which it fell in January -- as it did this year -- referred incorrectly to the behavior that followed in those years. As shown on the graph, the index later rose in three of the years; it did not fall in all seven.

Chart: "Down in January"
The Nasdaq composite index rallied yesterday, but still ended January down 3.17 percent. It was only the eighth January in the history of the Nasdaq composite, which goes back to February 1971, that the index fell during the month.
In the seven previous years with a January decline, the index ended the year below the January close. But in 18 of the 21 years that the index rose in January, it ended the year with a gain.

HEADLINE: Commuting Long Distances and Loving It

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Like millions of other Americans, Lillian and Philip Silver drive from their house in the suburbs on Monday mornings and head for work. But the similarity ends there.
A few minutes later, Mrs. Silver is dropped off at Greater Rochester International Airport, where she boards a USAirways jet to La Guardia Airport 250 miles away and then takes a $25 taxi ride to her job in Lincoln Center as director of development for the Metropolitan Opera. Time elapsed from door to door: almost three hours. For the rest of the week, though, Mrs. Silver can walk in a few minutes from Lincoln Center to the couple's Upper West Side apartment. 
 It will probably be a long time before commuting by jet becomes commonplace. But in today's booming economy, it is no longer an oddity. Mrs. Silver is one of about a dozen people who commute weekly by airliner from metropolitan Rochester, population one million, to New York City.
In other parts of the country, the trend is more pronounced. Consider those who commute to Silicon Valley, where the median home price is more than $400,000. Planes flying into San Jose, Calif., on Monday mornings are filled with workers who have spent weekends with their families in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah where that kind of money can buy a mini-mansion or a small horse ranch.
Likewise, Friday afternoon and evening flights leaving Dallas, Houston and Austin, Tex., are full, as people leaving jobs in one of those cities fly to their homes in the suburbs of one of the other cities, a commuting style encouraged by the low-fare Southwest Airlines, which is based at Love Field in Dallas.
"Commuting by plane is not that unusual, I discovered," Mrs. Silver said. "The finance director at the Met commutes from Minneapolis. There are other people at Lincoln Center who commute from Florida and other places. People made me feel it was quite exotic at first, but I keep meeting more people who do it."
Mrs. Silver began commuting in 1987 when she left a marketing job at a Rochester steam utility, a far cry from her dream of finding a professional home in the art world, and enrolled in Columbia University's M.B.A. program.
"My husband would say, 'We have two children, and three are away at school,' " she said. When she graduated from Columbia, the business school asked her to stay on as director of corporate relations, "and it was too appealing not to accept," she said. She had worked her way up to the post of associate dean when the Metropolitan Opera hired her in 1997 to head its fund-raising operation. Her husband practices law in Rochester.
Though living alone for four or five days a week has its down side, it also has its rewards. Commuters can earn hundreds of thousands of frequent-flier miles annually, for example, and those who stick to one airline can get upgrades to first class on nearly every flight even while traveling on the cheapest advance-purchase fares.
Moreover, a spouse who makes a good salary in a high-cost metropolis like New York or San Francisco can afford a home and way of life in a midsize city hundreds of miles away that colleagues can only dream of, even after taking into account the cost of the travel and a small apartment.
The explanations for these highflying commutes range from careers that put spouses in different cities to the pull of living in a smaller community with good schools to the expectation (often misconceived) that a job in another city will last only a couple of years and is not worth a move.
For Kirk Sapa, who commutes to Manhattan for his job as executive vice president of United Way of Tri-State, and his wife, Dr. Sharon Center, who teaches veterinary medicine at Cornell University in Ithaca, the reason was professional fulfillment.
"We don't have children," Mr. Sapa said, "which makes this far more doable. And while others have a hard time comprehending it because they don't do it, the reality in this New York market is that I probably spend less time commuting than most people in the suburbs do." Mr. Sapa drives his pickup truck to the Ithaca Airport, flies a USAirways prop jet to La Guardia, takes an airport bus to the Marine Air Terminal and hops the water taxi to the United Way office on Wall Street. He spends evenings at an apartment the couple bought in Brooklyn Heights, a short subway ride from his office.
Some people with children find long-distance commuting not only doable, but also desirable. Two years ago Jim and Laura Plant moved their children Conner, now 7, and Delaney, 4, from a tract home on a cramped lot in Silicon Valley to a 5,000-square-foot manor on three acres in Salem, Ore. Since then, Mr. Plant, 39, has been driving an hour to Portland on Mondays to take the 10 a.m. Alaska Airlines 100-minute flight to San Jose, where he climbs into his Mercedes-Benz and drives to his job as communications director of ReplayTV, a maker of technology for recording television programs on a hard disk.
"In Oregon, you can buy a really nice home," Mr. Plant said. "Sure, my kids miss their dad, but I think they enjoy the quality of their life in Oregon. And Mom isn't working, while if we lived in Silicon Valley she probably she would be if we were going to maintain any lifestyle at all.
"People have a lot of different reactions to my commute, from 'I can understand why you are doing it,' to 'Gosh, I couldn't be away from my family for five days.' "
Like many people who commute to work by air, Mr. Plant has a job that involves a lot of travel. He was interviewed by telephone while in New Orleans on a business trip.
For workaholics, commuting by jet can be a convenient way to separate work and play. Consider Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of the Intel Corporation, who for 11 years has been boarding planes in Arizona for the 600-mile trek to his job in Silicon Valley.
"While in Santa Clara, I can work 16 hours a day and not worry about being late getting home," Mr. Barrett, who works Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays in California, said in an e-mail interview. "I usually have dinner meetings the two nights I am away from home to maximize the use of my time."
His wife, Barbara, also travels on business, he said, so "a side benefit of all this is that we can often arrange our business travel to meet in interesting spots for a weekend away."
David Cay Johnston commutes weekly by jetliner to New York City from Rochester, where his wife, Jennifer Leonard, the president of the Rochester Area Community Foundation, and their daughters live.

HEADLINE: In a Changing City, New York Character

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
MANHATTAN has at least 30 shops that have a superb selection of cheeses. It has only one Di Palo's.
The store opened in 1910 in Little Italy as a latteria, selling only fresh cheese, milk and butter. Ninety years later it carries products from aged pecorino to dry-cured sausages, many found nowhere else in the city. Patrons brave long waits on weekends to compare the winter Parmigiano-Reggiano with the fall version; to see what makes the store's dried figs so different; to try a slice of the sopresatta and a hunk of the mozzarella warm from its water bath. 
 Di Palo's is just one of a handful of specialty markets in Manhattan that are still doing business the way they did when schmaltz herring and fresh mozzarella were sold out of barrels. Although they may lack the fame of a Zabar's or a Balducci's, these small culinary treasures do it the old way, specialists in a generalist's world.
I spent last week at five of these gems, soaking up the atmosphere and receiving a crash course in how to survive recessions, depressions, changing neighborhoods and demographics. In addition to Di Palo's, I explored Russ & Daughters, famous for schmaltz herring on the Lower East Side; William Poll, a fancy-food store for the Upper East Side carriage trade; Poseidon Bakery, making its own phyllo dough in what was once called Hell's Kitchen; and Faicco's, a Greenwich Village market that majors in pork.
All were opened by European immigrants who arrived around the turn of the last century. Their current owners, all descendants of the founders, take a hands-on approach. They choose employees who, like them, love to schmooze. They know most of their customers by name and are never stumped by their questions. They worked in the stores as children and have learned to change with the times and persevere.
Luigi Di Palo, better known as Lou, runs one of the oldest latterias in New York with his sister and brother. Di Palo's was opened by their great-grandfather, half a block from its present location at Grand and Mott Streets. Today it is one of the few Italian shops left in what is now an extension of Chinatown, and it even attracts Chinese shoppers for its sausages and hams, Mr. Di Palo said.
The 800-square-foot store is packed with hundreds and hundreds of Italian products, including more than 85 pecorino cheeses. It's easy to see why people come from long distances to wait their turn. The sights, the sounds, the aromas are transporting. Mr. Di Palo, 48, said the family strives to run the shop the way his grandparents did. "When people shopped in their store, it was like coming into their home," he said. "It was: 'Sit down. Have a glass of wine. Try this piece of cheese.' People can still taste anything they want in the store. The counters were deliberately made only waist high for closer contact with the customers."
RUSS & DAUGHTERS, on the Lower East Side, now sells cream cheese made from tofu, under a portrait of the founder, Joel Russ, who started his business with a horse and wagon, expanded to a pushcart and opened a store on Orchard Street in 1914. "My grandfather looks down at the tofu cream cheese, and I always think the picture is going to fall down," said Mark Federman, 54, a son of one of the three daughters in the store's name.
But adding more New Age products to its stock of smoked fish and chopped liver is one way the Jewish "appetizing" store has survived the ups and downs of East Houston Street. For years, the coin of that realm was drugs, not chopped herring. "I used to wonder what would die first, me or the store," said Mr. Federman, who came to help out in 1978, when his father was ill, and never returned to the world of high-powered litigators.
To change with the times, the mix of foods has been carefully altered to keep both the old loyalists and the new customers happy. Alongside the belly lox and pot cheese and the huge barrels of pickles, there are breakfast muffins, olive oils, imported cheeses, bagel bread pudding and that tofu cream cheese. The store has been artfully redone to retain its atmosphere. The display cases have that 1940's look, and while the linoleum is gone from the floor, the tiny hexagonal black and white tiles have the look of the 1920's, when the founder moved the store to this location.
Joel Russ brought in his three daughters because he had no sons, and it became a shtick, Mr. Federman said: "Three pretty young girls picking out herrings from the barrel and slicing lox."
His mother, Anne Federman, now retired, the youngest of the three girls, picks up the story from Florida, where she lives within minutes of her sisters: "My father had no patience," she said. "If a customer said a word to him that wasn't right, he would chase her out of the store. But we girls had patience."
AN unsuspecting shopper walking into William Poll on the Upper East Side would probably not have a clue that the store is 78 years old, that the food prepared fresh in the open kitchen had supplanted the old stock of milk and soda and S. S. Pierce products, the gold standard of canned goods until the 1950's.
The sleek and elegant shop, with gleaming brass chandeliers, was redone in the 1970's and still carries a few packaged goods for the convenience of shoppers. But most of the store has been turned over to refrigerator and freezer cases, which hold dishes made from the recipes of the matriarch, Christina Poll, 81, who came to work with her husband during World War II. It originated as a corner market opened by William Poll's brother a couple of blocks up Lexington Avenue (it moved in 1952) and found its silk-stocking niche.
The William Poll brief remains the same as it was nearly eight decades ago: to offer simple, straightforward, top-quality food to people who can afford $16-a-pound chicken salad. Shepherd's pie and baked potato chips and beef Wellington are all available; the shop carries a vast assortment of hors d'oeuvres made with the special Pollonaise sauce, a cream-based garlic mayonnaise that was devised by Mrs. Poll's husband, the late William Poll, a Greek immigrant. It will take orders for any of 185 main dishes; it sells seven different quiches, five souffles, three dozen sandwiches. A four-course catered dinner featuring rack of lamb is $45 to $60 a person.
"A lot of people go out to restaurants for trendy food," said Stanley Poll, a son of the founder, who runs the store with his brother James, 48. "But at home, it's back to basics. The only thing we don't do is sushi."
Today, much of the business is done with caterers and wholesalers and over the phone, but Mr. Poll said the store will always be there. "Not having customers in the store is like throwing away a franchise," he said.
William Poll is no longer just a neighborhood shop. The family says customers call from all over the country to order prepared dishes. "If we depended on shelf items, we'd be just another me-too," said Stanley Poll.
James Poll, who was a filmmaker, came back to the business four years ago. "It's in the blood," he said. "We know everyone's name. We know what they want."
POSEIDON BAKERY has been on Ninth Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets since 1952, and certainly the interior does not seem to have changed much in the interim -- the display cases and the faded blue and white paint could stand a little sprucing up. But Poseidon has a timeless appeal: it is the only Greek pastry shop in New York where the phyllo dough is still made by hand.
At least four days a week, often more, the shop produces 50 to 60 pounds of the tissue-thin dough, the foundation of cheese and spinach pies and endless sweets. A simple mixture of flour and water, the dough is mixed and rolled and rested and stretched on huge tables over heavy muslin in the back of the shop. Then it rests again and dries and is finally cut, to be used for all the phyllo pastries and to sell in sheets.
The trick to making phyllo is to pull the dough until it is almost transparent without tearing it. Unlike machine-made dough, the handmade phyllo is "light, it has more elasticity, it's easier to handle, it stays moist longer and it has no additives," said Lili Fable, who owns the shop with her husband, Anthony, and has just turned it over to their 30-year-old son, Paul. The handmade phyllo sells for $5.50 a pound at Poseidon, compared with $3 a pound for machine-made dough.
Along with mastering phyllo, Paul Fable, who was in the restaurant business until October, will be learning the intricacies of Greek pastries: how to shape and bake the many-layered Greek sweets like baklava, and savories like cheese, spinach meat or vegetable turnovers.
Poseidon was opened by the elder Mr. Fable's mother and stepfather in 1923 on West 41st Street. Today the clientele for its phyllo has changed, the Fables say. There are fewer Greek customers, though they always show up on Greek holidays. Now, caterers and young Americans who have gone to cooking school make up the bulk of the retail business.
Since Ninth Avenue's fortunes have improved, Paul Fable plans to modernize Poseidon. At first he hopes to add a few chairs and tables and a coffee machine, but eventually he wants to branch out and sell to gourmet shops and restaurants and on the Internet. "My parents and grandparents always wanted to keep it small, but each generation is a little different," he said.
THE first thing you notice about Faicco's Pork Store on Bleecker Street is that it is spotless, not showing its 50-some years at all. Edward Faicco, representing the third generation to work in the family business, says he is almost as proud of that as he is of his vast assortment of Italian prepared foods.
The second thing you notice is the meat counter with butchers behind it waiting to cut exactly what you want. People come for a single sausage or five pounds, a single chop or enough to feed a large family. "In a supermarket, if you want to ask a question you have to walk down the aisles to find someone," Mr. Faicco said, "and then they don't answer you. I make everyone who works here prepare everything, so they know."
Faicco's was opened on Thompson Street in 1900 by Mr. Faicco's grandfather and moved to Bleecker Street in the 1940's. A Brooklyn outpost opened in the 1950's.
Until 20 years ago, Faicco's sold only pork, but little by little it filled its cases with other meats and poultry and its shelves with Italian products, from pasta to canned tomatoes. In the last 10 years it has added items like fried mozzarella sticks, fried ravioli, prosciutto balls and lasagna. But its fame still rests on pork, particularly the sausages it makes, both the dry types, prepared in the Brooklyn store, and the fresh, made right here several times a day.
At a time when specialty stores like Dean & DeLuca and Balducci's are increasingly faceless since the founders have sold out, these mom-and-pop stores still provide the authentic personality that always has appeal in an increasingly homogeneous world.

Creating Waves In Nonprofit Sea

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Several years ago, a success story at the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago came perilously close to morphing into a public relations disaster.
Built in 1930, Shedd could handle up to 9,000 visitors a day. Then, in 1991, it opened an oceanarium that featured dolphin shows, drawing new visitors. But the oceanarium could accommodate only 7,500 people, and on busy days guards had to turn away hundreds of visitors, some of whom were angry after having driven for hours with their children to see the shows. 
 The overcrowding threatened to get worse if nothing was done before Shedd finished two exhibitions to reproduce the environments of the Amazon River and the Philippine coral reefs. Those additions will also have limited space.
For a solution, Shedd turned to one of the country's pre-eminent strategic consulting firms, Bain & Company, which charges corporate clients multimillion-dollar fees but like its competitors also does work free for nonprofits. Sure enough, by teasing out patterns in a sea of details the aquarium had compiled on visitors, from their ZIP codes to their ages and number of children, Bain came up with a plan to persuade local groups to visit on slow days.
Not so long ago, that achievement would have been soon forgotten, just another good deed by a consulting firm with corporate clients around the world who pay Bain an estimated $700 million annually for advice.
But now, because of a project that was nine years in the making and that was officially started four weeks ago, such sophisticated advice forms the backbone of a new initiative by Bain.
The initiative, the Bridge Group, has close ties to Bain but is a legally separate nonprofit organization. It has a staff of 12 of the best and brightest consultants from Bain's ranks who have committed themselves to stints at Bridge of six months to a year, even though they have to take pay cuts ranging from 80 percent for million-dollar-a-year Bain executives to 20 percent for junior consultants.
The Bridge Group is something entirely new in the world of big league business consulting -- a general-purpose strategic consulting firm that will help other nonprofit organizations for a fee.
Its aim is to complement the piecemeal, pro bono approach that Bain and others have long taken toward helping nonprofits solve management and logistical woes. The group will offer the consistent, sustained advice that has helped big business wring more profit out of each invested dollar. It will also enhance the quality of help now provided by a plethora of nonprofit consultants, ranging from one-person shops to niche agencies, mostly focused on fund-raising or management.
It is, Bain consultants believe, a long overdue step. After all, the United States has about 770,000 nonprofits, not counting religious organizations, which last year took in an estimated $750 billion in fees, grants, donations and investment earnings. But despite accounting for 8 percent of the economy, nonprofits get little attention in the business pages or from big consulting firms precisely because they are not in business to make investors rich.
Many nonprofit experts expect a wave of consolidation among nonprofits, just like the mergers that have swept through corporations over the last decade, as organizations seek the scale necessary for success in the 21st century. The creation of a strategic consulting firm for nonprofits is likely to encourage such a trend. For all its growth, however, the nonprofit sector is highly fragmented, with many organizations too small to accomplish much and many duplicating the works of other organizations.
"There simply is no force to push consolidations and to move organizations to an appropriate scale to fulfill their mission," said Thomas J. Tierney, Bain's worldwide managing director and father of the idea for the Bridge Group.
Moreover, about half the growth in nonprofit revenue in the last two decades came from fees charged for services that range from counseling troubled families to renting out space in churches to day-care providers. Donations accounted for only 8 percent of the growth.
Mr. Tierney's vision is not just to help individual nonprofits, but to build a storehouse of knowledge that can be applied to common problems among nonprofits in the same way that Bain can help a ketchup maker improve profits by reviewing work it did for mustard and pickle makers.
"Pro bono consulting for nonprofits often doesn't produce results because it is in and out," Mr. Tierney said. "They often have no follow-up because the ugly fact is that, ultimately, you get what you pay for."
Each project will include follow-up consultations so the insights that Bridge Group consultants develop do not gather dust on a shelf but are adopted and refined through practical experience.
The Bridge Group's consultants all have full access to the wealth of knowledge that Bain has stored in its Bain Virtual University, a database in which every corporate client's project is reduced to a case study, called a "knowledge module," so that the wheel does not get invented over and over again. This gathering and storing of information is a critical element in the efficiency and profitability of big consulting firms.
The Bridge Group, which has small offices in Boston and San Francisco, will charge fees that will generally be only about one-fifth what Bain charges for-profit corporate clients and in many cases will be paid by foundations, said Jeffrey L. Bradach, a former Harvard business professor who is the managing director of the Bridge Group.
This year, Bridge will handle perhaps 10 clients, one of them a major foundation that Mr. Bradach declined to identify. "The presenting problem was that they give away tens of millions of dollars a year but don't know what they really produce for that money," Mr. Bradach said.
The Bridge Group will analyze the donations, trying to show the foundation how to get results that further its agenda. That kind of insight into how grant-making can produce tangible results has been the Holy Grail of nonprofit evaluators. Mr. Bradach says his staff has the expertise to apply strategic consulting, over time, to improve the effect of grants.
The Bridge Group began with an idea sketched on the back of napkins at a Mexican restaurant in Silicon Valley. Mr. Tierney and Paul L. Carttar, another Bain consultant, were reviewing what they had learned from work for various charities in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the San Francisco United Way, and were bemoaning the lack of a vehicle to apply what they had learned to other nonprofits.
"Because these were pro bono projects there was no knowledge capture," Mr. Tierney said, using consultant jargon to explain that valuable insights were not reduced to case studies and stored for use by other consultants on future projects.
As the two men looked at the stack of napkins covered with notes, Mr. Tierney recalled, he told Mr. Carttar: "Gosh, there has got to be a way to do this in a sustainable manner."
Seven years later, when Mr. Tierney first sketched his idea for a reporter, it did not have a name. But soon two teams from Bain began working on the idea and, after 18 drafts of a business plan, they came up with a low-cost model built around highly motivated consultants working at low pay for fixed periods.
Bain made a $1.3 million grant for the project and then Mr. Tierney, Mr. Carttar and Mr. Bradach, the co-founders, went looking for outside financing, securing a total of $5.5 million from the Edna McConnell Clark, Rockefeller Brothers and Surdna foundations, all in New York, and the Irvine Foundation in San Francisco.
Edward Skloot, executive director of the Surdna Foundation, which has a $650 million endowment, said the Bridge Group was a critical step in improving nonprofit governance and management. "We see value in developing knowledge that can be shared" with other nonprofits, he said.
For Mr. Tierney, starting the Bridge Group is a chance to create a legacy in the world of big league consulting, an idea that could transform nonprofit management.
"If we can prove this model works, then someone else is going to do it and we want that," he said. "If one of the other big consulting firms doesn't do this in the next few years, it would be a mark against our idea."
The project has become his consuming passion. As he spoke, he took a sheet from a legal pad and, without pausing in his remarks, sketched a matrix comparing the Bridge Group model with the existing system under which firms and nonprofit consulting agencies both do cut-rate or free work for charities.
Soon, Mr. Tierney's jotting had grown into 28 boxes, an illustration of how consultants take reams of information that can easily overwhelm both corporate and nonprofit managers and reduce it to its basic components, then devise ways to deal with those components efficiently.
One question that Mr. Tierney and his co-founders say they repeatedly encountered as they sought financing was: What does Bain get out of this?
For one thing, its gets a relief valve for star consultants who might otherwise leave to become chief executives at corporations but now have the option of spending six months or more on socially redeeming work instead of helping condiment makers squeeze more profits out of their factories. Indeed, more than one-third of Bain's 2,400 full-time professionals have volunteered to work at the Bridge Group.
Only the best will get the chance, Mr. Tierney said, and they will "have to be very, very, very good."
So will the host of potential clients who have begun sending proposals to the Bridge Group, which when fully staffed will be able to handle about 40 a year. "We must be very careful about who are clients are," he said, "because as consultants you can't be any better than your client base."

HEADLINE: Talk by Putin Skips the War, But Albright Reminds Him

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In a surprise appearance at a Middle East conference here, the acting president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, sat down two chairs away from the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and delivered his first foreign policy statement, which within 15 minutes delineated the differences between the two countries.
Yet in his brisk, businesslike summary of fairly standard points, Mr. Putin did not mention the war in Chechnya. Russia considers the war an internal affair, but Washington continues to press Moscow to negotiate a settlement to end it. 
 He did pointedly single out the "threat of the destruction of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty," a reference to the Clinton administration's desire to modify the major arms control treaty between the United States and Russia. And he referred to Russia's desire for an indivisible Europe, a rejoinder to Washington's expansion of NATO to include former Soviet satellite countries.
Then, Dr. Albright replied in kind.
Without using the word Chechnya, she said the progress toward a political solution in the Middle East should be used as an example for how to resolve the war in the republic.
"I believe our work here today is not only important for promoting peace in the Middle East, but should also be a model for all of us who seek to end difficult and painful conflicts," she said. "Conflicts within states, as well as those between states, threaten our common security."
She reminded Mr. Putin that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which the United States and Russia are members, had recently assigned itself a role in resolving conflicts within countries.
After listening to Dr. Albright's rejoinder, Mr. Putin and the secretary of state shook hands, and Mr. Putin left the conference hall as quickly as he came.
Dr. Albright and Mr. Putin will meet on Wednesday at the Kremlin in a session that the Clinton administration hopes will give it its first close-up assessment of the man who replaced Boris N. Yeltsin.
As Dr. Albright prepared today for the Kremlin meeting, reports from Chechnya said that the rebels had left the capital, Grozny, presenting the secretary an opportunity to press her argument that the war had to be resolved through negotiation. One of Dr. Albright's senior aides said the secretary would use the "politically obvious" moment to argue again for a political resolution in Chechnya. Whether Mr. Putin, who has vowed to crush the separatist rebels, would heed the advice was another matter, the aide said.
The Clinton administration has been trying to forge a policy that expresses distaste for the methods the Russian military is using in Chechnya without so antagonizing Russia that relations are totally soured.
Dr. Albright said Moscow faced increasing isolation from other nations if it continued to shun negotiations over Chechnya. But there are also limits to the isolation that Washington wants to impose on Moscow as the administration tries to negotiate a new arms control agreement and engage Russia on other issues, including the Middle East.
The Middle East conference here, which was co-directed by Russia and the United States, was described by Dr. Albright as an example of the common ground that Washington and Moscow could forge. The gathering brought together the foreign ministers of most Middle East countries -- including Israel, although not Syria or Lebanon -- to discuss practical issues like refugees, water and economic development.
The conference was created at the Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991 as a permanent mechanism for dealing with matters that caused instability in the region. But the steering committee of the conference, consisting of foreign ministers, had not met since 1992, and lower-level officials had not met since 1996, when the peace effort between Israel and the Palestinians slowed down.
At the end of the gathering this afternoon, the foreign ministers announced that permanent committees had been formed on refugees, water, regional development and the environment, and that they would report back to the ministers in July.
A senior administration official said the discussion among the foreign ministers had been "practical rather than theoretical." He said many of the usual rhetorical flourishes had been dropped.
This was a sign, he said, that countries in the Middle East believed that the negotiations now under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and between the Israelis and the Syrians, were more likely to produce results than in the past.
At the very least, the official said, the conference and the continuation of its work "enhanced" the environment for the talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Israelis and the Syrians.

Trillions and Trillions

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
An old classmate of mine, who went on to become a Latin American finance minister, once brought his technical experts to a meeting with a U.S. Treasury official. The official was furious. "Get your expletive numbers guys out of here," he yelled -- which was how the U.S.-educated technical team subsequently referred to themselves.
All of which is by way of apology for today's column, in which I am going to be, at least a bit, a numbers guy. But then my subject is a numbers issue: how big a tax cut can a presidential candidate responsibly offer? 
 Of course, it depends on what the candidate plans to do about spending. Big tax cuts won't break the budget if they go along with, say, significant reductions in Social Security and Medicare benefits. But the truth -- or at least the conventional wisdom -- is that post-Clintonian America has reached a sort of equilibrium, in which the median voter wants a government that is neither much bigger nor much smaller than it currently is. And assuming that it is a Bush-Gore election (despite last night's results), both candidates will at least pretend to respect that equilibrium. How much money does that leave on the table?
If you have been reading the headlines, you probably think that the answer is, quite a lot. After all, didn't the Congressional Budget Office just estimate that thanks to our booming economy the federal government will run a surplus over the next decade of $1.9 trillion? And doesn't this mean that the budget can easily accommodate even the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts being proposed by George W. Bush?
No. To see why, you have to look at the, um, numbers.
The key question is, What would it mean to keep the size of government about the same as it currently is? A reasonable man -- and Mr. Bush's economists are, as I said last week, reasonable men -- might guess that it means keeping "real discretionary spending per person" more or less constant. Note the modifiers. "Discretionary," meaning that nobody is proposing to scale back the big-ticket entitlement programs; "real," because if prices rise it costs more to provide the same services; "per person," because more people means more need for government services, which is why a populous state like -- to take a random example -- Texas has a bigger budget than its less populous neighbors.
Alas, that $1.9 trillion estimate was not based on anything like this reasonable notion. It was based on the assumption that total spending on discretionary programs will remain constant -- in ordinary, non-inflation-adjusted dollars -- for the next 10 years. Since the projection also assumes roughly 2 percent inflation, this means a large reduction in real spending. And since the population is going to grow over time, it means an even bigger cut in real spending per person. In other words, that big surplus number is based on the assumption of a drastic, even draconian reduction in government services.
As it happens, the C.B.O. also offered a more realistic projection based on the assumption that discretionary spending grows with inflation. That simple adjustment lops off more than a trillion dollars. But because the population is growing, that still means a substantial decline in per capita spending -- and since some programs cannot or will not be cut, it means deep cuts in what remains.
How much is really on the table? I've done my own back-of-the-spreadsheet calculation of how the C.B.O.'s surplus projection would change if real spending grew with population; the adjustment brings the total down to around $400 billion.
So how can those reasonable men advising George Bush think that he can offer $1.3 trillion in tax cuts? Assuming that they are neither planning to raid Social Security nor counting on favorable revenue surprises to save them (unfavorable surprises are, of course, out of the question), they must have in mind a sharp scaling back of government programs.
But that, of course, is not at all what the candidate's rhetoric suggests. He seems to be saying that he only wants to stop those Washington politicians from initiating grandiose new spending schemes. There is little hint that his "compassionate conservatism" can be financed only if the government sharply cuts back on what it is doing now.
If you ask me, it's time he had a little chat with his numbers guys.

HEADLINE: A Wedge in the Cuban Embargo

 BODY:
Cubans have been told for many years that the decades-long American trade embargo against their country prevents them from buying even aspirin from their northern neighbor. President Fidel Castro has long used American restrictions on the sale of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba as an example of Washington's apparent inhumanity -- and a source of his own legitimacy. So last week's American health care exhibition in Havana raised eyebrows, if not actual sales. The exhibition was evidence of incremental changes in the embargo over the last few years that suggest the Clinton administration knows what ought to be done even as it avoids actually doing it.
Nearly 100 companies sent representatives to last week's exhibition, the first American trade show in Cuba since the embargo was imposed four decades ago. In turn, some 8,000 Cuban medical professionals got a look at everything from sophisticated surgical equipment to Pepto-Bismol. 
 Under the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, medical supplies are technically eligible for sale to Cuba. But they are subject to a complex web of licensing and certification requirements that have made it all but impossible to make an actual sale. Over the last several years the Clinton administration has quietly eased some of these requirements. But significant obstacles remain -- not least the embargo's prohibition against direct banking relationships between the United States and Cuba.
The exhibition shows that American businesses are eager to open the Cuban market. The administration's policy of nibbling away at an obsolete embargo merely cedes a potentially lucrative market to foreign competitors. The time is long overdue for a bolder form of engagement.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Sprint Pays Top Dollar To Be Where It Wants

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
When new owners bought the 56,500-square-foot Gotham retail condominium at 86th Street and Third Avenue last August, they knew that the annual market rent for space on 86th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues was about $150 a square foot.
Four months later, the owners, a limited partnership led by Peter L. and Anthony E. Malkin, wound up leasing part of their condo -- a 3,173-square-foot store on that block -- to Sprint Spectrum, a division of the Sprint Corporation, at an average annual rent of $216 a square foot, more than 40 percent above market. 
 It is, real estate brokers said, a new high for retail rents on the block, at least in recent memory.
"It's a matter of supply and demand," said Fred C. Posniak, vice president of W & M Properties, the real estate management, marketing and acquisition arm of the Malkin family, which has commercial and residential operations in eight states. "Availability on that block has always been tight. You can't get space there. And Sprint very much wanted to be there. They were looking for a seven-day-a-week operation, which this is. It sits near two movie theaters, so they can have nighttime traffic if they want it."
Mr. Posniak said he had received initial offers for the space from other companies, including clothing and electronics chains, of $200 a square foot. "I showed Sprint the offers," he said, "and I told them: 'You want the space? You have to pay for it.' And there was no hesitation."
Eighty-sixth between Lexington and Third includes retailers like HMV (on the west side of Lexington), Petco, New York Sports Clubs, Steve Madden shoes, Foot Locker, Strawberry and the Children's Place. A new Wolf Camera is to open just west of Lexington. The area is considered prime, Mr. Posniak said, in part because of the heavy pedestrian traffic created by the No. 4, 5 and 6 subway stop at 86th and Lexington, the only subway lines on the Upper East Side.
Annual rents on 86th east of Third Avenue -- on blocks that include retailers like P. C. Richard, Barnes & Noble, Circuit City and Gateway Country -- drop to $100 or $110 a square foot, he said.
The Sprint space has a 60-foot storefront on 86th Street and 33-foot ceilings. The store is to sell cellular phones and equipment. Interior construction begins this month, Mr. Posniak said, with an opening scheduled for early spring.
Howard I. Gilbert of Robert K. Futterman & Associates, who represented Sprint Spectrum in the deal, said that in addition to the advantages and attributes of the block, the space itself satisfied Sprint's needs.
"Sprint had a requirement for column-free space with a lot of street frontage, at least 35 feet," Mr. Gilbert said. "I researched the Upper East Side, all the main shopping streets, and found that there were only three spaces in the district that filled both requirements. Coincidentally, all three were on the same block. And only one was available." The other two are occupied by Strawberry, just west of Sprint, and the Children's Place, to the east, he said.
So even though the rent is high, "we got very lucky," he said. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
The Gotham retail condominium has three retail spaces -- the Loews Orpheum multiplex and a Bombay Company branch, both on Third Avenue between 86th and 87th Streets, and the store that Sprint will be taking over, on the north side of 86th, which had been occupied by Aeropostale, a clothing retailer. It sits at the base of a development that includes 239 residential apartments.
The Malkin partnership bought the retail condominium for $17.12 million in an all-cash transaction from an investment group that included Zeckendorf Realty; Goldman, Sachs & Company and Starwood Capital. It was bought under tax-deferred exchange rules, using proceeds of recent sales, among them the sale of the 1.1-million-square-foot office building at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, at the southwest corner of 47th Street, to a group led by Goldman, Sachs for $195 million.
Section 1031 of the federal tax code allows taxes on capital gains for income-producing properties to be deferred if the gains are reinvested in similar replacement assets that are identified within 45 days and bought within 180 days of the earlier sale.
One reason for buying the retail condominium, Mr. Posniak said, was Upper East Side demographics: between the East River and Central Park, from 72nd to 96th Street, there are 48,000 households, with an average annual income of $175,000; 17 percent of the households have incomes in excess of $250,000, and half the population is between age 25 and 49, prime spending years. "Our other two tenants have long-term leases," he said, "so this new lease, with such a dramatic increase in rent, gives us an immediate upside."
Benjamin Fox of the New Spectrum Realty brokerage company said that while the $216-a-square-foot average annual rent was clearly a new high for the block, he felt it was probably an aberration.
"National chains that feel they must be between Lexington and Third clearly understand the economics," Mr. Fox said, "but they are quite mindful of their competition. And in many instances, having the right location, even at way above market rent, is preferable to having a secondary location at a lower rent, where the competitor has a primary location. In this day and age, with brand-name promotional retailing, having a secondary spot is a no-no."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Awaiting Fed Decision, Investors Lift Beaten-Down Shares

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply yesterday as investors bought beaten-down shares of companies that had faltered during the latest debate over interest rates.
But as the Federal Reserve met in Washington, many investors remained concerned that a rate increase this week would be the first of several this year, making it difficult for companies to sustain the strong profit growth that has helped the market rebound from crushing losses last week. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.52 points, to 11,041.05, building on its 201-point gain on Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.82 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,409.28. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 111.63 points, or 2.8 percent, to 4,051.98.
After slumping in the morning, stocks rose on a growing sense that despite rising interest rates, which can cut into corporate profits, most companies would post strong earnings growth throughout the year.
"The earnings story continues to come in very strong across the board," said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist at J. P. Morgan's private client group. The companies that comprise the S.& P. 500 have posted average profit growth of 20.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 1999, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Mr. Wolfe said strong earnings were helping to distract investors from concerns that interest rates were headed sharply higher in a continuing effort to slow the pace of the nation's economic growth. Yesterday, the economy set a record for the longest expansion ever -- 107 months.
The economy has defied many analysts' expectations by maintaining a torrid rate of growth without significant inflation. The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 to keep inflation under control, and many economists believe the central bank will continue to raise rates because of the economy's unprecedented growth.
The latest suggestion that higher rates are on the way came yesterday from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which said in its monthly survey that manufacturing activity was continuing to grow and the price of raw materials was rising.
Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing money.
"When interest rates are rising, you look to companies that are accelerating their sales growth enough to compensate," Mr. Wolfe said. "Last year, technology was the sector that was able to do that."
Technology stocks gained ground yesterday as investors bet that they could repeat their strong performance in 2000. Cisco Systems, Qualcomm and Amazon.com all rose.
Much of the buying came from bargain-hunting investors eager to buy well-known technology names after many stocks in the sector fell last week, said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott & Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.

Treasury Prices Increase
 By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose on expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates enough today and in coming months to cool economic growth and keep inflation in check.
"The bond market believes the Fed is going to keep raising rates," until there are signs of slowing growth, said Kent Gasaway, who helps manage $1.5 billion at Kornitzer Capital Management and Buffalo Funds in Shawnee Mission, Kan.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32, to 96 2/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.42 percent from 6.48 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
CMS, a utility company formerly loved on Wall Street, cuts its dividend and faces disdain.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
HAVING almost gone broke in the 1980's back home in Michigan, CMS Energy -- the parent of Consumers' Power -- wowed Wall Street in the 1990's by going global and expanding into almost every part of the energy industry.
But that love affair appears to be over, or at least experiencing a crisis. Facing heavy debts and weaker profits from international operations than expected, CMS yesterday disclosed a financial restructuring plan. That plan will deeply cut dividend payments while raising cash by selling tracking stock tied to its old-fashioned utility business back in Michigan. 
 Investors reacted with anger, and the company's stock price fell to a four-year low as it dropped $6.50 a share, to $23.50 -- a figure that is less than half the peak reached in late 1998, when Wall Street was most impressed by the international diversification efforts.
What went wrong? Some things were beyond the company's control, most notably rising interest rates, which cut deep because much of the growth had been financed with borrowed money. But the company has also failed to produce the overseas profits it forecast, and it has zig-zagged regarding its financing strategy. Combined, the developments raise questions about management's ability to run, and to monitor, the vast operations it has acquired in recent years.
The biggest disappointment came from earnings that were far less than what the company had led Wall Street to expect. The company, which on Monday reported profits of $2.89 a share for 1999, had led analysts to expect about $3.30 in 2000. Now it is forecasting $2.50, before some special factors, a figure it forecasts will grow by 10 percent or more in 2001 and by 12 percent or more in 2002. The lower forecast reflects, among other things, reduced expectations for electricity plants in Argentina and Australia.
"We're very confident about our earnings forecasts going forward," said William T. McCormick, the company's chairman and chief executive, in a telephone interview. He voiced confidence that the stock would soon rebound.
In a conference call with analysts yesterday morning before trading began, Mr. McCormick said that he valued the local gas and electric utility in Michigan at about $25 a share, given the current share prices of other utilities.
If that analysis is correct, it would appear the rest of the company is now deemed to be worthless, with the stock priced at less than $25. Certainly the stock seems cheap, selling at less than 10 times the company's earnings forecast for this year.
In part, that appears to reflect a lack of confidence in the company's forecasts. Not only have earning forecasts come down, but just last fall the company was talking about selling enough assets to avoid having to issue more stock. Now it is planning to raise $600 million by selling tracking stock in the electric utility.
That stock would represent a 20 percent stake in the utility, and would be priced to produce a dividend yield of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent, Mr. McCormick said. The annual dividend of regular CMS stock will be cut to 40 cents a share from $1.46. Investors interested in dividends will be given the opportunity to exchange CMS shares for the new utility tracking shares. Like other tracking shares, they would be designed to trade like common stock of the subsidiary, but would legally represent an ownership stake in the entire company.
Mr. McCormick had been hailed for rescuing CMS from the verge of bankruptcy after it built a $4 billion nuclear plant in Midland, Mich., that never opened. He managed to convert that to a gas congeneration plant and he expanded the company into fields like interstate gas pipelines and oil exploration. It now has operations in 21 countries, including India, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil.
But along the way, the debt level -- already high as a result of the cost of building the nuclear plant -- rose as more acquisitions were made. Last year, the company delayed selling stock after spending $2.2 billion to buy gas pipelines from Duke Energy. That left it with an even heavier debt load as interest rates rose last year.
The new plan calls for the $600 million raised from selling the tracking stock to pay down debt. "That will permanently fix our balance sheet," Mr. McCormick said.
If Mr. McCormick's latest profit forecasts are accurate, then his forecast that the stock will rebound are likely to come true. But it may take some time for investors to regain their confidence in the company.

Extending A Hand, Not Cuffs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
THE police here are facing the same happy fate befalling departments around the country -- only more so.
Reported crime dropped 23 percent last year, easily beating the national average, and since 1990 has fallen almost by half. Last year, Stamford had the lowest rate of violent crime in the region. 
 This has left Stamford with what generals call a "peace dividend." Officers have time on their hands, or more than they did in the days of crack and killing.
Many departments have adopted new police methods with crime rates plunging, but Stamford has taken big steps away from the headquarters-and-radio-car mode of policing. It has become a community policing theme park, featuring a medley of strategies, many used elsewhere, and linking with schools and agencies like probation and corrections departments to weave officers into the life of the city.
Stamford, like other cities, is redefining the job of a police officer.
The department runs a summer camp with local teenagers as paid counselors. Officers are assigned to high schools and middle schools, not for security, but to teach and listen. At night, they visit families whose children have missed school repeatedly. Another program links officers with young offenders to get them schooling and jobs before they go bad as adults. Officers working with psychologists and social workers counsel children who are the victims or witnesses of crime.
Trenda Palmer, the president of the residents' council at Southfield Village, a public housing development where relations with the police were once raw, said that she was heartened to see children in police cruisers last summer who were not being taken into custody, but to police-sponsored baseball games. "The kids are playing and the officers are coaching," Ms. Palmer said.
With the new relationships, she said, the police "don't have that animosity against us, right now."
Lt. Robert Temme, an admitted "adrenaline junkie," said officers have had to find fulfillment in doing more than chasing bad guys. With less crime, he said, "If you weren't doing this, sometimes you wouldn't be doing anything at all." He slowed his patrol car in Southfield Village, pointing to the location of a new police operation. "Down the end of the block we took over an apartment and give music lessons to kids," he said.
Dean M. Esserman, the police chief since early 1998, said all this serves the mission of keeping the peace in this economically diverse city of 111,000. There is a heavy emphasis on stopping crime at its prime source -- adolescence. "You don't say, 'I'm giving up my law enforcement role; I'm going to be a social worker,' " he said. "Why can't you do both?"
So far, vocal skeptics are rare. But Philip Russell, a lawyer for two men who are suing the department, claiming excessive force by officers, said the police had now become involved in "domestic and business squabbles." He wonders if some strategies are just designed to avoid trimming the force. "The Police Department is trying to insinuate itself into parts of life where they really have no business," he said.
Mayor Dannel P. Malloy said he hired Chief Esserman because they both saw community policing "not as a program, but as the only way to police." Chief Esserman, 42, who was never an officer, was a prosecutor in Brooklyn when he fell under the spell of William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner. He became Mr. Bratton's general counsel at the New York Transit Police Department, then assistant police chief in New Haven and chief of the Metro-North police. He is following his mentor's playbook.
ARRIVING here, he signaled a change in the department's culture by halting a planned expansion of police headquarters. Instead, he divided the city into five districts, found donated space for substations, and put lieutenants in charge of each district. They are responsible for everything from fighting crime in their areas to recruiting citizen volunteers to help run the substations.
Chief Esserman is the first to admit there is still plenty to do. First, in a city where more than a third of residents are members of minority groups, only 36 of 313 officers are nonwhite.
Still, Charles G. Parks Jr., a lawyer and former president of the local N.A.A.C.P., said the biggest change was that "the police and the community they serve are not separate."
The test of that relationship will be how well Stamford, and cities making similar efforts, responds if crime rebounds. "It's the departments that capitalize on the drop," said Sgt. Ralph Romano, "that are going to benefit if things turn around."

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Index Rises For 12th Consecutive Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The American industrial sector grew in January for the 12th consecutive month, though at a slightly slower pace than in December, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday in a report that raised inflation worries.
And the Commerce Department said yesterday that construction spending surged 2 percent in December, pushing the amount of money spent on building single-family homes to a monthly record. 
 The figures confirmed that the country's economic expansion, which entered its 107th month of growth yesterday to become the longest on record, was continuing.
But a worrying jump in the prices of raw materials in the purchasing managers' report, to the highest reading in nearly five years, suggested that Federal Reserve policy makers, who began a two-day meeting in Washington yesterday, had even more reason to raise interest rates to cool the economy and try to prevent a surge in inflation.
"The manufacturing sector appears to have momentum, but prices are rising to levels of concern, particularly with a new round of petroleum price increases," said Norbert J. Ore, head of the purchasing managers' business survey committee.
The data on prices and concern about the Fed meeting briefly sent stocks lower, but bargain hunters helped them bounce back. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 100.52 points, to 11,041.05. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 231/32, to 96 29/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.42 percent, from 6.48 percent on Monday.
The purchasing managers' group said its manufacturing index, based on a national survey of executives who buy raw materials and other supplies for industry, registered 56.3 percent in January, down slightly from a revised 56.8 percent in December. A reading of more than 50 percent indicates growth.
The figure for January was slightly stronger than the 56 percent reading that analysts had expected. The index is watched closely because it is the first national reading monthly on American industrial performance. The survey polls executives from more than 350 industrial companies in the United States.
The component of the index that measures the prices factories pay for raw materials soared in January to 72.6 percent from a revised 68.3 percent the month before. The reading was the highest since April 1995, when the price index hit 74.5 percent.
The group said that 17 of 20 industries indicated higher prices, a trend that has become more evident the last five months, with persistent price readings of 60 percent or more.
The Commerce Department said that construction spending rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of $730.3 billion. That followed a revised 2 percent rise in November -- slightly less than the government had first estimated -- helped out by better-than-usual weather.
The December performance was much stronger than many analysts had expected. They were predicting that construction spending would fall by 0.3 percent in December. For the year, spending was up 6 percent, after rising 7.6 percent in 1998.

Job Cuts by Big French Auto Parts Maker Send Shares Lower

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Investors often reward companies that eliminate jobs and reorganize themselves to become more efficient. But shareholders in Valeo S.A. of France, one of Europe's largest automotive parts companies, sold heavily today on news that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or 12 percent of the total, in the next two years, and invest heavily in Latin America and Eastern Europe to shift its presence away from economically mature regions like North America and Western Europe.
By the end of trading here today, Valeo shares had fallen 9.9 percent, to 63.05 euros, or $61.34. The job reduction news was part of the company's announcement of 1999 annual results on Monday, after the stock market had closed. 
 Indeed at first glance, Valeo's earnings results looked strong. Profit increased 117 percent in 1999, to 563 million euros, on a 28 percent increase in revenue, to 7.7 billion euros. The company's chairman and chief executive, Noel Goutard, said Valeo would increase its dividend, which is paid in July, by 50 percent, to 1.5 euros.
But much of the profit gain was the result of a one-time increase from the sale of 50 percent of a German clutch maker, LuK G.m.b.H. Operating profit, on the other hand, rose only 14 percent to $472 million, despite the 28 percent revenue increase.
Moreover, problems nagging at Valeo's overall performance persisted in Latin America, where it generates only 3 percent of revenue; in parts of the electrical-equipment division, including the headlights unit; and in research and development, where costs rose 28 percent in 1999.
"The industry is seeing a lot of reorganization at the moment," said Jerry Raybold, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities in London. Valeo, he said, "is still in the testing ground."
Yet the measures announced by Mr. Goutard, who steps down in May, are far-reaching.
In the United States, which accounts for roughly one-third of the company's revenue, job cuts involve reorganizing ITT Automotive, a maker of brake and electrical systems in Auburn Hills, Mich., which Valeo acquired in 1998 for $1.7 billion. In Germany, Valeo is investing $54 million to upgrade its electrical-equipment manufacturing. But the major task facing Mr. Goutard's successor, Andre Navarri, 47, a former executive of the Alstom electronics group, who became Valeo's chief operating officer last year, will be to push the company into regions of potential growth, like Asia and Eastern Europe, and to expand businesses that promise high returns, like electronic systems and Internet-based distribution systems.
The goal of pushing into Asia got a boost last year, after the French automaker Renault, a major Valeo customer, acquired a 37 percent stake in the Nissan Motor Company of Japan. Catching this upwind, Valeo bought a Japanese engine parts and electronic-systems specialist, the Unisia Jecs Corporation, and the Zexel Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of fuel-injection and air-conditioning systems. Mr. Goutard has set his sights on a third Japanese acquisition, this time in the auto-electronics business.
To achieve its goals for new distribution methods, Valeo is setting up a $97 million investment fund to buy into start-up companies involved in automotive technology and Internet commerce.
Thus, some analysts think that investors punished Valeo too severely. Mr. Raybold of Credit Lyonnais says he expects the company to regain some of its value. "If you're selling now," he said, "you're selling too low."

HEADLINE: Computer Export Regulations Relaxed

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton eased some United States computer export controls today to relax what the White House called "unnecessary regulatory burdens" on the high-performance computer industry.
"This decision reflects my commitment to a control system that will enhance United States national security by implementing controls on computer exports that are effective and enforceable," Mr. Clinton said in a statement. 
 Bowing to the wishes of manufacturers, the administration relaxed a series of export limits. Unless Congress takes action to block the changes, most will take effect within about six months.
Mr. Clinton announced in an executive order that the United States would decontrol the export of all computers operating below 12,300 millions of theoretical operations per second, or M.T.O.P.S., to all countries except so-called rogue nations.
That would be a computer capable of 12.3 billion operations a second, several times as fast as ordinary desktop P.C.'s or laptops but in the range of computer servers used in offices or to host Web sites.
Companies exporting to "Tier III" countries (including China, Russia, India, Israel and Pakistan) will still have to notify the Commerce Department 10 days before the shipment of any computer performing above 12,500 M.T.O.P.S.
Exports to "Tier II" nations will also require licensing for computers operating above 30,000 M.T.O.P.S.
And exports to "Tier IV" countries (Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan and Syria) remain unchanged, meaning an embargo on those countries continues.

HEADLINE: Clinton Views Economy With Careful Pride and Calm Concern

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was concerned about the nation's rapidly growing trade deficit and about the debt loads being carried by individuals and businesses, but he said his worry was tempered by the strength the economy derives from the federal budget surplus.
In an interview about the economy with three news organizations on the day that the current expansion became the longest on record, Mr. Clinton also gave credit to his Republican predecessors for their role in promoting growth, but said that his push to eliminate the federal budget deficit had been critical to creating today's prosperity. 
 During the half-hour interview in the Oval Office, arranged at the instigation of the White House, Mr. Clinton was expansive in discussing the roots of the long business expansion, the problems that face the economy and the sparring between the two parties over how to handle the growing federal budget surplus.
He brushed aside an aide's attempt to end the session to answer a question about Vice President Al Gore's role in setting the administration's economic policy, saying the more people know about Mr. Gore's involvement, "the more credit he'll get."
Asked whether he should get the credit for the expansion, which reached 107 months today, Mr. Clinton said it was "an American boom."
He ticked off factors including a general reorganization of the private sector starting during the 1980's, the dizzying advances in technology and the Federal Reserve's skillful conduct of monetary policy.
The Reagan and Bush administrations, he said, deserved credit for pushing a free-trade agenda. Doing so, he said, had forced American industry to become more competitive and by stimulating imports had acted as a "powerful brake on inflation."
But Mr. Clinton stressed the role played by his administration's efforts, starting in 1993, to reduce and then eventually eliminate the deficit. He said he had built on that achievement by further opening foreign markets, dealing with international financial crises and overhauling the laws governing fast-changing industries like telecommunications.
"All these things, even before they were actually felt, helped to create a mindset of confidence, which it seems to me is critical for keeping the recovery going on this long," Mr. Clinton said.
Asked what might endanger the expansion, Mr. Clinton talked about the trade deficit and what some economists say is a worrisome level of debt.
"It's highly unusual for a country to have a budget surplus as big as ours and a trade deficit this big," Mr. Clinton said. Based on figures for the first 11 months of the year, the trade deficit for 1999 is on course to reach $267 billion, about $100 billion more than 1998, which was itself a record year.
"So I worry a little bit about the impact of the trade deficit that big for a long time," Mr. Clinton said. "That's one of the reasons I hope we can get China into the W.T.O. and open that market more, because it's the biggest source of our troubles."
Mr. Clinton then talked about the risks inherent in individuals and businesses borrowing heavily in the belief that they can carry more debt in an era when the stock market is making the country feel wealthy.
"I'm concerned about that," Mr. Clinton said. "My concern is mitigated by the fact that the government is in surplus and we're paying down the debt and that lowers our risk a little bit -- quite a little bit."
Much of the money being borrowed by companies, Mr. Clinton added, "will have a growth component to it and will increase the long-term growth and stability of our economy" because it will go to investments in new equipment and technology.
But Mr. Clinton said he remained concerned about the nation's declining personal savings rate, which fell to 2.4 percent of disposable income in 1999 from 3.7 percent in 1998 and 8.7 percent in 1992.
"The one thing that no one seems to know how to fix in America is how we get the personal savings rate back up," Mr. Clinton said.
"If we can just keep moving in the right direction and realize that this is a potential danger out there," the president said, "I'm not as troubled by it as I would be if we were running a deficit or if all this money was for consumer spending or if we didn't have a better debt-to-wealth ratio than we do."
Mr. Clinton effectively confirmed that the administration is dropping any pretense of submitting a budget proposal to Congress for next year that sticks to the spending limits set out in the bipartisan 1997 balanced budget agreement.
Congress has broken the limits in all but the most technical sense for the last two years as surplus projections have increased, and the two parties seem increasingly likely to abandon the limits formally.
"I want to have fewer gimmicks in this budget than we had last year," Mr. Clinton said. "So what I tried to do is take the money they spent last time and make it the base line, and then assume a reasonable amount of inflation based on the spending patterns of the last five years or so."
The result, White House officials said, is likely to be a surplus projection by the administration that is lower than any of the three projections released last week by the Congressional Budget Office. The budget office said that under assumptions similar to those outlined today by Mr. Clinton, it expected the surplus over the next decade outside of Social Security to total $838 billion.
Asked about Republican tax-cutting plans like the one proposed by Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said they risked sending the nation back into an era of deficits or painful spending cuts. And even as he waited to hear the results of the voting in the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Clinton took the opportunity to bolster Mr. Gore's claim to having played a key role in formulating the administration's economic approach.
Mr. Gore, the president said, had been in favor of moving in the first term to reduce the budget deficit.
Mr. Clinton also said Mr. Gore had been a strong backer of stepping in to help Mexico deal with its financial crisis in 1995 even though it was politically unpopular at the time.
Asked why Mr. Gore had not received more credit for his role, Mr. Clinton replied, "I think maybe it's because people don't know, so maybe the more they know, the more credit he'll get."

HEADLINE: If Democracy Is Not Enough

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Long a trade bloc with vague pretentions to be something more, the European Union demonstrated its abrupt development into a serious political force when it demanded on Monday that Austria keep the party of Jorg Haider, a rightist politician, out of government.
"This is about Europe and its values," said Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. "We cannot have business as usual with an Austrian government that would allow the far right to be legitimized." 
 Although one basic value -- ending war on the Continent -- always lay behind the slow process of European integration, this blunt interference in a member country's national politics on essentially moral grounds amounted to a radical departure, suggestive of an embryonic European government.
Austria reacted with contempt to the European Union's warning on Monday that diplomatic ties with a rightist government in Vienna would be reduced to a "technical level."
Wolfgang Schussel, the leader of the conservative People's Party, who tonight formed a coalition government with Mr. Haider's Freedom Party, called the European initiative "a contradiction of the spirit of European treaties."
But in a reversal of the pattern that usually sees Europe following the United States on major diplomatic initiatives, the Clinton administration said today that it would "consider similar steps to those identified by the Europeans." This role reversal -- Europe leading Washington -- seems to sum up an important shift.
Throughout the 1990's, Europe's energy was focused on introducing a common currency, the euro. But with that project completed, and with the experience of going to war in Kosovo to combat brutality based on ethnic discrimination, Europe has awakened to its political, military and moral identity.
At the end of the bloodiest century in the Continent's history, the feeling is strong that a man like Mr. Haider, who has spoken with sympathy of Hitler and the Waffen SS -- however whimsically and with whatever subsequent regret -- should have no part in "the new Europe."
It is this newly discovered and powerful commitment to a Europe free of the ethnic hatred and prejudice that often distinguished the Continent in the past that appears to lie behind the vehement stand against Mr Haider.
At the same time, a shared currency and shared concerns about a possible rightward shift on the Continent driven by aging populations and high unemployment have clearly pushed European governments toward a more united and bolder stance than seemed possible until recently.
"From the euro, which removed the sovereignty of member states of the European Union in the financial area, we are moving swiftly to the reduction of sovereignty in the political field," said Dominique Moisi, a French foreign policy expert. "That is clear in the Haider initiative, made in Europe's name."
Of course, this emergence in outline of a supranational European state is alarming many people. Britain has resisted the euro precisely because of the implications for its sovereignty, and while supporting the European warning to Vienna, the government of Tony Blair said that "the domestic political situation is for the Austrians to resolve."
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the French far-right leader, put the problems of the European position as succinctly as anyone: "Mr. Haider democratically won almost 30 percent of the vote, and according to elementary rules of democracy, he should be able to take part in a coalition government."
Yet it is precisely in the name of "democratic values" that the European Union has intervened, with the broad support of the Continent's press and a seeming majority of its population.
"Europe has values -- democracy, the rejection of racism and totalitarianism, the respect of human rights," Massimo D'Alema, the Italian prime minister, said today. "These standards and values forge unity. If these are put in doubt, Europe has the right to state its views."
The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, expressed a similar idea, telling Parliament today, "The ideas of the Freedom Party are contradictory to the principles on which the European Union was founded."
Under its treaties, the European Union can suspend any member found to be "in serious and persistent breach" of fundamental principles. That is not the case in Austria, as the executive commission of the European Union conceded today. The warning issued on Monday was instead a coordinated measure among member governments. The decision was made because the political reality of Europe is such that the arrival of the Freedom Party in power is regarded with grave concern.
The Christian Democratic Union, the main conservative party of Europe's most powerful country, Germany, is in a state of severe disarray as a result of a fund-raising scandal, prompting fears that voters will migrate to rightist parties.
Senior officials say Germany began the push for a concerted European position on Saturday when Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister and current president of the European Union, lunched privately with Mr. Schroder in the chancellor's hometown, Hanover.
Mr. Schroder suggested to Mr. Guterres that the European Union could not be seen at this delicate moment to be opening the door to what one German official called "an extreme, right-wing, nationalist, intolerant and anti-immigrant party."
Its action contrasted with the European Union's silence when an Italian post-Fascist party, the National Alliance, entered the Italian government in 1994. Then, Europe's primary concern was still the economic integration symbolized by the euro.
A member of the National Alliance, Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the Duce, said today that the European initiative in Austria was unacceptable because it meant that "the outcome of a democratic vote is being trampled."
But Germany, with experience of the horrors that democracy can usher in, is in no mood to be swayed by such arguments. "If we make it clear that we want nothing to do with politicians like Mr. Haider, that is not interfering in another country's affairs," Mr. Schroder said today. "It is an expression that we stand for a Europe based on values and that Mr. Haider has constantly violated those values."
But the fact is that the European Union has "interfered" in Austria's affairs on the basis of the union's new political and moral pretentions rather than on any firm legal footing. That reality will not escape Austrians, who may now indignantly increase their support for Mr. Haider.

Law Firms Raise Salaries To Compete With Internet
Some of the nation's top law firms have raised salaries for associates by as much as 50 percent in the last week in a stark demonstration of both the lure and the power of Internet.
The move is the most recent part of a chain reaction that began last month in Silicon Valley, where firms have lost dozens of lawyers to dot-com start-ups, and is now spreading to the white-shoe firms of New York. At least one top New York firm has matched the California raises, and partners at other firms around the country have held impromptu meetings to discuss salaries. Page A1. 

Another Opinion on Microsoft Suit
Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard legal scholar, told the judge in the Microsoft antitrust case that the company's decision to bundle its Web browser into the Windows operating system had "obvious benefits" to computer programmers and consumers. But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law. C8.

A Second Act for CMS Energy
Having almost gone broke in the 1980's, CMS Energy -- the parent of Consumers' Power -- wowed Wall Street in the 1990's by going global and expanding into almost every part of the energy industry.

HEADLINE: Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales.
The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999. 
 If the central bank "just keeps it small and everything else stays the same, I think the market will absorb" a rate increase, said Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing.
Rising gasoline prices appeared to have had only a modest effect on sales of the biggest, most profitable vehicles last month. DaimlerChrysler's sales of sport utility vehicles plunged 13 percent last month, led by a 21 percent drop in sales of the Dodge Durango. But the General Motors Corporation's redesigned Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL posted sharp increases.
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s director of market analysis, said that the increase in gasoline prices since last winter had only added about $25 a month so far to the cost of operating the average new automobile. That is not enough to influence many buyers, he said, while declining to speculate whether any further price increases would change sales patterns significantly.
In a sign that Americans remain full of optimism and enthusiasm about the strength of the economy, the freshest, latest models sold best last month, whether they were cars or light trucks. New and fairly new models like the Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type sedans, the Ford Focus hatchback, the Honda Odyssey minivan and the redesigned Chevrolet Tracker sport utility vehicle all sold briskly. Sales lagged for older models like the Ford Crown Victoria and Honda Accord sedans, the Mercury Villager minivan and the Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle.
Among automakers with headquarters in the Detroit area, G.M., with a lot of new sport utility vehicles and pickups backed up with generous discounts, did best last month, with sales rising 11.5 percent compared with January of last year. The Ford Motor Company's sales rose 4 percent, excluding Volvo Cars, which Ford bought last March. DaimlerChrysler's sales dipped 4.8 percent, including its Mercedes division.
G.M. fared poorly in January 1999, making its performance look better this year, while Ford and DaimlerChrysler did very well a year ago, one reason their sales last month seemed less impressive. DaimlerChrysler's sales were also hurt because winter storms curbed showroom traffic in the Northeast, one of its strongest markets, Mr. Jameson said.
Ford and DaimlerChrysler appeared to have lost market share last month to the Toyota Motor Corporation, which reported an increase in sales of 35.7 percent, and to the Nissan Motor Company, whose sales leaped 26.7 percent. Nissan's strong results were the latest sign that the Japanese automaker may be halting a long erosion in its market share, as new models like the Maxima sedan and Xterra sport utility vehicle have proved popular.
Other foreign automakers also prospered in the American market, including Volkswagen A.G., up 47.7 percent; the Subaru unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., up 27 percent; the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, up 9.1 percent; and the Honda Motor Company, up 3.3 percent.
A handful of small automakers did not release their results today, making it hard to calculate companies' market shares precisely. Mr. Ballew of G.M. said the industry's overall sales appeared to have run last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more than 17 million automobiles. That represents a fast pace, given that sales last year totaled 16.9 million vehicles, but the industry is expected to slow somewhat later in the year because of rising interest rates and energy prices.

And So Just What Good Were the Good Old Days?

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
It's only right for governors, presidential candidates and mayors to demand that schools improve. In a democracy, elected leaders should hold public schools accountable. But if politicians don't properly inform themselves about complex educational problems, they risk making decisions by cliche.
A case in point is the recent State of the State speech by New York's governor, George E. Pataki. Explaining his demands for reform, the governor said, "At the turn of the last century, New York's schools provided immigrant children and native New Yorkers alike with a first-rate education," whereas today "some students are forced to settle for less." 
 Those words may have struck many as harmless hyperbole. But allusions to a nonexistent golden age can be harmful, by masking the challenges schools actually face.
In the first decades of the 20th century, there was a yawning achievement gap between immigrants and the American-born. Even immigrant Jews, whom many now consider yesteryear's "model minority," did worse in school than immigrants do today. Schools took years to lift the children of immigrants up to achievement levels we now take for granted.
According to a 1911 federal report, 80 percent of native white seventh graders of that period in cities like Boston, Chicago and New York made it into eighth grade the next year. But a smaller proportion of Russian Jewish immigrant children, and many fewer Southern Italian immigrants, did so. After eighth grade, Southern Italians made it to high school at only half the rate of their native peers. (For purposes of the report, children were considered immigrants if they or their fathers were foreign-born.)
Twenty years later, things weren't much better. By the end of the 1920's, Italian immigrant high school students were still graduating at only one-quarter the rate of nonimmigrants. This was a much bigger native-immigrant gap than today's.
Immigrant Jews performed less well than native whites, but better than immigrant Italians. That was no surprise. Then as now, achievement had a lot to do with families' economic status. In 1910, 1 in 3 Southern Italian adult men in American big cities, and almost no Russian Jews, were unskilled laborers. In contrast, 1 in 3 Russian Jews, and very few Southern Italians, were merchants. As a result, Russian Jewish immigrants averaged about 20 percent more family income than Southern Italian immigrants.
Social promotion was hardly the norm back then. The term "retarded," for children deemed to have limited ability, comes from the early-20th-century practice of holding back (retarding) those who read below grade level. A 1909 study found that in New York City, Italian-born elementary students were held back twice as frequently as American-born children. Jewish and Irish students were also retained often.
Once denied promotion, many were quick to drop out. The immigrant challenge was so daunting that New York City started a special education program to address it. A 1921 survey found Italian children greatly overrepresented in these separate classes for slow learners.
Standardized exams seemed to confirm immigrants' inferiority. About this time, I.Q. tests became common. In 1919, the median I.Q. score of Italian 10-year-olds in New York City was 84; for native-born whites, it was 109. But when only those students whose fathers were unskilled or semiskilled laborers were compared, Italian and native I.Q.'s were nearly identical.
Progress was slow, and assimilation rates for subsequent generations varied by ethnicity. It seems that Jews typically adapted to schools and became fully fluent in English more quickly than other immigrant groups. Italians seemed to do so more quickly than Greeks.
But of immigrant children themselves, even Jews were mostly unsuccessful. The 1911 report found that about half of all Jewish immigrant children around the country were held back in school. (Jews from Poland did particularly poorly; two-thirds were held back.) The historian Irving Howe reviewed New York school documents from 1910 to 1914 and said he had become "impatient with later sentimentalists" who exaggerated how much Jewish immigrant children "burned with zeal" for their studies. The academically successful were a minority.
Is this relevant to today's problems? Yes, because we need reminding that the past provides models of very limited value. Americans now do a better (and more nearly equal) job of educating immigrant children than did Americans of earlier eras.
Our education debates could benefit from greater humility. We should aspire for greater success in educating immigrants, but nobody has sure answers for how to achieve it. If reform-minded politicians think better schools are simply a matter of turning back the clock, we've got big disappointments ahead.

HEADLINE: Law Firms' Pay Soars to Stem Dot-Com Defections

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
In a stark demonstration of the lure and the power of the Internet, some of the nation's top law firms have raised pay for associates by as much as 50 percent in the last two weeks.
The move is the most recent part of a chain reaction that began just before New Year's Day in Silicon Valley, where firms have lost dozens of lawyers to dot-com start-ups, and is now spreading to the white-shoe firms of New York. At least one top New York law firm has matched the California raises, and partners at other firms around the country have held impromptu meetings to discuss salaries. Many are expected to offer big raises in the coming weeks. 
 The pay increases will allow first-year associates to earn as much as $160,000 a year, depending on their year-end bonus. As firms simultaneously adjust the salaries of all other associates, the payroll at a single firm could grow by tens of millions of dollars.
Across the country, more than a thousand lawyers will receive the raises, and that number will multiply if more firms follow suit.
News of the pay increases has ricocheted around law offices thanks to Internet chat boards, like Yahoo's "Greedy Associates," where lawyers have been posting messages about developments at their firms. The online discussions have, in turn, raised the pressure on firms that have not yet offered pay increases, partners said.
Lawyers are now waiting to see whether other New York firms follow the lead of Davis Polk & Wardwell, which told its associates in the last week that it would essentially match the new Silicon Valley salaries, according to lawyers at other firms and a copy of an internal memo posted on the Web. Davis Polk employees did not return phone calls.
Typically, the handful of the most prestigious firms in New York match each other's raises.
Under the new structure, first-year lawyers will make a base salary of $125,000, and with bonuses, often for working long hours, they can earn more than $150,000. Last year, beginning lawyers in the Bay Area earned about $95,000 in base salary, plus bonuses of around $5,000.
At top New York firms during the 1990's, starting base salaries rose from about $80,000 to about $105,000, where they stood until this week. Many lawyers also received bonuses of about $10,000 last year.
With the latest raises, fourth-year associates at many firms will be able to make more than $200,000, up from less than $150,000 last year.
The steep cost of the raises has the potential to cut partners' takes by as much as one-fifth. It will also very likely force increases in the firms' fees, which already start at about $200 an hour. Partners said, however, that they had little choice but to try to stem the Internet brain drain and to keep rival firms from gaining a recruiting edge.
"We want to make it harder for people to leave us for clients," said Tower C. Snow Jr., the chairman of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a San Francisco-based firm where turnover among associates rose to 25 percent last year, from 12 percent in 1998, as lawyers jumped ship for both legal and executive jobs at eBay, E*trade and an array of Web start-ups. Brobeck was among the firms raising its salary structure recently.
The approach, associates say, has its appeal, in large part because much of the pay at Internet companies comes from stock options that may be worthless. "That much guaranteed salary is going to make people think pretty hard" about leaving, said Howard Holderness, a seventh-year associate at Brobeck. "A lot of dot-coms fail."
Still, the draw of the start-ups is fierce, in part because they offer the potential for wealth well beyond what any law firm salary could bring.
"It's been a very difficult situation," said Alan C. Mendelson, a senior partner at Cooley Godward, which has its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.
Many other professional service companies are facing the same drain. Booz Allen & Hamilton, McKinsey & Company and other consulting firms have begun taking stock in their clients more frequently and plan to allow employees to invest in the pooled equity, in an effort to mimic the skyrocketing stock prices of Internet companies. Investment banks like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter have raised salaries, in some cases offering restricted stock that workers can redeem only if they stay with the company for at least a few years.
For the law firms, the pay increases also reflect a new balance of geographic power. For decades, New York firms attracted many of the most talented law school graduates and paid them the highest salaries. Firms in other cities largely reacted to salary decisions made by New York firms.
Over the last decade, however, the gap between San Francisco-area salaries and New York salaries has shrunk, and at the most prestigious firms it no longer exists. In fact the current round of raises began at Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, a Menlo Park, Calif., firm, in late December. Other Bay Area firms matched Gunderson last week.
"You now have California setting a trend," said the head partner at another large New York firm, who requested anonymity because he said commenting publicly would increase the chances that his firm would have to match the raises. "This has never happened before."
Perhaps more significant, New York firms are now paying no more than some California firms, where the dress code tends to be more relaxed and associates generally work fewer hours.
Typically, however, young lawyers at firms have less flexible schedules than lawyers at corporate legal departments. With the economy and stock market continuing to boom, and law firms' revenues growing by 10 to 20 percent a year, associates are busier than ever.
That, in addition to the promise of Internet stock options, is causing the increase in turnover. "I wanted to be able to control my schedule," said the general counsel of a dot-com company who recently left a large law firm and who insisted on anonymity. "I didn't want clients to be able to control me."
Lawyers around the country said they expected the decision by Davis Polk -- the fifth-largest firm in the country, according to the American Lawyer magazine's 1999 ranking -- to cause other top New York firms, like Cravath Swaine & Moore and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom -- to match.
Lawyers at Cravath and Skadden declined to comment.
In cities where the cost of living is well below what it is in San Francisco and New York and where there is less technology and finance work, salaries can be considerably lower and firms are less likely to match the raises, lawyers said. But some kind of raise, on top of the usual annual increase that firms doled out at the end of last year, is likely in other major cities, particularly those like Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, with significant technology industries.
"We're definitely reviewing it, and our salaries will definitely change," said Janet Zagorin, the director of practice development at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a Los Angeles firm with offices in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
One option for firms is to raise salaries selectively. The San Francisco-based Morrison & Foerster, for example, gave raises to associates in its New York and Bay Area offices but not to those in Washington or elsewhere. And Shearman & Sterling, based in New York, increased pay only in its Menlo Park and San Francisco offices.

HEADLINE: For Now, a Real Campaign

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's big victory in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary and Vice President Al Gore's narrow triumph on the Democratic side send a powerful message. Voters are not ready to anoint, at least for now, the candidates picked by each party's establishment. As a result of this rebuff to the entitlement strategies of Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, Americans may get to witness one of the more competitive nomination battles in memory.
Mr. Bush sailed into the Granite State backed by practically every leading Republican in the nation, not to mention his own family. But Mr. McCain won the hearts of New Hampshire voters with a gabby, joyful insurgency that emphasized personal character and moderate fiscal policies. As for the Democrats, many experts counted Bill Bradley out only a week ago, but his close showing against Vice President Gore amounts to a license to prolong his challenge despite the animosity of the party's Washington establishment. Because of their money and support around the country, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore still rate as the front-runners for their parties' nominations. But the fight will be tougher than might have seemed possible until recently. The vote could be read as an invitation to the rest of the country to experience a real campaign, complete with weekly debates, town meetings and encounters with voters. 
 The most extraordinary showing was certainly Mr. McCain's. The G.O.P. establishment will see the outcome as the work of independents rather than genuine Republicans. But Mr. McCain's victory, built around his challenge to the party's sterile reliance on tax cuts, special interests and soft money, will force Washington Republicans to take a searching look at Mr. Bush and may compel him to begin personal attacks against Mr. McCain as they move into South Carolina. Mr. McCain needs to keep rolling up victories there and elsewhere to compete on March 7 in the decisive races in California and New York, where it is more important than ever that he be allowed on the ballot. New York Republicans, by the way, should flood the office of Gov. George Pataki with telephone calls and letters demanding that he abandon his authoritarian effort to prevent them from selecting from a full roster of candidates in the state primary.
Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley showed impressive toughness and determination. Mr. Gore secured an important victory, but it did not come easily, nor was it large enough to end the Bradley challenge. The former New Jersey senator surged ahead this winter but stumbled with his shaky performance at the Iowa caucuses in January. He engaged in an embarrassingly public soul-searching over whether to attack Mr. Gore for his campaign distortions and fund-raising abuses in 1996. He finally did, but at first that only seemed to send his ratings down. But over the weekend Mr. Bradley's message caught hold, portending an even more contentious Democratic contest in the weeks ahead.
Of course, New Hampshire is a famous incubator of short-lived political rebellions, of dreams that eventually get crushed. But this year's insurgencies have a different root system, having been nurtured in an atmosphere largely free of the anger of years past, when the state suffered from recessions or the hollowing out of its old industries. This year, after the dispiriting scandals of the Clinton administration, the voters were taking a fresh look at leadership and character. They were also thinking about what to do with the budget surpluses and how to shore up the nation's retirement, health care and education systems. On all these issues, New Hampshire voters have had their say and, more important, set the stage for a broader, longer national debate.

HEADLINE: In Austria, Shadows and Worries

 BODY:

To the Editor:
What should we in the United States think of the pressure being exerted by the European Union on Austria to prevent Jorg Haider's Freedom Party from entering a coalition government (front page, Feb. 1)? 
 In 1933 German democracy was destroyed, it will be argued, by allowing the Nazis to join a coalition government, by means of which they created a totalitarian state. But this is a false analogy. Mr. Haider does not have a large social movement outside Parliament that he can mobilize, nor can he exploit a financial crisis.
Austria is a stable democracy. If Mr. Haider entered a coalition government, he would have to modify his extreme views. Keeping him out of power allows him to express radical positions without being accountable to anyone.

HEADLINE: The High-Speed Train That Thought It Could, but Can't

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
INSPIRATION for the new logo for Amtrak's Acela train began, strangely, with a turtle.
"A turtle doesn't move very fast," admitted Nick Oakley, one of the designers of the new high-speed train. But during brainstorming sessions, designers kept coming back to the image of a sea turtle making stately and peaceful progress through blue waters as the key to the mood they wanted to suggest. The result was an abstracted fin. 
 The new logo appeared for the first time on a scheduled Amtrak train on Monday when an Acela Regional train pulled out of Boston.
The fully electrified service qualified this New York run as Acela, but the train was made up of refurbished old cars pulled by a venerable locomotive with a top speed of 80 miles per hour.
While Michael Dukakis, Governor Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and other dignitaries were saluting the departure of the Acela Regional, the critical Acela Express test train -- which can cruise at 150 m.p.h. -- sat idle and forlorn in a cold Amtrak yard in Philadelpia, where it was undergoing repair. High-speed service for the Boston-to-Washington corridor, originally set to begin last fall, has been promoted by a $26 million advertising campaign. But the inauguration was postponed after wheels on prototype trains showed excessive wear. At the end of January, equipment on the test train proved wanting yet again. Amtrak officials have pushed the start of high-speed service back to midsummer.
A reporter visited the first of the 20 new Acela Express trains at the new Ivy Hill maintenance hangar in Washington. Each $20 million Acela Express "train set" -- the cars are meant to stay together -- consists of locomotives at each end, a first class car, four business class cars and a cafe car, for a total of 304 seats.
On first impression, the car interiors do not have the futuristic glamour of the French high-speed TGV or the streamlined romance of the 20th-Century Limited, but rather a practical, comfortable and rugged approximation of an airline interior. There are amenities air travel doesn't provide, however: conference areas and a cafe offering fresh breads and salads, specialty coffees and draft beer. There are six public phones and -- here's a benefit -- cell phones can be used anywhere on the trip.
Each seat is equipped with two music channels and an electrical outlet for plugging in laptops. Seats rotate with the touch of a foot pedal to let neighbors face each other. A more comfortable environment for working en route is an advantage Amtrak hopes will lure business travelers from airlines. When he began the redesign, Mr. Oakley said, "Carrying a laptop and wearing a nice suit and catching Amtrak was not acceptable."
Mr. Oakley and his team debated the virtues of the open overhead racks traditional on trains versus the closed bins of airlines. The bins won.
The new cars offer windows twice as large as those on current trains, allowing passengers to look out even while standing up. The cafe car has chic-looking stools and a leather padded rail for slouchers. And Mr. Oakley was especially focused on the rest rooms. "We explored about 200 different versions," he said.
He tried to avoid making them like the plastic capsules that serve as toilets on airlines, yet they had to conform with the Americans with Disabilities Act. There is a round mirror, light from outside filtering through sandblasted glass, a diaper changing table, and a purple-blue composite sink.
Employees were consulted, too. The people who ran the food service, the designers found, didn't like turning their backs to prepare meals. The new counter is curved.
Engineers asked for traditional instruments instead of digital gauges. Two throttles operate engines and brakes, and a red emergency stop button the size of tea saucer is placed prominently on the dash. The cockpit is heavily reinforced on the safety cage principle used in race car design, but much stronger. Behind the engineers' seats is an emergency area in which they can lie prone in case of collision.
Acela Express (it is pronounced ah-SELL-ah, a made-up cross between acceleration and excellence) is the long awaited American high-speed train. While no match in speed or style for the French TGV or Japanese bullet train, it is still America's best and perhaps last hope for passenger train service that can compete with the airline and automobile for civilized transportation.
Top speed for Acela Express will be 165 miles an hour; the French TGV approaches 200 miles an hour. Amtrak says the Acela Express is aimed at business travelers and that it will cut half an hour off the current three-hour Metroliner trip between Washington and New York, and a full hour and a half off the New York-to-Boston one, which is now nearly five hours. A New York to Washington ticket, now $66 one way on the standard train and $115 on the Metroliner, will be about $135 business class. It now costs $200 for a full-price fare on the Delta Shuttle from New York to Washington.
But Acela Express will never be faster door to door than the shuttle -- even adding in taxi time to the airport. So instead of focusing on reducing travel time, Amtrak is emphasizing quality time. "How you use time is more important than speed with which you get there," said Robin Haueter, a designer who worked with Mr. Oakley and Brent Oppenheimer on the project for the Ideo design firm. "This is a big idea, a fundamental change in the way we all think about business travel."
Barbara Richardson, the executive vice president of Amtrak, who was in charge of the Acela development program, said: "People are tired of being treated like commodities. They view the journey as a space, an element of time that becomes their own."
The new trains are New Age trains, with soothing interiors and soothing aphorisms to sell them. Ads show the train as a place for dreaming and contemplation, "where thoughts and coffee beans brew." One ad is tagged, "Depart from your inhibitions," another "Inner children travel free."
WHAT is really riding on the new trains is Amtrak's very existence. Deficits have plagued Amtrak since it was founded in 1971. Legislation passed in 1997 calls for it to break even by the end of 2002 or prepare a plan for its own liquidation. Amtrak executives count on the new trains to draw 2.5 million additional riders annually and to increase its revenues by $180 million a year.
Acela really had its beginnings in 1995, when Amtrak tested the high-speed Swedish X-2000, with an undercarriage that tilts around curves, and the German ICE (Intercity Express), on American tracks. American tracks are notoriously rough by world standards. European high-speed trains run on tracks whose rails are carefully aligned and welded, and the European models ran here at speeds well below their capabilities. Rebuilding the American track to European standards would be prohibitively expensive.
The contract for the new trains went to a consortium of Alstom, in Paris, and Bombardier, in Montreal, which makes the French TGV. The cars blend mechanical and structural elements from European trains, rejiggered for American tracks.
Amtrak executives, including Ms. Richardson and George Warrington, the president, inspected train interiors in Europe. They were impressed by the Spanish high-speed train. "The inside of the coach felt homier," Ms. Richardson said. "We felt a greater sense of hospitality."
Amtrak sought out the Spanish train's designers, which included Mr. Oakley, who studied at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Haueter. "The high-speed train was really a piece of the bigger-brand picture," Ms. Richardson said. It would be used to lend a new image to all operations in the Northeast corridor, which carries the majority of Amtrak's traffic. Old train names like Keystone, Empire and even Metroliner will give way to Acela. The new trains will be used on Acela Express routes, while Acela Regional and Acela Commuter will use refurbished cars.
Amtrak surveyed some 24,000 travelers for the redesign, along with Amtrak employees. The designers chose a palette of colors centering on the teal-like blue that the railroad calls Acela blue.
New trains are only part of the $2.6 billion project. New stations are being added at Route 128 in Westwood, Mass., an important Boston commuter hub, and in New London, Conn.; at many other stations, seating and signage will be improved. There are even new uniforms, designed by Stan Herman, who created uniforms for Federal Express.
The "rebranding" campaign carried out by DDB New York began last summer with surreal teaser ads without mention of Amtrak or any image of a train. Clouds, blue tints, and a repeated slogan "Life on Acela" suggested to some viewers ads from a pharmaceutical company, perhaps for an antidepressant. "The ads are not what you would expect from a railroad," Ms. Richardson said. "But people remembered them. They got people buzzing."
Success will depend more on the nuts and bolts than on the buzz. Bombardier-Alstom has expressed confidence that it can fix the wheel problem. It has an incentive: it can be penalized for late delivery up to $13,500 per train per day.
Success will also depend on finances. While Amtrak says it is making economic progress thanks to increased ridership, a report issued last week by the Amtrak Reform Council, appointed by Congress to oversee the railroad, calls its accounting into doubt. An earlier report by the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative branch, expressed doubt that even Acela could make Amtrak profitable.
Of course, no European high-speed train operates without government subsidy, as Amtrak is being asked to do. Acela's success will depend on whether its stately sea turtle pace can beat the relentless march of Congress's time limit, or whether the Acela's new trains can manage some fancy tilting in Washington.

HEADLINE: A Dwindling Surplus

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Phantom Surplus" (Op-Ed, Jan. 28), by Robert Reischauer: 
 Current and projected budget surpluses have more to do with the strong economic growth and consequent high tax revenues of recent years than with political virtue from the White House or Congress.
However, the surpluses that have been projected by the Congressional Budget Office and others will not happen because they are based on the assumption of a continuation of such growth, which is unlikely. When growth does slow or reverse (even temporarily), standard logic, based on private accounting principles, will require spending to be reduced or taxes to be raised to balance the budget.
But the principles of Keynesian economics, not accounting, should apply to the federal budget: when growth slows, cutting spending or raising taxes will decelerate it even further.

HEADLINE: Data Signals Economic Growth Should Continue in Current Year

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A key forecasting gauge rose to a new high in December, signaling that the economy's record expansion should continue well into the year.
The Conference Board said yesterday that its index of leading economic indicators increased four-tenths of a point in December, to a record 108.7, after rising three-tenths of a point, to 108.3, the month before. That was in line with analysts' expectations. 
 Separately in Washington, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes rose 4.5 percent in December, helping to raise the total for the year to a record high.
The strong economic readings came only a few hours before Federal Reserve policy makers, meeting in Washington for a second day, raised short-term interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point and warned of the risks of heightened inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future. The move to cool off the economy was expected.
The index of leading indicators is a barometer of economic activity in the next three to six months.
The latest reading signaled that the nation's economic expansion, would continue, economists said.
The Conference Board, a business-funded research group based in New York, said the index reading for December was the highest in the 40 years the index has been calculated on a comparable basis. The record mark was first passed in November.
Nine of the 10 components that make up the index rose in December. The 10th, which measures the average workweek in manufacturing, was unchanged, it said.
The group said its index of coincident indicators, measuring current activity, increased two-tenths of a point in December, to 126.8, from a revised 126.5 in November. The index of lagging indicators, which tracks past activity, went up half a point, to 109.4, in December from 108.9 percent in November.
The separate home sales report said that Americans purchased new single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 900,000 in December, aided by favorable weather. December's 4.5 percent increase, bigger than the 4 percent rise many analysts were forecasting, followed a 6.3 percent decline in November.
For all of 1999, new-home sales rose 2 percent, to a record 904,000, surpassing the previous record of 886,000 in 1998.
Existing-home sales tracked by the National Association of Realtors also set a record in 1999 of 5.2 million.

HEADLINE: First Store Opens at the First Shopping Mall in Harlem

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
As dozens of headset-sporting store workers handed out dark blue mesh tote bags to use in place of shopping carts, a two-level Old Navy store began welcoming customers yesterday, becoming the first retailer in the long-awaited Harlem U.S.A. complex to open its doors.
By June, the glassy six-level structure at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard -- the first retail and entertainment complex of its kind in the neighborhood -- will be home to seven other tenants: a Chase Manhattan Bank branch, a Disney Store, a nine-screen Magic Johnson Theater multiplex, a Modell's sporting goods store, an HMV record store, a New York Sports Club and a Jeepers video arcade. 
 Less than an hour after the Old Navy store opened, Tawania George had already stuffed three tote bags with T-shirts and other basic clothing for her five children. "I'm having a ball," she said with a big smile. "It's convenient, so I don't have to go downtown. It's hard to travel with little kids. And I'm within walking distance, so I save money on carfare."
The developers of Harlem U.S.A. spent years persuading national retailers like Old Navy, which is owned by the Gap, to venture into their inner-city neighborhood to capture some of the dollars local residents are spending downtown and elsewhere. Consequently, the new retail and entertainment complex is expected to be closely watched by other companies. How well it does is likely to have a large impact on the future of economic development on 125th Street and similar shopping strips.
Many shoppers said they welcomed the new complex because of the jobs it was bringing to a neighborhood where the unemployment rate in December was 9 percent, nearly twice the rate for Manhattan as a whole.
The $66 million shopping center is expected to create 600 jobs, three-quarters of them earmarked for Harlem residents. About 2,000 people applied for the 150 openings at Old Navy, said Sekee Clarke, the general manager of the store, who is himself a Harlem resident.
A number of the people who lined up in the cold yesterday to wait for Old Navy's doors to open were also seeking jobs. Rhoda Payne, a cashier at a Times Square multiplex, said she was disappointed to learn that there were no more openings and surprised not to see any familiar faces among the employees. "I've been living here for 13 years," Ms. Payne said, "and I don't see anybody that I recognize." Many of the employees helping customers or watching out for shoplifters had been brought in for the day from other Old Navy outlets, store officials said.
Built with private and public money, Harlem U.S.A. was developed by Grid Properties Inc. and the Gotham Organization in conjunction with the development arm of the Harlem Commonwealth Council, a local nonprofit organization that began assembling the site in 1973. Originally, the group hoped to develop a hotel there, said Barbara Norris, the president of the Commonwealth Local Development Corporation. The current project has been eight years in the making, Ms. Norris said.
In 1996, the developers received an $11.2 million loan from the New York Empowerment Zone Corporation, which oversees a joint federal, state and city economic development program. That loan was a key element in getting the project off the ground, said Drew Greenwald, the president of Grid Properties.
There is room at Harlem U.S.A. for three to six additional stores, the developers said. Mr. Greenwald said they were negotiating with several smaller retailers, including a local entrepreneur who wants to open a bookstore.
Ms. Norris said she had no doubt that Harlem would embrace the new complex. "These residents want the same quality that every other citizen in this town has," she said, "and they're entitled to it."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Share PricesFinish Mixed in Wake of Fed Rate Increase

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks struggled to a mixed finish yesterday after the Federal Reserve's widely expected interest rate increase did little to calm turbulent financial markets.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 points, to 11,003.20. The blue-chip index rose as much as 60 points in the moments before the Fed released its decision, then bobbed between positive and negative territory for much of the rest of the session. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.16 point, to 1,409.12, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 21.98 points, to 4,073.96.
Stocks gave up early gains after the Fed said it was raising its target for the federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge one another on overnight loans -- to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent. Several commercial banks quickly announced that they, too, would increase borrowing costs.
Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by making it more difficult for companies to borrow money to finance growth.
As a result, investors yesterday turned to the companies that are advancing quickly enough to outrun rising rates, said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. For the most part, that meant a lift for technology stocks.
"Investors are crowding into shares of the companies that they believe will continue to grow earnings, despite the Fed's tightening of interest rates," Mr. Acuff said.
Hewlett-Packard rose 4 3/4, to 110 9/16, and I.B.M. advanced 9/16, to 113 1/2, the strongest of the Dow components.
On the Nasdaq, Yahoo jumped 10 5/8, to 328, and Qualcomm gained 6, to 142 1/16. Turnstone Systems, which makes equipment that allows for high-speed Internet connections over telephone wires, soared 50 1/4, to 147 1/4, in its second day of trading after its initial public offering.
"Those are the companies that are driving innovation and improving productivity for the U.S. work force," said Philip S. Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "They're helping this economic expansion continue."
Trading remained highly volatile as investors worried that yesterday's interest rate increase might be the first of several this year. In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said it remained worried that the rapidly growing economy "could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion."
The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
"The market knows that the Fed is in a gradual tightening mode," Mr. Acuff said. "As long as that's in place, it will be hard to advance significantly."
Financial services companies like American Express, which fell 4 13/16, to 164 3/16, are especially vulnerable, analysts said. Lending volume typically slides when interest rates are rising.
While interest rate concerns dominated Wall Street, corporate news also drove trading yesterday.
General Motors fell 3 7/8, to 81 3/8, after the company named its president and chief operating officer, G. Richard Wagoner, as chief executive, preparing G.M. for the retirement of the chairman and chief executive, John F. Smith Jr.
Time Warner rose 7 3/4, to 86 1/2, after reporting earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. The strong report also lifted shares of America Online, which has stumbled since it announced plans to acquire Time Warner last month. AOL rose 4 1/2, to 60 1/4.

HEADLINE: General Motors Chief to Hand Over Reinsto Company's President

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 2

 BODY:
John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Motors announced today that he would hand his chief executive title and day-to-day responsibility for running the company, the world's largest automaker, to G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, the president and chief operating officer, starting in June.
Mr. Smith, 61, will serve as the executive chairman. Harry J. Pearce, 57, who is recovering from leukemia, will stay on as G.M.'s vice chairman and may later be tapped to replace Mr. Smith as chairman, people close to the board's deliberations said. 
 While the titles change, the same triumvirate will lead General Motors. Mr. Wagoner will run the day-to-day business. Mr. Smith will spend more time working on the company's alliances with companies like Fuji and Toyota and with repairing G.M.'s frosty relations with car dealers. Mr. Pearce, who will report to Mr. Smith, will continue to oversee G.M's nonauto businesses plus its efforts on safety, the environment and public policy.
"The three of us make a great team," Mr. Smith said. "We've worked together since 1992 and share a common vision for General Motors." Indeed, Mr. Smith has presided over kaleidoscopic change at General Motors.
Mr. Smith was installed in a board coup in November 1992, when the company teetered near bankruptcy. It lost $2 billion in 1990, $4.5 billion in 1991 and $23.5 billion - more than $20 billion from an accounting change -- the year Mr. Smith was handed the reins.
Mr. Smith, working closely with Mr. Pearce and Mr. Wagoner, turned the red ink to black. Last year, with the economy and auto sales booming, G.M. earned a record $6 billion. G.M. has also improved nearly all aspects of its business, other auto executives and industry experts acknowledge. But many question whether G.M. has done enough to keep up with competitors. G.M.'s market share in the United States dipped to 29.5 percent last year, down from 34.3 percent in 1992.
Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive whom G.M.'s board ousted in 1992, acknowledged that G.M. has been partly turned around on Mr. Smith's watch. "It is obvious they've got their financial house in order," he said in an interview last month, adding, "To be a good, successful corporation you also have to have that market share."
Wall Street praised the management changes, and said that the drop in G.M.'s stock price today -- it was down $3.875, to $81.375 -- was driven by investors who took profits after G.M. announced Tuesday that it would distribute about half the value of its Hughes Electronics stake.
"It is good to have younger people moving into positions of importance at organizations like that," said Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Auto industry veterans echoed that sentiment. "In an organization as traditional and hidebound as General Motors, having a person who doesn't know all the reasons that things can't be done" can be a benefit, said Robert A. Lutz, former president and vice chairman of Chrysler and now the chief executive of the Exide Corporation, the battery maker.
Mr. Pearce has enormous credibility on Wall Street and within the auto industry, and praised the board's move today.
"Had I been an outside director I would've selected Rick Wagoner as C.E.O. of this company," Mr. Pearce said. "His track record speaks for itself -- it is extraordinary."
Mr. Wagoner has been a star at G.M. for more than a decade. Just like many past chief executives, he began his career in G.M.'s powerful treasurer's office in New York. He later became treasurer of G.M.'s Brazil operations, then was moved to the finance jobs in Canada and Europe. He was then sent back to lead the Brazil operations, which he turned around. When Mr. Smith was named chief executive, he tapped Mr. Wagoner as chief financial officer.
"Rick will have responsibility for the strategic, operational leadership of General Motors," Mr. Smith said. "He is in charge."
Still, Mr. Wagoner could end up reporting to Mr. Pearce some day. Mr. Pearce said today that his health was not a concern, noting that his bone marrow transplant was 17 months ago. "The possibility of a relapse is very remote," said Mr. Pearce, who noted that while "I may not look quite right to you yet," he will be weaned from drugs suppressing his immune system by midsummer, when Mr. Wagoner is scheduled to take over. Those drugs cause swelling and redness in his face.
James L.M. Ferrara, director of the Bone Marrow Transplant program at the University of Michigan, said that generally speaking, "the majority of relapses occur within 12 to 18 months after transplants," and that someone like Mr. Pearce is in the recovery phase, but "is not home free."
The changes announced today are not the only shifts in store at the top of G.M. John G. Smale, G.M.'s lead director and leader of the 1992 board coup, announced in November that he would retire from G.M.'s board in May. Mr. Wagoner said today that he had no plans to change course for G.M.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
That30-Year Benchmark? Think 10-Year, Treasury Says

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Since 1977, when the federal government began regularly issuing 30-year bonds, they have been the benchmark of the American bond market. But yesterday the Treasury signaled that those days should soon be over.
In a move that could eventually eliminate the 30-year bond altogether, the Treasury Department announced plans for a reduction in new issuance of the bonds and the buying back of other long-term Treasury debt. 
 The department's under secretary for domestic finance, Gary Gensler, said bond market investors were already starting to regard the 10-year note as the benchmark. "The focus," Mr. Gensler said, "is more and more on the 10-year note than on the 30-year bond."
The changes the Treasury announced were forced by growing federal budget surpluses, which have allowed the government to pay off some of the publicly held government debt, which now stands at about $3.3 trillion. In this quarter, the Treasury expects to reduce the public debt by $17 billion followed by a record payoff of $152 billion in the second quarter.
The shift to the 10-year note as a benchmark had already begun because of its wide use as a pricing point in the corporate and mortgage markets. But the change has accelerated because of the distortion in the performance of the 30-year bond since the Treasury first announced last month that it was going to buy back old Treasury securities. Since then the yield has fallen almost half a percentage point.
"It would not surprise me if the Treasury phases out the 30-year bond over the next several years," said Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, N.J. "It's trading like it's a collectors' item."
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said the Treasury itself had hastened the shift from the 30-year bond by announcing the buybacks. The Treasury, he said, "triggered the event that has called into question the reliability" of the 30-year bond.
The Treasury said yesterday that it would reduce the issuance of its 2-year, 5-year and 10-year notes and its 30-year bond. It will also reduce the issuance of its 30-year inflation-indexed bond. Together, the issuance of regular and inflation-indexed 30-year bonds will be less than half the $45 billion total in the fiscal year 1999, which ended on Sept. 30.
Accordingly, Mr. Crandall said that based on what has been issued so far this fiscal year, the $10 billion in new 30-year bonds to be issued next week will be followed by about $5 billion in May. The May figure is significantly less than the $10 billion many analysts expected.
The Treasury also said it would reduce the issuance of one-year bills by cutting the schedule from every four weeks to four times a year. Officials are also considering the elimination of the one-year bill. At the same time, the Treasury will increase the supply of three-month and six-month bills.
The reduction of longer-term debt issuance and the shift to more three- and six-month bills will help lower the overall cost of government borrowing, which is one of the Treasury's main goals.
The Treasury buybacks will start in the next two months. The initial buybacks will be about $1 billion at a time. Mr. Gensler said the buybacks would give the Treasury and investors the experience they need before moving to larger buybacks. Investors are not required to sell their Treasury securities back to the Treasury, so a premium price will have to be offered. The Treasury said it hoped to buy back up to $30 billion in longer-term securities by the end of 2000.
The announcement of the details of buying back long-term debt and the reduction of issuance of new 30-year bonds had a marked effect. The price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 27/32, to 97 29/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.28 percent, from 6.42 percent on Tuesday.
The yield on the 30-year bond is now not much higher than the yield on the one-year Treasury bill, which was at 6.19 percent yesterday. And it is lower than the yield on the Treasury's 2-year note at 6.58 percent, the 5-year note at 6.65 percent, and the 10-year note at 6.57 percent, down from 6.62 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Albright Visits Post-Tudjman Croatia and Hails the New Leadership

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright came here today to praise the government that was recently formed from the democratic opposition.
She also encouraged the two candidates for the presidency and promised that the United States would support the rapid integration of a "new Croatia" into NATO, the European Union and the West. 
 Dr. Albright and her aides expressed hope that the "Croatian example" would affect neighboring Serbia, where Washington wants to see the end of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Washington also hopes that "Croatia's rapid move into Europe" and Western institutions like NATO's Partnership for Peace will "make the Serbs think hard," a senior American official said.
On her last visit here, in August 1998, Dr. Albright had a bitter meeting with President Franjo Tudjman, whose government resisted full cooperation with the international tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and worked to undermine the 1995 Dayton agreement in Bosnia.
But with the death of Mr. Tudjman in December and the electoral victory of a six-party opposition coalition led by Prime Minister Ivica Racan that Washington encouraged, "I think everyone is ready to embrace the new Croatia," Dr. Albright said.
"What a difference a year and a half makes," she added.
She said Washington would increase economic aid, from $12 million to $20 million. She also delivered a letter from President Clinton to Mr. Racan that promised support for Croatian democracy if the new government lived up to its promises to cooperate with the tribunal and abide by the Dayton agreement, including allowing Serbian refugees to return to their homes. Washington would like Croatia to stop spending up to $3 million a day to support a separate Bosnian Croat administration and military, an official said.
Mr. Racan, leader of the reformed Communist Party, now called the Social Democrats, said Croatia would live up to its responsibilities toward Bosnia, Serbia and Europe. "Judge us by our deeds, not by our promises," he said.
Unusually, Dr. Albright arrived in the middle of an election campaign for the presidency, a period that ends on Monday in a runoff between the front-runner, Stipe Mesic, and an ally of Mr. Racan. Drazen Budisa. United States officials said they would be happy if either won, and Dr. Albright had private meetings with each today after she had arrived from Moscow.

HEADLINE: Victories That Will Be Fleeting

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills is the author, most recently, of "A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
New Hampshire's returns were not only a case of the suppposed winning candidates losing, but of men losing whose whole rationale for being in the race at all was that they are winners. The Republican establishment backed George W. Bush early (and lavishly) because this time out, it preferred winning to principle. What happens, then, when the winner does not win?
Bill Bradley, too, picked up early and sizable donations because he alone, it was felt, could win in the fall. Mr. Gore, according to early punditry, could not defeat Mr. Bush -- he was too wooden, too tainted, too mired in difficulties with his campaign staff. Mr. Bradley had Mr. Gore's views without his disadvantages. 
 Yet, Mr. Bradley not only lost to this loser; in exit polls, those who said they care about winning in the fall went more than three-to-one in favor of Mr. Gore.
Well, Mr. Bradley's spinners say, he didn't really lose because he made a strong comeback, and Mr. Gore just "edged" him (by four points -- some "edge"). A big defeat is defined, for this occasion, as Mr. McCain's 19-point victory over Mr. Bush.
Yet that 15-point difference in the margins of victory hides more than it reveals.
If the ludicrous candidates were removed from the Republican side, almost all their combined vote -- 20 percent -- would have gone to Mr. Bush, giving him 50 percent of the total. The right wing of the party, which splintered its vote among the also-rans, has its doubts about Mr. Bush, but it abominates Mr. McCain.
Despite the pundits' warning that Republicans will now have second thoughts about Mr. Bush, what Mr. McCain's victory will do instead is dispel any hesitancy by the party about Mr. Bush's candidacy. Republicans will now rally urgently to make sure that their party does not nominate a man who threatens the mother's milk of the party -- campaign donations -- and denounces one of the principal sources of that milk, the tobacco companies. Mr. McCain is in for a heady few weeks, delighting reporters and infuriating party regulars. Then reality will set in.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Bradley not only lost his campaign's rationale (that he is a winner) but he did what little "winning" he did by abandoning the rationale for that rationale -- that he was offering a new politics, serenely above politics as usual.
This claim was suspect, even before his last-minute assault on Al Gore as a person.
After all, the lowest blow thrown in this whole campaign, on either side or at any time, was Mr. Bradley's false assertion several weeks ago that Al Gore was the first candidate to bring up Willie Horton. The meanest attack dog on any side has been Mr. Bradley's surrogate, Senator Bob Kerrey.
Mr. Bradley said that he did not want to look at the past when Mr. Gore brought up old votes on farm aid, but he spent his last few days in New Hampshire doing little but looking at his opponent's old votes on abortion, trying to manufacture a difference with Mr. Gore where there is none.
The man who said he was above "ploys" and "tactics," like Mr. Gore's challenge to a series of debates, used a ploy to distract from his imminent loss in New Hampshire by releasing his own version of that challenge just before the polls closed.
Mr. Bradley is running for the Democratic nomination, but he lost the Democratic vote decisively in New Hampshire -- by 19 points, according to exit polls. (The independent vote made up the difference.) He lost every income category to Mr. Gore except those making more than $100,000 a year. That demographic is not the backbone of the Democratic Party. Those who said jobs and the economy were their prime concern preferred Mr. Gore to Mr. Bradley by a whopping four to one.
Mr. Bradley is the "insurgent" of the fashionable fat cats -- who include, of course, his cheerleaders in the press. He is the champion of campaign finance reform who has outspent Mr. Gore, and he can continue to dog Mr. Gore only because his coffers are full of the very money he calls unclean.
That is why John McCain, the apparent big winner in New Hampshire, will soon prove just a momentary nuisance to George Bush, while Bill Bradley, the four-point loser, will be a long-term spoiler for Al Gore. He will be because he can afford to be.

HEADLINE: Robert J. Milano, 87, Self-Made Industrialist

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Robert John Milano, a self-made millionaire industrialist who briefly served Mayor Edward I. Koch as deputy mayor for economic development, died Saturday at a hospital in Palm Springs, Fla., where he lived. A former New York resident, he was 87.
In January 1978, a newly minted Mayor Koch introduced him as a Horatio Alger he had recruited to head the office that the mayor said would produce the city's salvation. Ten weeks later, the two men announced their parting at separate news conferences. 
 Both said Mr. Milano had not been dismissed, but the circumstances left little doubt that the mayor had asked for his resignation. Coming but 74 days into the Koch administration, his was the first casualty in the mayor's cabinet.
He certainly did not need the $1-a-year compensation he was to be paid. At the time, he was selling a business he had started from scratch to the Gulf Oil Company for $16 million.
A native of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood on Manhattan's West Side, Robert Milano was born on June 14, 1912. He attended the High School of Commerce and studied business administration and financial law in evening sessions at City College. In 1930, he went to work as a bookkeeper for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
After scraping together extra cash by selling insurance and holding a part-time accountant's job, he started his own venture selling chemicals in 1936 at the age of 24. It prospered even through his four-year Army service in World War II and, by 1975, evolved into Kewanee Industries, a conglomerate with sales of about $500 million a year.
By the 70's, his business activities were slowing, and Mr. Milano devoted his energies to a role as the businessman in civic and governmental groups. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him in 1971 to the Scott Commission, which the governor created to investigate the city's fiscal policies.
Serving on that panel and on a State Charter Study Commission for New York City gave him enough experience with the workings of the municipal government to enable Mr. Koch to draw on his talent.
He helped expand the New School for Social Research into the present New School University. He joined the New School's board in 1976, served as vice chairman and remained a trustee at his death. In 1995, the university named its Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy for Mr. Milano.
Mr. Milano's survivors include his wife of 61 years, Sidonia Friedsam Milano; their son, Robert S., of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Precautionary Rate Hike by the Fed

 BODY:
Perhaps the Federal Reserve acted prematurely yesterday when it raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in order to reduce spending and thereby weaken inflationary pressures. After all, inflation remains subdued. But the Fed has evidence on its side, and the support of many experts. Its decision is reasonable.
The Fed stubbornly refuses to disclose the criteria it uses to decide when to pump more money into the economy to drive interest rates down, or when to draw money out of the economy to drive interest rates up. This lack of clarity is the one knock on Alan Greenspan's otherwise excellent stewardship of the Fed. Many monetary experts believe that the Fed tries to keep inflation at about 2 percent a year. Rates much above 2 percent disrupt the private sector and, because inflation rates can accelerate, could force the Fed eventually to crack down hard, throwing the economy into recession. Rates much below 2 percent flirt with setting off deflation, when prices fall and make it hard for the government to keep production and jobs from falling alongside. 
 So why did Mr. Greenspan decide to crack down yesterday? The inflation rate has been running at almost 3 percent for the last 12 months and even a bit higher for the last six months. Compensation -- wages plus medical and other fringe benefits -- rose by about 3.5 percent at the end of last year. Both wages and prices were rising faster at the end of last year than they were at the beginning, a worrisome trend for the Fed. The Fed also points to a rapid growth of spending that could cause wages and prices to rise even faster.
There was a time when the Fed was afraid to let the unemployment rate fall much below 6 percent lest inflation take off. But under Mr. Greenspan's direction, the Fed mostly sat back as unemployment fell to close to 4 percent. Inflation hardly budged. There would have been nothing wrong if the Fed had decided yesterday to stay put. But Mr. Greenspan judged the risk too high. February marks the 107th consecutive month on Mr. Greenspan's watch that economic output has risen, the longest uninterrupted growth on record. His judgment warrants the benefit of anyone's doubts.

Fed Raises Interest Rates And Hints at Further Action
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that further rate increases will probably be needed to keep the persistently strong economy from generating inflation. 
 The move, the fourth rate increase since June, was in line with what economists and investors had expected. Financial markets took the announcement in stride. Page A1.
 
Stocks struggled to a mixed finish. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 points, to 11,003.20, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.16 point, to 1,409.12. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 21.98 points, to 4,073.96. C12.
 
Publicis to Acquire Fallon McElligott
Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis advertising agency, said it had agreed to be acquired by the Publicis Group unit of Publicis in Paris, the world's 10th largest agency company in revenue and 12th largest in billings. Maurice Levy, the president of Publicis, would not comment on the purchase price, but it has been estimated at $120 million. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C10.

The Senate voted decisively to make it harder for people to erase their debts, a measure that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy law. Major differences still exist between the Senate bill and a rival House version approved last year. But lawmakers from both parties and Clinton administration officials expressed confidence that Congress can produce a compromise bankruptcy bill that Mr. Clinton can sign into law this year. A1.
 
Indonesia Receives a Credit Plan
International donors meeting in Jakarta gave Indonesia's government a powerful show of support by extending up to $4.7 billion in credit to fill a budget hole and keep the country's tenuous economic recovery alive. C4.
 
30-Year Bond to Be Phased Out
The Treasury announced plans for a reduction in new issuance of 30-year bonds and the buying back of other long-term Treasury debt in a move that could lead to the elimination of the 30-year bond altogether. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.28 percent. C12.
 
Economic Indicators Show Gain
The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators increased four-tenths of a percent in December, in line with analysts' expectations. Separately, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose 4.5 percent during December. For all of 1999, new-home sales rose 2 percent, to a record 904,000. C25.

HEADLINE: Central Bank's Statement On Interest Rate Increases

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 5 3/4 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 5 1/4 percent.
The committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.
Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Gives a Nudge To 2 Key Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today and signaled that further rate increases would probably be needed to keep the persistently strong economy from generating inflation.
The move, the fourth rate increase since June, was in line with what most economists and investors had expected. Financial markets took the announcement in stride. 
 Stocks ended mixed. Bond prices rose, in part because the Treasury Department announced a plan to buy back some of the government's long-term debt as part of an effort to deal with growing budget surpluses. Market Place, Page C1.
The central bank allowed the economy to expand for the last several years at rates well above what conventional wisdom once thought could be sustained without igniting inflation, betting that huge investments in technology would allow companies to absorb cost increases without raising prices.
In the process the Fed discovered that the United States was less susceptible to an upward spiral in wages and prices than almost anyone previously believed, even with unemployment at its current level of 4.1 percent, a 30-year low.
But in raising rates today, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, made clear once more that the central bank's growth experiment had its limits. The message today was that the Fed was increasingly reverting to its traditional posture of stamping out any inflationary pressures before they could endanger an expansion that on Tuesday became the longest on record.
In increasing its benchmark Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks by a quarter- point today, to 5.75 percent, the central bank pushed rates above where they had been in mid-1998, when the Fed cut rates three times to help bring the global financial crisis under control. The Fed also raised its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter-point today, to 5.25 percent.
"By tightening, the Fed signaled carefully to the markets its intention of keeping inflation from accelerating," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York. "It recognizes that stable inflation is the key ingredient to economic expansion."
By raising its official short-term rates, the Fed puts upward pressure on rates paid for everything from credit cards and mortgages to business loans. Banks immediately said today that they would raise their prime lending rates.
Many longer-term rates set directly or indirectly in the bond market -- like those for mortgages and much of the borrowing done by corporations -- have moved higher since the Fed began raising rates last year. But analysts said the impact of long-term bond rates on the economy could be clouded somewhat by the Treasury Department's debt buyback plan.
The Senate took up Mr. Greenspan's nomination to a fourth term today. Both parties said they expected an overwhelming vote in his favor on Thursday, reflecting the broad consensus that he has guided the economy skillfully for more than a dozen years.
In a statement, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee sent a clear signal that today's increase was not likely to be the last.
"The committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth," the statement said, alluding to what Fed officials view as the most basic of economic imbalances.
"Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion," the committee said.
Economists said the Fed was likely to raise rates by at least another half a percentage point in coming months, hoping to temper demand by making borrowing more expensive and taking some steam out of the stock market. The Fed's next meeting is on March 21.
"One more increase is probably in the bank, taking the funds target to 6 percent," said Chris Varvares, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting and forecasting firm in St. Louis. "From then on it depends on a series of factors -- the stock market, the underlying trend of demand and any inflation surprises in either direction that might occur."
The economy grew in last year's fourth quarter by 5.8 percent, well above anyone's estimate of its speed limit. And in a further indication that last year's rate increases had not yet slowed the economy much, the Commerce Department said today that new-home sales rose a strong 4.5 percent in December despite higher mortgage rates.
Still, inflationary pressures are no more than shadowy. By a price measure included in calculation of the gross domestic product, inflation rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from 1.1 percent in the prior three-month period. Yet when volatile oil prices are excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose 1.9 percent last year, down from 2.4 percent in 1998.
"The strong economy is not creating inflation," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "The Fed, as it has been doing, is trying to stay ahead of the problem."
In trying to keep inflation under control, the Fed is trying to reduce demand for goods and services across the economy. There are a variety of channels through which higher interest rates can make that happen, from increasing unemployment to cooling off interest-sensitive sectors like housing.
But analysts say that one of the most important variables in demand is the stock market, which is creating much of the wealth that is allowing consumers to spend freely at auto dealers and malls. If higher rates do not put a ceiling on stock prices, they said, demand is likely to remain too strong for the Fed's tastes.
"If a stock market correction doesn't happen, then consumer spending remains very strong, to the point where a Fed funds target of 6 percent would be insufficient to get the economy down to the speed limit," Mr. Varvares said. "If the stock market were to hold at its recent peak, Fed funds would easily have to go to 7 percent to elicit the slowing the Fed would need to see."
The Fed might also need to push rates up more aggressively if long-term bond rates continue their recent decline.
At the same time, Fed officials are well aware that recessions are often caused by the central bank's raising interest rates a bit too much in the pursuit of price stability, choking off growth. Without firmer evidence that inflation is actually bubbling through the economy, Mr. Greenspan is likely to stick to a cautious, incremental approach to tightening policy.
"Since they're not behind the curve and we don't have an inflation problem outside of energy," Mr. Thayer said, "I don't think there's any urgency."

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES A BILL TO TOUGHEN BANKRUPTCY RULES

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Senate approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws today, decisively passing a measure that would make it harder for people to seek legal protection from payment of their debts.
But in a move that could complicate final passage of the legislation, it also included in the measure a $1 increase over three years in the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour.
Major differences still exist in the details of the bankruptcy overhaul passed today and a rival House version approved last year. But lawmakers from both parties and Clinton administration officials expressed confidence today that Congress could produce a compromise bankruptcy bill that Mr. Clinton could sign into law this year. 
 Less certain is how Democrats and Republicans will resolve their differences over the minimum wage. Democrats had wanted the $1 increase be phased in over two years.
The Senate vote today passing the Bankruptcy Reform Act came after Democrats summoned Vice President Al Gore from the campaign trail in Manhattan to break a possible tie vote on a contentious abortion rights amendment to the bill. The measure would bar people convicted of crimes against abortion clinics from using bankruptcy protection to avoid paying civil judgments.
Republicans, who had vigorously opposed the amendment, abandoned their opposition once Mr. Gore took his seat as president of the Senate, letting the measure pass handily. Page A20.
Senators later voted 83 to 14 to approve the overarching legislation that was proposed by the nation's largest banks and credit-card companies, but opposed by consumer and civil rights groups. One reason the outcome was so lopsided was that the campaign contributions and lobbying muscle come mainly from the politically powerful financial community, concentrated in New York.
The banking industry has grown increasingly concerned that too many people with money are taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws and skipping out on mountains of debt. "Despite their ability to pay, wealthier filers walk away from an estimated $3 billion per year in debt," said Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
The measure imposes new income requirements on people seeking a fresh start by using the nation's debt-forgiveness laws and limits a loophole used by the wealthy to shield their homes. And the bill requires credit-card companies to disclose interest rates and fees more prominently on monthly statements.
"It was time for Congress to close the loopholes that let big spenders walk away from debts and update the code to achieve a healthier balance between consumers and creditors," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who sponsored the bill.
Negotiators from the Senate will now meet with their counterparts from the House to reconcile competing bills. Last year, the House approved, 313 to 108, a bill with even stricter provisions on debtors. The White House said both versions are unacceptable, calling the House version too harsh and inflexible and the tax breaks attached to the minimum-wage provision in the Senate measure unacceptable.
A spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in her campaign for the Senate in New York has criticized the bankruptcy legislation for being unfair to women and children, declined to comment today on the Senate's action.
Under the Senate bill, the minimum wage would increase to $6.15 from $5.15 over three years, instead of over two years as Democrats want. Senate Democrats also object to $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that Republicans say would help small businesses adjust to the rising minimum wage. Democrats had proposed $29 billion package over 10 years. The House bill does not have a minimum-wage provision.
"The amendment in the bill includes a poorly targeted tax package with tax breaks that are skewed disproportionately to upper income people," said a letter signed by all 45 Senate Democrats to the lawmakers who will negotiate the House-Senate compromise.
The thrust of both House and Senate bills is to make it more difficult for people to discharge their debts. Both measures try to make debtors accept more responsibility by making it more difficult to file Chapter 7 bankruptcies, which allows consumers to discharge unsecured debts that remain after assets are liquidated. Lawmakers aim to make Chapter 13, which requires reorganization of debt under a repayment plan, the bankruptcy of choice.
With Americans filing a record 1.4 million bankruptcies in 1998, Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, said the bill "closes loopholes and ends unfairness in provisions that are totally being abused and making a mockery out of legitimate bankruptcy law."
But critics of the measure, like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today "the industry's cure is worse than the disease." Bankruptcy filings dropped by 112,000 in 1999 from 1998, Mr. Kennedy said, and the bill's provisions make it more difficult for thousands of debtors who file for bankruptcy because of corporate layoffs and downsizing because of mergers.
At issue in several days of floor debate and outside Capitol Hill today, was whether it is the banks or their customers who are responsible for the growth in bankruptcy filings.
The chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, Howard M. Metzenbaum, a former Democratic senator from Ohio, said the Senate bill "will deny many families in financial crisis a fresh start while spurring more reckless and irresponsible lending by credit-card issuers."
House and Senate negotiators have a tough road ahead. There are several crucial differences between the two bills. Both measures impose a new income requirement. The Senate bill generally says that anyone with the ability to make at least $15,000 in payments over five years would not be able to have their debts forgiven. Under the House bill, the threshold is $6,000 over five years.
The Senate bill is more generous than the House in shielding, or creating "safe harbors" for debtors who make less than the median income in their state or regions.
For Chapter 7 bankruptcy filers, the Senate puts a $100,000 cap on housing equity they can exempt from creditors' motions. The House bill has a cap of $250,000, but allows states to opt out, an important distinction for wealthy bankruptcy filers in Texas and Florida.
Finally, the Senate bill provides new consumer protections, like the disclosures on credit cards. The House protection is more limited and more generic.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said of the bill, "The proverbial small type that hides fees and interest costs will be converted to large font so that consumers can make informed purchases, determine the best repayment schedule and manage family expenses."
While adopting the abortion rights amendment, senators rejected several others, including one offered by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, that would have prohibited gun makers and dealers from using bankruptcy to escape debts incurred in civil lawsuits.

HEADLINE: A 3-Hour Talk With Putin Leaves Albright Encouraged

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 2

 BODY:
After a month of what she called "psychobabble" from people trying to decipher Russia's new leader, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met Vladimir V. Putin today on his turf and said she was taken with his "can-do approach" and his lack of dogma.
"I found him a very well-informed person, a good interlocutor, obviously a Russian patriot who seeks a normal position with the West," she said of Mr. Putin, who also caught her attention by abandoning note cards that his aides had prepared for him. 
 The three-hour meeting, in Mr. Putin's elegantly refurbished white and green office in the Kremlin, was the first lengthy session that a high-ranking Clinton administration official has had with the acting president since he replaced Boris N. Yeltsin, who resigned on New Year's Eve.
While it seemed that Dr. Albright found the contrast between the erratic Mr. Yeltsin and the crisp Mr. Putin refreshing, the meeting, which ran more than double the time expected, did not produce any breakthroughs in the recently troubled relationship between Washington and Moscow.
The war in Chechnya remained an irritant between the two, with Mr. Putin arguing that Russia had to take military action against the "terrorists" in the republic, she said.
"We did not mince words, either of us, on Chechnya," Dr. Albright told reporters. "I said to him what I said publicly -- that he's riding a tiger."
She added, "I do not think we are any closer to a political solution in Chechnya."
Dr. Albright said she proposed that an international team of experts be allowed to visit Chechnya to determine the needs of people who have been displaced by the fighting and stranded with little heat or shelter. "He seemed receptive," she said.
In addition, he did not reject a proposal that foreign journalists be given accreditation to cover the war, she said. "He seemed to take that on board," she said. "We'll see."
On arms control, Dr. Albright said she was encouraged that Mr. Putin seemed open to the Clinton administration's push to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
In public, Russian officials have been defiant in rejecting any changes to the treaty. Earlier this week, Mr. Putin alluded to Washington's promoting the "destruction" of the treaty, the key arms control agreement of the cold war.
The administration contends that the threat of long range missiles from nations like North Korea raises the need for a limited national missile defense system, which could be deployed only with changes to the treaty.
Today, Dr. Albright said Mr. Putin showed flexibility on the subject. "He seemed to have an understanding of the new threats and how to deal with them," she said.
Elaborating a little on Dr. Albright's account, a senior administration official said that Mr. Putin "did not deny the new threat." Mr. Putin suggested that the United States and Russia should together develop a "common assessment" of the threat while at the same time "maintaining the fundamental principles of the A.B.M. treaty," the official said.
"I'm not saying he agreed with us," the official said. "But his approach was, 'Let's see if we can accomplish something here.' It's encouraging when a Russian leader adopts flexibility on a position."
Mr. Putin told Dr. Albright that the new makeup of the Russian Parliament since the December elections made it more plausible that the second strategic arms reduction treaty would be ratified. Start II, which mandated a reduction in warheads deployed by each side, was signed by the United States and Russia in 1993 but has languished in Parliament since. One test of Mr. Putin's leadership, administration officials have said, will be whether he follows through on his pledge to see that the treaty is ratified.
In a speech last month, Dr. Albright said she believed that Mr. Putin was "one of the leading reformers" in Russia, based on his activities as deputy mayor of St. Petersburg and then in the Yeltsin administration,
Some experts on Russia have disputed this, but Dr. Albright appeared to be confident of her view after the meeting today.
Aides who accompanied her said Mr. Putin had stressed the need for strengthening the legal system so that the economy could function properly. He understood the need for new bankruptcy laws and for closing loopholes in the tax code, they said.
Unlike Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Putin was attentive to details, listened and took notes, said aides of Dr. Albright who attended the meeting. And Dr. Albright said she also found Mr. Putin attentive and patient.
"I've been in lots of meetings where you could just exchange your cards," she said of the note cards that diplomats often rely on and read from during official meetings like the one today. Instead, Mr. Putin made a joke by holding up the stack of cards that had been given to him but he did not need.
But for the secretary, the real assessments were yet to come. "What is important is to judge him by what he does," she said.

Tennis Tries to Take Root in Unlikely Soil

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe, Feb. 2

 BODY:
There were four tennis courts and a wall to hit against, all surrounded by acres upon acres of poverty. On this oasis of athleticism, there were kids with big smiles hitting forehands, and a few of them had bare feet.
"The bare truth of tennis is that it takes money," said Levar Harper-Griffith, though he stood on these sun-baked hardcourts today as something of a counter to that point. 
 He is 18 years old, a black kid from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, whose mother worked two jobs so she could shepherd him to junior tournaments to play against kids of more affluent means.
Somehow, against the odds and his mother's better judgment, her efforts and his talent landed Harper-Griffith here this week, as a practice partner for John McEnroe's United States Davis Cup team as it prepares for the first-round competition against Zimbabwe on Friday.
The host country has approximately 80,000 whites in a population of nearly 13 million, but its three competing players this weekend are white. Wayne and Byron Black, Zimbabwe's pro tour veterans, are national heroes for their surprising share of Davis Cup success. The Black brothers are also a reminder of the imbalance of wealth distribution here that remains from the colonial years before 1980.
Economic power may not require a big forehand, but Paul Chingoka said that a black tennis star in Zimbabwe would, symbolically, be huge.
"This is the pressure I am getting every day, for us to develop a top black player," said Chingoka, the president of Tennis Zimbabwe. "This is going to happen. In all age groups now, the top players are black children. Tennis is still seen as elitist, but there has been pressure to desegregate."
Five years ago, Tennis Zimbabwe embarked on its plan to privately finance the tennis courts here, in one of the country's highest poverty and population density areas, about a 30-minute drive from Harare.
Chingoka said that 400 to 500 children use the facility, free of charge, every week. Coca-Cola helps underwrite the costs for the right to cover much of the facility with its promotional graffiti. Three years ago, the United States government kicked in for one of the courts.
"The U.S. paid for one court -- big deal," huffed McEnroe, ever the ambassador, after a one-hour clinic in which he was the star attraction.
Gently prodded, he soon went on an anticorporate rant that was overheard by a Tennis Zimbabwe official, who rushed over to say that the soft drink company's largess was more than the "thousand Cokes" that McEnroe surmised.
Longtime Nike pitchman that he is, this probably isn't a potential platform for the political future McEnroe keeps talking about. Yet in his wonderfully roundabout way, he was making an excellent point about tennis and the excessive grandstanding that goes on when officials of the sport in any country get going on the subject of introducing the sport to people who don't traditionally play it.
One of the Tennis Zimbabwe coaches said that many of the local juniors live too far from these courts, or any courts, and must travel for hours to play. The Black brothers, conversely, grew up on a farm outside Harare that had four grass courts installed by their father, Don, a former pro.
McEnroe has always wondered how good he would have been had Harry Hopman, the Australian legend, not dropped out of the sky, onto Long Island. Venus and Serena Williams had a most unusual father in Richard. Andre Agassi, for all his hard work to become tennis's irresistible force, was trained by daddy from the age of 3. Another bare tennis truth is that it takes a willing parent or guiding angel to raise a child who may one day compete in the global village.
A native of Grenada, Bernice Griffith used to carry young Levar along with her racket to neighborhood parks to save money on a sitter. She would play for 55 minutes, then hit with her only child for five.
She never cared much for the wealthier and pushier tennis parents she later spent afternoons with. It was never her intention for Levar to become a real player.
"He loved it, though, and it kept him into his studies because those were the rules," she said from her home in Sarasota, Fla.
When her son grew into a world-ranked junior, she hoped tennis would carry him to a Stanford scholarship. He recently turned pro instead. His mother, not wishing to dwell on a sore point, just keeps reminding him to take pictures, to bring something home, when he calls every night to report from Africa.
Tonight, he said he would tell his mother about those kids he'd hit with on a hardcourt that was a long way from home. Brooklyn was never as forbidding as Chitungwiza. Levar Harper-Griffith understood that the odds for those kids were much greater than his own. He said he would wish them an angel, even if it could be for only five minutes an hour.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
'THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an "American Century" or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith). 

* "BERLIN METROPOLIS: JEWS AND THE NEW CULTURE, 1890-1918," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through April 23). A show that should be a required course in every New Yorker's education: our cosmopolitan tradition, our appetite for novelty and change spring partly from seeds planted a century ago in Berlin. Though it highlights the part played by Jews, the story it tells could be the story of all outsiders who gravitate toward cities in search of meaning. With more than 200 paintings, stage designs, sheet-music covers, gallery catalogs, photographs, sculptures and other objects, it covers the years when modernism took root: in galleries, publishing houses and theaters, in advanced art from France and Italy, in the rich street life of newspapers, cafes and shop windows. Given the revolutionary temper of the art, the presentation is surprisingly understated, and this adds enormously to the show's power. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Tuesdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp).
* "BODY ART: MARKS OF IDENTITY," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through May 29). The theme of this smart, entertaining, globe-spanning show is personal adornment of the most intimate kind, including tattooing, piercing and scarification. The packed installation offers just enough bare multicultural flesh to inspire rubbernecking without actually being an adults-only affair. Most interesting is the way art and anthropology are seamlessly brought together. Greek vases and African hairpins, ethnic postcards and Indian miniatures, Victorian corsets, Amazonian nose plugs and contemporary neo-tribal body work from New York share the limelight. It all makes fascinating sense, and a family-style museum gets to looks sexy in the bargain. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8:45 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly; $4.50, children (Holland Cotter).
"KOREAN CERAMICS FROM THE MUSEUM OF ORIENTAL CERAMICS, OSAKA," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through June 4). This beautifully serene exhibition, cloistered within the Met's white-on-white Korean arts gallery, presents 48 objects, all considered masterpieces. For starters there are the exquisitely refined 12th-century Koryo dynasty celadons, coveted even by the Chinese. Then comes the marvelously loose, incipiently modern punchong ware from the early Choson dynasty, which brings out a distinctly Korean penchant for roughness, asymmetry and the unexpected. The show closes with the restrained all-white and blue-and-white porcelain made from the late 15th to early 19th centuries, which return to a Chinese aesthetic but remain subtly apart in their assertive shapes, plain surfaces and the slight irregularities: in short, in their perfect imperfectness. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Suggested admission: $10 for adults; $5 for students and the elderly (Smith).
* CILDO MEIRELES, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through March 5). This prominent Brazilian artist is usually labeled a conceptualist, but he might better be called a producer of magic theater. His enveloping installations are like waking dreams, closer to Magritte than Duchamp. In "Volatile" you walk barefoot through ankle-deep talc to behold a single candle illuminating a cavernous room; it is like a religious experience. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $4, students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
* "MILLENNIAL DREAMS: VISION AND PROPHECY IN AMERICAN FOLK ART," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 65th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through May 14). With all the Y2K furor it's easy to forget that for most Americans not so long ago the turn of the millennium carried profound spiritual weight: it signified the end of time, the culmination of history, when good and evil faced off and the heavenly kingdom arrived on earth. This intelligent and stirring show explores these ideas in works ranging from the Apocalyptic paintings of the Pentecostal preacher William A. Blayney to Sister Gertrude Morgan's visions of an interracial paradise to Edward Hicks's earthly lions-with-lambs "Peaceable Kingdom." At the center of everything is a set of Shaker chairs, each as plain and elegant as a hymn-book tune and suspended together in space like a stairway to heaven. Just perfect. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Cotter).
* "ONLY THE BEST: MASTERPIECES OF THE CALOUSTE GULBENKIAN MUSEUM, LISBON," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Feb. 27). A Turkish-born Armenian oil millionaire who spent most of his adult life in Europe, Gulbenkian (1869-1955) was as eclectic in his aesthetic tastes as he was focused on quality. He bought, he scrutinized, he de-accessioned, ending up with one of the century's greatest collections, 80 of whose 5,000 objects are in this show. Organized in alternating groups of fine and decorative arts, it nearly covers the cultural glove, with mostly outstanding examples. The decorative holdings include Turkish and Islamic ceramics and textiles, jaw-dropping examples of 18th-century French silver and a selection of jewelry by Rene Lalique. Alternating with these are Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities; medieval and Renaissance paintings, including a stunning portrait of a young woman by Ghirlandaio; and one great painting each by Rubens, Fragonard, Manet and Degas. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
* "VISIBLE TRACES: RARE BOOKS AND SPECIAL COLLECTIONS FROM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF CHINA," Queens Borough Public Library, 89-11 Merrick Boulevard, Jamaica, (718) 990-8550 (through March 15). One of the freshest exhibitions of Asian art in New York this season is this gathering of 68 manuscripts, books, maps and ink rubbings installed in the Queens Library Gallery. The chronological span is huge, and although the written word prevails, there are visual delights aplenty. Highlights include a seventh-century Buddhist sutra scroll from the Dunhuang caves; a sweetly tinted manual for raising goldfish, and a vivid pictographic text from the Naxi people, an ethnic minority within China. A free daylong scholarly symposium will be held on Feb. 19, at the Queens Flushing Library; reservations are required: (718) 990-8665 (Cotter).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
"CONTEMPORARY BRITISH CERAMICS," James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Feb. 19). Traditionalism prevails in this selection of more than 50 mostly functional pieces by 16 British ceramicists. Against the understated background of earnest technical and formal refinement, Elizabeth Fritsch's geometrically patterned bottle and vase, Geoffrey Swindell's small, podlike vases with delicate pink openings, and Ursula Morely Price's containers, curiously finned like underwater creatures, stand out (Johnson).
MELVIN EDWARDS, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through March 31). Compact assemblages of found metal parts, welded together into dense Cubist compositions, continue the "Lynch Fragments" series that Mr. Edwards began in the 1960's. Comprising elements like chains, padlocks, spikes, horse shoes and hammer heads, these works from the 90's are formally implosive, poetic meditations on a long history of racial violence (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
MORRIS GRAVES, "Instruments for a New Navigation," Schmidt-Bingham Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-1122 (through Feb. 12). These nautical-looking "instruments," spurred by the cosmic implications of space-age exploration, were made by the painter in 1962 but have not been shown until now. Mostly table-top constructions of cast bronze and steel with marble or alabaster bases, they are disks and plaques that frame mirrors, lenses and thin sheets of materials like mica, glass, brass filings and fossilized iron pyrites. A small chromatic forest of them inhabits the gallery. At best these objects are high decoration, a far cry from the delicate mysteries of Mr. Graves's luminous paintings at their best (Grace Glueck).
DAVID HUNTER, "Self-Portraits," Danese, 41 East 57th Street (212) 223-2227 (through Feb. 12). Each of the extremely elegant Neo-Minimalist paintings by this 34-year-old New York artist consists of an off-white, textured square joined to a velvety black vertical band; razor-incised lines crisscross at the center while faint pencil lines, arced and straight, define the perimeter. Whether they work as self-portraits, as the artist intends, is doubtful, but subtly sensuous formal variations invite close, meditative scrutiny (Johnson).
"VACLAV VYTLACIL AND THE ADVENT OF AMERICAN MODERNISM: 1920-1940," David Findlay Jr. Fine Art, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 486-7660 (through Feb. 12). Through teaching and his own painting, Vytlacil (1892-1984), born in New York to Czech immigrant parents, played a role in promoting European modernism in the 1930's and, as a founding member of the American Abstract Artists, pushed actively for the recognition of home-grown American abstraction. Early on his work was inspired by Cezanne through Hans Hofmann; later he was influenced by Matisse and Picasso. The strongest works here are his abstractions of the later 30's and early 40's, biomorphic and geometric forms deftly melded into dynamic compositions. They seem on the verge of Abstract Expressionism, but the development of that movement fell to more muscular talents (Glueck).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
CECILY BROWN, Gagosian Gallery, 136 Wooster Street, (212) 228-2828 (through Feb. 19). Something of a cautionary tale, the third solo show of this highly visible young English painter indicates that her public career has outdistanced her artistic development. On canvases that seem big for bigness's sake, she highlights blizzards of energetic yet vacuous brushwork with hints of bodies and erotic activity. The results are best when taken as Conceptual Art objects, particularly as feminine sendups of Abstract Expressionist angst and posturing. But naughty bits not withstanding, the majority of these paintings are uninteresting from any distance. The artist's earlier work, which featured orgy-crazed bunnies, was merely promising, but it had a raunchy painterly abandon to call its own (Smith).
 GEORGE DEEM, Nancy Hoffman, 429 West Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 966-6676 (through Feb. 16). Since the early 1970's Mr. Deem has been appropriating and more or less cleverly manipulating images from Vermeer and other famous artists. In this small show he offers Vermeer copies in which he has omitted the figures, leaving oddly familiar, empty rooms (Johnson).
* KEITH EDMIER AND RICHARD PHILLIPS, Friedrich Petzel, 26 Wooster Street, (212) 334-9466 (through Feb. 12). Mr. Edmier presents a haunting life-size sculpture of his pregnant mother cast in translucent pink plastic. She wears a pink suit copied from the one worn by Jacqueline Kennedy on the day her husband was assassinated, and it reveals her translucent abdomen, which holds the artist as a young fetus. Mr. Phillips's pencil drawing of a Christlike George Harrison, copied from an old Playboy magazine illustration, brings out the Virgin Mary in Mr. Edmier's sculpture (Johnson).
JAMES FEE, Yancey Richardson, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-1255 (through Feb. 19). Previously known for romantic photographs of the industrial landscape, Mr. Fee here turns to the female nude. In these blurred, solarized, toned, cut-up and otherwise aggressively manipulated pictures, shadowy models run, dance or tumble in outdoor settings. There is a feeling of dreamlike action, but the pictures seem overly caught up in technical processes (Johnson).
CHRIS HIPKISS, Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-3768 (through Feb. 26). This self-taught English artist's vast, intensely detailed visions of nature under the baleful dominion of industry -- with pretty androgynous warriors clad in sexy outfits appearing here and there -- suggest the drive of a genuinely offbeat imagination struggling to come to grips with powerful psychological tensions. He conceives of his epic, ongoing narrative as a story of war between masculine culture and feminine nature. Whatever they mean, they are fascinating (Johnson).
RAYMOND PETTIBON, David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street, (212) 966-9074 (through Feb. 12). Mr. Pettibon continues to practice his signature formula with nonchalant perfection. To poetic and humorous effect, he loosely copies found images onto paper and neatly adds words from sources like the Bible, Proust or Charles Manson. One piece shows Jesus suffering on the cross with the words, "Truth is I have been in such a state of mind as to read over my lines and hate them" (Johnson).
BEATRICE RIESE, A.I.R., 40 Wooster Street, (212) 966-0799 (through Feb. 12). Ms. Riese began her long and distinguished career as an art student in Paris in the 1930's, and later worked in New York as a textile designer. This retrospective of her intricately patterned grid paintings, beginning with one from 1969, includes oils on canvas, watercolors and most recently rows of angular alphabetic forms finely inked on paper. Throughout, the artist's play with repetition and variation, flickering light and muted colors keeps the eye engaged (Johnson).
JENNY SCOBEL, Locus, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 334-6424 (through Feb. 12). Working with graphite and wax on gessoed panels, Ms. Scobel creates mysterious portraits of a certain imaginary, pretty young woman posed in front of old-time animated cartoons. It might be interesting to see her fascination with this character extended beyond portraiture (Johnson).
IONEL TALPAZAN AND EDWARD NAGRODZKI, American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530 (through Feb. 12). Obsessed with U.F.O.'s, Mr. Talpazan, a Romanian immigrant who lives in New York, makes powerfully abstracted, vividly colored diagrammatic pictures of flying saucers. More amazingly inventive than obsessive, Nagrodzki (1915-1999) produced amusing, eccentric sculptures like a grinning snake made from hinged-together coconuts (Johnson).
"(UN)RESOLVED," Rosenberg & Kaufman, 115 Wooster Street, (212) 431-4838 (through Feb. 12). The ambiguous title is appropriate for this miscellaneous group exhibition. Among the more interesting works are exquisitely made drawings on music-composition paper by Andrew Topolski, a soberly sensuous rectilinear composition made of red commercial primer paints on a sheet of steel by Merrill Wagner, and an abstract canvas with a curiously raised, netlike grid of green paint by Vadim Katznelson (Johnson).
ADRIANA VAREJAO, Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene Street, (212) 965-0753 (through Feb. 12). The best piece in this Brazilian artist's second New York show is an illusionistic, three-dimensional painting: what appears to be a rectangular section of European-style blue-and-white tiles has torn and slipped like skin, revealing an underlying stew of bloody entrails. It is funny like a good special effects event in a horror movie, and it is also a visceral metaphor about terror underlying the veneer of colonialist civilization (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
HARRY BERTOIA AND TODD EBERLE, Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 980-5454 (through Feb. 26). "Sounding Sculptures" is by Bertoia (1915-1978), who was best known as a furniture designer for Knoll International but also made hand-welded copper and bronze sculptures that tinkle like chimes and resound like bells when struck. He created an entire orchestra of such instruments and composed music for them that seems perfectly attuned to New Age ears. Mr. Emberle's photos, titled "Wired," are close-ups of historic hardware from the Computer History Museum at NASA's Ames Base in California (Cotter).
 MARTIN CREED, Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258 (through Feb. 12). Two years ago this winning British conceptual artist packed the gallery with colored balloons. This time he fills it with darkness and light. His "Work No. 127, The Lights Going On and Off" is just what it says: a row of overhead spots flashing on and off at five-second intervals in an otherwise empty room (Cotter).
JEFF ELROD, Pat Hearn, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7377 (through Feb. 26). The abstract forms in Mr. Elrod's clean, cool paintings are digitally derived from random doodles executed by mouses and then printed out and transferred to canvas with razor-sharp precision. "Mythic Proportion" looks like a cross between a Clyfford Still peak and an Ellsworth Kelly pod. The super-streamlined "Delete Yourself" consists of a big Dionysian scribble that never quite lets loose (computers never do), set on a monochromatic Matisse-flat field (Cotter).
TIM GARDNER, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121 (through Feb. 12). This young Canadian artist makes a United States solo debut with dozens of snapshotlike watercolors of teenage boys doing the uncouth, spacey things that some boys do: streaking, surfing, climbing mountains, staring slack-jawed into space. The results, many of them self-portraits, seem complicated until you think of them as updated Winslow Homers, in which virtuosic execution and just-the-facts nostalgia disguise slow-acting uncertainties (Cotter).
MICHELLE GRABNER, Ten in One Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through Feb. 12). The grids in Ms. Grabner's table-top-size paintings, made up of little dots and strokes of enamel paint, are far removed from classic geometric abstraction. With their soft colors and off-kilter sway, they point to humbler decorative patterns found on baby blankets and dish towels, the raw material of a domestic sublime (Cotter).
 "LUX," Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Feb. 19). As its title suggests, this good group show in a new Chelsea gallery is about luminosity. It centers on a utopian Dan Flavin neon sculpture, "Monument for V. Tatlin" (1964), and radiates out from there with work by Alex Katz, Karin Sander, Bing Wright and Liz Rideal (Cotter).
DEBORAH MESA-PELLY, "Safety," Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 967-8040 (through Feb. 12). Ms. Mesa-Pelly is one of several young artists creating cryptic, psychologically charged narratives for the camera. Female protagonists appear in dreamlike settings, which Ms. Mesa-Pelly constructs by hand. The romantic, anxious scenarios that result are a mix of Nancy Drew, Emily Bronte and "Roswell," pitting innocence against experience, home against the world (Cotter).
 RICHARD SERRA, "Switch," Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 228-2828 (through Feb. 26). Big art doesn't get much bigger than this 28-ton, 13-foot-high sculpture multipart by Mr. Serra, installed in Gagosian's new hangarlike gallery. Mr. Serra's work has been called oppressive, but visitors seem to be having fun with this one. It's theater, epic, expensive, flawlessly produced (Cotter).
 
Other Galleries
 
VALENTINA DUBASKY, Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424 (through March 4). In semi-abstract landscape paintings with heavily built-up surfaces, Ms. Dubasky, who has been exhibiting regularly in New York for 20 years, layers fanciful plant forms over blurry, patchwork fields. The best, as in the swamplike scene of "Ancient Futures," have an appealing combination of material richness and shimmering light (Johnson).
"FROM THIS WORLD TO THE NEXT," Jewish Approaches to Illness, Death and the Afterlife, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 678-8000 (through April 12). The seminary houses the largest repository of Jewish manuscripts, books and prints in the Western Hemisphere. This stirring, modestly scaled thematic exhibition on death and immortality gives a hint of its resources. Installed on three floors, it includes 18th- and 19th-century prints of funerals, Renaissance manuscripts on the much-debated topic of the afterlife, and memorial books recording individual deaths and the names of vanished communities. The library closes at 3 p.m. on Fridays and is closed on Saturdays. (Cotter).
 
Last Chance
 
CHRIS FINLEY, Jack Tilton, 49 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 941-1775 (through tomorrow). If Chris Finley's painting had a soundtrack, it would be some kind of comical shrieking. Wedding Cubism and Pop, he uses high-keyed sign painter's enamels in moods that range from manic goofiness to hysteria. The feeling of catastrophic hilarity is very much of the moment (Johnson).
DAVID HUMPHREY, McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 688-5951 (through tomorrow). A comic, surrealistic eroticism is grounded by Mr. Humphrey in lushly materialistic painting. Outlined cartoon style or realized as blurry photographic images, male and female figures morph and merge on opalescent fields, yielding dreamily layered, pastoral visions at once graceful and funky (Johnson).
"INSTRUMENT OF CHANGE: JIM SCHOPPERT RETROSPECTIVE 1947-1992," National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3820 (through Sunday). Schoppert (1947-1992) was born in Alaska of American Indian and German descent, and his work bridges European modernism and traditional Northwest Indian art. His European models (Miro, Brancusi) are fairly easy to spot, as are the Indian forms that he drew on. What's moving is the diplomatic way he brought them all together so that they both yield and retain their distinctive identities. The synthesizing process is most successful in several monumental polychrome wall sculptures carved from wood, with deeply cut designs and twilight colors. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Free (Cotter).
* "EASTMAN JOHNSON: PAINTING AMERICA," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). If he wasn't the most exciting painter, Johnson (1824-1906) was a solid one whose mix of corny stereotype and original observation was heavily influenced by 17th-century Dutch genre painting. His narrative focus encompassed rural and domestic life, women, children and old men, and a group of important African-American subjects. His boldest endeavor before and during the Civil War was painting antislavery scenes, like the powerful "Ride for Liberty: The Fugitive Slaves" (circa 1862). After the war he became noted for his domestic interiors and scenes of rural life. This show is a worthy tribute to an artist who fused home-grown talent with European training to convey a well-varnished vision of 19th-century America. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (first Saturday of each month, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.) Admission: $4; $2 for students; $1.50 for the elderly (Glueck).
"LA LA," Tricia Collins, 83 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1861 (through tomorrow). This playful four-artist show offers a quirky mix of representation and abstraction. It includes Michele Basora's paintings of chubby, big-eyed little girls; swirling psychedelic doodles by Layla Lozano; Jason Rosenberg's jewel-like compositions of stripes, rectangles and targets; and best of all Warren Isensee's buoyant, perfectly patterned arrangements of crisply painted pastel-colored ovoids (Johnson).
* JOHN SINGER SARGENT, "Portraits of the Wertheimer Family," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sunday). A reunion of a dozen Sargent portraits commissioned by the wealthy Jewish art dealer Asher Wertheimer. The ensemble hung in the family's London home, but the bequest of nine of them to the National Portrait Gallery in the 1920's aroused the ire of British worthies, who felt they didn't belong in a museum devoted to exalted Britons. Most of the portraits were eventually consigned to storage at the Tate Gallery. The show's catalog raises interesting issues like the position of Jews in English society and to what degree Sargent stressed his friends' Jewishness, given the slight edge of caricature and stereotype that he conferred on many of his portrait subjects. Most of the paintings give a wonderful account of Sargent's bold brushwork and his talent for finding and projecting his subjects' individuality. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).
ROBERT THIELE, M-13, 72 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 925-3007 (through tomorrow). Mr. Thiele continues to produce small, monochromatic shaped paintings. His boxy rounded rectangles or circles and other eccentric shapes have an appealingly clunky, near-sculptural presence and delicately nuanced surfaces. They look best gathered into groups, however; this exhibition seems underpopulated (Johnson).
B. WURTZ, "Buttons, Part I," Feature, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772 (through today). Like a cross between Kandinsky and Richard Tuttle, B. Wurtz's painting seems both cosmic and mundane. On loose, raw canvases he has painted circles and straight lines with dry economy and strategically sewn buttons to the fabric. At first these works seem too unfinished and too slight to sustain interest, but they have a cheeky intelligence and a material presence that can grow on you (Johnson).

Not Easy to Like, but Impossible to Forget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN; "Walker Evans," is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through May 14.

 BODY:
HIS general note is lyrical understanding of the street, trained observation of it, special feeling for patina, eye for revealing detail, over all of which is thrown a poetry."
That's Walker Evans, writing in 1931 about Atget. Later, lecturing in 1964 about Atget and also about Mathew Brady, another hero, he projected a group of the penny picture postcards he had collected since he was a child. 
 "Can you imagine anything more?" he asked his audience about his anonymous little hand-colored images of small-town main streets and trolley cars. "A conglomeration of hideous things that come together by casting a spell of -- I can't call it beauty, but of a certain kind of silent poetry."
Twice, poetry. That was what Evans was after in his own photographs, a poetry that you couldn't call beauty, not conventional beauty anyway, an art inspired by vernacular subjects and aspiring to the natural dignity of the street. As the Met's excellent new retrospective of him reiterates, to the end of his life (he died in 1975, at 72), Evans had this goal, which in his case became a distinctly American project.
Accounts of him during his last years make him out to be an ironic, oblique conversationalist, funny, insecure, vulnerable, weakened. His best work was years behind him. He had trouble understanding why people were no longer interested in what he was doing, but he had been out of the spotlight for a long time. Some people thought he was already dead when he had his last retrospective in 1971.
The list of people he couldn't abide or about whom he made nasty, unbecoming cracks is well known. About Ralph Steiner, the photographer who generously offered to teach him photography, Evans commented, "He is a bitter little Jew, intelligent, whose limitations are skillfully blurred."
Evans despised Victorian proprieties, which he associated with his parents. He hated all do-gooders and ideologues, whether they were limousine liberals or far-right-wingers, and he especially disliked "artistes."
"Too much exposure to art is not very good for an artist," he told his students. He couldn't stand the idea that he might be linked with somebody like Alfred Stieglitz, who represented what might be called official bohemianism, which to him was as bad as the old academy.
As Douglas Eklund puts it in the catalog for the Metropolitan's show, "In all of those circles Evans the man moved quite comfortably but with a residue of free-floating negativity; the uniquely subdued, dispassionate tone (and some might argue the chilling effect) of his photographs came from this sustained and critical refusal to join."
The Met's survey, organized by Jeff L. Rosenheim, a curator in the museum's photography department, sweeps skillfully through six decades of Evans's career, with 175 vintage photographs and other objects and documents. The stress on vintage photographs means that there's a patina to his early work, now 70 or so years old, which is an interesting counterpoint to the astringency.
The documents and objects come from Evans's archives, which the Met owns. They include "Pictures of the Time," a rarity of sorts: a splenetic, witty scrapbook of clippings from newspapers and magazines that Evans compiled with the writer James Agee. It consisted of what they hated about commercial photography and photojournalism, like celebrity portraits and soft-core bathing-beauty advertisements, but also what they liked, like crime scene photos and ethnographic documents: all straight, unpretentious pictures. You see clearly what Evans became when you look at what he did and didn't admire.
There are also copies of Fortune magazine, where he was a longtime editor, with Evans's photo spreads in them, a slide show of his great color pictures of railroad cars, which he did for Fortune, and postcards and old road signs.
From the beginning, Evans was fascinated by lettered signs, and he emphasized the obvious connection between language and photography: they were two surrogates of reality, words and pictures each being meaningful but incomplete and often misleading by themselves. Signs, like photographs, were to him specifically a form of poetry, and his photographs of isolated words or letters read as a kind of abstract language.
He collected road signs, even pilfered them: he would drive around rural Connecticut with students who would unscrew the signs he liked most when the coast was clear.
This is the first complete retrospective of Evans. The 1971 overview, at the Museum of Modern Art, came before he worked with the Polaroid SX-70, with which he took his last photographs. Those are minor pictures, mostly, but intriguing. A mass-market gadget given to him and a few other prominent photographers by Polaroid to help publicize its product, the SX-70 gave Evans a new lease on life.
It spit out palm-size glossy images in saturated colors. It was for casual snapshot portraits. Evans had trouble wielding bigger cameras by then. Now he could work again, and no doubt he relished working with a tool as mundane and populist as the SX-70. It involved photography at its most basic level: point and shoot. He had always tried to show what was distinguished in what other people overlooked, and now he was making art, or at least trying to, with a tool that sophisticated photographers generally wouldn't take notice of.
He took 2,600 pictures with the new camera, lots of fish-eye close-ups of friends, and especially of young women he was trying to impress, but also tightly cropped abstract vignettes that reprise basic themes from the 1920's and 30's, now in the SX-70's garish colors, which he clearly embraced. The late street-sign pictures are derivative and unremarkable. But one Polaroid recalls his best work: a junked pink Ford in the weeds, the grill a toothy smile. Typical of Evans, the car is a ready-made American beauty.
We see basically what was already clear before this exhibition: that American documentary photography is synonymous with Evans. It is built on his belligerent independence (this was his most truly American trait), his elevation of the everyday, his open eye, his mordant concentration and deliberate organization, his slow, razor-sharp, deadpan gaze.
This was also something particularly American about him: his lean, laconic scrutiny of the world. His pictures are called elegies, but they're elegies devoid of nostalgia. They are difficult to like at first, they're so austere. Gradually one can be moved by them because their construction -- often head on, seemingly uncomplicated, sometimes as if the images are not really even composed -- comes across as plain, eternal truth. Evans photographed disappearing national icons, like old Model T's and gingerbread houses, but no matter what his subject was, his pictures always connoted the world out of time. Not just time stopped, which is the condition imposed by all photographs, but objects held in a kind of supreme suspension.
Disorder is suddenly made to seem like order, the timeworn and commonplace looks extraordinary, and everything briefly snaps into focus. Call it a natural state of grace, which gives inherent dignity to all the ephemeral subjects Evans shot.
You see his elegance of vision in his famous pictures of sharecroppers' and tenant farmers' cabins in Alabama for "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men." These may be even better than his portraits of the Burroughs and Tingle families. The portraits are ingrained in the American psyche basically because Evans, in a photographic style as spare as James Agee's writing was the opposite, denied us what we expected: he short-circuited pity for those people by cutting out the charm and anecdote. We stare level-eyed, and as if without any distance from his subjects, who gaze -- squint really -- at us as if demanding to know who are we to look at them. Lionel Trilling, observing the portrait of Allie Mae Burroughs, put it this way: she "simply refuses to be an object of your 'social consciousness,' " he wrote. "She refuses to be an object at all."
Still, the cabin interiors may be closer to the core of Evans's achievement, because in essence he was always a still-life photographer, even when he was photographing street scenes or people. Still life implies an art of inanimate objects, of objects made into archetypes. Evans constantly implied that the things and people in his pictures had symbolic roles. They never seemed to exist in the here and now, just through Evans's lens.
So the few spare objects that the Burroughs family possessed -- table, towel, jug, bowl, kerosene lamp -- as in a Vermeer, are each given a separate weight, purity and value. Together they nonetheless look isolated and self-contained. No doubt this quality was an expression of Evans's own feeling of separateness.
His history is familiar: born in St. Louis to an advertising executive and a housewife; boarding school in the East; rebellious adolescence; Williams College briefly; literary aspirations; Paris in the mid-1920's, too shy to meet Joyce; makes photographs in the 20's in an abstract, Cubist-inspired mode; documents the South in the 30's for the Resettlement Administration of the Department of Agriculture, then with Agee; "American Photographs" show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1938 establishes his early fame.
It can be useful to read Evans, not just see his pictures. As a writer he was lean and fastidious. The second edition of "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men" has just been republished with his brief memoir of Agee. Evans managed in prose something of what he achieved in his pictures: concision, clarity, no pretense, dry wit. Critics and historians, starting with Lincoln Kirstein in the essay he wrote 62 years ago for "American Photographs," have stressed Evans's literary connections for good reason.
Hemingway's writing showed him the virtues of economy. Cummings showed him how to make fun of stuffy social conventions and vapid consumerism. Eliot showed how to express emotion in a chilly, oblique style, which came naturally to Evans.
The result was a modern visual grammar of forms that, in picture after picture, resists easy absorption. They take time to sink in. The more we look at an Evans photograph, the more his language elaborates itself through essential details: the sliver of light through the shutters of the plantation house in Louisiana; the lovers at Coney Island whose forms echo the column and tower behind them; the light reflected above the man in the subway, who is absorbed in thought, his face in shadow; the menu of the sandwich shop that we read over the shoulder of the cook and his pal; the three men outside the barber shop in Vicksburg, Miss., serendipitously posed.
It is curious that such a prickly man could have made such moving, ultimately optimistic pictures. But maybe that's why they're moving, because sentiment is checked by dispassion. The world is a beautiful place, Evans keeps telling us -- often despite itself.
In one of his best-known photographs, of rain-slicked Main Street in Saratoga Springs, the street's slow arc is picked out, as if in black outlines, by parallel rows of identical parked cars. The geometry of the scene is neatly complicated by a scrim of Dutch elms in silhouette. America is freshly born. Everything is complete. Nothing is hackneyed or maudlin, just straight. Typical Evans.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 8.
 
Now Playing
 
 * "ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER," starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around "A Streetcar Named Desire" and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as "screwball drama." Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin). 

"EYE OF THE BEHOLDER," starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). Mr. McGregor is a British surveillance expert and Ms. Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this ludicrous psycho-thriller. As Mr. McGregor's character, known only as the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of "Vertigo." But the film, by the director best known for "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," is so garish, disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music video posing as a movie (Stephen Holden).
"FANTASIA/2000," with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Mr. Levine, Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful "Sorcerer's Apprentice," starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown, "Fantasia/2000" is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are "Rhapsody in Blue," a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater, Broadway at 68th Street, (Holden).
"GIRL, INTERRUPTED," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen, a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend (Holden).
"THE GREEN MILE," starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of "The Shawshank Redemption" could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
"HOLY SMOKE," starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a young hippie mother in "Hideous Kinky," Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother coaxes her home, where a "cult exiter" named P. J. (Mr. Keitel) is waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Mr. Keitel's P. J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
* "THE HURRICANE," starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a movie redeemed by Mr. Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring (Holden).
"ISN'T SHE GREAT," starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David Hyde Pierce and John Cleese. Directed by Andrew Bergman (R, 90 minutes). In this bio-pic, Ms. Midler portrays the author Jacqueline Susann, who took the lurid pulp genre to a new, sweaty level. No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva than Ms. Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic self-absorption than anyone else. And Mr. Lane, who plays Irving Mansfield, Susann's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark plug: his voice shows up before he does. Yet in this adaptation of the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly hostility seems to be a facet of the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's talent. But Mr. Rudnick and Mr. Bergman have so defanged "Isn't She Great" that it's like watching a sketch from the old "Carol Burnett Show" that has mildewed (Elvis Mitchell).
"THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG," directed by Aviva Kempner (not rated, 90 minutes). This unabashed valentine to baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930's and 40's and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The 30's and 40's were the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's home run record and become the first man to win most valuable player awards at two positions, first base and left field. In blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome Greenberg became a target of anti-Semites. But his stardom, his innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).
"MAGNOLIA," starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180 minutes). In "Magnolia" the colossally talented Mr. Anderson has set up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories, with many of the cast members from his "Boogie Nights" assembled to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting, obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
"PLAY IT TO THE BONE," starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124 minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Mr. Harrelson (with a shaved head) and Mr. Banderas as fading middleweight boxers and best friends summoned at the last minute to fight each other as the opening act for a Las Vegas heavyweight bout. The formulaic road movie follows them with their pal and mutual ex-girlfriend (Ms. Davidovich) on their wisecracking way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where they fight a brutal match. The dialogue has sass, and the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the professional boxing world is very knowing, but the relationships don't track (Holden).
* "THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY," starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of "The English Patient" was no fluke, Mr. Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia High smith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Mr. Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious playboy-snob, Mr. Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
* "TITUS," starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R, 160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who created transfixing stage pictures in "The Lion King" and "Juan Darien," has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, "Titus Andronicus," into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge enacted throughout history. Mr. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms. Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back. Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden).
 * "TOPSY-TURVY," starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Mr. Leigh's grandly entertaining "Topsy-Turvy" is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as "Shakespeare in Love" did last year. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"FREDERICK WISEMAN: AMERICAN FILMMAKER." The police officer's lot and juvenile justice are in the light of the projector this weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, where the Film Society of Lincoln Center, in association with Human Rights Watch International, is offering a complete retrospective of the nonfiction works of Frederick Wiseman. At 1 and 5:30 p.m. today and again at 6:45 p.m. tomorrow, the attraction will be "Law and Order" (1969). This 81-minute documentary surveys the wide range of work the police are asked to perform and its affect on their behavior. A panel discussion on "Law and Order" is to take place at 7:30 p.m. today. At 2:45 and 9 p.m. today and at 4 and 8:30 p.m. tomorrow, the attraction will be "Juvenile Court" (1973). This 144-minute documentary shows the complex variety of cases before the Memphis Juvenile Court, illustrating conflicting issues, the range and limits of choices available to the court, the psychology of offenders and the constitutional and procedural questions involved in administration. The series continues through Feb. 24 at the Walter Reade Theater, at Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members and children; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information and screening times: (212) 875-5600 (Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.
 
Opera
 
"LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN," Metropolitan Opera. One of the Met's more satisfying productions meets the splendid Bryn Terfel, who will take on the Offenbach opera's four deep roles single-handedly. Also with Ruth Ann Swenson and Neil Shicoff. James Levine conducts. Metropolitan Opera House. Tonight at 8. Tickets, $26 to $225. Sold out but returns may be available. (212) 362-6000. (Bernard Holland). 

"LA TRAVIATA," Metropolitan Opera. The tasteless, cluttered, grossly overdone Franco Zeffirelli production of Verdi's "Traviata," which was drubbed by critics when it was introduced last season, is back, unabashed and unchanged, complete with the dancing cows in the Act III party scene. But the young soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas, who sings Violetta, is worth checking out. Though last month when the production opened she was suffering from a sinus problem, Ms. Gallardo-Domas still brought a vibrant voice, sensitivity and passion to the role. The tenor Roberto Aronica was a rather unsubtle Alfredo. And, good news, the baritone Thomas Hampson takes over the role of Germont for three performances starting Saturday afternoon. Metropolitan Opera House, Tomorrow at 1 p.m. Sold out, but returns may be available. (212) 362-6000 (Anthony Tommasini).
 
Classical Music
 
THE AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. The performances can be uneven, but the American Symphony Orchestra and its conductor Leon Botstein keep drawing us back with interesting programs. This one, "Polishing the Jewel: The Genius of George Enescu," deals with work of the composer-violinist-teacher and includes four symphonic items. A known but not too often heard 20th-century figure gets a close hearing. Avery Fisher Hall, tonight at 8. Tickets $18 to $45. (212) 875-5030. (Holland).
ARTEMIS QUARTET. This young group, formed in 1989 in Lubeck, Germany, is making its New York debut and thus not yet familiar. But a recording on the Primavera label speaks well for an adventurousness in its programming, with works by Wolf, Zemlinsky, Webern and Berg, as well as for the vitality of its performances. The programming here, slightly more standard, sandwiches Ligeti's Second Quartet between Beethoven (the last quartet, Op. 135, in F) and Mozart (the D minor, K. 421). Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $31. Sold out but returns may be available (James R. Oestreich).
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER. "Musical Evolutions II: Crisis and Creativity (1922-1945)" is the title of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's interesting six-concert series that concludes tonight. Offering six concerts and four lectures, the series examined music composed during that historic period of catastrophic economic collapse, political turmoil, fascism, war and genocide. Paradoxically, these were years of intense creativity and radical innovation in the arts, especially music. The Orion String Quartet will be the guest artists, offering Barber's famous String Quartet No. 1, Copland's "Vitebsk, Study on a Jewish Theme" for piano trio, Antheil's raucously exuberant Violin Sonata No. 2, and selected American songs with the tenor Jerry Hadley. Alice Tully Hall, Tonight at 8. Remaining tickets are $35 and $25. Call: (212) 875-5788, or CenterCharge, (212) 721-6500 (Tommasini).
BARGEMUSIC. The concerts offered on this converted coffee barge on the East River are favorites of connoisseurs for both musical reasons (the programs typically combine familiar works and intriguing novelties) and extramusical ones (the view of lower Manhattan across the river is stunning, and the intimacy of the setting is perfect for chamber music). This week's programs are drawn from the heart of the standard repertory. The centerpiece of the program tonight and tomorrow evening is Schumann's "Dichterliebe," to be sung by the baritone William Sharp, with Gilbert Kalish at the piano. Also included are a group of Spohr songs, to which a violinist (Carmit Zori) is added to the ensemble; and David Leisner, an eloquent guitarist, will perform Bach's Prelude, Fugue and Allegro and -- with Toby Appel, violist, and Julia Lichten, cellist -- Paganini's Terzetto Concertante. For the Sunday concert, Mr. Kalish and Ms. Zori are to perform a Mozart Sonata (K. 378), and will be joined by the cellist Ronald Thomas for the Schumann and Smetana Piano Trios. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083 or (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23, $20 for the elderly, $15 for students (Allan Kozinn).
EMERSON STRING QUARTET. The eminent American ensemble begins its five-part survey of the Shostakovich String Quartets. Seldom has so much human misery been rendered with such beauty and eloquence in these pieces. An excellent opportunity to hear great repertory in good hands. Alice Tully Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets $38. Call (212) 875-5050. (Holland).
STEVEN LUBIN. This pianist has provided some fine, provocative performances of both Classical repertory played on the fortepiano and Romantic literature performed on a concert grand. He is using the modern instrument for his recital on Sunday, which includes Bach's Italian Concerto, Beethoven's Sonata in F (Op. 54) and Schubert's Sonata in B flat. Sunday at 2 p.m., Armor Hall, Wave Hill, 675 West 252nd Street, Riverdale, the Bronx. (718) 549-3200, extension 229. Tickets are $15, $12 for the elderly, $10 for members and students (Kozinn).
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. When Yuri Temirkanov, busy in Baltimore and elsewhere, agreed to give up a week at the Philharmonic to make room for Riccardo Muti, who scored such a success with the orchestra last season, speculation that Mr. Muti was the prime candidate to become the next music director grew hotter. Now that Deborah Borda, then the orchestra's executive director, has decamped for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, all bets seem to be off. So there is little to do but enjoy a program of vintage Muti: Rossini's "Viaggio a Reims" Overture, the divertimento from Stravinsky's "Fairy's Kiss" and Strauss's "Aus Italien." Today at 2 p.m. and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: today, $16 to $64; tomorrow, $18 to $77 (Oestreich).
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. The orchestra's excellent conductor Mischa Santora leads them in a concert framed by American classics: Barber's Adagio and Dvorak's "Sorrowful Songs" Symphony and Symphony No. 9. As usual, the young musicians are appropriately given the opportunity to play a piece by a composer of their own generation, in this case John Mackey, whose Percussion Concerto will feature Samuel Z. Solomon. Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $7 to $40 (Paul Griffiths).
POMERIUM. Alexander Blachly and this most venerable of New York's early-music vocal ensembles consistently present programs that offer both beautiful singing and scholarly enlightenment. This time Mr. Blachly and company are examining works composed for the chapel of Charles V, the Duke of Burgundy, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor in honor of the 500th anniversary of his birth. The composers on the program include Josquin, Lassus, Crecquillon Morales and Gombert. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Manhattan, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $20, $15 for students and the elderly (Kozinn).
"RE-ENCOUNTERING RACHMANINOFF." The New Jersey Symphony's three-week festival, with a variety of events behind it, sticks to orchestral concerts for its final weekend. Tzimon Barto plays the Second Piano Concerto, whose popularity has far outlasted that of the song based on it, "Full Moon and Empty Arms." Zdenek Macal, the orchestra's music director, also conducts the less familiar First Symphony. To judge from the performance Mr. Macal elicited in the Second Symphony during the opening weekend, the results could be memorable. Tonight at 8, War Memorial, West Lafayette and Barracks Streets, Trenton; tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476. Tickets: $15 to $58 (Oestreich).
ROYAL PHILHARMONIC. One might have hoped that this London orchestra and its young music director, Daniele Gatti, would have visited New York with something more adventurous than a program devoted to the Brahms "Haydn" Variations, the Beethoven Fifth Symphony and a Mozart concerto, but, of course, an orchestra's touring selections tell audiences a great deal about the state of its collective imagination. The one real draw here is the superb pianist Ignat Solzhenitsyn, who is to be the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall. There is a pre-concert lecture at 2 p.m. at the Kaplan Penthouse in the Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street. (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $47 (Kozinn).
ANDRAS SCHIFF. For one listener, the most enduring memory of the last Bach year, 1985, was this pianist's performance of the six keyboard partitas. Mr. Schiff seemed as much creator as recreator, conjuring not only a distinct mood but also a distinct world of sound for each work. Now, on his way to the partitas next weekend and having already polished off the six English Suites in another Bach year, Mr. Schiff plays the six French Suites. Tickets may have to be begged, borrowed or stolen. (For those who relish a daylong immersion in Bach -- a worthy project for any day -- Lincoln Center offers a symposium, "The World and Music of Johann Sebastian Bach," from 10 to 5, and a prerecital lecture by one of the world's foremost Bach authorities, Christoph Wolff, at 7, in the Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor.) Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38 (Oestreich).
 SPECULUM MUSICAE. This one will be exciting. Some of the city's finest musicians get together to present works by Edgard Varese, who spent most of his adult life here, creating music of beautiful intensity. The program ranges from pieces he wrote in the 1920's for forceful ensembles of wind and percussion to "Deserts," his late masterpiece for orchestra and electronic sounds. Sunday at 5 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway and 116th Street, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $15 (Griffiths).
FREDERICA VON STADE, MATTHEW POLENZANI AND CRAIG RUTERNBERG. The George London Foundation offers an interesting recital series at the Morgan Library that pairs established artists of international renown with younger artists who are recent winners of grants from the foundation. On Sunday the renowned mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade will perform with the young tenor Matthew Polenzani, with Craig Rutenberg at the piano. During a pre-concert talk the great mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias will recall her work with London, who died in 1985. Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street; Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets $40, $30 for members. Sold out, but returns my be available. Ticket information: (212) 685-0008 ext. 347 (Tommasini).

Dance
 
COLORADO BALLET. A company known for its polished dancing and rich repertory offers three contrasting works: Sir Frederick Ashton's "Facade," a satirical ballet of 1931 that is considered one of the 20th century's great choreographic comedies; Stanton Welch's "Of Blessed Memory," a tribute to a mother and her children, and Peter Pucci's "Picture of Sedalia," a look at a turn-of-the-century community. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, Tickets: $30 (Jack Anderson).
FLAMENCO: ANDREA DEL CONTE DANZA ESPANA. Back by popular demand, the Andrea del Conte Danza Espana troupe will present a new program of flamenco dance and song. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 4 p.m. and Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 4 p.m. through March 5. Tickets: $20; $18 for students and the elderly; some $5 tickets available for students through the High 5 Tickets program. Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens; (718) 729-3880 (Jennifer Dunning).
FLAMENCO EXTRAVAGANZA. The cast may change from performance to performance, depending on which guest artists turn up at this intimate club to sing, dance or play flamenco guitar. But the star of the evening is Carmen La Sala, featured with Paco Ortiz, Juan Amaya, Sandra Rivera and Natalia Brillante. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. "Sheherazade's Tales," an evening of belly-dancing, may be seen on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. and there is a variety show on Wednesday nights, also at 8:30. Tickets: $20 for the flamenco progarm and $10 each for "Sheherazade's Tales" and the variety show. El Patio del East Side, 211 60th Street, Manhattan; (212) 838-9090 (Dunning)
 FRESHLY SQUEEZED (DANCES NOT FROM CONCENTRATE). If this "tangy medley" of dances by Suzanne Blezard, Sarah Carlson and Clare Byrne is as charmingly imaginative as the program title, the three emergent choreographers will be far ahead of the game. The dances are set to music that ranges from Mel Torme to David Bowie, with a few advertising jingles and some new music by John Presnell thrown in for good measure. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets are $12. Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village; (718) 857-4588 (Dunning).
 GYPSY AND FOLK DANCE FESTIVAL. The Csurdongolo Dancers and Eletfa Folk Band will perform warrior, wedding and village dances from Hungary, Transylvania and Romania. Tonight at 8. Tickets are $30 and $35. Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 840-2824 (Dunning).
"ISADORA AND THE JEWISH INTELLIGENTSIA" Part of the 92nd Street Y's Sundays@Three: Jewish Voices Series, "Isadora and the Jewish Intelligentsia" examines Duncan's life and times through slides of Duncan and the art that inspired her, video interviews with the Duncan authority Julia Levien and Anne Wilson Wangh, founder of the Dance Library of Israel, and live performing by the Dance Vision company, directed by Isadoraites Beth Jucovy and Adrienne Ramm. Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets are $10. 92nd Street Y, Harkness Dance Center, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street; (212) 415-5553 (Dunning).
"LEONARD AND MINKY" John Selya's choreography, created for companies that include American Ballet Theater and the Houston Ballet, stands out for its thoughtful and loving adherence to the classical canon and for its humor and originality. This time around, Mr. Selya is taking on a pair of cats named Leonard and Minky and their bittersweet love for each other in a fable designed for the whole family. The score is by Joel Diamond, a Grammy-nominated chamber and film music composer. Edward I. Koch, former mayer of New York City, will narrate the ballet on tape. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. and next Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 924-0077 (Dunning).
NEW YORK CITY BALLET. The New York City Ballet celebrates American composers on Sunday with ballets set to music by Philip Glass, Charles Ives, Louis-Moreau Gottschalk and the great perennial Anonymous, whose efforts have been orchestrated by Hershy Kay.

Tonight at 8; Sat. at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sun. at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $72. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 870-5570 (Dunning).

Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue and 10th Street, East Village; (212) 674-8194 (Dunning).

Another one of those mysterious touring Russian ballet companies, the St. Petersburg Ballet Theater, directed by Konstantin Tatchkine, will perform "The Dying Swan," the third act of "The Sleeping Beauty," dances from "The Fairy Doll," "Giselle," "Paquita" and "Le Corsaire" and Peggy Willis-Aarnio's "Diamond Ballet." Tonight at 8. Tickets are $15; $10 for students and the elderly. Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, south of City Hall, Lower Manhattan; (212) 346-1715 (Dunning).

KEVIN WYNN COLLECTION. Kevin Wynn's dancers move with high-voltage energy and his choreography is often complex and unpredictable. His program features works from the repertory and two new pieces, "Corpuscle Madness" and "Territorial Boogie." Tonight at 9; tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street (11th floor), Greenwich Village, (212) 625-8369. Tickets: $15 (Anderson).

HEADLINE: The Fed's Bad Strategy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re your Feb. 3 editorial about the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate increase: The United States is facing a labor shortage over the next 20 years. Between now and 2020, when the number of people of traditional working age (20 to 64) will increase by 15 percent, the over-65-year-old group will increase 100 percent. The country will need a rapidly growing economy to support this dependent population. 
 Slowing growth is the wrong strategy. The right strategy is to continue the increase in worker productivity, expand immigration of productive workers and, most important, remove the disincentives for workers to stay on the job after age 65.
Future American prosperity will be determined largely by how early or late workers retire. Raising interest rates in response to labor demand is the wrong strategy for the demographic challenges we face in the new century.

HEADLINE: A Parent's Dream, Circa 2000: Be the NextDenise Savoie

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THERE was a time when children were told they could hope to be president, but for many Americans the envied footsteps are no longer those of Al Gore or George W. Bush. Now people dream of being like P. Kingston Duffie, Richard N. Tinsley or M. Denise Savoie.
Never heard of them? Two years ago they invested almost $8,500 as they founded Turnstone Systems to design products that help local phone companies provide DSL lines, which allow rapid Internet communications. The company looks as if it may succeed, having so far sold $27 million in products. Last year, it almost broke even. 
 This week Turnstone went public, selling stock to the public at $29 a share, compared with the one-tenth of a cent a share that the founders paid. Investors fell all over themselves to buy the stock, and yesterday Turnstone closed at $132. The shares bought by the three founders, who range in age from 35 to 44, now are worth $1.1 billion. The company, in which about $100 million has been invested -- including the $87 million put up by public investors this week -- has a market capitalization of $4.3 billion.
What makes the Turnstone story so impressive is that it is not all that extraordinary. Seven American companies have gone public this week. Besides Turnstone, they are SkilSoft, a provider of corporate training courses; Sequenom, a biotechnology company; Quantum Effect Devices, a semiconductor company; Telaxis Communications, a wireless equipment company; Centra Software, an Internet company; and Alamosa PCS, a cell phone company.
The seven sport a total market capitalization of $13.4 billion, equal to 16 times the amount of money that equity investors put into them and more than 170 times the $78 million in combined annual revenues.
Those figures reflect the wealth effect in action. The Federal Reserve, which has now raised the federal funds rate four times since last summer, is expected to raise it two or three more times before this year is out. That has put a damper on some old stocks, but it has not damaged the market for companies like these.
An initial public offering that immediately doubled in price used to be an amazing phenomenon. Now it is almost taken for granted that new offerings will soar. Of the seven, all but SkilSoft traded at twice the offering price or better the first day, although Alamosa faded to close with a gain of just 66 percent. But none got much attention.
Those doubles benefit the lucky people who got in on the public offering. Those who got in earlier do much better. All told, insiders -- including founders, employees and the venture capitalists who financed these seven companies -- have put $257 million into their equity investments. Their stakes are now worth $11.4 billion.
That wealth is created not by the success of the companies -- none are now profitable -- but by the enthusiasm and hope of investors. It is a virtuous circle, in which optimistic investors produce higher share prices that justify the optimism and draw in more investors.
All this is possible because many companies have a shot at being winners in an era in which technology is changing the economic landscape. But while some companies may prove to be great successes, there is no way that the economy will produce enough profits to justify all the optimism now being shown. Someday, when enough companies have fallen by the wayside, investors will grow hostile, and even promising ventures will find it hard to raise capital. There are no signs that day is near.

HEADLINE: Senate Ratifies Nomination Of Greenspan to4th Term

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Alan Greenspan's nomination to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve today after members of both parties lauded his performance over the last dozen years in nurturing the economy's long expansion.
The vote was 89 to 4. 
 The action gave Mr. Greenspan, who is 73, another four-year term as head of the central bank, a post that makes him one of the most powerful policy makers in an increasingly interconnected global economy. It came a day after Mr. Greenspan raised interest rates by a quarter of a point to slow the fast-growing economy in an effort to head off the possibility of inflation.
President Clinton, whose administration has had a close working relationship with Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, said he was pleased by the Senate's action, especially in light of the Fed chairman's role in allowing the current expansion to become the longest on record this month.
"Chairman Greenspan's wise and steady leadership has inspired confidence here in America and around the world," Mr. Clinton said in a statement. "He has made a truly remarkable contribution in helping lead our nation to the longest economic expansion in history."
Mr. Greenspan was first appointed to the Fed by President Reagan in 1987. He was subsequently reappointed by President Bush, and now twice by Mr. Clinton.
Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said Mr. Greenspan was the only person who could have won such broad bipartisan support.
"And why have three successive administrations appointed Alan Greenspan to be chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve system?" Mr. Gramm asked during Senate debate on the nomination on Wednesday. "Because he is the best central banker we have ever had."
The four votes against Mr. Greenspan came from liberal Democrats who said he was too focused on fighting an inflation threat that was more theoretical than real, and doing so behind a cloak of excessive secrecy at the Fed. They were Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Harry Reid of Nevada and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
During the debate, Mr. Harkin said that in focusing singlemindedly on the "specter of inflation," the Fed was paying too little attention to its legislated mandate of encouraging full employment.
"Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board seemed to think they needed to make a pre-emptive strike on inflation before we see clear signs of inflation out there," Mr. Harkin said. "This view, if aggressively acted upon, would place an absolute cap on our economy's ability to grow. It would destroy much of our potential for growth. That is a tragedy."
The Fed has raised rates four times in quarter-point increments since June, pushing its federal funds target rate to 5.75 percent.
The Fed released today the minutes of its policy-setting meeting on Dec. 21, when it voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady. The minutes showed that Fed officials were concerned about continuing signs of incipient inflationary pressures in December, but that they were primarily focused on guiding the economy smoothly through the Year 2000 computer problems.
The officials said at the meeting that the three rate increases they had approved over the previous six months had had relatively little effect up until that point in slowing the economy. But they agreed that it would be prudent to delay any action on rates, in part because waiting would give the central bank further time "to assess the delayed effects of its earlier tightening actions."
The Fed concluded this week that its prior rate increases had not been enough. In explaining its decision on Wednesday to raise rates again, the Fed said the risks to the economy "are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
2000 Begins With Plenty Of Momentum

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
A surge in factory orders in December gave manufacturers their best year since 1995. That, plus big sales gains at retailers and a surprise dip in unemployment applications all show the economy is starting 2000 with plenty of momentum.
Strong demand for airplanes and electronic equipment helped to push orders to factories up 3.3 percent in December and contributed to making 1999 the strongest year manufacturers had experienced in four years, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Consumers, meanwhile, continued their yearlong buying binge in January, giving major retail chains better-than-expected sales, retailers said in another report.
And, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week fell 5,000, to 274,000, the Labor Department said, indicating that the economy is still growing and that employers are having trouble finding workers.
The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point in an effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace so as to not set in motion inflation.
In the last three months of 1999, the economy grew at a 5.8 percent annual rate. It grew 4 percent for the whole year, and economists said the momentum had carried over into the new year.
December's bigger-than-expected 3.3 percent rise in factory orders was the largest monthly increase in seven years. It was led by a 20 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment, including airplanes and cars. A 6 percent increase in orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the category that includes household appliances and communications equipment, also contributed to the rise.
Many economists expect the unemployment rate -- now at 4.1 percent -- will fall to 4 percent when the January employment report is released Friday.
The less volatile four-week moving average for unemployment-benefits claims fell last week to 282,000. Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication that employers are having difficulty finding workers to fill job openings.

HEADLINE: For Many, Abortion Is Lost in the Crowd of Issues

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
Solidly in the Republican camp, Tom Miller rattled off the issues most important to him: taxes, the economy, health care.
Abortion was nowhere near the top of the list. 
 "Oh, I just put that one aside," said Mr. Miller, a 36-year-old engineer, waving a hand in the air, as if to dismiss a troublesome topic. "The politicians talk a lot about abortion, but it's not something that's going to decide my vote."
For all the passionate debate over abortion among presidential candidates, interviews with more than 50 voters in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin found that it was the rare voter who saw the issue as pivotal.
Questions about abortion evoked a welter of complicated feelings that left many people uneasy about even discussing it, preferring instead to focus on tax policy, or the trustworthiness of candidates.
Taylor Manning, a 46-year-old corporate manager in Naperville, Ill., who is the bishop of his Mormon ward, said that while he held "strong personal views about abortion," he preferred that the issue remain outside the political debate. It was a position he said was common among his Republican acquaintances.
"I run with a pretty conservative group of people," Mr. Manning said, "and I don't think they're basing their votes on abortion."
To be sure, a core of deeply committed voters see abortion as the overriding issue in American politics. Patricia Gantz, 59, who lives in Dewitt, Mich., said she wanted to see abortion "outlawed in all cases," and could not fathom casting a ballot for a candidate who supported a woman's right to choose abortion.
But a far greater number of voters, including those on both sides of the abortion debate, said it was just one of many issues to be considered. Moreover, voters expressed a skepticism about the hard-line statements against abortion by some candidates, particularly Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, saying they could be merely an effort to win ardently conservative voters in the Republican primaries.
Finally, a big share of voters said they did not believe it was likely that any president could overturn laws that protect abortion rights.
For that reason, Heinke Hoenck, a retired secretary in Janesville, Wis., said she could vote for Mr. Bush in the fall, even though she disagreed with his opposition to the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court in 1973 that gave constitutional protection to abortion rights.
"When it came right down to it, there would be an uproar in this country" if abortion were made illegal, Ms. Hoenck said. "It would be very hard for a president to change the law."
Tony Harvey, a 38-year-old engineer in Chicago, expressed a similar view, saying that government would ultimately find it impossible to stop abortion.
"I'm very religious, and I do not believe in abortion," Mr. Harvey said. "But to me, all this talk about abortion is beside the point. If people want to have abortions, they're going to have them."
President Ronald Reagan consistently sided with forces opposed to legal abortion, Mr. Harvey noted, but failed in two terms to make it illegal.
That sentiment was also voiced by strong opponents of abortion, like Herb Dowman, a 37-year-old environmental engineer in Dewitt, Mich. "I'm going to vote for an anti-abortion candidate," he said, "but I don't expect anything to change."
Marilyn Smith, a 41-year-old secretary for an insurance company in Fort Atkinson, Wis., said that while she opposed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion, she favored keeping abortions legal in the early term.
Nonetheless, when she talked about the issues that would determine her vote, Ms. Smith mentioned taxes and help for farmers, among other things. Abortion was simply "not that high on the list," she said.
"I want to look at the total package," Ms. Smith said. "One issue is not going to decide my vote. There are too many important things to think about."
Liz Schweitzer, an administrator at St. John's Student Parish in East Lansing, a center for Roman Catholic college students, said abortion did not dominate the political discussion, even among people who tried to adhere to church teachings on government issues.
"Abortion gets a lot of press, but it is just one of the church teachings on life and social justice issues," Ms. Schweitzer said, noting that Catholic leaders, while opposing abortion, also espoused many positions that seemed at odds with Republican politicians, like greater help for immigrants and the poor.
Michigan, which holds a primary on Feb. 22, has demonstrated a penchant for surprise. The state's Democratic voters, for example, have in the past supported George C. Wallace and the Rev. Jesse Jackson in primaries.
The willingness of many voters to support candidates regardless of their views on abortion concerns Marie Jones, a 32-year-old research scientist at Michigan State University.
"It worries me that maybe they could make it illegal," Ms. Jones said, noting that many states had enacted restrictions on abortion, like 24-hour waiting periods and requirements for parental notification.
The same concern was voiced by Laurie Stephens, a 26-year-old factory worker.
"If they say they're going to outlaw abortion, maybe we ought to take it seriously," Ms. Stephens said as she walked down a department-store aisle with her 4-year-old daughter, Kristin. "What if it goes through, and we're back to illegal abortions?"

HEADLINE: And Let the Lawyers Sing: 'Glory to the Salary King'

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The frenzy over law firm salaries reached new heights yesterday and spread for the first time to a law firm based in neither New York nor Silicon Valley.
The nation's largest law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, sent memos to associates yesterday telling them they would receive raises of about 40 percent. First-year associates will now make $140,000 a year in base salary, about $15,000 more than they will at other firms that announced large raises in the last two weeks. 
 The big increases are the latest sign of the widespread effect that the Internet is having on highly skilled workers in a range of professions. Silicon Valley law firms started the bidding war over the last month and a half to keep their younger lawyers from defecting to dot-com start-ups, and other firms have reacted to keep pace with the salaries of the California firms, many of which have offices on the East Coast.
Thousands of young lawyers, already among the highest paid workers in the country, are getting raises that usually go only to people who receive promotions or who switch jobs. And almost overnight, the nation's largest law firms have added as much as $50 million to their individual payrolls.
"It is a lot of money," said Benjamin F. Stapleton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, which announced raises on Wednesday. The moves by Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell virtually ensure that every other top firm in New York will offer similarly large pay increases in the coming weeks, lawyers said. Davis Polk & Wardwell, which told its associates last week that their salaries would jump by about 25 percent, was the first New York firm to act.
Skadden's decision will also put pressure on its rivals to hand out large end-of-year bonuses to bring associates' total pay packages to about the same level as those at Skadden. Because Skadden will pay relatively small bonuses, its partners do not consider the raise to be an attempt to top the other firms' salaries, said Robert C. Sheehan, the firm's executive partner.
Boston-based Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault told its associates yesterday that they, too, would receive raises of as much as 40 percent. Recent law school graduates will now earn $140,000 in a city with real estate costs that are well below those in New York or San Francisco. Sixth-year associates at Testa will make $205,000 this year. Lawyers in Boston typically work many fewer hours than those in New York.
Testa will not offer bonuses of any kind, said Timothy C. Maguire, a partner. All 330 of Testa's lawyers work in Boston, and Mr. Maguire said he expected Testa's rivals, like Hale & Dorr and Ropes & Gray, to offer similar raises soon.
The new salaries indicate just how much law firms have profited from the long economic expansion, the current wave of mergers and initial public offerings, and the growth in litigation over the last decade. In addition to announcing the raises, Testa's memo to associates said it hoped they would curtail the long hours they have recently logged and improve their quality of life.
If that happens, Mr. Maguire said, the firm would have an easier time hiring more talented lawyers and bringing in more clients. "We're turning away an awful lot of work," he added.
The East Coast firms have avoided the strategy of most Silicon Valley firms, which have tied bonuses -- as much as $30,000 for first-year associates -- to the number of hours that a lawyer bills.
The latest round of raises brought glee to associates around the country, many of whom keep each other apprised of the announcements through e-mail and postings on a Yahoo Web site called Greedy Associates. One participant posted a poem yesterday afternoon praising Skadden. Its last lines were: "Arps! The Skadden Angels sing! Glory to the Salary King . . ."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE SCENE -- CAMPAIGN SKETCHBOOK;
Long Day's Journey Into Morning Finds Gore Long on Talk

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Even with Michael S. Dukakis nodding off in the second row, Al Gore kept talking. One of the Secret Service agents standing at the edge of the crowd had his eyes closed, too, and the press corps was literally moaning for mercy -- so loudly, in fact, that many of the real people at the town hall meeting here at Los Angeles City College turned around to look.
But until nearly 1 o'clock this morning -- or 4 a.m. back in New York, where his day had begun -- the vice president stood close to his questioners, looked straight into their eyes and tried to close the sale, finally wrapping up after 3 hours 18 minutes (just a few minutes shy, aides said, of his personal record, 3:24). 
 He had warned them, though, telling the crowd of about 200 straight away that he would stay to answer all questions, until California's presidential primary on March 7 if necessary. Often his answers were so comprehensive that they seemed to begin with the creation of the earth -- the biblical version of which, he happened to mention, he does not believe should be taught in science class.
Though California is not considered a state where retail politics works particularly well, the audience here, mostly undecided Democrats, not only rewarded the candidate's endurance but stayed afterward and asked him to elaborate on a variety of answers.
Several people said later that they particularly appreciated his not always giving the answer that his questioner seemed to want. When a retired evangelist asked the vice president if he was a born-again Christian, he said yes, but went on to say that this did not mean he wanted to be associated with what he called the intolerance of Jerry Falwell. "I'm sorry to be long-winded," Mr. Gore said by way of finishing.
"I am, too," replied the man, who, having had a little fun at Mr. Gore's expense, added that "America needs to get back on its knees."
The vice president made clear that he did not agree with the questioner's support for prayer in schools, and he also defended the welfare overhaul to a man who said many people had been hurt by it.
He did not, however, correct a young man who said, "Many years ago you wrote books about the Internet." Instead, he joked about having stretched the truth on that topic some time back: "You notice he didn't say I invented the Internet; I didn't say that this evening either, did I?"
He may have made a teensy overstatement, though, when he told the crowd that "we had a huge event with 3,000 people at Ohio State University" earlier in the day. Officials at that rally said the room where it had taken place did not hold more than 1,200 people, and, given the area needed for the staging erected for the occasion, they estimated the crowd at 500.
In another answer, about how to keep youths from joining gangs, Mr. Gore said the whole idea that quality time spent with children could make up for a shortage of time with them "is a lie," but then added, "There is some truth to that lie."
In his 10-minute answer to the young man's question about the future of the Internet, Mr. Gore was nothing if not thorough. He began with a description of "stagflation" caused by the oil crisis of 1973. Eventually moving into the present, he said, "Now, instead of big price increases, we have a price decrease for processing information, low unemployment and low inflation because the price of processing information is cut in half every 18 months."
For good measure, he worked in a statement of support for universal preschool and for smaller class sizes before finally wrapping up that same answer about the Internet by admitting, "I've given you a mouthful there."
At times, Mr. Gore seemed to go out of his way to state the obvious. To a woman who told him that she was disabled and that she and her three children had previously been homeless, he said, "I'm glad you have a home."
The audience, though, seemed quite moved by his attentions.
A man who spoke passionately about his work with children, trying to keep them out of gangs, said he was holding down two jobs and volunteering a lot of his time to help others in his community.
"We need support," the man said. "Jesus Christ, we need more people up there helping, and when you become president -- and I hope you're not doubting yourself that you will become president -- hopefully you will remember what we said here at L.A.C.C."
After the marathon, Brian Price, a previously undecided screenwriter in the audience, said: "I saw two things I hadn't seen on television -- a plan and passion. I want somebody who can take on the anti-gun-control morons on the other side, and I saw somebody who looks like they have the pluck to fight."

Citing Currency Weakness, Europeans Raise Key Rate

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Declaring that the weakness of Europe's year-old single currency had created concern about price stability, the European Central Bank raised interest rates today for the second time in three months.
The rise in the benchmark refinancing rate, to 3.25 percent from 3 percent, came the day after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates in the United States and indicated that further rises might be necessary to keep America's strong economy from producing inflation. 
 Economists and investors had expected the European rate increase, though many said they did not see that happening before the spring. The timing led some economists to express fear that Europe's fledgling central bank would be seen as sailing in the wake of the Federal Reserve. But financial markets in Europe appeared, for the moment at least, to welcome the move.
The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, maintained that the timing of the move after the Federal Reserve action was coincidental.
Share prices reacted favorably, with the benchmark index of the Paris stock exchange closing up 3.41 percent and that in Frankfurt rising 2.54 percent. In Britain, which has not adopted the single currency, the euro, and sets rates independently, stocks gained one-third of a percent.
The euro rose as well, settling in New York late in the day at 98.85 cents, up from 97.57 cents on Wednesday.
Hints of today's increase in the interest rate the European Central Bank charges commercial banks for short-term loans had come on Monday, when Mr. Duisenberg suggested that continued weakness of the euro threatened to generate inflation. At a news conference at the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt today, he repeated that reasoning.
The euro's drop in value compared with the dollar, Mr. Duisenberg said, is a "cause of concern with regard to future price stability." As the euro weakens, the prices Europeans pay for goods they import from the United States or pay for in dollars, like oil, increase. So, the bank chief said, "import prices can be expected to rise further, thereby increasing the risk that upward pressure on consumer price inflation might materialize in the medium term."
An increase in interest rates tends to strengthen a currency by making deposits denominated in that currency more attractive. Even with the euro's improvement in trading today, it has been languishing below $1 for much of the last week.
At the end of January, the European currency was valued almost 12 percent below its average worth during the first quarter of 1999, and it has continued to erode since then.
The central bank, before increasing rates in November, to 3 percent from 2.5 percent, had been primarily concerned with stoking sluggish European economies, which have shown less vigor than the American economy through most of the 1990's.
But in raising rates today, the central bank put its emphasis clearly on avoiding inflation.
Though evidence of inflation in European countries is sketchy, Mr. Duisenberg said that the bank's principal yardstick for growth in the money supply, an inflation barometer, showed an annual increase of 6.1 percent in the last quarter of 1999 -- well above its 1999 target of 4.5 percent. He said long-term bond rates in Europe, another inflation signpost, showed evidence of continued strong increases, reaching the highest level at the end of January since 1997.
Though economic growth has been strong in France and Spain, and in several smaller European countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, it remains fitful in Germany and Italy, which with France form the core of the Continent's economy.
The central bank's move drew mixed reactions from economists. Many said that the rate increase was premature and that the evidence of inflationary danger cited by Mr. Duisenberg was overdrawn. Some accused the central bank of acting primarily to slow or reverse the euro's slide against the dollar and said the move seemed to be a reaction to the Fed's rate increase on Wednesday.
"With their timing, they threw into question their independence," said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Mr. Ramm said he saw little danger in the move for European growth prospects, since many economists had expected a rate increase within the next six to eight weeks. But he added, "It would be a real embarrassment if the euro fell further."

HEADLINE: Austrians Defend Austria, but Views on Haider Party Range Wide

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Feb. 3

 BODY:
O.K., tell the truth, a young reveler at Jorg Haider's birthday celebration on an Alpine ski slope was prodded recently -- isn't all your Freedom Party's talk about the economic threat posed by immigrants really just a cover story for not liking dark-skinned people?
"No," Martin Pohl answered, fixing his questioner with a straight, if slightly beery gaze. "We Austrians are not like that." 
 "It's not," he added firmly, "as bad here as in America. I have seen 'Mississippi Burning.' "
That, in its way, encapsulates the view of many Austrians in Mr. Haider's camp -- and many who dislike him -- about the threats from the European Union, Israel and the United States to isolate Austria diplomatically if Mr. Haider joins the government. Look to your own houses before dictating to us, they say. Some leaders, they suggest, have mounted the dung heaps of corruption scandals and neo-Nazi incidents in their own countries and suddenly shouted that they have the moral high ground.
To be sure, there are others who feel just the opposite.
"I, as an Austrian, I enjoy this," said Georg Hofmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for Profil magazine. "Why shouldn't the E.U. say we don't want an extremist in your government? It's not good manners to have racists in government. We don't do that."
Interviews in the Alps, where Mr. Haider comes from, and in the streets of liberal Vienna, where hostility to him is strongest, produce a range of musings -- not just about the diplomatic crisis, but also about Mr. Haider's unpredictable personality and Austria's complex self-image as the one-time seat of a vast empire later reduced to a Nazi state and now to an Alpine chalet on Western Europe's frontier.
Mr. Haider often says what some other Austrians feel but dare not say. Sometimes, it is complaints normal to a democracy: The government is full of tired old men who divide the spoils. The economy would be stronger if they dared privatize. Civil servants are lazy and rude.
In Carinthia, as a lawyer who inherited wealth, Mr. Haider is seen as above corruption, pro-business and a leader who made the civil servants smile on time.
Sometimes, what he says is unpleasant but true: Immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the small crime rate. Some cheat on the generous welfare system.
Sometimes it is wacky: immigrants use state-paid fertility treatment to out-breed Austrians.
And sometimes, it is over the line: The Waffen SS deserves the same respect as any military unit.
Mr. Haider's style has been called "defamation followed by halfhearted excuse," and he used it again last week, calling the Belgian government corrupt protectors of pedophiles and implying that France's president, Jacques Chirac, was a doddering failure. Senior politicians say such language cannot be used in international relations.
Alexander van der Bellen, leader of the Green Party, called him a "persistent offender."
Some Haider backers enjoy his forthrightness; some worry.
"He's a good man, but when he opens his mouth, it's a catastrophe," said Willy Klima, 53, a Vienna cabbie.
Manfred Spahn, 32, a casino floor manager, said: "I admit I did think of voting for Haider as a protest, because he exposed corruption. But I have an aunt who died recently at 93. She lived through two world wars, and she compared Haider to Hitler and said it might be possible to happen again, so she decided to vote for the reds, even though she'd voted black all her life. I listened to what she said."
In Austrian politics, the Social Democrats are known as the reds; black is the color of the conservative People's Party, which has signed an agreement on a coalition government with Mr. Haidar's party.
Michael Chik, 19, who was to join an evening anti-Haider demonstration, is part of the tiny Chinese minority, born here of parents who immigrated to open a restaurant. "I know some people in the Freedom Party, and they are quite racist," he said. "And it's the members who make the party."
He said he had been teased as a child. "They did this," he said, pushing his eyes up into slits. "But it's the Turkish people who get beaten up and face discrimination."
Others who are, by Austrian law, "foreigners," say they do not feel threatened.
"I'm not a supporter, not at all, but Haider's not against anyone like me who's been here 30 years and does his work properly," said Milan Lakobria, 50, an electrician originally from Yugoslavia. "He's against those who don't work."
Mr. Lakobria is still not a citizen, nor are most of his children born here. But they could be if they wanted, he said, "and anyway, it's better here than in my country."
Anna Krailler, 75, a retired cashier walking her small white dog through a middle-income Vienna shopping center, made no secret of her feelings. "Yes, I am for Haider," she said. "It's time that all those foreigners who steal cars were out."
"Over there," she said, pointing to a residential district, "there are blocks with only one or two Austrians. You get no peace, there are so many children running around. In summer, the foreigners take over the parks. And it's not only them. My generation helped rebuild Austria, and I don't get enough pension to live on. I think things will be better under Haider."
Asked about the diplomatic isolation, she said: "Well, the German criticism wasn't so bad. The worst was the Jews. They're afraid. I don't know why -- no Austrian would ever harm a Jew. And their ambassador should just go home. How are we supposed to react? Suddenly everyone's against us, but no one has the right to condemn Austria."
But Elisabeth Sickl, a minor official of Mr. Haider's party in Carinthia who is likely to be the social minister in the new government, denied that xenophobia and racism are characteristic of Haider supporters. "Humanism is my aim," she said. "I feel treated very unjustly. We are no Nazis."
A theme coming up repeatedly was fear of the "jetzt erst recht" backlash. The phrase is literally "now first right," but is translated as "now more than ever," meaning that if you push an Austrian, he will get his back up and do exactly what you wanted him not to do.
"We're afraid of new elections, because Haider will get more votes," said Susanne Fromwald, 31, a social worker who spent the night sleeping on a sidewalk in an all-night demonstration against the proposed government. "People here who don't like people from other countries telling us who to vote for will vote for Haider." She said she preferred European "concern" to isolation, but her companions liked the stronger course.
But Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi-hunter based in Vienna, opposes isolation, fearing that the tiny country's lifeline -- tourism and trade -- will shut down. He prefers new elections, even knowing that they could strengthen Mr. Haider.
"Nobody can say he's a Nazi," Mr. Wiesenthal said, "but when Jews call me and say, 'We're not against Haider because he never said something against the Jews,' I ask: 'Is that the best you can say about him?' "
But many Austrians, regardless of their political sympathies, said the European Union had gone too far by condemning Austria before Mr. Haider spent a day in office.
"If Haider is a problem -- O.K., I can cry," said Mr. Klima, the ebullient taxi driver. "But every man should have a chance."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Bonds' Rise Sends Traders Into Turmoil

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Chaos swept through the bond market yesterday as traders and investors tried to make sense of a spectacular and damaging rise in the prices of longer-term Treasury bonds. Rumors of significant losses sustained by banks, brokerage firms and hedge funds said to be on the wrong side of the Treasury market's move roiled the market, reminding many participants of the crisis created by the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund that gripped the market in September 1998.
Tripping over themselves to buy 30-year bonds, investors and traders drove the price of the bonds up an unusual 3 percent early in the morning. The yield on the bond fell from its Wednesday close of 6.28 percent to as low as 5.93 percent before settling at 6.13 percent at the end of the day. The yield on the 10-year note fell from 6.57 percent Wednesday to 6.44 percent yesterday. 
 Market participants were stunned by the action. "The government bond market is trading with an extraordinary amount of stress," said Tom Juterbock, head of government bond trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. "I can't recall a time when this market had this much stress. This is without historical precedent."
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a statement in the early afternoon denying a rumor that a special emergency meeting had been called by the Fed to assess the damage caused by the move in the market. Such a meeting was convened when Long-Term Capital Management was teetering and resulted in a Fed-assisted bailout of the hedge fund.
But bond traders at banks and brokerage firms across Wall Street said yesterday that losses were surely large at many institutions this time around because of the nature of the bets that had been made by these firms in recent weeks. Once again, as was the case with Long-Term Capital Management, the majority of bond market participants are finding themselves all in the same troubling trades.
The root of the recent trouble is the Treasury's plan to reduce its issuance of long-term debt and to buy back a good deal of the debt that is outstanding. Worried about a shortage of Treasury debt to be traded, investors who need to own high-quality long-term government securities -- managers of pension funds and insurance company portfolios who offset their long-term obligations with assets of similar maturities -- surged into the market.
As these investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasuries, traders who had sold those securities short faced mounting losses. Because banks and brokerage firms typically offset the potential risk in their sizable holdings in mortgages or corporate bonds by selling government bonds they do not own, a process known as selling short, the move had punishing effects on firms' positions up and down Wall Street.
Worried about possible trading losses, investors pounded the shares of two Wall Street firms known for their bond trading operations. Goldman Sachs Group's stock fell 6.3 percent, to $85.375, one of its biggest one-day declines since the firm went public in May, while shares in Lehman Brothers Holdings dropped 2.5 percent, to $70.4375.
A spokesman for Lehman Brothers said, "We're not having any problems as a result of the Treasury market moves." A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Although the Treasury announced its buyback plan on Jan. 13, the reality of its effects was not fully recognized by bond traders until recently. As the meaning of the reduction in supply sank in among investors, the rush into the bond market began.
On Wednesday, the Treasury said that it would retire $17 billion of its debt in the first three months of this year. Most of the buybacks are to be focused on debt with maturities of 10 years or more. In addition, the Treasury said its most recent auction of securities would raise $32 billion, almost 14 percent less than the $37 billion analysts had been expecting.
Charles Parkhurst, managing director for government bond trading at Salomon Smith Barney, said that it was troubling that the Treasury had led the market to believe that the 30-year bond was a dinosaur and would be eliminated.
What traders find particularly maddening about the action in the market is that many of the trades that are causing the greatest woes are not especially speculative. In fact, they are fairly ordinary. It is simply that the Treasury's debt reduction plan has turned the market on its head.
Although no bank or brokerage firm came forward with reports of losses, the carnage in the market will most likely push brokerage firms and banks to reassess their heavy reliance on Treasuries to hedge their corporate bond or mortgage holdings. The United States Treasury market is the largest and most liquid in the world, but now that this market will be shrinking, traders will look for new securities to use as hedging vehicles.
In the meantime, these traders are exiting their troubled short positions, which are sizable, buying long-term Treasuries to cover those they had sold short. One trader said a conservative estimate of the Treasuries sold short is twice the securities available for trading, indicating that the pain in the bond market could continue for some time.
A senior executive at a commercial bank said, "This started last Friday afternoon and all the trading floors are shaken." The executive added that because no one knew which firms had been hit the hardest, anxiety levels throughout the market would remain high.
The rally in bonds has exacerbated an unusual occurrence in the market: short-term interest rates are considerably higher than those on long-term securities. That is unusual because investors are traditionally paid more to hold long-term instruments because they are taking on more risk than those investors who buy short-term securities. When short-term yields rise above those of long-term instruments, Wall Street traders say the yield curve is inverted.
"Whenever we have changes in the structure of the yield curve, it has taken about six months for the market to assimilate the changes," said Gemma Wright, senior interest rate strategist at Aubrey G. Lanston, an investment firm in New York. "This is not going to be any different."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Unusual Movement"
Even as the Federal Reserve has raised rates, the yield on the 30-year bond has moved sharply lower in recent days, falling below the yield on the 2-year note. The result is an unusual occurrence, an inverted yield curve, in which investors who take on more risk by owning long-term debt are paid less than those holding short-term instruments.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seizes Russia Tanker Said to Carry Oil From Iraq

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Two American warships enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq seized a Russian tanker in the Persian Gulf today after boarding it and discovering evidence that it might be smuggling oil out of southern Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said.
A lightly armed boarding party from the guided missile cruiser Monterey landed on the tanker by helicopter on Wednesday after repeated attempts to get the tanker to respond to radio queries about its cargo, said the spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley. 
 "There were no incidents of violence whatsoever," he said. The Americans reviewed the tanker's navigational equipment and documents, including bills of lading. They also took samples of the cargo of gas oil to determine whether the petroleum originated in Iraq. Late today, the analysis of the petroleum -- and the sediment carried in it, which should indicate its source -- had not been completed, officials said.
The Volgoneft-147 tanker, flying a Russian flag, is only the second Russian vessel stopped by the international patrols since 1990, when Iraq was prohibited from selling oil on the open market as punishment for its invasion of Kuwait, Pentagon officials said.
For the last month the United States has warned the Russian government of its monitoring of two Russian tankers that had arrived on the Iraqi coast and appeared to be involved in smuggling oil. The Russian ambassador to the United States was briefed regularly on the issue, and American diplomats in Moscow have discussed it with the government there, said James P. Foley, a State Department spokesman.
"The Russian government has told us that this ship is privately owned and that an investigation on the Russian side is under way," he said.
The number of ships trying to smuggle oil out of Iraq has risen dramatically with the increase in oil prices to $27 a barrel from $11 a year ago, a senior Pentagon official said. But the unusual presence of Russian vessels pushed the United States to involve the Moscow government.
"We tried to get the Russians to police this ship themselves," the Pentagon official said, "but I guess with oil prices so high it's hard to stop these entrepreneurs."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Corporations on Steroids

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat came to Davos this year, and there were two people he insisted on meeting with: Bill Clinton of the United States of America and Steve Case of America Online.
I never got to ask Mr. Arafat whether he thought Bill C. was more important than Steve C. After all, AOL-Time Warner has a market value exceeding the gross national product of most countries Mr. Arafat deals with. It's no wonder that when you ask White House officials what the President did in Davos, they say he had a few "bilaterals" -- meetings with other heads of state and business. When I asked the spokesperson for one of the giant technology firms what the company's C.E.O. was doing in Davos, the answer was: "He's holding bilaterals" with other heads of state and business. Every day the line between companies and countries blurs a bit more. 
 Get used to it. As the walls around the world disappear, companies can increasingly compete everywhere. And when you can compete everywhere, in many businesses you must compete everywhere. This is making companies bigger than ever, whether it is AOL-Time Warner or Exxon-Mobil or Microsoft. World leaders, investors and the media are naturally dazzled by the sheer size and power that some of these companies are amassing.
But what happens to democracies when companies grow to size extra-extra-large, in order to compete globally, but democratic regulatory institutions -- like the antitrust division of the Justice Department -- remain a size small?
At a press lunch in Davos, Bill Gates was asked how Microsoft could have hired lobbying firms to try to defund the Justice Department's antitrust division when it had a case pending before the antitrust division. Flashing anger, Mr. Gates said this was "an outrageous characterization -- it's untrue . . . The only thing that we ever spoke out on in terms of funding is p.r. funding." The Justice Department, Mr. Gates said, shouldn't be leaking or promoting "negative activities against U.S. companies overseas. I wasn't involved in any of the specifics of that, but to characterize that as defunding . . . is an outrageous thing."
This answer was disturbing on two levels. First, the notion that it was O.K. for Microsoft to engage lobbyists even just to reduce the public relations budget of the Justice Department's antitrust division -- while Microsoft had a case pending before it -- suggests a moral obtuseness that is, well, outrageous.
Second, the antitrust division of the Justice Department has no p.r. budget! It has one spokeswoman assigned to it from Justice's central office of public affairs, and her salary and related p.r. expenses are paid by public affairs, and they amount to roughly $100,000. Yet, according to The Washington Post, Microsoft's lobbyists, and several nonprofit foundations Microsoft brought to its headquarters on an all-expense-paid trip, tried to get the fiscal 2000 budget for the Justice Department's antitrust division slashed by $9 million -- from Justice's request of $114 million (a modest increase so it could hire more lawyers) down to $105 million (so it would have to cut back activities).
Microsoft wasn't trying to reduce the antitrust division's ability to engage in p.r.; Microsoft was trying to reduce its ability to engage in antitrust -- in a year when there had been a 30 percent increase in corporate mergers. As The Post noted, while corporate lobbying over policies is normal, it is rather unusual for a firm "to seek an across-the-board cut in a department's budget, especially in the middle of a major court battle."
Old problem -- dangerous new twist. America's antitrust laws were initially motivated by two concerns, argues the Harvard University political theorist Michael Sandel -- preventing big monopolies from overwhelming consumers and preventing big business from overwhelming democratic government. Those laws first arose when businesses grew beyond the control of state and local institutions, and therefore some federal power was needed to rein them in.
"Now business is growing to global dimensions, but governments are still national -- so government is again struggling to keep pace," observed Mr. Sandel. "In a world without walls, we are going to have to come up with new ways for government to rein in the power of global corporations, and prevent them from buying up democracy. Instead of just being dazzled by these mega-mergers, there should be a nagging voice in us all asking: Is democracy going to be bought up too?"

Tennis Is Part Of Farmer's Charmed Life

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: MANDARA, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
THE grounds are out of a dusty colonial storybook, from another time and a privileged place. This is where Don Black raised a tennis family, where the grass is lush and the fruits are plenty and labor was love.
Here, on 22 acres rife with avocado pear trees and vegetation that sways to a gentle breeze as if it were music, Don Black awakened his sons, Byron and Wayne, and later daughter, Cara, to the first sign of dawn. School days, every day, they would all hit barefoot on grass moistened by dew. 
 In addition to the fruit, Black grew three tennis pros. The boys, no physical specimens, always went along with what the father called "the contract." They became tour veterans, and something of a local Davis Cup dynasty.
"Imagine if I'd had an athlete to work with," Don Black said, half-kidding. "If I had one like Michael Jordan, he could have killed Sampras."
The Black brothers don't have to worry about Pete Sampras this weekend. Only Andre Agassi, whom Wayne will try his luck with today in what the country's president, Robert Mugabe, is calling "the dwarfs against the giants," Zimbabwe hosting the United States, in the first round of the Davis Cup.
Don Black was also a tennis player, once a match point from Wimbledon's fourth round. Then he returned to his native Rhodesia and became a teacher, like his English mother, and a farmer, like his Scottish father, who came to this former British colony in 1913.
What a charmed life the 72-year-old Black has led on this fertile African land, a straight shot from downtown along Enterprise Road. He retired, at 40, from teaching with a full pension. He was too young to fight in World War II and too old, by three weeks, to be drafted by the colonial regime during the revolution that resulted in independent Zimbabwe in 1980.
"So many of my friends were gone to war and I was over there working on the kids' strokes," he said.
"Over there" was the grass court he had just stepped off, after finishing a lesson in an unobtrusive rain. From the veranda, his bare feet resting on the dry stone floor, he pointed to where Roy Emerson had climbed the fence and collapsed a rail now known as "Emmo's Bend." All of his old Aussie friends had visited him here, in fact, and hit on his well-manicured lawns. He and Rod Laver became good friends.
From his hideaway outside Harare, Black tended to his fruit, read books and corresponded anonymously (he forgot to sign his name) with the likes of Bertrand Russell. He constructed four grass courts, one hard court surrounded by banana trees. He married "the girl living two miles down the road." Velia Black wrote letters to her family in England, and they subsequently became a book, "Growing Up in Rhodesia."
The Black kids were raised in a very different place than the ones who beg for money downtown, or even those visited Wednesday by John McEnroe. In Chitungwiza Township, where unemployment is roughly 50 percent, some of the kids also played barefoot, only it was on sun-drenched cement.
While Velia Black has offered scholarships for a few talented children there, it is hard to connect or comprehend such disparate worlds. When he schooled his own children, Don would set up a bucket and the kids would aim for it with the serve. An African gardener whom the family knows only as Madala -- Old Man -- would retrieve the balls.
The gardener, still with the family, was once going blind from cataracts. An Australian eye surgeon teaching in Harare sent a car. Old Man was fearful, Don said, and wouldn't get in. They plied him with brandy, and off he went, returning the next day, eyesight restored.
Don Black opened his historical storybook and even Byron's scrapbook for visitors yesterday. Inside, he played a musical video called "It's the Blacks," composed by a local performer named Fungai Malianga. There is no disputing the Black family's popularity here, but the economy is failing, the government is wheezing and turmoil may be brewing.
While two-thirds of the white population left after 1980, Don Black stayed. He wouldn't even travel to watch his kids play. "How the hell could I leave all this?" he said.
Off in the distance, his wife was teaching tennis to a diplomat's kids. A servant was cleaning the first-floor windows. Old Man was strolling across the avocado fields.
The breeze was calming and intoxicating.
"I'll die here, whatever happens," Don Black said.

$183 BILLION DEAL IN EUROPE TO JOIN 2 WIRELESS GIANTS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Two of the world's leading companies in wireless communications agreed today to combine in a $183 billion takeover deal, the largest ever.
In a stunning end to the kind of hostile takeover attempt once considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany. The all-stock transaction shattered the previous record for a takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time Warner announced less than three weeks ago. 
 If consummated, the takeover will vastly expand the reach of Vodafone, which already is the world's biggest wireless telephone company, giving it dominance in the European market. Vodafone already has a major presence in the United States, Asia and Africa.
But the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal is perhaps more important as a watershed in European corporate behavior and the export to Europe of bare-knuckled takeover tactics first honed on Wall Street.
Never before has a European company carried off a hostile takeover on such a scale: cross-border, cross-cultural and paid for with shares in a company that was almost unknown outside of Britain 10 years ago.
The exact terms of Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann are still subject to approval by the German conglomerate's supervisory board -- the equivalent of a board of directors -- which is expected to ratify the agreement on Friday.
The deal came just four days before the expiration of Vodafone's takeover offer to holders of Mannesmann stock. Mannesmann's management had called the offer unwanted, unfriendly and too low.
Although it was nominally called a "friendly" merger today, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann, capitulated only when it became obvious that a majority of his shareholders were about to sell.
"The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann, a great company, would be better together with Vodafone AirTouch," Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, told reporters in Dusseldorf, where Mannesmann is based.
It remained unclear what the combined company would be called. But the deal would bring together two businesses with vastly different backgrounds. Mannesmann, founded more than a century ago as a maker of steel pipe, has evolved into technology-driven leader that specializes in communications. Vodafone, by contrast, was born 18 years ago as Britain's first cellular phone company, and that has been its only business ever since.
Together, Vodafone and Mannesmann would have 42.4 million subscribers. NTT DoCoMo of Japan is a distant No. 2 with 26.7 million, and Telecom Italia No. 3 with 17.8 million, according to estimates by the Lehman Brothers investment bank.
Mr. Esser, who had been voluble in his opposition to Vodafone's takeover designs and had been expected to resign, said he would continue to work for the combined company. He will become a nonexecutive chairman and keep a seat on the board.
Mannesmann shareholders will control 49.5 percent of the combined company and will get 58.96 Vodafone shares for each share of the German company that they own, up from the original 53.7 offered. Based on Vodafone's closing share price Wednesday of 3.855, or $6.21, the day before word of the deal got out, the total value is about $366.14 a share, or $183 billion.
If Vodafone shares hold their value, the agreement will be a bonanza for shareholders in Mannesmann, the most widely owned foreign stock in the United States. The takeover price for Mannesmann shares is more than double what they cost before the takeover battle began.
The arrangement has to be approved by the European Commission, which is expected to issue a preliminary decision on Feb. 17. But the deal is a bitter defeat for Mr. Esser, who had passionately fought to preserve his company's independence, though he insisted tonight that the situation was the best possible outcome.
"It's not a change of opinion," he told reporters.
But a slight discomfort was evident between the two men as they presented their agreement tonight. Despite a show of collegiality, they awkwardly shook hands for just a moment. After a bit of prodding by photographers, they were cajoled into shaking hands again.
Despite Mr. Esser's public nonchalance, the takeover is also a shock to Mannesmann, an old-line industrial and engineering conglomerate that had transformed itself into the biggest provider of wireless communications in Europe.
Mr. Gent also outmaneuvered Mr. Esser on the chessboard of Europe's wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely valuable national licenses in each country.
Mannesmann owns networks in Germany, Italy and Britain. Vodafone owns Britain's second largest network and scores of other stakes around Europe and elsewhere.
Mr. Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies -- Vivendi, a French media conglomerate. That move derailed Mr. Esser's desperate attempt to negotiate a merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a major French network and greatly strengthened his position with shareholders.
But Mr. Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal convinced wavering shareholders that Mr. Esser had lost the upper hand, even with his allies, and shareholders began betting on a takeover.
Executives from both companies began to work in earnest together at the start of the week. The companies reached a basic agreement early this morning. Negotiations continued for most of today until the announcement was made late tonight.
The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's three biggest markets -- Britain, Germany and Italy -- along with a 45 percent stake in an AirTouch-Bell Atlantic venture and holdings in more than 30 other countries.
Though Europe has had a surge of big hostile takeovers in the last two years, the takeover of Mannesmann makes history on several fronts besides sheer size.
For one, the only successful European takeovers have been between competitors within a single nation.
The battle for Mannesmann is also one of the first real battles for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption of a single currency in 11 countries made it crucial to overcome boundaries.
The battle also is one of the first cases in which national political leaders did not try to interfere to protect an important domestic company.
When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated takeover battle last year, the battle was largely sanctioned and guided by the Ministry of Finance, which wanted to consolidate the nation's banks and keep out foreign bidders.
The same was true when TotalFina, the French-Belgian oil company, began a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine. Likewise, Italian political leaders opposed the proposed merger between Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Olivetti of Italy.
In Germany, the reaction was different. Despite the angry talk about the dangers of hostile takeovers, the German government stayed out of the fight.
That reflected a widespread view among German business executives that it was far more dangerous to interfere with a legitimate if hostile takeover attempt and jeopardize the ability of German companies to buy up foreign companies.
As a result, Mr. Esser and Mr. Gent waged their battle almost entirely through direct appeals to shareholders themselves.
The conflict began in January 1999 when Vodafone acquired AirTouch of the United States, a minority partner in all of Mannesmann's communication ventures. But it deepened whenMannesmann invaded Vodafone's home territory by buying the British mobile phone network Orange for $33 billion in October.
Faced with Mannesmann's direct attack in Britain, Mr. Gent decided that Vodafone could not remain a real player unless it took over its partner-turned-rival.
Word of the deal weakened Vodafone's share price. In London trading, shares ended at 368.5 pence, down 17. In Frankfurt, Mannesmann shares added 0.5 euro to 325.50 euros.
Both companies employed armies of investment bankers to advise them. Vodafone's lead adviser was Goldman Sachs, which will earn about $75 million, analysts estimate. Vodafone is also advised by Warburg Dillon Read, which is expected to take home $50 million.
Mannesmann's advisers are Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. It is unclear how much Mannesmann's advisers stand to earn.

HEADLINE: EUROPE'S MEGADEAL: THE IMPACT;
Dusseldorf and Mannesmann

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Had it not been in large part for Mannesmann, this old industrial city might well have suffered a decline similar to that of Gary, Ind., or Birmingham, England.
Yet just as Mannesmann reinvented itself from a producer of seamless steel pipe to a fast-growing telecommunications company, Dusseldorf, a center of the German industrial renaissance of the postwar period, has reinvented itself as a newly prosperous center of high technology and services. Both the city and the company at its heart achieved what countless other cities in Europe and elsewhere only talk about: they moved beyond their history, embraced change and fostered entirely new jobs based on fast-growing advanced technologies. 
 And despite all that, the most important company here is now succumbing to a $183 billion takeover by the British telecommunications giant Vodafone AirTouch, which seems intent on running the company from London.
"It is as if a German company decided to come along and buy General Electric, only to sell off all the parts it didn't want," said Christoph Blume, Dusseldorf's director of economic development.
Yet business executives and political leaders here seem to share an overwhelming view that there is no turning back. To the extent that Dusseldorf and Mannesmann have achieved new prosperity, they have done so by embracing high technology and ignoring national borders so they could tap into foreign trade and capital markets.
City officials publicly criticized Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann, but no one tried to stop it. And in Germany's once-protective financial circles, bankers argue that it would be far more dangerous to block Vodafone than to let shareholders decide for themselves.
The reason is apparent on the streets of this city: it is packed with foreign companies, many of them providing highly paid jobs in technology and management. Dusseldorf has shed 125,000 industrial jobs since the early 1960's. But it has added almost the same number in fields like accounting, management consulting, software development, advertising and telecommunications.
"When I was growing up," said Michael Monks, the leader of the workers' council at Mannesmann's mobile phone subsidiary here, "people called this the executive desk for the Ruhr Valley -- the headquarters for heavy industry."
They don't anymore. A crumbling wharf along the Rhine River, rusting and dormant 10 years ago, has been redeveloped as a "media harbor" and now boasts gleaming buildings packed with new companies and trendy restaurants. Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden, two of the biggest mobile phone manufacturers, have research and business centers here. The electronics conglomerate Siemens A.G. has a development center for computer chips.
And at least half a dozen telecommunications companies have installed fiber optic networks to provide high-speed data communications through the main business areas. Mannesmann is at the core of this new population; others include MCI Worldcom, Esprit Telecom of Britain and Isis Multimedia of France.
Few companies have become more entwined with the international economy than Mannesmann itself. The company was founded more than a century ago by two brothers who came up with a method for making seamless steel pipe. Later, it branched out into engineering services, auto parts and electronics.
Since obtaining a license to supply mobile phone service throughout Germany in 1989, Mannesmann has evolved into one of Europe's most successful and internationally active competitors. Until now the biggest mobile phone carrier in Germany, with slightly more customers than Deutsche Telekom, it has spent tens of billions acquiring wireless businesses in Italy and Britain.
Such an enormous transformation required foreign partners and foreign capital. Airtouch Communications, formerly the wireless communications arm of the Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco, provided money and technical expertise from the beginning. Mannesmann also raised billions in international bond markets and attracted scores of foreign stockholders. About 60 percent of Mannesmann's shares are owned by non-Germans, and a large share of that is held by American or British institutional investors.
And Mannesmann is not unusual. Werner Seifert, president of the Frankfurt stock exchange, estimates that two of every five shares traded in the DAX index of leading German stocks are held by foreigners. Far from viewing that as a threat to jobs and stability, Mr. Seifert argues that it makes companies healthier by forcing them to compete in the global markets. And takeovers, he said, are part of that process.
"In the United States, the target companies in corporate takeovers are usually companies in old industries that have not been producing jobs," Mr. Seifert said. "The market was punishing companies that had not been able to create jobs."
The economic unification of Western and Central Europe -- where trade barriers have all but disappeared and 11 countries including Germany have adopted the euro as a common currency -- has added to the pressure for mergers, as well as for openness.
"In the past, you might have dominated your domestic market," said Theodor Baums, a professor of banking and finance at the University of Osnabruck, "but now you are just one of many players and you must build up your position across borders. If you want to have operations abroad, you have to recognize the rights of companies in other countries to come in here."
Mannesmann, in sharp contrast to companies embroiled in takeover battles in France or Italy, was careful never to deviate from that model. In his three-month barnstorming campaign to defeat Vodafone's hostile bid, Mannesmann's chief executive, Klaus Esser, never invoked political defenses and trained all his efforts on persuading Mannesmann shareholders that Vodafone's offer was simply too low. "The final decision belongs to shareholders," he said again and again. And though he might have grimaced at the results, Mr. Esser generally acted in accordance with that belief.
Jorg Pluta, director of the Deutsche Schutsverein fur Wertpapierbesitz, an advocacy group for individual investors, praised Mr. Esser for his openness. "I would give him an A for transparency," he said.
That may come as cold comfort to people here. Several recent surveys have found that the overwhelming majority of Mannesmann individual investors in Germany opposed selling their shares to Vodafone.
Nonetheless, employees at Mannesmann's wireless business say they are not worried about their future. Wireless, which employs 8,000 people in this country, is growing rapidly and is almost certain to need more rather than fewer people.
But many fret that Vodafone will move to sever ties quickly with Mannesmann's older businesses, like steel pipes and auto components. While both companies had planned to spin off the older businesses, Christopher Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone, is widely expected to be harsher than Mr. Esser in closing older factories. "All the evidence thus far suggests that foreign takeovers lead to the disposal of management functions and jobs," said Udo Siepmann, head of the Dusseldorf Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Others business leaders are somewhat more optimistic. "This city has shown that it can go through a huge transformation," said Hans Georg Crone-Erdmann, head of the Association of Chambers of Commerce for North Rhine-Westphalia. "I have absolutely no worries about the future."

Before Play Starts, Zimbabwe Gets Lift

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The No. 1 player in Zimbabwe stood shoulder to shoulder with No. 1 in the world here today. At the Davis Cup draw to determine the pairings for Friday's opening matches, Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, might have been hoping that Andre Agassi's magic is contagious.
With lines for gasoline lengthening, unemployment, inflation and H.I.V. infection rates soaring, and Parliamentary elections coming, the beleaguered president made sure that Agassi was right next to him for the group photo at the statehouse. 
 "If you've read the papers, Zimbabwe is going through a bit of a rough time right now, and I think this is a bit of a breath of fresh air," said Byron Black, who plays the American Chris Woodruff in the second match at the Harare Sports Center. Black's brother, Wayne, will play Agassi in the first match.
There are seven other first-round matchups in the World Group: Australia, the defending champion, at Switzerland; Britain at the Czech Republic; Italy at Spain; Belgium at Russia; Austria at Slovakia; Brazil at France; and the Netherlands at Germany.
Mugabe called the Zimbabwe-United States encounter "the dwarfs against the giants." But Woodruff did not want to hear about it.
"I'd be lying if I told you I didn't feel any pressure," he said. "This is a big deal."
He was home in Knoxville, Tenn., when the United States captain, John McEnroe, called last Friday to inform him that he had been drafted by Uncle Sam. Here he is, at 27, set up as the biggest target in Zimbabwe.
"Andre is playing the best tennis of anyone on the planet right now," Byron Black said. "Obviously, the guy we're aiming to beat is the No. 2 player, Woodruff. Hopefully, the doubles could be the crucial decider."
If that occurs, McEnroe may run out of hairs that have not turned gray. The United States team of Alex O'Brien and Rick Leach has never played together. The Zimbabwe captain, Gavin Sinney, is pairing Wayne Black with Kevin Ullyett for Saturday's doubles, and engaging in some playful warfare with McEnroe.
"America, with the players they've got, should win the Davis Cup every year for the next few years," he said.
Agassi, speaking for the depleted Americans, said, "I think we'll be fortunate to get through this weekend."
One singles victory by Woodruff would pretty much assure a second-round match against England or the Czech Republic in Los Angeles. But Woodruff has no Davis Cup experience other than being a practice partner. His best ranking was 25, three years ago.
He soon hurt his wrist, then tore up his knee just fooling around, kicking field goals with the tour veteran Richey Reneberg at a high school field in Atlanta. He was out for almost a year.
"He's 6-4, good agility, big hitter," said Paul Goldstein, one of the team's practice players. "At the Australian Open, he beat Tim Henman, didn't lose a set for three rounds, lost to Sampras in the quarters. He's playing good ball."
How that translates here, in the nearly mile-high altitude and under extreme Davis Cup conditions, who knows? Byron Black today was promising more noise than even McEnroe might be able to bear. There will be "a lot of drums," Black said, possibly -- by coincidence, of course -- right behind McEnroe.
This is the first time Zimbabwe has ever engaged an American team, a situation that makes Byron Black something of a prophet. A couple of years ago, after Zimbabwe had qualified for the World Group, the tennis federation president, Paul Chinoka, asked him if he and his brother could help bring famous American players like Agassi, Sampras or even the retired McEnroe to Harare to play exhibitions and promote the game.
"I thought, well, this could be a bit expensive," Black said. "I said, 'Maybe you should wait for Davis Cup. We'll get them for free.' "

In June 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin came to Washington to celebrate "partnership and friendship" with the United States. "We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gun sights," he told a joint session of Congress.
Nothing better symbolizes the subsequent decline of Russian-American relations than the recent announcement that Russian military strategists had approved use of nuclear weapons "to repel armed aggression" -- which some see as a threatening expansion of Russian nuclear doctrines. 
 The change, however, is less a cause for concern than for regret. Russia is saying it will not rule out using nuclear weapons to defend itself, even from conventional attack, if all other means fail. Militarily, this reflects Russia's weakness, not its strength. The new policy does not mean the United States need fear an offensive Russian nuclear strike. Russia knows the strength, the reach and the effectiveness of the West's strategic nuclear deterrent far too well to take such a risk.
Diplomatically, however, the new policy signals deep distrust, even fear, of the West. On the nuanced scale of diplomatic rhetoric, Russian leaders now reject "partnership and friendship" and embrace "cooperation" -- a step backward.
Russians today believe we exploited the collapse of the Soviet Union to weaken Russia. To a surprising degree, they blame us for their economic troubles. They think we pushed reforms to enrich the few and impoverish the many.
Why, Russians ask themselves, did the United States, after promising that NATO was strictly a defensive alliance, lead it into an offensive war against Russia's ally, Serbia? After the anti-ballistic missile treaty served as one cornerstone of the Russian and American nuclear relationship for 27 years, why does the United States now want to build an antimissile defense system that will destroy the balance? And, by the way, what right does America have to criticize Russia's struggles to keep its federation together in a war no less brutal than the one America fought to preserve its own union?
Americans are equally frustrated -- by misuse of international loans, stories of money laundering, Russian opposition to American foreign policy initiatives in Kosovo and Iraq, Russia's tactics in Chechnya.
So, in this climate, what should the United States do?
First, remember Russia's importance to our own security and prosperity. Russia's weapons of mass destruction pose threats if they fall into the wrong hands. Russia's economy struggles today but has enormous potential. Russia retains influence as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. And Russian organized crime infiltrates the West.
Engagement is the only sensible way to encourage a stable, democratic and prosperous Russia. But our expectations must be realistic. Compared with Western models, Russia's economy and democracy are disappointments. Compared with Communism and czarism, however, they reflect major progress.
Some retreat from the euphoria of 1992 was probably inevitable. But it is possible to repair the relationship. Whatever the outcome of elections in both countries this year, the winners should prepare, quickly and deliberately, to make a fresh start to restore good will.
For the United States, that means recognizing that the relationship with Russia is not friend-or-foe, with nothing between. Russia has made great strides in political and press freedom, and almost all elements of Russian society want democracy and capitalism. But our new leaders will also need to recognize that Russia will have its own foreign policy, independent of ours. We should oppose Russia when its policies conflict with our interests and values.
Our involvement with Russia may not immediately produce results. There will be setbacks. Through it all, we must be patient, persistent and a bit modest. Only this approach can stop the drift toward enmity and make possible an ultimate return to friendship.

Gold Tops $300 on Job Data And an Altered Sales Strategy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The price of gold surged past $300 yesterday, gaining 8 percent after a leading gold producer said it would adjust its sales strategy in anticipation of higher prices.
Gold for delivery in April jumped $23.10, to $313 a troy ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest gain in four months, the highest price since Oct. 15, and the first time since Nov. 24 that gold had traded for more than $300. 
 The price rose early in the session after the release of new United States unemployment data, and it accelerated after the gold mining company, Placer Dome Inc., released its annual results and said it was changing its sales strategy.
In its announcement, Placer Dome, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and ranks fifth among global producers, said it would no longer sell borrowed gold, a hedging strategy that is based on expectations of lower prices.
"It looks like mining companies are pulling out of their hedge programs left and right," said Carlos Perez-Santalla, a gold trader at Hudson River Futures in New York. "It's positive for gold."
Prices have risen for three straight sessions, leaving them 7.5 percent higher than a year ago. In London, gold for immediate delivery rose $22.85, to $310.30 an ounce.
"We believe gold prices will move higher," Jay Taylor, chief executive at Placer, said in a statement. He called on other gold companies to "show confidence in gold" and reduce their hedge positions.
Traders who follow the hedging by mining companies for signs of where gold prices are heading said Placer Dome's announcement had increased confidence that prices were heading higher.
Prices rose after the Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low in January, raising concern for higher salaries and consumer prices. Investors sometimes buy gold as a hedge against inflation.

HEADLINE: In a Valley Pockmarked by Poverty, Developing a Cure for Suburban Blight

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Martin Munoz, his wife and two children live in a home the couple fashioned around a broken-down school bus and a camper trailer. Just across the way, a fighting cock is tethered near another home, which is nothing more than a camper shell on a pickup.
The rag-tag trailer park where the Munoz family has made its home for the last 14 years is a symptom of a gradual but steady decline in living conditions in the northeast San Fernando Valley that has city officials pondering what could be the largest redevelopment project in Los Angeles's history. 
 The problems of the northeast Valley, redevelopment experts say, are part of a relatively new phenomenon that other communities will face in coming decades: suburban blight, or the aging of neighborhoods outside the traditional urban core.
While the roots of the decline -- poverty, a lack of political clout, the departure of the middle class -- may be the same as those found in urban centers, they present new challenges, experts say. Rather than being concentrated in well-defined areas, much of the worst blight in areas like the northeast Valley is tucked away in small pockets.
"The difference is largely a function of land use and scale," said Robert Fazio, a longtime employee of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and a coordinator of the San Fernando Valley project. "We don't have the density of New York and Philadelphia, but there still is great economic disparity of income and education levels and employment opportunities."
While blight exists, Mr. Fazio said, "some conditions are so subtle but so pervasive that it's going to be tough to make clearly defined visible improvements."
In all, the redevelopment project would include 6,835 acres and take at least 20 years, with the possibility of being extended another 10 years.
Redevelopment officials, who devised the plan at the City Council's request, are proposing that about $490 million in property taxes be diverted to the area over the next four decades to upgrade land, provide new housing and stimulate business and industry that will generate jobs. Only a broad outline has been sketched.
Early plans single out basic community improvements, like a $100,000 tree-planting initiative, the development of a community-based art plan and improvement of employment, education and transit services.
The proposal is subject to the approval of City Council, which is scheduled to consider it this spring.
The area's decline is rooted in how it grew up, said James P. Allen, a professor of geography at California State University at Northridge and an expert on the ethnic population of Southern California.
The northeast Valley is a sprawling network of older settlements and the remnants of farming communities like Pacoima in the northeast reaches of Los Angeles. It has long been home to new immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who often find it difficult to break the cycle of poverty. Many of those whose skills and incomes improve move on to the more prosperous communities to the west.
Those left behind traditionally had little political clout.
The northeast Valley developed helter-skelter. Residential areas often crouch next to gritty industrial sites. Trailer parks have sprouted beside gravel pits. Small motels that once gave shelter to travelers along Route 99 now house large families in single rooms. While shopping areas are scattered about the northeast Valley, they are heavy on liquor stores and lacking in the kinds of services that families need.
"There are little things that make you see the difference," said Neal S. Dudovitz, executive director of San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services in the heart of the Pacoima business district. "All the banks have left; there's one bank for about 80,000 people. Until recently, there was no bank machine."
According to reports prepared for the Community Redevelopment Agency, property values in the area declined by 10 percent from 1994 to 1998, compared with less than one-third of 1 percent during that same period in all Los Angeles County. The average household size, a figure used to measure overcrowding, was 3.4 for the area, compared with 2.97 citywide. In some pockets, the average household size was as high as six. Per capital income was $9,266, compared with $16,188 citywide.
The full picture, however, is less visible. Mr. Fazio tells of 10 people living in an old Airstream trailer, paying $100 a month for the right. In old motels, families double up in one-room lodging.
To address housing issues, the plan calls for rehabilitating existing property, selling blighted property and developing new homes. It also proposes neighborhood improvements, like sidewalk installation, paving and new street lights.
Low interest loans are to be offered to encourage business expansion and modernization while long-range strategies for use are developed. In commercial areas, facade fixups are planned, along with general improvements like better lighting, security and parking.
Critics of the project assert that the redevelopment agency has an unimpressive track record in tackling other projects in the city.
"I'm not opposed to revitalization. I'm not opposed to jobs. I'm not opposed to reinvestment or improving people lives. I'm not opposed to redevelopment," said Don Lippman, who does not live in the area but criticizes the agency's work in general. "I'm opposed to the C.R.A because they don't do the job. All they do is take the money."
Redevelopment officials counter by naming more than a half-dozen sites where their efforts have brought improvements -- like Watts, where an agency project brought more housing and a shopping center.
Still, Dick Symonds, who owns a business in the area and recently won a seat on the project's community oversight committee, is apprehensive.
"I'm trying to learn what they are going to do," Mr. Symonds said. "All I've been able to establish so far is what they can do: take your land, make you fix up your land."
Mr. Fazio said no changes would be made without participation and support from the area.
Caron Caines, a legal aid lawyer who has worked on the community advisory panel, said such suspicions about the project were easy to understand. The legal aid office, Ms. Caines said, had opposed some of the practices of the redevelopment agency on the grounds that they had singled out low-income communities "because it's easier to bulldoze them."
"I still think there's a danger of that," she said, adding that she has grown to believe that the agency can play a useful role in redeveloping the area.
"I'm just concerned that it be used as a scalpel and not a hacksaw," Ms. Caines said. "I've worked with them now for years; they're good people that care about the community."
Mr. Munoz, who moved here from Mexico and is now a legal resident of the United States , had not heard about the proposed development.
He did not have an opinion or any expectations, but he did have a rhetorical question: "What can you ask if you live here?"
Still, standing outside his home, an American flag hanging by his door near a small pedal car secured by a chain, he was intrigued by the idea of neighborhood improvements.
"We need more space," said Mr. Munoz, who pays $343 a month rent to stay in the trailer park bordering a recycling center. "A clean yard where the kids can play and not get sick would be good."

HEADLINE: Lee Hills, 93, Knight Ridder Official and Pulitzer Winner

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Lee Hills, who began a journalism career as a teenage reporter covering mining disasters in Utah, continued it as an editor by bringing Pulitzer Prizes and national renown to The Miami Herald and The Detroit Free Press, and finally spread the gospel of quality journalism around the country as chief executive of the Knight Ridder newspaper group, died Thursday in Miami. He was 93.
He earned a law degree by the age of 29 while moving through newspapers in Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee, and later became well versed in the financial side of the business, but Mr. Hills never strayed far from the newsroom. 
 Even as editor of The Free Press, he could not resist the lure of reporting -- a predilection that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1955 for coverage of labor negotiations between the United Automobile Workers and the automakers. He later revealed that no less a figure than Henry Ford II had been a crucial source.
Five years later, as editor of The Miami Herald, he directed the newspaper's coverage of mob bosses living in the area, a series called "Know Your Neighbor," which won that newspaper its first Pulitzer Prize.
Most of all, according to journalists who knew him, Mr. Hills saw probing, objective journalism as a calling and a public service. Mr. Hills -- an employee and friend of the late John S. Knight, who, with his brother James, owned the Knight newspaper group -- had sought to make the sharp, the curious, the critical and the crusading professionals around him adopt his standards of fairness, objectivity and excellence.
"He knew full well the kind of journalism he had come into, a journalism of faction and interests and parochialism and provincialism, and of a brawling independence as well," said Hodding Carter, speaking of the 1920's and 1930's -- when Mr. Hills covered everything from lynchings to the crime career of Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd.
"But," Mr. Carter continued, "he believed so strongly in the implications of a free press that he became one of the guys who helped to guide us into the period in which the adoption of standards and the notion of a semi-profession, with real connection to principle, and with the idea that the news came first and public interest came first."
Mr. Carter, who is president of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, added: "He came up wanting above all else to be a good newspaperman, a good journalist. He became, in effect, the prime minister for Jack Knight as he created a newspaper organization that was solidly successful economically and held to the old values in journalism throughout."
Mr. Hills was born in Egg Creek Township, near Granville, N.D., in 1906. The family moved to Utah after his mother's death in 1911. It was in that state that he took his first job at a newspaper, sweeping floors at The Price News Advocate.
He received his college education at Brigham Young University and the University of Missouri. While working as a reporter and editorial writer at The Oklahoma City Times, which he joined in 1929, he earned a law degree. He later worked for that newspaper's competitor, The Oklahoma News, a Scripps-Howard newspaper, before introducing himself to John Knight in 1942.
According to the obituary in The Detroit Free Press yesterday, Mr. Hills, looking for a new job, asked to meet with Mr. Knight, who, with his brother, owned The Akron Beacon-Journal, The Detroit Free Press and The Miami Herald. Mr. Knight agreed to take him on as a news editor at The Herald. He soon became managing editor.
When the government rationed newsprint at the height of the war, Mr. Hills persuaded Mr. Knight to cut back on advertising to allow full space for war coverage.
Some of the reporting he made room for was his own, as he served briefly as a war correspondent for The Herald, and filed reports from the Far East, the Middle East and Latin America -- an area of the world that fascinated him. At The Herald, he supported extensive coverage of Latin America.
Even as the head of professional groups, he found a way to get back to his reporting roots. In 1962, touring the Soviet Union with 12 editors -- at the time he was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors -- he got nationwide attention, reporting an interview with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.
As John Knight's chief lieutenant, Mr. Hills served for the better part of three decades -- from 1951 to 1979 -- as executive editor or publisher of both The Herald and The Free Press.
Alvah Chapman, who, like Mr. Hills, served as a chief executive of Knight Ridder, said yesterday: "Lee, of course, was both a business operator and a journalist. He was responsible for the business success as well as the editorial success of The Detroit Free Press. But he was best known for editorial skills and news skills."
Mr. Hills and Mr. Chapman, at Mr. Knight's behest, arranged the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. with Ridder Publications Inc., producing a newspaper group that boasted a greater circulation than any of its rivals -- until the rapid growth of USA Today put the Gannett Company into the lead.
Mr. Hills was the first chairman and chief executive of the merged newspaper group. He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.
Mr. Hills was also an active philanthropist in both Detroit and Miami. Mr. Carter credits Mr. Hills with persuading the Knight brothers to set up the Knight Foundation with gifts amounting to more than $400 million. He also served as president of the Inter-American Press Association -- through which he met his third wife, Tina Ramos Hills.
Mr. Hills is survived by his wife and by Ronald Hills of Saratoga, Calif., his son with his first wife, Leona Hass, whom he divorced in 1944. His second wife, Eileen Whitman Hills, whom he married in 1948, died in 1961. He is also survived by two sisters, Louise Elwood, of Seattle, and BeverLee Margolis, of Mercer Island, Wash.; a brother, Stanley Hills, of Mercer Island; two grandsons and three great-grandsons.
Allen H. Neuharth, a colleague of Mr. Hills at The Herald and later, as founder of USA Today, a competitor, said yesterday: "Among journalists, he was a reporter who never stopped being a reporter, even though he went on to be an executive and a publisher. But he retained his reporter's instincts and sensibility, and that motivated everything he did in his newspaper decisions."

HEADLINE: Oman Letting Seized Russian Tanker Dock

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Oman has agreed to accept the Russian tanker seized by two American warships that were enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq, a Pentagon official said today.
Oman is letting the Maritime Inspection Force escort the Russian-flagged tanker, which is suspected of smuggling oil out of Iraq, to one of its ports, where officials will await the results of a laboratory analysis of an oil sample to determine its origin, the official said. 
 If the results confirm that the oil is Iraqi, the official said, Oman is most likely to dispose of it and release the ship, which was intercepted on Wednesday.
Russian diplomats boarded the tanker today to ensure the crew's well-being.
The Pentagon also announced that the size of the inspection force was doubled today, from two to four ships, adding that the action was part of a customary rotation. The number of ships that try to smuggle oil out of Iraq has reportedly risen dramatically with the increase in oil prices. In the last year, 700 were boarded and investigated, with 19 being seized.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Tobacco Ally Takes On McCain

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
The National Smokers Alliance, a group subsidized by the tobacco industry, has begun running a 30-second advertisement in South Carolina that sharply attacks Senator John McCain of Arizona for his sponsorship of an antismoking bill to impose fees on tobacco that would have raised the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10. South Carolina holds its presidential primary on Feb. 19.
 
PRODUCER -- National Smokers Alliance
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Two black-and-white photographs of Mr. McCain, smiling in one and scowling in the other, materialize as the voice-over labels him a "typical Washington politician." The narrator accuses Mr. McCain of having proposed "the largest consumer tax increase in history" while claiming in his campaign for president that he has "never voted for a tax increase." Headlines appear on the screen from articles by United Press International ("McCain vows tobacco taxes, regulation") and The San Diego Union-Tribune ("Tobacco politics: tax and spend, not smoking, defined McCain's bill"). They are followed by an effect in which the two photographs merge into one, intended to suggest political duplicity. 

SCRIPT -- Narrator: "John McCain, presidential candidate, meet Senator John McCain, typical Washington politician. Candidate McCain states that as senator he has never voted for a tax increase. Yet in 1998, Senator McCain sponsored legislation backed by President Clinton to increase tobacco taxes. Senator McCain's bill would have imposed the largest consumer tax increase in history: $516 billion. Saying one thing and doing another. That's the real John McCain."
 
ACCURACY -- Mr. McCain was in fact chief architect of legislation intended to discourage smoking among young people. In June 1998 the bill died on the Senate floor because backers could not muster the 60 votes they needed on procedural issues. In addition to the fees, the bill would have imposed monetary penalties on cigarette makers if the number of young smokers did not decline to designated levels. Mr. McCain and the White House, which supported the measure, estimated the 25-year cost of the bill at $516 billion. The senator has, indeed, asserted that he has never voted to raise taxes, and some supporters of the bill said the fees did not constitute a tax. Still, a levy imposed on a commodity like cigarettes, sometimes referred to as a "sin tax," is intended less as a means of filling government coffers than as a way of enforcing a social mandate.
 
SCORECARD -- A classic attack advertisement tailored to the perceived economic insecurities of a tobacco state. The advertisement also tries to portray Mr. McCain as an inside-the-Beltway ally of Mr. Clinton, who is not popular in South Carolina Republican politics. The National Smokers Alliance, which is based in Alexandria, Va., and claims a membership of three million, clashed with Mr. McCain over the 1998 bill; the group, financed in part by the Philip Morris Companies and the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, ran advertisements at the time attacking Mr. McCain. He proved somewhat impervious to cries of hypocrisy on tax issues from advertisements sponsored by interest groups in New Hampshire, and whether the approach has more traction when tied to a home-grown industry like tobacco remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: Post and News Considered Shared Tasks, But Declined

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The New York Post and The Daily News, whose rivalry has generated flashes of rapier tabloid journalism and multimillion-dollar losses, have held exploratory talks on combining their printing and distribution operations to cut costs, but the discussions have gone nowhere, officials of both papers said yesterday.
In interviews, Ken Chandler, publisher and editor in chief of The Post, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and co-publisher of The Daily News, confirmed a Wall Street Journal report yesterday that talks had been held, but both suggested the discussions had been dormant for months and might even be dead. 
 "We always listen to new ideas that are put before us," Mr. Chandler said. "Some preliminary meetings were held. But we are proceeding with our business plans with or without outside parties."
Mr. Zuckerman sounded even less sanguine. "There were talks in the most limited sense, but they never went beyond the exploratory stage," he said. "We never got into specific discussions, and they're unlikely to be revived."
Both men were reluctant to discuss the substance of the talks, except to acknowledge that a merging of printing and distribution operations had been among the topics. There were apparently several sessions over a year that ended about six months ago. It was unclear why the talks were suspended.
The discussions took place against the backdrop of New York City's highly competitive market for newspaper readers and advertisers, in which The Post and The News, two of the nation's largest tabloids, have struggled to survive.
Both tabloids are privately held and do not disclose finances. But The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, is believed by newspaper analysts to lose $9 million to $15 million a year, and The Daily News recently disclosed in court documents that it lost $17.9 million in 1998, despite a cash infusion of $19 million by Mr. Zuckerman.
Relying on the deep pockets of their owners, the tabloids have each invested heavily in new color presses -- a $200 million plant in the Bronx for The Post and a $62 million plant in Jersey City for The News. The News has had problems with its presses, curtailing the number of lucrative color ads it could sell, and lost a lawsuit against Goss Graphic Systems, which supplied the presses.
The News is also caught up in a potentially expensive arbitration dispute with its drivers, and its circulation has declined. In the six months ended last Sept. 30, its circulation dropped by about 20,000, to 701,831 on weekdays and 790,911 on Sundays, while The Post's circulation was up slightly to 438,158 on weekdays, although its Sunday circulation dropped 5.6 percent to 360,945.
In some cities where hard economics have threatened to kill newspapers, the government has sanctioned cost-cutting agreements in which two papers share production, distribution and even business operations while keeping separate newrooms and editorial voices. The Post-Daily News talks apparently never broached such far-reaching cooperation.
Indeed, as the two sides appeared to back away from the contacts yesterday, the old rivalries rose to the surface, and there seemed to be so little common ground that Mr. Chandler and Mr. Zuckerman could not even agree on who had initiated the contacts.
"A friend of Mr. Murdoch called me and said they would like to get together and talk, so we did," Mr. Zuckerman said.
But Mr. Chandler recalled it differently. "The Daily News reached out to us and asked if we would be interested in ways to share some production costs."
And Mr. Zuckerman said: "I think they are losing an immense amount of money. To merge two very complicated processes on an operational level would be difficult."

HEADLINE: President to Ask for Increase In Help for Manufacturers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In the budget he will send to Congress on Monday, President Clinton will propose increased spending to help manufacturers who have been hit by competition from abroad and a shortage of skilled workers at home, administration officials said today.
The proposals have the backing both of organized labor and manufacturing groups. They were developed, in part, at the urging of Vice President Al Gore, administration officials said. 
 Although Mr. Gore is backed by most unions, he is at odds with organized labor over his support for free trade and bringing China into the World Trade Organization. Even so, the proposals could help him show that he is sensitive to the upheaval that global competition is creating among manufacturers.
In his budget, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Mr. Clinton will propose an increase of $386 million in spending on a variety of programs that could help manufacturers, administration officials said.
Among the proposals is an increase of $215 million, or 26 percent, for the Export-Import Bank of the United States to help promote exports.
The others include $30 million in new matching grants to states for training programs designed to help manufacturing workers keep up with changing technology. Financing for a separate program to give more science and math training to technicians would be increased to $14 million from $4 million.
Mr. Clinton will also propose a substantial expansion of programs that monitor and enforce trade agreements, in particular those that watch for rapid surges in imports from competitors selling their goods below cost or taking advantage of big swings in exchange rates. Industries like steel were hit hard by import surges after the global financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, prompting calls from manufacturers and from Congress for protectionist measures.
Mr. Clinton will also call for expansions of existing programs to help areas that lose factory jobs to foreign competition and for more money for programs to help smaller manufacturers learn to use the Internet to do business.
Dave Smith, the director of public policy for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the proposals were "all steps in the right direction" but were modest relative to the size of the problems.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the White House had clearly recognized two important issues, "the move to e-commerce and the skills shortage in America's work force."

Unemployment Rate Fell To Just 4 Percent in January
The nation's employers created 387,000 new jobs in January, more than in any single month in more than two years. The Labor Department also said that the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. It had been 4.1 percent since October.
The average hourly pay of the nation's nonsupervisory production workers -- about 90 million people in a work force of 130.3 million last month -- rose by 6 cents in January, to $13.50 an hour. That represents an annual rise of just 3.5 percent, down from an annualized increase of 3.7 percent last fall. Page A1. 

Nasdaq Soars to Another Record
The Nasdaq composite index rounded out a strong week with a new high as investors moved money from industrial companies that may be hurt by rising interest rates to technology companies. The Nasdaq composite index gained 33.16 points, to 4,244.14, above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.64 points, to 10,963.80, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.60 point, to 1,424.37. The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.26 percent from 6.13 percent on Thursday. C3.

HEADLINE: Military Rumblings in Indonesia

 BODY:
Indonesia's passage from army-backed dictatorship to freely elected civilian government over the past two years, though accompanied by terrible economic hardships, is one of Asia's great political success stories. But that achievement is now threatened by a tense confrontation between President Abdurrahman Wahid and Indonesia's most powerful military figure, Gen. Wiranto. For democracy to survive in the world's fourth largest country, Mr. Wahid must prevail.
Mr. Wahid's accession to power last fall marked a clear change at the top of the country's political structure. But at lower levels, much power remained in military hands. Mr. Wahid has tried, gingerly, to ease the army out of politics and subject it to civilian authority and justice. 
 The current crisis was triggered when a government human rights commission this week found General Wiranto responsible for much of the killing and destruction carried out by pro-Indonesian militias on East Timor last year. The commission recommended his criminal indictment. President Wahid appropriately asked the general to resign immediately as minister for security affairs. Mr. Wahid also said that General Wiranto would be tried, but promised to pardon the general if he was convicted.
But General Wiranto has refused to resign. Mr. Wahid, who is traveling in Europe, returns to Indonesia on Feb. 13. Meanwhile there are mounting fears that some of General Wiranto's military supporters may be plotting a coup.
Any military move against the elected government would have devastating consequences. Washington has already said that Indonesia would find itself internationally isolated. Foreign investors would withdraw their funds. Most important, Indonesia's people would strongly resist any return to military rule.
President Wahid has warned restive officers that the civilian authorities are now in charge and urged them to be careful. Washington and other democratic governments must do everything in their power to discourage Indonesian military officers from challenging Mr. Wahid's authority. His continued constitutional rule offers Indonesia its best hope for a peaceful and prosperous future.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Donations Lag in Last Weeks of Appeal

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
From Wall Street power brokers to young children with small allowances, people across the metropolitan area and beyond have given more than $5 million this year to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which supports seven of the city's oldest and most respected social service organizations.
Since the 1994-95 campaign, donations to the fund have gone up with every year, but despite a booming economy and a new way of donating, via The Times's Web site -- at www.nytimes.com/neediest -- the amount of money raised in this year's campaign may fall below last year's record total. 
 Daily contribution levels have decreased over the past month, now that the holiday season is over. On Thursday, the fund received only $2,385.63, less money than on any previous day in this year's campaign. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, the fund received an average of $84,822.54 each day.
But the problems of the poor do not go away after the last few bars of "Auld Lang Syne" are sung and people put away their party hats.
Helping to buoy this year's totals are the many donors who give year after year, often in memory of a parent or spouse who had given for many years. And there are people like Alyson Sikorski, who this year made her first donation to the fund.
Ms. Sikorski, a structural engineer with Goldstein Associates, a consulting firm, organized a fund-raising effort at her office in Midtown Manhattan. She and 29 of her co-workers gave a total of $300 to the fund. "We're lucky enough to have jobs and to be able to support ourselves and our families," she said.
Whether they spend their days in the office towers that line the Avenue of the Americas or in classrooms on shady suburban streets, donors to the fund have little in common, except compassion for the less fortunate. While reasons for giving vary, many say they donate to the fund because The Times pays the fund's administrative costs, so every dollar received goes to those in need.
A fourth-grade class from Rye, N.Y., gave $388.10 to the fund in January and sent a handwritten letter signed by 15 students in Elizabeth Block's class at the Rye Country Day School: "In Mrs. Block's class we talk about the news a lot. As we talked about it we realized that there are a lot of poor people, and we decided that we should try to help them because we are more fortunate. We chose you because you don't use up the money. You send it to the people who need it."
Some of Mrs. Block's students helped raise money by doing chores at home like setting the dinner table, taking out the garbage or pet-sitting. Others contributed their allowances. Still others gave out of their savings, providing money to those in need, often because of circumstances beyond their control: the death of a family member, sudden medical expenses or the loss of a job.
"Some of the things we hope you'll help with are homeless people who are getting arrested, or people who have little clothes or don't have enough food and drink," the letter said.
The money the class raised is enough to provide warm winter clothes to children born into poverty, or to help buy furniture for a family burned out of their apartment by a fire, or keep a family from being evicted and forced into a shelter.
Each year, some of the largest contributions to the fund come because of a group of dozens of committed young financial analysts, who despite busy schedules work hard to persuade their Wall Street colleagues to give.
Last year, they raised a total of $201,286 for the fund. This week, the group turned over its first installment from this year's drive, $45,228 from employees of Salomon Smith Barney. Money from eight other Wall Street firms participating in the fund-raising effort is expected to be given before the Neediest Cases appeal ends at the end of the month.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
Bush Begins Taking Shots at McCain

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Feb. 5

 BODY:
In a new offensive against his surging opponent, Gov. George W. Bush today attacked Senator John McCain for accepting campaign contributions from corporations he helps regulate as head of the Senate Commerce Committee.
Mr. Bush, who suffered a numbing defeat at the hands of Mr. McCain in the New Hampshire primary, also unveiled a new television commercial that included some of the harshest criticism to date of his rival. 
 Accusing Mr. McCain of "Washington double talk," Mr. Bush said his actions as head of the Commerce Committee seemed to clash with his image as the champion of campaign finance reform.
"He's a person who's a committee chairman," Mr. Bush said. "He's used his positions skillfully to forward his campaign."
Mr. Bush also referred to news reports that Mr. McCain intervened with federal regulators on behalf of a company whose plane he used to travel to campaign events. "When you're chairman of the Commerce Committee, one is capable of finding people to fly you on their airplanes and very capable of using that position to raise money," he said.
The new Bush advertisement began running tonight in South Carolina and is the first by Mr. Bush that attacks Mr. McCain by name. It criticizes a 3-week-old McCain commercial in which the senator asserted that "the one big difference" between him and the other candidates was that "I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy."
In the Bush commercial, an announcer says, "John McCain's ad about Governor Bush's tax plan isn't true, and McCain knows it." Mr. McCain's economic adviser says he would support Mr. Bush's plan -- $2 trillion to protect Social Security, reduce the debt and a real tax cut. "McCain's plan?" it continues. "A tax cut smaller than Clinton's. And not a penny in tax cuts for 30 million Americans."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
A New Challenge for Bush: Showing He Wants to Win

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 4

 BODY:
In the past, when Gov. George W. Bush pondered his astonishingly charmed political career, he sometimes sought metaphors to describe the feeling of being propelled and kept afloat by forces that were larger than he was, and beyond his control. He once compared himself to a cork in a stream.
It was an acknowledgment that he had managed to become the governor of Texas without too much fuss or any previous experience in office. It also remarked on the dizzying spectacle of watching Republican kingmakers and money men beat a path to his door after his landslide re-election in 1998. 
 Mr. Bush, in other words, has had it pretty easy. So his crushing defeat to Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, after what many Republicans call a halfhearted campaign there, has led many political observers and Republican officials to wonder how much they really know about the level of determination, energy and humility that Mr. Bush can bring to this quest.
Can he reach down into his gut and find the passion, inspiration and invention that a pivotal juncture like this one requires? Can he regroup, retool, hone a message that apparently did not resonate and find a tone that is more commanding, and less merrily lackadaisical, than the one he has used so far?
"Those are very real questions rooted in the nature of how all of this came about," said Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University of Texas here. "The governor did not go out and build this possibility for himself in any kind of dogged, persistent way of Bill Clinton or Richard Nixon, two prototypes of people who decided they wanted to be president at the age of 4."
But the New Hampshire primary cast doubts on whether Mr. Bush -- or, for that matter, his advisers -- were fully prepared to capitalize on that chance. In the days leading up to the contest, Mr. Bush clung to a confidence about the outcome that proved entirely unwarranted, and he followed a schedule that was sometimes curiously undemanding.
He took midday breaks. He played in the snow for television cameras. And he gave the impression of being tired and homesick.
"They mailed in the campaign," marveled a Republican strategist in Washington. "They did an endorsement a day, and they went sledding."
Even one of Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledged: "I think he worked hard in New Hampshire, but I think they were all surprised by how hard he had to work. Until you do this, you don't get it."
Now more than ever, Mr. Bush has to fight. And the signals of whether he is up to the task -- indeed, whether he truly appreciates the need -- are contradictory and inconclusive.
His public manner since he left New Hampshire has been relentlessly upbeat. And even as polls showed that support in South Carolina was flagging, he arrived there with an arsenal of optimistic quips about shaking the snow off his suit, moving past a bump in the road and onto a smooth highway, forsaking an alien land for a patch of terra firma that was clearly "Bush country."
He chalked up New Hampshire as an aberration, and so, too, did some of his senior aides, almost all of whom have been with Mr. Bush for the last five years in Texas and know him as a charismatic, easygoing man who always rides high.
But Mr. Bush said in a private interview in Detroit today that anyone who mistook his jocularity and stubborn optimism for an inability to hunker down and fight was misreading him.
"Make no mistake about it," he said emphatically in the back hallway of a church where he was campaigning. "Not only do I want to win, I'm going to win. I want to win bad enough to win, and I'm going to win. You can mark it down in your book: on this day, I told you, looked you in the eye, and said I'm going to win the nomination, and I believe I'm going to win the presidency."
"You should not be lulled into a false sense about me, about my competitive nature and my desire to lead this country," he said.
There are external signs that Mr. Bush is heeding the lessons of New Hampshire. In the past two days, he has significantly ratcheted up his criticisms of Mr. McCain.
He began to question Mr. McCain's calls for more integrity in government, noting reports in newspapers that the Arizona senator sometimes received favors or campaign contributions from people who appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee, which Mr. McCain chairs.
He challenged Mr. McCain's claims that his proposal for tax cuts did not leave enough surplus money for Social Security, a charge he answered less aggressively in New Hampshire. The Bush campaign began running a television commercial in South Carolina tonight that belittled Mr. McCain's assertion, likened Mr. McCain to President Clinton and other Democrats and labeled Mr. Bush the true conservative.
"On taxes," the ad states, "McCain echoes Washington Democrats, when we need a conservative leader to challenge them."
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said more was in store. "I think you're going to see the fire in the governor's belly when he comes out on Monday," Mr. Fleischer said. "We are not going to let Senator McCain again engage in the type of misrepresentation of the governor's position he successfully engaged in in New Hampshire."
Mr. Bush also began rounding out the economic thrust of his oratory in New Hampshire with some of the broader themes he articulated all through the first phase of his campaign last year -- like the importance of personal responsibility and trying to diminish the number of children born out of wedlock and encouraging youths to stay off drugs.
But he still seems to be hanging much of his campaign on the promotion of a massive tax cut that polls suggest is not high on many voters' lists of priorities.
And even in the wake of New Hampshire, he continued the parade of endorsements that played directly into Mr. McCain's claim that what was happening in the Republican primary was a coronation, not an election. On Wednesday, in Greenville, S.C., Mr. Bush trotted out former Vice President Dan Quayle. The gesture left some political analysts scratching their heads.
Mr. Bush's friends and advisers say that none of this should be read as complacency. Moreover, it remains to be seen if Mr. Bush can harness and sustain the energy for what is shaping up to be a longer primary fight than anyone originally envisioned.
When Clay Johnson, Mr. Bush's Texas chief of staff and lifelong friend, praised Mr. Bush's discipline in an interview two months ago, the anecdote easily yielded to a different interpretation.
"He had two hard half-days," Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Bush's schedule as governor. He said Mr. Bush began at 8:30 a.m., ended around 5:30 p.m. and had 90 minutes to two hours of "personal time."
"It requires a lot of discipline not to get sucked into a lunch or a meeting or something," he said. "But it's an inviolate part of his routine, and so, be it a light lunch or exercise or whatever it is, he insists on getting that.
"It's very hard to do, as you can imagine. All my friends say it's impossible to exercise. I say, how can the governor carve the time out if you can't?"

HEADLINE: Austria Coalition Sworn In as Diplomatic Fallout Rises

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Feb. 4

 BODY:
President Thomas Klestil swore in a coalition government today that includes members of the anti-immigration Freedom Party. That prompted the United States to recall its ambassador "for consultations" and European governments to begin downgrading relations in protest.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said contacts with the Austrian government would be limited, adding that there should be no place in a European government for a party that "doesn't distance itself clearly from the atrocities of the Nazi era and the politics of hate." 
 The leader of the Freedom Party, Jorg Haider, has done just that in recent days, calling the Nazi regime barbaric and signing a document that commits the new government to work for an Austria free of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. But his volte-face after past expressions of sympathy for aspects of Hitler's rule has not convinced the West.
At a tense ceremony in the Hofburg Palace, the icy manner and averted gaze of Mr. Klestil conveyed all his personal distaste for the intermittently hate-mongering politics of Mr. Haider's far-rightist party as he took the oaths of office from the 12 cabinet ministers.
Thousands of demonstrators brandishing banners that denounced Mr. Haider as a fascist clashed with the police outside, obliging the ministers from the conservative People's Party and the Freedom Party to use a tunnel to cross under the square that separates the president's office from the chancellery.
The subterranean debut, and the clamor in the habitually sedate streets of the capital, seemed to sum up the looming isolation of the coalition and the abrupt disquiet of a country better known for consensus than conflict.
Israel immediately withdrew its ambassador. Germany and Finland said bilateral ministerial contacts had been frozen, and other European Union countries promised to follow suit, honoring a commitment made on Monday to shun ministerial-level contacts if Mr. Haider's party entered the government.
"We are filled with concern for Europe," Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany said, echoing the alarm of several European countries whose real fear is not immediate upheaval, but the prospect that the Austrian coalition could break the general consensus that the moderate right in Europe should not ally with the extreme right.
Such alliances in countries like Germany or France would have a shattering effect on the broad thrust of postwar politics, threatening further moves toward European integration. But for now those moves remain a remote possibility.
The new government here is headed by Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of the center-right People's Party. Mr. Schussel's decision to form a coalition's giving the sanction of high office to the Freedom Party brought three decades of Social Democratic-led government to an end and the wrath of the West down on Austria.
The formation of the government was the first stage in what could be a protracted battle between Austria and its 14 European Union partners, who have in effect committed themselves to undermining the coalition by isolating it.
"The European governments have placed themselves on a very high horse, from which it will not be easy to descend," said a British foreign policy expert, Jonathan Eyal. "Their unstated aim now seems to be to bring the Austria government down. But what if that merely makes Mr. Haider stronger?"
The long-term effect of the European action appears difficult to predict. The Austrian stock market fell 3 percent today, and rumors of canceled investments and a downgrade of the country's credit rating swirled here. It appears just possible that the economy could suffer to a point where the government becomes vulnerable.
Faced by a possibility of real damage to the country, Mr. Klestil made an extraordinary televised appeal today, several hours after swearing in the government. "The People's Party and the Freedom Party have a majority of seats in Parliament," he said, referring to the two parties' 104 seats in the 183-member chamber. "This must be respected in a democracy. Therefore, the intention of the two parties to form a coalition had to be accepted in a democratic state based on the rule of law.
"To the members of the federal government, I appeal to you to act in the spirit of European values and to work with all your strength so that Austria will find the kind of international acceptance and recognition it deserves."
The European Union took the past words of Mr. Haider as a legitimate basis to downgrade diplomatic relations, a step that the United States has not taken. Still, the Clinton administration's displeasure is clear enough. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the new government "might be a step back into a very dark past."
The past in question is the Third Reich, enthusiastically embraced by many Austrians in 1938 and occasionally defended by Mr. Haider in references to Hitler's labor policies and his Waffen SS.
Mr. Haider has since tried to take back those remarks and, in a declaration signed this week with Mr. Schussel, committed himself to "understanding for all human beings irrespective of their origin."
But in an interview today with German television, Mr. Haider appeared to cast scorn on the document. "It is an affront for the Austrian public that such matters of course have to be signed time and again," Mr. Haider said. "I have no intention of wandering around the world apologizing for all kinds of things."
Mr. Haider has chosen not to join the government and stay on as governor of the southern province of Carinthia. But there is little doubt that his influence will be strong.
Many Austrians, tired of the Social Democrats and worried by rising immigration, embraced his message, pushing his party's share of the vote from 5 percent in 1983 to 28 in elections in October.
Today, Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the People's Party, said she would tell the European Union that it had overreacted. "Jorg Haider has made mistakes," Ms. Ferrero-Waldner said. "But he has also distanced himself from his mistakes, and he is not in the government."

HEADLINE: Expansion Provided 387,000 New Jobs In U.S. Last Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Far from easing off as the American economic expansion was becoming the longest in history, the nation's employers added more jobs in January than in any other single month in more than two years -- drawing in people who had given up looking for work and easing the struggle of millions of workers to make ends meet.
The January increase of 387,000 new jobs was the biggest jump since September 1997, when employees of United Parcel Service, returning from a strike, swelled the count to 408,000, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The unemployment rate ticked down another notch, to 4 percent, the lowest level in exactly 30 years. It had been 4.1 percent since October. 
 Wall Street saw the January employment numbers as fresh evidence of a rising inflation rate, if not right away, then by early spring -- the concern being that a shortage of workers forces employers to pay higher wages and then to raise prices to cover the added labor costs.
"These latest numbers do not give any evidence of the slowdown in the economy that many of us had been expecting in the new year," said Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "The next set of inflation numbers may be low, but the forces we are seeing threaten to push inflation higher soon."
Reacting to the employment report, bond traders pushed up interest rates mildly out of concern that strong employment will eventually result in higher inflation unless the economy slows. In yesterday's action, they reversed course after having driven down long-term rates all week. Traders had been in turmoil over the Clinton administration's plan to shrink more quickly than expected the number of long-term bonds used to finance the national debt. That prospect had people rushing to buy the bonds while the supply lasted. The demand drove up prices of those bonds and drove down the interest rates that the Treasury must pay to get people to buy its bonds.
But while Wall Street saw inflation in the employment report, the Clinton administration saw stability and also the danger that rising rates -- pushed up too quickly by bond traders and the Federal Reserve -- could water down the economic boom in an election year. The Fed raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday by one-quarter of a percentage point and warned of "heightened inflation pressures in the near future."
Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman said in an interview yesterday, however, that the labor market, despite the low unemployment rate, was not inflationary.
"We cannot continue to have these quick reactions to the employment numbers; we have to take the long view," she said. "This is a strong economy that is in balance with a significant pool of people available to take on more work."
She argued that a fluke drove up job growth in January. Of the 387,000 jobs created last month, nearly half -- 169,000 -- were a result of an unusual spell of warm weather in mid-January, just when her department was taking its monthly job survey, she said. Construction jobs rose by 116,000 rather than a more normal 18,000 for January, and similar spikes occurred in industries related to construction -- landscape gardening, for example, and the manufacture of plywood and concrete.
Take away the 169,000 and job growth last month was only 218,000, Ms. Herman said. That is still too much for Wall Street economists. The economy can average a maximum of only 150,000 new jobs a month and still avoid an unacceptable rise in the inflation rate, said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc., a forecasting service in St. Louis.
Job growth averaged 234,000 a month last year, an unusually high level for an expansion that became 107 months old this week, the longest in history and one month older than the 1960's expansion.
If all these new jobs are inflationary, the evidence is missing from the Labor Department's wage data. The average hourly pay of the nation's nonsupervisory production workers -- about 90 million people in a work force of 130.3 million last month -- rose by 6 cents in January, to $13.50 an hour. That represents an annual rise of just 3.5 percent, down from an annualized increase of 3.7 percent last fall. Most other labor cost indexes are also rising mildly.
Whatever the inflationary effect of a booming job market, the monthly job reports, including the one in January, suggest that millions of Americans are finding it easier to make ends meet. The percentage of the work force holding two or more jobs, for example, fell to 5.7 percent last month from 6 percent in January of last year -- suggesting that more and more people now earn enough at one job to get by or get enough extra hours from their employer to avoid taking a second job, or both.
Then, too, the number of people stuck in part-time jobs because they cannot get full-time work is shrinking. So is the pool of people who say they would like to work but are not looking because they are discouraged or think they cannot find work or cannot arrange child care or transportation. Since they are not actively looking for work, they are not included in the labor force, even as unemployed.
But these are the people who are being drawn increasingly into jobs. Their numbers have dwindled steadily from 6.7 million in January 1994, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first started to track them, to 4.7 million in January 1999 and to 4.3 million last month, the bureau reported yesterday.
That leaves a pool of more than 10 million people still to draw from, including the 6 million who are listed as actively looking for work and therefore officially unemployed.
"An economy where jobs are looking for people as well as people looking for jobs is one of the best social programs we have," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said at a news conference yesterday.
The weather was not the only factor in driving up job creation last month. The Census Bureau added 11,000 people as it geared up for the 2000 census. After months of cutting back, manufacturers have begun to add people, including 13,000 last month. With oil prices rising, the petroleum industry is also adding people. Retailers added 43,000 people, which is unusual so soon after Christmas, although consumer spending continues to be robust.

Nasdaq Sets Record as Shift to Technology Accelerates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rounded out its best week in history with a record yesterday as investors moved money from industrial companies that may be hurt by rising interest rates to technology companies.
The Nasdaq composite index soared 33.16 points, or 0.79 percent, to 4,244.14, above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21. In percentage terms, the technology-dominated index rose 9.1 percent, its best weekly performance in history. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.64 points, or 0.45 percent, to 10,963.80, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.6 point, to 1,424.37.
"Money continues to shift from the real world to the virtual world," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York. "Money managers are going to the stocks that they know will perform."
Investors put money into shares of Nasdaq's largest stocks, including Apple Computer, Intel and Cisco Systems.
But smaller, younger companies that are just beginning to capitalize on the technology craze drew attention as well. Firepond, a maker of software that helps companies manage their electronic-commerce businesses, soared in its initial offering of stock.
"It takes a lot of equipment and labor to build the Internet, not just ideas," Mr. Bleier said. "The companies that are figuring out how to improve the Internet are going to do very well."
The broader market proved more vulnerable after the government delivered the latest indication that the economy is growing quickly enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its effort to keep inflation at bay.
The Labor Department said yesterday that employers added 387,000 jobs in January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since 1970. Still, some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4 percent, and investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent, to $13.50, in January, the fastest pace since September.
Despite the rise in wages, analysts said investors apparently had faith that the Federal Reserve was in control of inflation. On Wednesday, the Fed increased rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated that more increases might be on the way.
Vodafone AirTouch was an exception to the strength in technology shares, falling after the company sweetened its bid for the German wireless company Mannesmann. Mannesmann shareholders will vote by Feb. 17 on the Vodafone offer, which is valued at $183 billion.
Mattel shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange a day after its chief executive and chairwoman, Jill E. Barad, resigned. The toymaker reported a steep loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third time in the last four quarters.
 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
Treasuries Drop
Treasury bond prices were unable to shake off early heavy losses yesterday after surprisingly strong jobs data reawakened inflation fears and fueled profit taking after stellar gains a day earlier.
Dealers said the heavy drop showed a measure of normality had returned to bond markets after a week of huge price gains, particularly in the 30-year Treasury bond, set off by a government plan to buy back $30 billion of its debt and cut issuance.
"After a few days where it seemed the only thing the bond market was focused on was reduced supply and maybe scarcity, the bond market is reacting a little more normally to the flow of economic information," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond plunged 1 25/32, to 98 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.26 percent from 6.13 percent on Thursday.
The 10-year notes fell 18/32, to 96 9/32 with a yield of 6.53 percent. Five-year notes were off 16/32 at 96 29/32, yielding 6.64 percent. Two-year notes were down 6/32, to 99 17/32 to yield 6.63 percent.

HEADLINE: Panel Recommends Reparations In Long-Ignored Tulsa Race Riot

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla., Feb. 4

 BODY:
Nearly 80 years after this city erupted in what many historians regard as the nation's bloodiest race riot, a state commission today recommended reparations be made to the aged black survivors who watched as people were shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death.
The preliminary findings of the Tulsa Race Riot Commission are expected to provoke a contentious debate in the Oklahoma Legislature, which convenes on Monday. The Legislature created the commission more than two years ago to investigate a massacre long obscured in history. But the issue of reparations is controversial. Many lawmakers oppose any payments, and recent polls suggest that a majority of residents share that opinion. 
 A final decision on reparations may be many months away, at best, and the commission did not estimate their cost. The Legislature must first decide whether to extend the life of the commission, whose term expires on Monday even though it has not completed a final report. But the commission's 7-to-4 vote in favor of reparations was a firm statement that advocates hope will lend moral weight to helping the riot's survivors.
"The Legislature may not do what we think is the right thing," said Dr. Vivian N. Clark, a commission member. "But the world is looking at them, so whatever they do will reflect on the state of Oklahoma."
The riot occurred in 1921, and while 40 deaths have been documented, the commission's historian, Scott Ellsworth, has said that interviews and records indicate that the actual death toll could be as high as 300 people. In justifying reparations, the commission noted that the attack far surpassed the 1923 massacre in Rosewood, Fla., in which whites destroyed the small town and killed at least six black residents. In 1994, the Florida Legislature provided up to $2 million to compensate survivors. The commission also noted that Congress authorized $1 billion to revitalize south-central Los Angeles after the 1992 riots.
The workings of the Race Riot Commission have sparked a remarkable and often uncomfortable period of introspection in Oklahoma. For decades, the riots were never publicly discussed in Tulsa, nor mentioned in classrooms or textbooks. Many residents had no idea that whites burned the city's once-prosperous black community to the ground.
But the commission has collected thousands of documents, many found in attics or dusty file rooms. More than 1,000 elderly people have called with information, and investigators have found 80 survivors, many of them elderly and infirm. The commission's plans to excavate a section of a city cemetery in search of a mass grave of riot victims was postponed by Tulsa city officials last week because of bad weather and information that suggested they might be looking in the wrong place.
Two commission members, State Senator Robert V. Milacek and State Representative Abe Deutschendorf, voted against the reparations resolution because they did not think the wording should suggest that the state, unlike the city of Tulsa, bore any culpability for the massacre. Mr. Milacek said many lawmakers were likely to oppose reparations for fear that allowing them could establish a precedent for other communities to seek redress for past injustices.
"Where does it end?" asked Mr. Milacek, a Republican who said he had agonized over the issue and considered the riot a blight on the state.
Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, has endorsed direct reparations to survivors but expressed skepticism about broader payments. In today's meeting, the commission recommended, among other things, direct payments to survivors and descendants of those killed, scholarships for students in the Greenwood district where the riot occurred, the creation of an economic empowerment zone and a monument memorializing the event.
Last November, a subcommittee of the Race Riot Commission recommended that $33 million be paid in reparations, an amount that stunned the public. But today, the commission intentionally did not recommend a dollar amount, deferring that responsibility to lawmakers. But the preliminary report that will be presented next week does mention a figure, $12 million.
State Representative Don Ross, a Democrat who represents the Greenwood neighborhood, said he did not want the Legislature to consider voting on reparations until a final report was drafted. Mr. Ross plans to introduce a bill next week to reauthorize the commission, and he said a final report would better establish the historical record and more firmly determine culpability.
"I can't help but believe that if a compelling document is delivered that the attitude of the Legislature will change," Mr. Ross said.
"There is no statute of limitations on a moral obligation," he added.
Alfred L. Brophy, an Oklahoma City University law professor who researched the issue for the commission, said there was compelling legal and moral justification for reparations, even though the historical record was incomplete. He said preliminary research indicated that city officials not only failed to protect the lives of black residents but also contributed to the riot by deputizing many members of the white mob that attacked Greenwood. He also noted that promises to rebuild Greenwood were never fulfilled.
The commission was created in 1997 by a law written by Mr. Ross, for whom the attack has been a defining crusade. The commission is led by Bob L. Blackburn, the chairman of the state historical society, and includes lawmakers, historians and at least one survivor of the riots.
Mr. Ross learned about the riot when a teacher mentioned it to him as a young boy. He was infuriated and incredulous at the story. In segregated Tulsa, the Greenwood community once had been a thriving black business and residential district. It was home to 15,000 people and 191 businesses.
On the morning of May 30, 1921, a black shoe-shiner named Dick Rowland and a white elevator operator named Sarah Page had an encounter inside an elevator at the Drexel Building on Main Street. Exactly what happened is not known, though the commission suggested that Mr. Rowland may have accidentally brushed against Ms. Page. But a scream was heard, and Mr. Rowland was eventually arrested on a rape charge. He was released when Ms. Page refused to press charges.
But the fuse for the riot had been lighted. A white-owned newspaper, The Tulsa Tribune, published an article with the headline, "To Lynch Negro Tonight." On May 31, an armed white mob arrived at the courthouse to carry out the lynching. They were met by blacks who had arrived to protect Mr. Rowland, and a gunfight claimed several lives.
The fight moved across the railroad tracks into Greenwood after the Tulsa police deputized a large number of whites, many of whom were members of the Ku Klux Klan.
The commission's final report is expected to detail what happened, but this much is known: whites set fire to buildings and homes, ultimately looting and burning more than 1,200 structures. Klansmen reportedly raged through the streets shooting people. Survivors told of corpses stacked onto wagons and trucks.
In the years that followed, the promised rebuilding of Greenwood never happened. Instead, insurance companies refused to pay fire policies, citing special riot exemptions. Whites ultimately took over much of the land. Today, Greenwood is the site of the Oklahoma State University at Tulsa campus, where the commission held its meeting.
In the audience, a few survivors had come for the vote.
Annie Beaird, 86, recalled the sounds of bullets and the sight of black men rushing to defend their neighborhood. Ms. Beaird, who breathed through an oxygen tube and was in a wheelchair, said reparations are appropriate since her family's four-room house was destroyed.
"I think they should give us something," she said. "We lost everything we had."

 BODY:

ON MY COUNTRY
 AND THE WORLD
 By Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Translated by George Shriver.
 300 pp. New York:
 Columbia University Press. $29.95. 
 In the best ironic tradition of Russian literature, Boris Yeltsin resigned on the final day of 1999 -- eight years to the day after he had forced Mikhail Gorbachev to pack his bags. As Gorbachev watched his old rival on television, he could be excused if he took pleasure in hearing Yeltsin admit that the transformation of Russia had been a tougher job than he had imagined.
Although written before Yeltsin's departure, Gorbachev's latest book, "On My Country and the World," might just as easily have been titled "I Told You So." The volume aims to browbeat Yeltsin, burnish Gorbachev's reputation and that of the Soviet Union in world history, cadge some honor and influence from Russians (who gave him just a handful of votes when he ran for president in 1996) and cinch for himself the role that he dreams of as a kind of worldly political-economic philosopher and scold.
Gorbachev's chapter titles have the ring of Pravda or Izvestia headlines during the palmy days of the Evil Empire: "Was Socialism Built in the Soviet Union?," "Let's Not Oversimplify! A Balance Sheet of the Soviet Years," "The Coup: A Stab in the Back -- and the Intrigues of Yeltsin." Gorbachev vents his irritation that after being thrown onto the ash heap of history, the Soviet Union is shockingly underappreciated. Attention must be paid to its "astonishingly great" social, cultural and economic achievements.
Although politically the Soviet Union "kept retreating further and further from the original ideals" of the Bolshevik revolution, Gorbachev writes, "the system that was called Socialist gave people (at least the majority of working people) a minimal income necessary for life and confidence in the future, which working people in the West as a rule do not know." Soviet shortcomings, he says, must not be allowed to discredit Socialism: "The Socialist idea is inextinguishable."
Meditating on his career, Gorbachev considers the breakup of the Soviet Union a "tragedy," without which "the world today would be living more peacefully." His "greatest sorrow and misfortune" is "that I did not succeed in preserving the country as a single whole." Calling for a new confederation of three Slavic republics and Kazakhstan, he writes: "The Union could have been preserved. A new Union can be created."
Gorbachev's nostalgia extends even to the Soviet Communist Party. Shirking credit that is deservedly his for compelling old comrades to bow to reform, he insists that it was the party that provided the "initiative" for his political and economic improvisations.
As in earlier books, Gorbachev defends himself against hoary criticism from the Russian right and left, for surrendering the Soviet empire and extending the Afghanistan war for four years. He blames the frustrations of his perestroika program on political foes who "simply began to sabotage change" and the fact that economic progress lagged so far behind political reform. He justifiably claims credit for laying the groundwork for "normal, democratic and peaceful development of our country."
The only real electricity in this book flows out of Gorbachev's indignation at Yeltsin. This is so deeply felt that while recounting for the umpteenth time in print or spoken word the August 1991 hard-line coup against him, Gorbachev goes so far as to deny Yeltsin serious credit for thwarting the putsch when he famously stood atop a tank and demanded Gorbachev's return to authority. Like a long-defeated pol tugging the visitor's sleeve to bloviate once again about how he was robbed at the polls, the author treats us to yet another heated account of Yeltsin's "double game" in late 1991, when he "sacrificed" the Soviet Union "to his passionate desire to accede to the throne in the Kremlin."
For Gorbachev, the significance of Yeltsin's reign is that "the historical achievements of the Soviet period" were eroded: "Everywhere in the 'post-Soviet space' the economy and culture have declined, and a majority of the population has fallen into poverty. . . . Weakened by economic uncertainty and political instability, Russia has lost many of the previous positions it held in the international arena. Fewer and fewer people take Russia's opinion into account."
These days, Gorbachev does not seem to care much more for the United States than he does for Yeltsin. In language whose echo of the Yippie chant in Chicago in 1968 is probably accidental, he rants that "the whole world is watching as Washington attempts to impose on others its model of how to approach major political, economic and social problems." He warns against "the United States' declared intention to assert American leadership over the whole world." Western democracy, he says, is "not well: it is in a crisis. Democratic institutions persist, but the citizenry seem more and more alienated from those institutions." Like a schoolboy firing a spitball, he says that it is the Western countries that need, "if I may say so, a democratization."
Somewhere amid all of this the author splices in what amounts to an advertisement for the Gorbachev Foundation, which, he explains, "works together with others in the world community who are ready to participate in the search for a way to a better future." Throwing modesty out the window, he goes on: "Is a movement toward a new civilization realistic? I think the lessons of history -- above all, the history of the perestroika era, which was, if I may say so, a practical test of humanist approaches to the transformation of society -- allow us to give a positive answer to this question."
He recommends that the United Nations establish a "permanent worldwide brain trust" consisting of "people having no government duties and who are free of any ideological or other preconceptions or prejudices." In case some dimwitted reader of this book fails to grasp just whom Gorbachev has in mind, the 1990 Nobel laureate goes on, "The experience and authority of Nobel prize winners could be utilized in this connection."
Mikhail Gorbachev had a crucial role in one of the great changes of world history -- the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. As the last leader of the Soviet Union, he demonstrated amazing political courage and desire to do good. His historical reputation, which deserves to be formidable, is unlikely to be diminished by the vanity, political posturing and sheer pettiness displayed in this book.

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
In Alex McKnight's rugged neck of the woods -- a town called Paradise, right across from Canada, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula -- anything under a foot of snow is just "scattered flurries," and any fistfight that doesn't require skin grafts qualifies as civilized discourse. A former Detroit cop and failed private eye who drew first blood in Steve Hamilton's strong debut mystery, "A Cold Day in Paradise," Alex returns in WINTER OF THE WOLF MOON (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95) to duke it out with a roughneck team of hockey players whose postgame rituals extend to dealing drugs and beating up Indians. 
 When an Ojibwa woman comes to Alex with a face full of bruises (and a bag full of dope) that she got from one of these guys, he offers her asylum in a cabin that he rents out to snowmobilers. But her subsequent kidnapping sends him back out into the snow for a series of brutal encounters with amateur thugs, professional killers, dumb racists and even a few lawmen who don't respect boundaries. It's a cold, cruel world up here. ("Once you freeze all the way through to your soul," Alex is advised, "you will never feel warm again.") But Hamilton understands the border mentality, and his tensile prose -- with its shifting images of heat and cold, light and dark -- reflects the dramatic, often violent contradictions of people who live on the edge of the world.
Munch Mancini has cleaned up her act since she showed up for work, stoned and drunk, as the offbeat sleuth in Barbara Seranella's down-and-dirty first novel, "No Human Involved." UNWANTED COMPANY (HarperCollins, $24) finds the former biker babe (and odd-job hooker) clean and sober and working as an auto mechanic in Los Angeles. On the side, she also operates a limo service, a one-Cadillac fleet that attracts more hubcap thieves than prom bookings and exposes her to clients like Raleigh Ward, a State Department flunky who panders to the unethical, even criminal whims of his diplomatic charges.
Although the heroine's moral reclamation lowers the stakes, Seranella shrewdly introduces an ex-con named Ellen, a wig-wearing, trash-talking, risk-taking friend from the bad old days, to juice the action. ("Was it just a coincidence that she had come back and craziness had followed?") Untethered by conscience or common sense, flaky Ellen chauffeurs Ward and his current charge, a sadistic bureaucrat (and possible serial killer) attached to Romania's 1984 Olympic gymnastics team, to Tijuana for a little fun and games and murder. The ensuing mayhem would be hilarious if it weren't so creepy and scary -- a combination of emotions that Seranella handles with the same kind of no-sweat skill that Munch applies to her automotive repairs.
In detective stories, as in life, one revisits the past at one's peril. Try telling that to Gerry Boyle's normally clearheaded sleuth, Jack McMorrow, a former reporter for The New York Times who has to learn his lesson the hard way in COVER STORY (Berkley Prime Crime, $22.95). After years of lying low in Maine, Jack returns to New York -- just long enough, he thinks, to pick up some stringer assignments from The Times and have a drink with an old crony. But his pals at the paper treat him like a bumpkin, and his friend, a burned-out homicide cop named Butch Casey, hits him with a weird conspiracy theory involving the mayor's office in the corruption of the criminal justice system. All in all, it's not an ideal homecoming. It gets worse, though, when Butch is arrested for assassinating the mayor in the men's room of the Algonquin Hotel and Jack is hounded by the police and the press as an accomplice.
Boyle's incisive coverage of the public hysteria bristles with contempt. "The block around the Criminal Courts Building looked like Tower Hill on execution day," he observes of Butch's arraignment. But his fugitive hero is so busy hiding out from the mobs that he does a shoddy job of investigating Butch's political grievances. His sharp interview technique suffers badly, and some editor should tip him off that biting his nails and making anxious telephone calls do not constitute live action.
The boys have recovered from "the big war" in Ed Gorman's WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE (Carroll & Graf, $22.95). The '53 recession is history, there's a bumper crop in the fields and just about everyone in Black River Falls, Iowa, has turned out for the 1957 Edsel Day festivities at Keys Ford-Lincoln. Gorman's sweetly nostalgic mystery, set in a small-town America that surely never was, continues the education of its narrator, a young legal investigator named Sam McCain, who yearns to restore the lost innocence of a nation by stopping time at some "perfect" year like 1952, when he graduated from high school. But for all McCain's rhapsodic invocations of early rock 'n' roll and hayrides under a harvest moon, reality intrudes. The Edsel is a bust. There's a dead body in the trunk of a display model. And someone in his beloved hometown is a killer. Although McCain's persistent navete verges on stupidity, his zeal to cleanse Black River Falls of evil makes him the kind of hero any small town could take to its heart.
As a way of announcing the truth-telling theme of his new crime novel, George P. Pelecanos opens SHAME THE DEVIL (Little, Brown, $24.95) with a stylishly choreographed but extremely raw scene of urban violence -- a 1995 robbery in a Washington pizza parlor that leaves five people dead, including one of the gunmen and a little boy who just happened to get in the way. Even harder to take are the scenes that occur three years later, in the pathetic support group of family survivors who meet each week to share the never-ending pain of loss and, in a cruel but suspenseful plot turn, to protect themselves from the killers, who are back for vengeance. Pelecanos is one of those dangerous writers who aren't afraid to take risks, so there's a merciless reality to his characters and a cold clarity about the way they talk, think and feel. Whatever their flaws, none of the people in this writer's world are ashamed to tell the truth.

CAPITALISM RUSSIAN-STYLE
 By Thane Gustafson.
 Cambridge University,
 cloth, $54.95; paper, $19.95. 
 For decades, Russia has been a screen on which American paranoia, fears and dreams have been projected: the Red scare, cold war skulduggery, nuclear nightmares and, for the last several years, free-market fantasies. Russia's experiment with capitalism came to an abrupt and ugly halt in the summer of 1998, when its currency cratered and its economy collapsed. Today, amid various corruption scandals and an uncertain political landscape, there is vigorous debate about whether Russia's economy is on the rebound. This argument is not merely academic nor is it the stuff of boring economics texts; the stability of a vibrant, captivating country still chock-full of nuclear weapons depends on its economic recovery. So for anyone interested in an engaging, sweeping tour of the Russian economy in the 1990's and a framework for understanding the complicated financial and political dynamics at work in Russia, Thane Gustafson's "Capitalism Russian-Style" is a superb guide. Gustafson, a professor of government at Georgetown University, tackles his subject with authority and grace, offering bounteous facts and anecdotes that never drag down his narrative or his argument. While clearly taking financiers and public officials in Russia and the West to task for the failed economic policies of the 1990's, Gustafson is optimistic about Russia's future. "Russia today has sunk to a level of weakness not seen since the early 1920's, when the country lay prostrate after a decade of war, revolution and civil war," Gustafson writes. But, he notes, "the tide of change in Russia is not spent; indeed it is still building." Timothy L. O'Brien

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Australia Highlights Aboriginal Tourism

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
MORE than a half-century ago the Australian Unesco Committee for Museums put together a traveling exhibition of the country's Aboriginal culture, which toured the United States and Canada. The accompanying catalog extolled the rich heritage of the Aborigines, the indigenous people who came to Australia more than 30,000 years ago, and it concluded with the hope that the exhibit would "engender a curiosity about Aboriginal life."
That curiosity took a long time to awaken, but a growing recent interest in other cultures is beginning to pay off for Australia's Aborigines. The most recent figures from the Australian Tourist Commission show that in 1997 the 200 tourism businesses operated by Aborigines generated $20 million a year, while the sale of indigenous arts and crafts brought in another $130 million. 
 While small compared with overall tourist revenues in Australia, about $10 billion, it is a start for a people who number only about 400,000, or just over 2 percent of Australia's population of almost 19 million. And it is all the more impressive in that most Aboriginal villages, cultural centers and tour operations are far from big cities and their amenities.
Yet Aboriginal tourism has stirred some resentment against tourists -- particularly for what the Aboriginal people regard as tourists' cultural insensitivity and their failure to respect mores and traditions. Perhaps the best known example is that of the visitors who climb Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock), even though they are asked at the cultural center at the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park not to do so.
For related reasons, in 1998 the Queensland government issued a code of conduct with suggestions such as these: That visitors learn a few words of the Aboriginal language, and be aware that avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect. But with many more visitors expected this year for the Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, and with almost 5 million projected in 2001 (compared with 4.2 million visitors in 1998), the chance to satisfy that "curiosity about Aboriginal life" is greater than ever -- and so is the likelihood of offending Aborigines.
Therefore the Australian Tourist Commission is drawing up another -- and presumably more detailed -- code of conduct for visitors, to be issued within a few months. It will counsel them to respect Aboriginal sacred sites, ceremonies and traditions. In the United States, some Indian tribes have also adopted codes of conduct for visitors.
The Australian government wants Aboriginal tourism to succeed for several reasons. Some of them were detailed in a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra three months ago by John Morse, managing director of the tourist commission. Describing Aboriginal tourism as a "win, win, win" situation, he said it can help Aborigines achieve economic independence and help the wider Australian population "discover more of this rich and diverse culture." And it can appeal to "people in countries around the world, over 80 percent of whom want to experience culture in some form or another." And, of course, it adds to the national treasury.
In his speech, Mr. Morse mentioned two particularly successful examples of Aboriginal tourism. The Aboriginal Cultural Park in Cairns, created by the Tjapukai people, last year won the Gold Award for Culture, given by the Pacific Asia Travel Association. With five theaters, an art gallery, a museum and a cultural show, the park -- in the city that is a tropical gateway to the Great Barrier Reef -- is already a major tourist attraction. And there is the Sydney Aboriginal Discovery Tour, whose Aboriginal owner, Margaret Muragun Campbell, has arranged tours for some 10,000 visitors not only to the landmark Sydney Opera House and the city's harbor, but also to the outback and Aboriginal communities.
There are many other examples of successful Aboriginal tourism, as well as a popular tourist site partly on Aborigine land -- Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, 100 miles southeast of Darwin. It is a trove of archaeological treasures that is on Unesco's World Heritage list; its 8,000 square miles include hundreds of plant and bird species and more than 5,000 rock-art sites, most of them consisting of paintings but some with engravings or designs in wax. Yet while Aborigines have lived in Kakadu for at least 25,000 years, it is not technically an Aboriginal park, since the native people leased their half of the land within the park to the government about 20 years ago. In return, they own concessions in the park and participate in its planning, management and conservation.
Other Aboriginal tourism operations include Native Guide Safari Tours in Mossman, Queensland. Founded by Hazel Douglas, it operates a variety of tours including visits to the Daintree rain forest, a World Heritage site, and catamaran cruises off the beaches of Cairns. Harry Nanya Tours in Wentworth, 60 miles from Sydney, also specializes in tours conducted by Aboriginal guides. And in Alice Springs, in the Red Center desert of central Australia, a Southern Arrernte Aboriginal tribal group owns and operates the Aboriginal Art and Cultural Center, which sells art, crafts, books, CD's, tapes and didgeridoos, the haunting Aboriginal wooden wind instruments. Its Web site, aboriginalart.com.au, sells these items, too -- and if a didgeridoo strikes a browser's fancy, the site also offers lessons in how to play it.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.;
On the River, 38 Minutes From Midtown

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK

 BODY:
IN 1896, the grandparents of Nancy Delmerico Vitagliano, a freelance graphics designer, emigrated from Zungoli, a small town in Italy, to the hilly Westchester village of Dobbs Ferry, where Ms. Vitagliano's father was born and lived all his life.
So when she married Donald Vitagliano, a construction inspector at United Water in New Rochelle, N.Y., who lived here, they, too, followed her family's tradition and remained in Dobbs Ferry. 
 "I'm always telling my 10-year-old son, Willie, stories of what it used to be like here," she said. "It was a small town where everybody knew one another and walked downtown on Saturdays to the five-and-dime, ice cream parlor or drugstore for egg creams. It was always very nice and quiet. It's still a great place for a child to grow up. That's why we stayed here -- for Willie."
She added that she and her husband "love the village's wide economic and ethnic demographics."
Charles Baiano, 78, another native of the community, said: "You're 45 minutes from New York City and one hour to any airport. I can walk to almost any place in the village without any problem and we have a beautiful waterfront park on the Hudson."
Mayor Brian Monahan called his village "a small-town commuter haven where people really get to know and care about one another."
The village has always had a strong downtown, said Celeste Meneses, president of the Dobbs Ferry Chamber of Commerce. And with the recent opening of 11 art galleries, she added, "it's even stronger now." Its diversity, she said, is enhanced by the village's variety of ethnic restaurants, ranging from Asian, Italian and Greek to Cajun. For upscale dining, there's the Chart House on the Hudson River, with a Continental menu.
Barbara Dannenbring, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Ye Village, said the community's location, variety of housing styles and prices and "small-town authenticity" strengthened sales.
"You can drive down the street and see old barns and the Zion Episcopal Church where Washington Irving first worshiped and take in the romance of the Hudson River," she said. "Though we're a small town and have never had all that much inventory, it's going fast and for more than expected. A home that sold in 1995 for $458,000 resold for $540,000 in 1998 with no work having been done to it."
Village taxes are high -- $115.40 per $1,000 of assessed value -- because there is a lot of tax-exempt land, including the 68-acre, 3,559-student main campus of Mercy College; the 90-acre, 400-student private Masters School and the 150-acre Children's Village, for troubled boys. But that fact has not affected sales, said Mrs. Dannenbring.
Two- to three-bedroom, 1,400 square-foot colonials, Cape Cods and small ranches on .10-acre lots range from $200,000 to $300,000. Colonials, split-levels and small Tudors with three bedrooms and two baths range from $300,000 to $350,000. Larger homes on up to a third of an acre in the village range from $350,000 to $400,000, said Mrs. Dannenbring.
Three- and four-bedroom, 2,000 square-foot homes with Hudson River views are available for $400,000 to $800,000, she said. Buyers can also find large, older homes dating from the turn of the century in this price range.
There are also 266 co-op units in three complexes. A two-bedroom unit ranges in price from $80,000 at the Beacon Hill garden apartment complex, which has a pool, to $139,000 at the mid-rise Draper Lane, said Lisa Omboni, owner of Main Source Realty.
In addition, there are 126 condominium units in four complexes. Two-bedroom units are priced from $147,000 for a simplex with 1,200 square feet of space at Village Green, which has a pool, to $539,000 for 3,000 square feet in a town house at Wit's End, which has master-bedroom suites and fireplaces, said Ms. Omboni.
TWO more complexes are under construction. One is the 24-unit Livingston Ridge overlooking the Hudson, where a two-bedroom ranges from $619,000 to more than $1 million for 2,870 to 3,680 square feet, said Mrs. Dannenbring. The other is the Landing, with 104 town houses being built on 45 acres of land on the Hudson split by Wicker's Creek, where during excavation artifacts of the village's earliest Indian inhabitants were unearthed. The two- to three-bedroom homes, ranging from 1,800 to 2,400 square feet, will be completed next year, and range in price from $400,000 to $700,000.
Many residents oppose the Landing because it blocks river access, said Mayor Monahan. "We're doing everything we can to lessen the impact on the community," he said. "We've approved a conservation easement from the developer to allow residents to walk to the river."
Demand for rentals outstrips supply, said Ms. Ombini. 'As soon as we get the listings they're gone because young singles and married couples are either trying out the area for a year, or couldn't otherwise afford a home here," she said. A two-bedroom apartment ranges from $1,200 in the garden-style Osborne Manor to $1,300 in the 36-family Broadway Arms. Rentals are also available at several of the village's two- and three-family homes, as well as its co-ops and condominiums.
Ellyn Leverone, a travel agent, moved to Dobbs Ferry from the Park Slope section of Brooklyn in 1995 with her husband, Robert, a television producer at CBS Market Watch, and their two children. She said they were looking for not only "a heterogeneous community with more of an outdoor lifestyle, but one with a small school system that I could become actively involved in."
She is now active in the Parent Teacher Student Association and teaches an after-school cooking class.
"The school is the focal point of the community and the community is the focal point of the school," said Dr. Richard Woolley, interim superintendent of the 1,390-student Dobbs Ferry Union Free School District. And, he added, the district -- which has a k-4 elementary school and middle and high schools -- has "a high emphasis on academic achievement."
"For select, high-achieving children in the middle and high school, we offer the International Baccalaureate Program, a very intensive, challenging and high level academic curriculum," said Dr. Woolley. In addition, he said, the district has eight advanced placement courses.
"But we also see to it that no child in this district falls through the cracks," Dr. Woolley said. "We have a specialized program that gives about 15 to 20 children extensive help in handling the curriculum. These youngsters are given extensive study skills and other assistance with their academic work."
Last year, students scored 567 in verbal and 584 in math on the College Boards, compared with state averages of 495 and 504, respectively. Among the 70 graduating seniors last year, all but four went on to higher education.
Ten percent of the students in the district attend private or parochial schools, including two in the village -- the private co-ed Masters School for grades 5 to 12 and Our Lady of Victory Academy, a girls' high school operated by the Sisters of Mercy. Annual tuition at Masters is $15,300 for the middle school and $16,750 for the upper school. The upper school charges an additional $8,000 for boarding. Tuition at the Academy is $4,350.
FOR recreation and nature walks, there is the 70-acre Juhring Estate nature preserve; the 8-acre Gould Park, with ballfields and a pool, and the 3.5-acre Memorial Park, where residents can play basketball, bocce and baseball. The Embassy Community Center, which opened last year, offers programs for all ages.
But the jewel of the village's recreational facilities is the 8.5-acre Waterfront Park on the Hudson, according to Mayor Monahan. "We have one of the most attractive Hudson River waterfronts anywhere," he said. "One of our goals is revitalization and expansion of our waterfront." It was in the waters around the Waterfront Park that the Weckquaesgeek Indians, who lived at the mouth of a stream they called the Wysquaqua (now known as Wicker's Creek), spotted Henry Hudson's Half Moon gliding by in 1609. Hudson's first mate, Robert Juet, entered "very high land" in the ship's log to describe the area's topography. Around 1730, William Dobbs began operating a ferry at Willow's Point in what was known as Wysquaqua to carry passengers and supplies to Sneden's Landing in Rockland County. The village was incorporated as Dobbs Ferry in 1873.
During the Revolution, George Washington established a redoubt on the site that overlooks the Waterfront Park. After the war, Dobbs Ferry began to grow as an agricultural community and sloops transported passengers and goods to New York City.
The arrival of the New York and Hudson River Railroad in Dobbs Ferry in 1849 heralded a new era for the village as businessmen bought up property and built estates.
At the end of the 19th century, immigrants, mostly from Italy and Ireland, came to the village to work on the estates, or in local businesses and factories. Today, the 180,000 square-foot office complex that was once the site of the Hudson River Brewing Company has about 85 tenants, including a bagpipe maker, the Cartoon Bank, an Internet archive of cartoons from The New Yorker, and artists, writers and musicians.
If there's any downside to Dobbs Ferry, said Mr. Monahan, whose family first came to the village in 1880, it's the ongoing traffic problem.
"Dobbs Ferry is an older community that wasn't built on the notion that every family would have three cars," he said.

A MONUMENTAL MISTAKE?: In 1874, an eight-foot granite monument was erected on South Broadway by the Sons of the American Revolution to mark the site of what was believed to be George Washington's headquarters when he planned what became known as the Battle of Yorktown. Robert Stackpole, president of the New York chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, said that was the belief at the time. When evidence to the contrary was uncovered in 1895, nothing was done to change the inscription because there were no letters of protest, he said. Now, he said, with an interest in promoting tourism the inscription will be revised, perhaps to reflect that Dobbs Ferry was the western redoubt of the Continental Army's encampment.

HEADLINE: Ha Jin's Cultural Revolution

BYLINE: By Dwight Garner; Dwight Garner is an editor for The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
On a bright fall morning in 1985, xuefei jin walked out of Logan airport in Boston and took his first real gulp of American air. It almost sent him to his knees. "There is a unique American smell that hits you when you arrive here," he says. "It is very sweet, like chemicals or a kind of perfume. It makes you sick for a while." Jin had flown from Beijing, a student visa stuffed into his pocket, to study American literature at Brandeis University. "I know people who came here from Asia and vomited for days. They couldn't even brush their teeth because the water smelled so different."
Xuefei (pronounced shu-FAY) Jin, who writes under the pen name Ha Jin, is a courtly and soft-spoken man who punctuates stories like this one with a quick, apologetic laugh -- a laugh that says, "How silly this must all sound." He employs it often when talking about his early years in America, while recalling, for example, the menial jobs he took to pay the rent -- busing tables at a Friendly's restaurant, cleaning houses, working as a night watchman at a chemical factory -- or remembering why he initially thought all Americans must be rich. ("There were so many squirrels, and no one was trying to eat them.") It's a laugh that pops up everywhere, vanishing only when he talks about his decision, in the days following the Tiananmen Square massacre, in 1989, not to return to his native country. Or when he recalls the difficult months he spent trying to get permission from the Chinese government so that his wife, Lisha Bian, and later his young son, Wen, could join him in America. 
 Jin's laugh is abundantly in evidence on the windy December afternoon he takes me on an impromptu driving tour of Emory University in Atlanta, where he has taught since 1993. It's a bumpy ride in his small Chevrolet; every so often, Jin brakes suddenly, as if he has gotten lost in his own backyard. His driving skills are almost as shaky as his command of spoken English -- his Mandarin accent, with its hard "r" sound, remains strong. "It is very easy to lose your way in Atlanta," he says. "So many street names begin with the word 'peach."' He rolls down the window to look around, and he sucks down another deep lungful of American air. "I am very grateful for fall and winter," he says. "The rest of the year, Atlanta is pollen central."
Jin has more or less adjusted to America's complicated oxygen supply. But watching him grapple with the intricacies of its spoken language -- he often drops his articles, and an excruciatingly exact rendering of the quotation above would be, "Rest of year, Atlanta pollen central" -- is an experience that will startle anyone who first encountered his voice through his fiction. On the page, Jin has the kind of effortless command that most writers can only dream about. His first novel, "Waiting," the story of a Chinese doctor who wants to end his arranged marriage so he can marry a more modern woman, recently won a National Book Award, a mere 11 years after Jin began writing seriously in English. In the 50-year history of the awards, only two other writers who weren't native English speakers have taken home the fiction prize: Isaac Bashevis Singer and Jerzy Kosinski.
"Waiting" begins with the kind of economical but perfectly turned sentence that abounds in Jin's work -- Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu" -- and it casts a spell that doesn't break once over the course of the book's 308 pages. Set in northern China in the 1980's and based on a true story, the novel is a delicate portrait of a decent but oddly passionless man. It is also about a love triangle in which there's little genuine love to be found.
Like all of Jin's work, "Waiting" has the stripped-down simplicity of a fable. The novel's protagonist, Lin Kong, is an urban doctor who left behind in the countryside the woman his family chose for him to marry -- a loyal wife whose Old World servility and bound feet embarrass him. Because he can't work up the nerve to force her to grant him a divorce, and because adultery is punished severely by the Communist Party, he is forced to wait 18 embittering years before he can be with the clever, educated nurse he thinks he loves. During those years he lives "like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed by others' opinions." Worse, he comes to realize he may have been waiting for the wrong woman.
"Waiting" is set just after the end of the Cultural Revolution, and Jin forcefully evokes a world in which both petty rules and local gossips could ruin a life in an instant. It's a world he remembers all too well. "In China there was no privacy," the 43-year-old writer says. "Your banker would tell your neighbors how much money you had in your bank account! It was something you didn't even question."
These kinds of memories remain vivid for Jin, which helps explain why none of his fiction is set in America, even though all of it has been written since his arrival here in 1985. (In addition to "Waiting," he has published a novella, two short-story collections and two volumes of poetry.) Unlike almost every other Asian-American novelist who has attracted notice in the United States -- Gish Jen, Amy Tan and Chang-rae Lee, to name but a few -- Jin steers clear of the bumpy politics of assimilation.
The exoticism of his northern Chinese locales separates him from these writers, but so does the almost classical rigor of his storytelling. If the lucidity and focus of "Waiting" puts you in mind of Russian masters like Gogol and Chekhov, that's no accident. Jin reads and rereads these writers, he says, to remind him of what fiction is supposed to be. "You read so many novels these days by young writers and they feel so ephemeral," he says. "They are full of references to TV shows and movies. What's important is to get human feeling onto paper. That's what is timeless, and that's what you get from Tolstoy and from Gogol and from Chekhov."
In a funny way, says the Chinese-American novelist Gish Jen, the timeless quality of Jin's writing may be among the few really new things happening in American fiction right now. "The whole idea of looking to masters instead of overturning something is very Chinese," she says. "On some level, Ha Jin has chosen mastery over genius. It's as if he said, 'I am going to make something like that.' This never happens with American writers. We are too beset with the anxiety of influence. What he's doing is very challenging, and I am interested to see how the American literati pick it up and deal with it."
The glamorous world of the literati is something Jin himself knows little about. He is a small, somewhat awkward man who can appear to be here but not here in America, and that's not just because he gets lost easily or still struggles with spoken English. Jin has almost zero affinity for American popular culture -- he can't remember the last movie he saw, and his TV knowledge is limited to unhip shows like "Walker, Texas Ranger." In many ways, he resembles the brilliant but slightly bumbling foreign academic in one of his own favorite novels, Vladimir Nabokov's "Pnin."
Jin's monkishness becomes apparent the moment you step into his house, a small brick ranch in a drab suburb northeast of Atlanta. The faux-wood-paneled living room is decorated in a style that might best be described as Grad School Provisional. Besides books in English and Chinese, there are a couple of inexpensive vinyl-covered couches, and, most notably, there is a Ping-Pong table that takes up half the room. ("My wife always beats me," Jin says.) Yet he plays only rarely, he confesses. Often he works so late that he ends up sleeping in his office -- in a small bed placed near his computer.
As Xuefei Jin picks at the platters of food that have been spread across the living-room coffee table -- there are oranges, cookies and plastic jugs of Gatorade and apple juice -- he tells me he's not sure what surprises him more: that he has become a writer, or that he has made a life for his family in America. "It wasn't supposed to work out this way," he says. "This is not where I thought I would be."
When Jin arrived at Brandeis in 1985, he not only didn't plan on becoming a writer, he also didn't plan on staying in the United States. "I just wanted to get my Ph.D. so I could get a good teaching job when I went back," he says. To ensure that Jin would indeed return, the Chinese government made him leave his wife and young son behind. "My first years here were very exciting but very lonely," he says. "My wife and I wrote many, many letters."
Jin's scholarship ran out after a year, and he began working odd jobs to cover his living expenses. It was while at one of these jobs, as a night watchman at a chemical factory, that he began doing his first writing in English -- a language that he studied for several years in China, but one that he had not yet come close to mastering. "I was just dabbling," he says of these early experiments. But as he wrote, he sensed a freedom in English that he had never felt in his native language. "I had written a few poems in Chinese, but I wasn't happy with them. The Chinese language is very literary and highbrow and detached from the spoken word. It doesn't have the flexibility that English has. So I slowly began to squeeze the Chinese literary mentality out of my mind."
At the prompting of a professor, Jin took some of his work to the poet Frank Bidart, who was teaching at Brandeis. "It was extraordinary to find something this shaped from someone whose first language was not English," Bidart recalls. "He had this remarkable idiom." One of Jin's poems, "The Dead Soldier's Talk," was so good that Bidart read it over the telephone to Jonathan Galassi, who was then poetry editor of The Paris Review (and now editor in chief of Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Galassi immediately accepted the poem; a few years later, Jin's first book of poetry, "Between Silences," was published by the University of Chicago Press.
Around this time, Jin began experiencing severe stomach problems. The Chinese government grudgingly allowed his wife to come to the States to care for him; the pains soon went away, and in 1989 he prepared to return to China with his wife. But something happened, Jin says, "that changed everything for me." Student protesters had gathered in Tiananmen Square, and Jin and Bian spent several days glued to the television screen in their small Boston apartment. "I was not mentally prepared for what happened," he says of the government's crackdown. "I had always thought that the Chinese Army was there to serve and protect the people." Disillusioned, Jin decided not to return to China and began working to get his son, Wen, out of the country as well. To his astonishment, Chinese authorities allowed Wen to board a flight to the United States a few months later.
Wanting to write fiction as well as poetry, Jin enrolled in a master's program at Boston University, where his work was embraced by teachers like Leslie Epstein. But his accent, which was still terribly thick, made workshop discussions difficult. What's more, Jin's subject matter turned off some classmates. One of his classmates was Jhumpa Lahiri, whose first collection of stories, "Interpreter of Maladies," appeared last year. "He is such a gentle man, but his stories really pushed people's buttons," she says. "There were a lot of brutal rape scenes in them. One was about a man who castrates himself. I remember people being shocked and outraged by some of it."
Epstein remembers those heated discussions well. "Ha Jin is one of the great poets of rape," he says. "One of his best stories, 'Man to Be,' has this terrible, terrific rape scene in which a man recovers his humanity when he looks into the eyes of the woman he is about to rape." One of the most powerful moments in "Waiting," too, is a rape scene. While Lin Kong dithers about divorcing his wife, his girlfriend is brutally raped, and Lin Kong is convinced, perhaps with some justification, that it is his fault. "Indecisiveness," he thinks, "had opened the door to the wolf."
Jin laughs uncomfortably when I tell him that he has been described as a "great poet of rape." "My stories are not gentle stories," he says. "The question for me has always been, How do you write about terrible things without resorting to vulgarity? I think I might push things farther than people expect. But that's how you test yourself as a writer."
Jin has remained in academe, having taught writing at Boston University for a few years before moving to Emory. Settled in Atlanta, Jin began publishing his work. His first story collection, "Ocean of Words," appeared in 1996 and won a PEN/Hemingway prize; a 1997 collection, "Under the Red Flag," won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction. As the awards for his work began piling up, Jin says, he began to be asked the same question over and over at readings and book signings: how can someone write English so fluidly, yet speak it so haltingly? "I always give the same response," he says. "On the page, I can spend all the time I need. I can be patient. I can work and work until I think I've almost got it right."
Jin was born in 1956 in the northern Chinese city of Jinzhou, where his father, a military officer, was stationed. At age 7, he was shipped off to boarding school, where he studied for two years, until Mao Zedong ordered all of China's schools closed at the start of the Cultural Revolution.
He returned home to chaos. "Because my grandfather had been a landowner, my mother was criticized very severely," he recalls. "People did terrible things to her. She was once thrown into a trash can." Soldiers burned books owned by Jin's father in a bonfire on the city's streets.
With no school to attend and little else to do, Jin joined the Little Red Guard, where he spent a few years "wearing red armbands, waving flags and singing revolutionary songs" before lying about his age and signing up, at 14, with the People's Liberation Army. At the time, there were rumors that Russia was planning an attack on China, and Jin did not want to die at home in a bomb shelter. "Like everyone else, I wanted to be a hero, a martyr," he says. Jin spent a year shivering on the Russian border, a year that provided the raw material for his first collection, "Ocean of Words," a cycle of stories about Chinese soldiers who await the outbreak of war and struggle, sometimes comically, to cleanse themselves of "bourgeois sentiment."
The Russian attack never came, but something else happened: Jin came upon a worn Chinese translation of "War and Peace." "I was almost illiterate and could barely read it," he says. "But I remember thinking to myself: What a revelation this is. I'm here fighting the Russians, and Tolstoy showed me that the Russians were just like me."
Jin was discharged when he was 19. Because the schools were still closed, he took a job as a telegraph operator in a remote northern city. For once he had ample time to read. Even better, a local radio station began broadcasting an English-language program from 5 to 5:30 a.m. six days a week. He listened avidly and set himself a goal: to read Friedrich Engels's "Condition of the Working Class in England" in its original English. "It was a stupid goal," he says. "I didn't come close."
When China's colleges finally reopened in 1977, Jin was admitted to Heilongjiang University in the northeastern city of Harbin as an English major. He spent four years there, listening to tapes and reciting English phrases until his mouth felt as if it would fall off into his hands. "I hated it," he says. "I simply couldn't say the words. They twisted your tongue, your muscles, too much. We all went to the clinic regularly to get painkillers."
In the early 80's, just as China was beginning to liberalize, Jin enrolled at Shandong University in eastern China, where he got a master's degree in what was becoming a fashionable intellectual topic: American literature. "Like everyone else, I became obsessed with Faulkner, with Roethke, with Bellow," he says. "It was finally O.K. to read these writers."
At Shandong University, Jin met visiting U.S. scholars who encouraged him to study in America. Around this time, Jin also met his future wife, who was teaching mathematics at Shandong. What's more, he stumbled upon the story that would ultimately emerge in "Waiting." While visiting Bian's parents, who were army doctors, he heard the story of another doctor at their hospital who had waited 18 years to get a divorce. "Intuitively, I knew this would make a great story," he says, "but I never thought I would write it. You needed skill to write a story like that. I didn't have it."
When Jin finally did sit down to begin "Waiting," in the early 90's, he still wasn't sure he could bring the story off. "I was terrified because I didn't know if it was any good," he recalls. Fortunately, LuAnn Walther, an editor at Pantheon, found the novel very good indeed. After years of advances and royalties that were rarely more than a few thousand dollars, Pantheon bought "Waiting" at auction for $50,000, and the foreign rights later sold for another $50,000. "I finally felt like I could breathe," Jin says.
It has grown dark outside, and the oranges and cookies are almost gone, when Jin suggests heading out in search of some real food. We pile into his car along with Bian and Wen and drive to a Malaysian restaurant in Chamblee, another suburb. With the recent influx of Asian immigrants, the area has been nicknamed "Chambodia." Along the way we pass strip malls with Korean hair salons and Vietnamese noodle shops, and Jin points out several excellent Chinese bookstores. As much as he appreciates the bookstores, he says, they are a constant reminder that his own books are not available in mainland China. None of his work has been published there. "The American media sometimes portrays me as a dissident, as an exile, although I'm not sure I really am one," he says. News that a Taiwanese publisher will translate "Waiting" has inspired some hope. "I'd like my parents and my brothers and sisters to be able to read my work."
At the restaurant, Jin digs into a whole sauce-covered snapper and discusses his future projects. He is currently polishing a collection of short stories that are set in the same city where "Waiting" takes place and developing a novel that he describes as being about insanity. "It's about a professor in China who has had a stroke but who remains quite articulate," Jin says. "He talks a lot of nonsense but also a lot of truth." Once these books are finished, Jin says, he plans to put China behind him and write his first novel set in the United States. "I have been gathering some ideas," he says.
The idea of writing about America clearly intimidates him, so I'm almost entirely kidding when I ask him if he'll try a frenetic, jumbo-size Atlanta novel along the lines of "A Man in Full." Jin takes the question seriously, however. He has read Tom Wolfe's book, and he praises its abundance of "great detail" while making it clear that it's not his kind of thing.
"I may not understand America very deeply in that way," he says, "but perhaps I can make sense of it from a different angle, from an immigrant's perspective." Jin smiles. "This book will be a great hurdle for me. I will have to write it very slowly."

HEADLINE: Learning How To Be King

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Goldberg; Jeffrey Goldberg is a contributing writer for the magazine. He has written frequently on the Middle East.

 BODY:
"THE THING IS," says His Majesty Abdullah II, the 38-year-old king of Jordan and 43rd-generation direct descendant of the prophet Muhammad, "is that I've become a bit like Elvis."
People see him where he ain't, in other words. 
 "There are sightings all over the place," he says. Since ascending the Hashemite throne last February, Abdullah has made it a habit to inspect his kingdom in mufti. "The bureaucrats are terrified. It's great."
Today, Elvis is flying to Zarqa, outside of Amman, in one of the Royal Squadron Black Hawk helicopters -- like his father, the late King Hussein, he is his own pilot. Once in Zarqa, he will execute a quick costume change and then pay surprise visits to the city's public hospital and to the local offices of the finance ministry.
We land at a paratrooper base outside the city. Prince Ali, the king's 24-year-old half brother and chief bodyguard, jumps out first. A second Black Hawk, filled with more bodyguards, lands a minute later. King Abdullah waves to the paratroopers who watch as he steps out of the helicopter. When his father was king, Abdullah, then a general, commanded these men.
We enter the office of the brigade commander, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Sirhan, who has become only semi-accustomed to the scene now unfolding. Before our eyes, the vibrant young king of Jordan transforms himself -- no point in mincing words here -- into a fat, old, one-eyed gimp in beat-up New Balance sneakers and a red-checkered kaffiyeh. The king first reaches into a gym bag and pulls out a pillow. "Excuse me for a minute," he says. "I have to put my padding on." He steps out of a bathroom a moment later with a tire of fake fat ringing his abdomen.
Out of another bag he takes a plastic-foam head that keeps his wig properly stretched. He holds up the wig, which has been styled into a sort of Bedouin Jheri curl. "Kind of gives me the Qaddafi look," the king says. Before the wig goes on, though, he pulls out a tray of fake mustaches and picks one. Then he takes out a beard extension. The long beard gives him the appearance of a Hamas sheik, which I mention to him with some trepidation, since he and Hamas are fighting a cold war at the moment.
"Wait till you see you me with the wig," he says. He pulls the wig over his short-cropped hair. Before me stands neither a Hamas sheik nor a Libyan strongman, but Samuel L. Jackson in "Pulp Fiction."
Then come the glasses, thick plastic glasses with one lens completely blackened out. An aide hands him a cane, and then His Majesty steps into the sunshine. The soldiers are not sure where to direct their salutes. Prince Ali, too, is in mufti -- fake beard, sunglasses, a kaffiyeh. Very 70's, I say. "Like a terrorist?" Prince Ali asks, smiling.
This is the plan: the king and Prince Ali will travel by taxi to the local offices of the finance ministry. I will follow in a second car with two of the king's aides. A Nissan pickup will carry the bodyguards. The king cautions me not to blow his cover by staring at him too overtly; he suggests, rightly, that a pale-faced American in khakis will draw more attention in Zarqa than a half-blind Arab, even a half-blind Arab wearing New Balance sneakers.
A rust-bucket yellow taxi pulls up, and the king of Jordan hops into the back seat. By the obsessive security standards of Middle Eastern royalty, he is quite alone. But Abdullah, like his father before him, is one of a handful of Middle Eastern leaders who are unafraid of their own people.
He has no particular reason to fear them. One year after ascending the throne, the king has reached a level of popularity no one in Jordan could have reasonably expected. After all, his father was revered the world over as "the plucky little king" who reigned for nearly 47 years and, by the standards of the region, gave his country a remarkable degree of peace, stability and modernity. Abdullah, though, was an unknown. King Hussein named his oldest son crown prince only two weeks before his death. The next king was supposed to be Crown Prince Hassan, youngest brother of King Hussein. Prince Abdullah had a reputation as a bit of a lightweight, a Prince Hal with a vaguely Falstaffian cast of friends who drove fast cars and enjoyed the company of women. A friend of Abdullah's from his Massachusetts prep-school days, Perry Vella, told me: "Right at the beginning, Abdullah said, 'You know, everybody's underestimating me.' But he said: 'I can do this job. I was born to do this job.' "
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has been paying close attention, is impressed by the job he's doing. "I have to tell you, it's been quite amazing to watch him," she says. "I hate to sound patronizing about a king, but he has quickly understood the possibilities of his role."
The possibilities are endless, and so are the challenges. He faces longstanding problems on the political front. Thirty years after the civil war known as Black September (White September to Jordanian nationalists), Palestinians, who make up 60 percent of Jordan's population, are still politically disenfranchised, grossly underrepresented in Parliament, the government and the army. It will be up to Abdullah -- and his wife, the 29-year-old Queen Rania, who is of Palestinian descent -- to define who is a Jordanian.
There is also the matter of Islamic fundamentalists, at home and abroad, who opposed his father's brand of moderate, outward-looking Islam and now oppose his. But the king's most pressing challenge -- at least if you accept his list of priorities -- is reviving Jordan's comatose economy. "We're not concerned about threats on our borders," he told a group of American high-tech executives in October. Queen Rania, who worked for Apple Computer before marrying the king, sat by his side -- a bold spot for the wife of an Arab potentate -- and whispered suggestions in his ear. "The only problem Jordan has ahead of it is its economy," the king continued. "We produce thousands of computer graduates, but we don't have the jobs to give them."
Then there is the quandary of how to honor his father's legacy while casting aside his method of governance. King Hussein built modern Jordan, but modern Jordan isn't modern enough, as the new king sees it, to survive. King Hussein, his obvious attributes notwithstanding, played tribe against tribe, showered cronies with duty-free Mercedeses and allowed state enterprises to be run like fiefs. The question is whether King Abdullah can convert his kingdom into a modern meritocracy.
The king has spent a good deal of time on matters of Middle East peace; he was instrumental in brokering the talks between Syria and Israel, Albright says, and he has spoken regularly with President Clinton on the subject. And he has repaired his country's strained relations with its Arab neighbors, visiting every Arab country except Iraq. He is regularly on the phone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, one of his father's traditional rivals. Abdullah's energetic diplomatic efforts took the Egyptians by surprise. But to Abdullah, Mubarak, along with Yasir Arafat and the aging Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, are yesterday's news. Steve Case and Bill Gates -- these are the friends he wants.
And so Abdullah is moving to reform the economy and make real his vision of the kingdom as the Internet capital of the Arab Middle East. But privatization is moving slowly, the king's own advisers have been warring with one
another and Jordan's bureaucracy is famously sclerotic and resistant to change.
Which is why we are in Zarqa today.
The taxi pulls up to the front gate of the finance offices, and the king and Prince Ali alight. They blend in with crowds of obviously frustrated taxpayers, who wait in line for clerks who aren't there or who, when they are there, do not seem all that interested in assisting the public. The king and Prince Ali spend five minutes banging on the closed door of the land-assessment office, which should have been open at this hour. Not a soul at the finance ministry even guesses he's here. At one point, the king, leaning on his cane, stands directly under his official portrait, the one that graces all government buildings in Jordan.
He spends an entirely unnoticed hour at the finance ministry before we move on to the government hospital. There, a fake television crew, sent by the royal court to stir up the crowd, interviews angry patients. The king's idea is simply to stand in a corner and listen to the complaints elicited by the crew. This works for quite a while. "The doctors are O.K., but the CAT scan never works!" one old man yells over the din.
Then something happens. Maybe it's the large number of very fit, very serious men in a sick ward, or maybe it's the presence of the television crew, but a ripple of excitement moves through the crowd. "I think the king of Jordan is here," a teenage boy tells me. The bodyguards get antsy. The king walks down a hallway, followed by an increasingly sizable, increasingly confused crowd. No one knows precisely what to say. Finally an old woman yells out, "May God grant you long life!" and the jig is up. Elvis leaves the building, and we drive back to base.
Later, in General Sirhan's office, I ask the king if the bureaucrats of Zarqa are by now aware of their unannounced visitor.
"Yes, I think so."
What should they be feeling about now?
"Panic," he says dryly.
How bad was it?
"You saw how people were being treated," he says. "There was a complete lack of organization. There was one old man who was complaining that his form hadn't been dated, and he was getting sent to one office and then another. They should be sweating, because a report is going to go to the prime minister and then on to the relevant ministers about the problems."
What he saw in Zarqa, he wants me to know, is not unique. "You get this in a lot of bureaucracies, all over the place," he says. "I was just watching 'Dharma and Greg' the other day and she was being sent up and down somewhere -- I think it was a registrar's office, and she wanted to solve a problem on a street she lived on. It's not unique."
" 'Dharma and Greg'?"
"It's a sitcom," he explains.
Utterly casual, disdainful of sycophancy and steeped in american culture, King Abdullah II is one of the Three Kings of what optimists might call the new Arab progressivism. Like King Mohammed VI of Morocco and the emir of Bahrain, Sheik Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, he ascended his country's throne in 1999, promising economic reform and modernization. Like growing numbers of young Arab technocrats, he is Western-educated. And like his peers, he is frustrated that the West's power brokers haven't yet paid sufficient attention.
"We're at a very interesting crossroads," the king says. "Madeleine Albright asks, 'What can we expect of the younger generation in the Middle East?' And I always return by saying: 'Well, the younger generation was all educated in the West. We understand the West, so all of us are saying, what can we expect from the West?' "
In 10 or 15 years -- when Mubarak and Arafat and Assad and Qaddafi are all gone -- Abdullah may well be the senior Arab statesman, and already there is talk that he could emerge as a kind of "king of the Arabs" (which was, in fact, the self-proclaimed title of his great-great-grandfather, Sharif Hussein, the ruler of Mecca).
When I ask him if he seeks such a role, he chastens me (not aggressively, because Abdullah is too polite to administer an enthusiastic chastening), denying any pretensions of pan-Arab leadership. He does, however, offer up his hope that Jordan could emerge as a yardstick other Arabs use to measure their own level of freedom.
"What I keep asking my friends in the States is, 'The U.S. had a long-term approach in Europe, a doctrine that worked in Europe, so how can we do the same thing again for these modern, progressive countries in the Middle East?"' the king says. "You have to strengthen them, invest in them. We can be symbols for someone sitting in Yemen, who can say: 'I don't want my country to be like it is now. I want to be like the Jordanian model or the Bahraini model or the Moroccan model.' "
"People in Baghdad," he notes, could also "benefit from seeing this. How did the wall fall? East Germans looked into West Germany and said, 'Enough is enough.' We're trying to say the same thing."
Though he has been king for only 12 months, Washington views him as an emerging heavyweight. He played a major role in bringing the Syrians and Israelis together, carrying messages between Assad and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, whom he talks to regularly. "I told the Americans, 'Look, Assad is sincere, he wants to have peace and he wants you to know that,' "the king recalled. "They were very skeptical throughout the summer. They thought that I was new, maybe I was being nave. But if there's anything I know, I have at least some understanding of people, and the guy came across as genuine." A short time later, the Syrians and Israelis were sitting face to face in West Virginia.
But unlike his father, whose great game was the Middle East peace process, King Abdullah is more interested in what comes after the peace. "The U.S. needs a doctrine for this region," he says. "The U.S. could come in and, say, get Bahrain, the U.A.E., Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia. . . . Give us incentives to come together." The benefits to the United States are obvious: an alliance of modernist, outward-looking Muslim Arab states would counter the forces of anti-Americanism rampant in the region. Madeleine Albright thinks the king is on to something. Referring to the new kings, she said, "He turned me on to looking at them as a group."
What is unusual about this nascent reform movement is that in the main it comprises men who inherited their countries from Daddy. It is not the usual place for hereditary kings to push for reform, reform that could ultimately undermine the power of their own thrones. But this is the Middle East, and everything is inverted.
Many of the monarchies are, all things considered, benign; and the republics -- places like Iraq and Syria -- are run by despots desperate to see their sons follow them onto their jerry-built thrones. The king of Jordan, to be sure, is not Spain's King Juan Carlos, and he is certainly not Vaclav Havel. Abdullah seems genuinely interested in economic reform, but his taste for political reform so far seems limited. His regular undercover visits to hospitals and ministries, though motivated by a desire for change, owe more to populism than they do to ideals of a civil, democratic society.
Press freedom in Jordan is spotty: on the subject of the royal family, and its budget, the newspapers print what the royal court tells them to print. Then there is the persecution of Mustafa Hamarneh, the director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan. Hamarneh was forced out of his job after publishing poll results that angered the prime minister. One poll found that most Jordanians feared criticizing their government.
The prime minister, Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, is a traditional Jordanian pol, and he recently won -- or appeared to -- a nasty power struggle with the former chief of the royal court, Abdel Karim Kabariti, himself a former prime minister who is known to be a politically liberal advocate for Palestinian enfranchisement. (The prime minister and the chief of the royal court are, in theory, the king's two most important advisers.)
When I raised the matter with the king, he told me, "Competition is good, but in this particular setup, it took a destructive turn. The chief of the royal court was more on his own agenda. I think he thought, There's a new guy running the show, I'll do my own thing.
"This was not a victory for the traditionalists," the king continued, slightly defensively. "I think now the prime minister understands more than ever that if I've removed the head of the royal court, I'm quite prepared to remove the prime minister if he doesn't implement social reforms."
That the king can remove the prime minister at will underscores the fact Jordan is, of course, no democracy: ultimate power rests with the king and the king alone. King Hussein fired prime ministers once every 11 months, on average, and the king has it within his power to dissolve the popularly elected Parliament.
As in much of the Arab world (see Algeria), the most strident agitators for democracy in Jordan are found among the Islamists. Still, even the Muslim Brotherhood and its political party, the Islamic Action Front, are loyal to the Hashemites. King Abdullah is himself not an excessively zealous Muslim. He fasts on Ramadan and prays, he says, every day. But like most of the Hashemites, he is the Muslim equivalent of high Episcopal.
Not long after becoming king, Abdullah did have to make sure that the Muslim Brotherhood stayed loyal in the face of wholesale infiltration of the group by Hamas. The brotherhood, like Hamas, is allied with the so-called anti-normalization forces opposed to King Hussein's peace treaty with Israel, but the Islamists, the king said, have always known where to stop.
"I told the Muslim Brotherhood, 'I have no animosities to anybody in Jordan, but I'm concerned that there are elements in society that are beginning to cross the line, and terrorism is a red line for me,' "he said. "I told them I hoped they weren't going to allow outside influences to affect an organization that was part of Jordanian society."
They didn't listen. Intelligence sources say that, with Iran's backing, Hamas continued its plotting. "They were warned 22 times," the king said. " 'We know what you're doing, stop it, we know what you're doing, stop it.' Eventually, it got to the point where the government had to take the issue in hand." Which it did last fall, expelling several key Hamas activists from the country and shutting down Hamas offices in Jordan. Turning Hamas into his enemy does not come without danger for King Abdullah. Anti-Israel feeling runs deep in Jordan.
Queen Rania, somewhat surprisingly, is turning into a force for normalized relations with Israel. She is Palestinian -- her father is from Tulkarm and her mother from Nablus, both in the northern West Bank, and when she spoke to me about Israel, she was quite withering about people who are removed from the conflict but who counsel against peace.
"I'm close to the issue," she says. "I have a higher appreciation for peace because I've seen what goes on there. It's very easy for people outside, Jews and Palestinians, to say they're against the peace process. They're not the ones who are suffering, both on the Israeli side and on the Palestinian side."
As a child, she said, she would visit the West Bank, and she would also visit Israel proper. "I used to visit Netanya, I'd visit all these Israeli cities, and I'd see how much pressure the Israelis were under because of security threats, and I'd see how much pressure Palestinians were under. I just don't have high regard for people who are very far away but make these judgments without knowing the true dimensions of the problem."
King Abdullah has not yet visited Israel, and the Israelis, at least for public consumption, have expressed annoyance at his hesitancy. Some Israeli pundits have suggested that Abdullah seems more interested in developing a relationship with Qaddafi than with his next-door neighbor Barak. Asked about this, the king said: "I had to establish my relationship with the Arab world first. What I'm doing will benefit Israel. If Arab countries look at Jordan with respect and Jordan has peace with Israel -- my friends in Israel have to understand that what I was doing was in their best interests.
"You know," the king says, mindful that his adversaries, even his friends, still underestimate him, "I understand the game."
One day in Amman, while reading some of the endless literature on the king's storied family, I came across this description, written by an English visitor to the region: "His eyes had a confirmed twinkle; and though only 35, he was putting on flesh. It might be due to too much laughter. Life seemed very merry for Abdullah. He was short, strong, fair-skinned, with a carefully trimmed brown beard, masking his round smooth face and short lips. In manner he was open, or affected openness, and was charming on acquaintance. He stood not on ceremony, but jested with all comers in most easy fashion: yet, when we fell into serious talk, the veil of humor seemed to fade away. He then chose his words, and argued shrewdly."
This passage is a dead-on sketch of Abdullah II, except that the Abdullah in question is King Abdullah I, the current king's great-grandfather and namesake, who was awarded the territory that became Jordan by the British after World War I. T. E. Lawrence wrote this 74 years ago, in his masterwork on the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks, "Seven Pillars of Wisdom." Abdullah plotted the revolt; his father, Sharif Hussein, ruler of Mecca, was its inspiration.
I was so taken by my little literary discovery that I immediately mentioned it to the king. He seemed unimpressed, and reminded me that Lawrence did not particularly care for Abdullah I. (Lawrence was partial to Abdullah's younger brother, Feisal, the military leader of the revolt and the future king of Iraq.) He is acutely conscious of his lineage. After our discussion of T. E. Lawrence, he gestured to the wall before him, which was lined with portraits of his Hashemite ancestors. There were his father, Hussein; his grandfather, Talal, who was briefly king before mental illness forced him to abdicate; his great-grandfather, Abdullah I, and his great-great-grandfather, Sharif Hussein.
"One day," King Abdullah II said, "I hope my picture is up there, and people say I continued the tradition of my forefathers."
The Hashemites are perhaps the most noble family in Islam. For hundreds of years, they ruled -- in a comparatively enlightened manner -- the Hejaz, the strip of western Arabia that is home to Mecca and Medina. Only in the last hundred years did they lose control of Mecca, to the more fundamentalist House of Saud, which gave its name, and its particular brand of desert conservatism, to Saudi Arabia.
The Hashemites trace their lineage directly back to the prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fatima, and beyond, to the tribe of Quraish. Hashem, who gave the dynasty his name, was Muhammad's great-grandfather.
If this sounds as if it could be burdensome to the computer-game playing, New Economy-minded king now running Jordan, he doesn't mind letting you know it is. "It's a corny slogan," he said, "but our purpose -- my great-grandfather's purpose, my father's purpose -- is to serve the people. It's a tremendous responsibility to be direct descendants of the prophet Muhammad. This family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1,400 years. I'm not going to drop the ball on my shift."
Fealty to the memory of King Hussein and to the ideals of the Hashemite dynasty may explain why the whole house didn't come crashing down, taking Jordan with it, when King Hussein died last year.
"Other Middle Eastern families would have found themselves at each other's throats, literally, over the events of the past 12 months," says Robert Satloff, an expert on Jordan who runs the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "It's to the King's credit -- and Prince Hassan's, too -- that the family has stayed together."
Seated in his grand office on the grounds of the Raghadan Palace, Prince Hassan, Abdullah's uncle who was in line to become king, has at least retained his sense of humor. When I tell him that I want to talk about two very different things -- I want to hear about his work fostering dialogue among the three Abrahamic faiths, but first I want to talk about the events of last January -- he laughs and asks, "Do I really have to have the medicine?"
I ask him why he made no trouble when his own brother removed him from the line of succession. "There are two taboos in my existence," the prince says. "I don't mean to sound noble or conceited. One, once you've taken an oath of loyalty, there is no way around it. The other taboo is, I don't steal money. These are my guiding lights."
No one better than Prince Hassan knows the price Hashemites pay for loyalty. His staff, which once stood at 80, has been halved. On his wall there is a poster that reads, "Even Superman Is Clark Kent Most of the Time."
Though Hassan's allies suggest his brother's change of heart was sudden, in retrospect it was never entirely clear that Hussein meant for Hassan to be king. Abdullah was crown prince for the first three years of his life. King Hussein gave Hassan the title only in 1965 -- altering the constitution to allow himself to name a brother, not just an eldest son, crown prince. King Hussein, according to his confidants, made the decision reluctantly, only after realizing that should he be assassinated, a real possibility at the time, with anti-Hussein feelings running high in the Arab world, it would be quite dangerous to make king a boy barely out of diapers. King Hussein is said to have never stopped contemplating restoring the crown princeship to Abdullah. Robert Satloff recalls a conversation he had with King Hussein in 1993, shortly before the time he proposed convening a council of Hashemites to discuss issues of succession.
"He didn't say specifically that he was going to remove his brother," Satloff told me, "but he said he felt a heavy responsibility to right one of the great wrongs he committed in his life, which was the wrong he committed against his son Abdullah."
Prince Hassan didn't help himself by opposing his brother's wish to convene the Hashemite men to debate the rules of succession. King Hussein worried, apparently, that as king, Hassan would appoint his own son, Rashid, his successor, rather than one of Hussein's sons.
It seems fairly clear that King Hussein seriously weighed changing succession long before his first bout with cancer, in 1992. But Abdullah, who has always maintained that he didn't want the job, says he picked up on rumors that he would be replacing Prince Hassan only in late 1998. And it wasn't until his father returned to Jordan in January 1999 from an extended stay at the Mayo Clinic, he says, that he knew the change in succession was imminent. His father, a master of discretion and surprise, communicated the change in typically unorthodox fashion, according to his son.
"I had pretty much known I was going to be crown prince for a couple of months. I had a heard from members of my family, 'The king is very proud of you and your achievements.' That was a message. But it was confirmed to me by the way my father had received me at the airport when he arrived home. He stepped off the plane and completely ignored me. In His Majesty's absence, some people had been bad and some people had been good. And you watched how he shook hands with people who had been bad, and how he walked straight past me, and I knew."
There was, Queen Rania says, no joy in her house the day Abdullah learned definitively that he would soon be king.
"I was upstairs organizing some photographs when my husband came in and said, 'I'm going to be the crown prince,' "Queen Rania recalled. "I looked up at him and said, 'O.K.,' and then I continued organizing photographs. That was denial. I had an hour to let the implication sink in and see the positive side, but then, after an hour, we heard that His Majesty wasn't doing very well. We thought we were over the cancer, and everything would go back to normal." Two weeks later, her husband was king.
King Abdullah moved quickly to let the Hashemites know that he was in charge, and that family unity was paramount. His first act was to issue a decree -- as King Hussein wished -- naming Hamzeh, Hussein's elder son by Queen Noor, crown prince. A month later he elevated Rania from princess to queen.
The family, Abdullah says, quickly rallied around the new team. This is not as easy as it seems, because King Hussein had what might delicately be termed a complex personal life. He was married four times, and had children by all four wives. With his first wife, Dina, he had a daughter, Alia. After divorcing, he then married an Englishwoman, Toni Gardiner, who took the name Muna and bore four children: Abdullah; his younger brother, Faisal; and twin girls, Aisha and Zein. After divorcing Princess Muna -- who still lives in the royal compound, near Abdullah's palace -- Hussein married a Palestinian woman named Alia Toukan, who bore a son, Ali, and a daughter, Haya, before she was killed in a helicopter crash. Then came Noor (nee Lisa Halaby), an American-born graduate of Princeton who is the mother of Hamzeh, the 19-year-old named the crown prince; his brother, Hashem, 18; and two girls, Iman, 16, and Rayah, 13.
The siblings are, they say, unified. "The five brothers are like the five fingers of a hand," Prince Ali says. "If you're nice to us, it's an open hand. If you don't want to be nice to us, we become a fist." The king said: "Jordan's got to survive, and it's going to survive with the brothers sticking together."
Despite the apparent unity among the sons of Hussein, these are still uneasy days in the palaces of the Hashemites: prominent family members have been eclipsed, most obviously Prince Hassan and Queen Noor.
"Noor has a good role in Jordan and internationally," the king said, referring to his stepmother's energetic charity work. "But things have changed. There's been a shift. The team is now Abdullah, his wife, Rania, and Crown Prince Hamzeh. That's the team."
It is up to Rania, the brainy and also quite stunning new queen, to apply a little diplomatic finesse to an awkward situation. "There's so much work to be done here," Rania says.
Amman is in many ways a small town -- the elite tend to live in one neighborhood, Abdoun, and the Abdoun chatterers are quite busy parsing the relationship between the two queens.
"People are going to look for negatives," Rania says. "The idea of two queens is intriguing, but we have a very good relationship."
Queen Noor has retained her title, but she seems conscious that her influence is diminished. "I see us all being in transition," she told me as we sat in Bab-al-Salam ("the Gate of Peace"), the palace she shared with King Hussein. ("Palace" is actually too grandiose a word for the houses of the Hashemites; they live well, but there are people in Amman who live better.) "Abdullah and Rania and the new people coming in need to make an independent way for themselves. I'm trying to maintain a low profile."
The king is similarly blunt on the subject of his once-powerful uncle.
"I give the ex-crown prince all the support I can, but he's not part of the executive team anymore," Abdullah told me. "The difficulty he has is coming to terms with the fact that he's no longer No. 2."
King Abdullah says the dysfunction between his father and his uncle extended well beyond issues of succession.
"In the old system, His Majesty had his policy and the crown prince tried to create his own policy," the king said. "So, the system effectively created two bosses. His Majesty would give one directive and the crown prince would give totally different directives. It confused everybody."
The ultimate question asked in palace circles, of course, is this: Why won't Abdullah one day do to his younger half brother Hamzeh what Hussein did to his younger brother Hassan? Won't he arrange to be succeeded by his own son?
Right now, all sides profess harmony. "There's no byzantine quality here," Abdullah says of his relationship with Hamzeh. "We're very close and we think the same way. My father maybe favored the two of us because I think we're both very much like him."
On the other hand, Abdullah and Rania have a 5-year-old son, Prince Hussein, along with a 3-year-old daughter, Princess Iman. Hussein is a typically Americanized kid : when I last saw him, he was battling his uncle Hamzeh with a "Star Wars" light saber. But one day, he will be old enough to be crown prince, and that's when things could get interesting.
"You know, Satloff wrote a very interesting article about this," the king said, referring to Robert Satloff, the Jordan expert. "I showed Hamzeh this paper. Satloff says that whatever Abdullah does and says will not convince the skeptics that what King Hussein did with Hassan would not happen again with Abdullah and Hamzeh. I told Hamzeh that I wanted him to read this. I've told Hamzeh: 'Look, I've got to make this work, you've got to make this work, we know what happened between Hassan and Hussein and why it didn't work. Let's use them as a model in a way, to make sure that you, Hamzeh, succeed.' "
It is probably a relief to Abdullah that Hamzeh purports not to care at all about issues of succession. Hamzeh, who is easily the most earnest 19-year-old in the history of 19-year-olds, is known in Jordan to be the son who was closest to his father. He became fascinated early on in the workings of the royal court, and seldom left his father's side. In Amman, it is often said that, had King Hussein lived a few years longer, he would have made Hamzeh, not Abdullah, his successor.
"I was always trying to balance the time he was spending with his father by encouraging his father to encourage him to involve himself in a range of other activities with people his own age," Queen Noor remembers.
In an interview in the Basman Palace, near his father's grave, Hamzeh says he happily leaves his future in the hands of his oldest brother:
"Well, sir, His Majesty is my king. He is my older brother. I love him dearly, sir, and I would follow him anywhere. Whatever he chooses will be for the best of the country," he says, unrelentingly serious and completely, refreshingly archaic. Like his father, he addresses everyone as sir.
You don't care about being king at all?
"It doesn't matter at all."
This is not, his mother says, public relations. "Believe me," Queen Noor says, "he doesn't know about spin. He really means what he says."
When I ask Hamzeh if it ever crossed his mind simply to hang out for a while, like other 19-year-olds, his eyes grow wide. "Hang out?" he asks, astonished. "Sir, by privilege of birth you are born into a responsibility and a duty, and it's an honor for me to be my father's son and to be born with a heritage that goes back over 1,000 years. It is a great responsibility to serve God Almighty and serve one's country and one's people with every ounce of energy -- and I pray to God Almighty that I will be able to serve them well."
No hanging out, then.
This might change, though, if his brother gets a say. Next year, the plan calls for Hamzeh to begin his career as a college freshman. "Harvard or Princeton, I hope," King Abdullah says. "He needs to fall in love, get into a bar fight, that sort of thing. It'll be good for him."
All Hashemites, it seems, find their way to America. The American influence in Jordan cannot be overstated. The United States is Jordan's biggest benefactor and most important ally. They agree about almost everything, except Iraq; Jordan, which broke with the U.S. during the Persian Gulf war, today supports an end to the United Nation sanctions. The level of intelligence cooperation between the two countries is extraordinary: the effective and, by Middle Eastern standards, elegant Jordanian intelligence service has become perhaps the C.I.A.'s most important partner in the fight against Islamic terrorism, far more important than the Israelis. Last year, sources in Jordan say, the Mukhabarat, the intelligence service, alerted the C.I.A. to at least three plots by Bosnia-based Islamic terrorists to attack U.S. targets in Europe. In December, the Jordanians also arrested 13 people associated with Osama bin Laden in connection with a suspected plot to attack Christian and American targets in Jordan. The C.I.A., these sources say, declares all of its agents in Jordan to the Mukhabarat, not even bothering to develop cover stories, as it usually does in closely allied countries.
Most of the Jordanian Army's top commanders have trained with the American military. (In 1983, King Abdullah spent six months at Fort Knox, where, his instructor, a Capt. Gary McFadden, wrote in a fitness report that "Captain Abdullah is a great credit to the Jordanian Armed Forces and to the country of Jordan.") In the royal court, searching for someone who did not spend time at Georgetown University can be a frustrating task.
But even in the highly Americanized royal court, Abdullah stands out as the most Americanized of them all. His English has a slight British accent, a product of his early English public-school education, but his vocabulary is idiomatically American, as are his cultural references. He is fluent in the language of American pop culture; he has well-formed opinions of dozens of new movies. "I'm easily entertained," he says. "I'll sit through just about anything."
He is also very American in his distaste for excessive protocol. One time, while talking to him in his living room, I began a sentence with either the word "yo" or the word "hey," for once catching myself midsentence. I told him I forgot for a moment he was king. "Thank God," he said.
The great benefit of his seven years of American prep school, he says, was that his teachers and friends didn't particularly care he was a prince.
In fact, at his first prep school, the Eaglebrook School in Massachusetts, he was treated quite poorly by some students precisely because he was who he was.
"I had a slight problem because there was some prejudice," the king said. "I never learned to fight in my life, but I had to learn quickly at Eaglebrook. In the first month, the two proctors came in and picked a student from my year and said, 'This guy is going to beat you up and we're going to watch.' The proctors said, 'You know, you're an A-rab.' The majority of students were Jewish. A lot of the Jewish students were very nice, but some of them had extremist views toward Arabs. So I didn't know how to fight, but I took a chance and jumped off the bed and I knocked the guy off his feet, and he knocked his head against the wall. Pure chance."
There were others at Eaglebrook who picked on this diminutive Arab. As we talk in his office -- his dagger-carrying Circassian guards standing just outside -- the king momentarily loses himself in unhappy memories of his first New England prep school.
"There was a guy who was much bigger than me," he says. "I still dream of the time I could find this guy. I'm sure he's a lot bigger than me, but I'm quite capable of handling myself now and I'd like to remind him of some of the things he did to me in school."
One time, his father came visiting and saw evidence of his son's difficulties. "I had this huge black eye," Abdullah recalls. "He said, 'How did you get that?' I said I ran into a wall. He didn't believe me." (A few minutes after this interview concluded, the king's cousin, Princess Ghida, found me to say the king was worried I might think his views of Jews or of Israel have been colored by ancient prep-school unpleasantness. She was too clever, though, to say that some of the king's best friends are Jews, though he does, in fact, have Jewish friends. Most of the king's best friends are in fact Christian, which is something in this part of the world.)
By the time he began 10th grade at nearby Deerfield Academy, he was an expert wrestler, and his troubles had long since receded. "The three best years of my life," he says of Deerfield.
In its 200-year history, Deerfield has always been most interested in character building, says one teacher, Jim Marksbury, a close friend of Abdullah's. At Deerfield, he was known simply as "Ab." Abdullah, Marksbury says, fit in well: he was uninterested in receiving any special privileges. People knew who he was, but they didn't care.
"I remember meeting him for the first time," his classmate Perry Vella remembers. "They said, 'This is Prince Abdullah of Jordan,' and I said, 'I'm Perry Vella of Queens.' And that was it."
Deerfield, his former teachers say, shaped Abdullah into a bit of a Yankee.
"Good manners, sportsmanship -- knock a man over, you help him up -- the New England work ethic, these are the things that inform the school," Marksbury said. "He didn't like ostentation."
He willingly took his turn in the dining hall waiting tables, recalls the school's former head football coach and dining-hall manager, Jim Smith. "People treated him like one of the guys," Smith says. "He became really Americanized." The only duty Abdullah actively shirked, Smith remembers, was his weekly Arabic lesson, arranged for him by his father, who worried -- rightly, it would turn out -- that Abdullah's Arabic was inferior to his fluent, idiomatic English.
"This instructor, his name was Muhammad, would come over from U. Mass., and Abdullah would always hide from him," Smith says. "After he left, Abdullah would appear out of a closet somewhere."
When he went home to Amman for vacations, Abdullah became something of a Massachusetts Yankee in King Hussein's court, sharing with his father some of the ideas he had picked up.
"I had a lot of crazy and wild ideas that I wouldn't want to blame the American system for," he says, laughing. "My father was always saying, 'Well, maybe you should think about that.' "
When I pressed him, though, he wouldn't specify which ideas he took from America. He didn't mention press freedom or the separation of church and state. Which raises the question: Was the Americanization of Abdullah more a matter of style than of substance?
Here, he retreats into circumspection. "I've benefited from the best of both societies and both cultures, East and West," he says. I realized later that I might have been expecting the impossible from him: after all, his business is the monarchy, which is the most un-American business of all.
So how does a man learn how to be a king?
"There's no Kingship 101," King Abdullah told me one day. "But there are teachers. Usually your father or your grandfather. The best teacher I ever had was H. M." -- by which he means His Majesty, King Hussein.
Abdullah's full brother, Prince Faisal, a general in the Jordanian Air Force (and a 1985 graduate of Brown University), says: "My brother would have loved a couple of years as crown prince. But he was better prepared than his father was for the throne."
True, his father was only a teenager when he was crowned. But by the time King Hussein reached the age of 38 -- the age Abdullah is now -- he had watched his grandfather's assassination at the Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem; he had fought, and lost, the Six-Day War; he had survived the murder of his cousin, the king of Iraq, which spelled the end of Hashemite rule in Baghdad; he had himself survived numerous assassination attempts; and he brought his country through Black September in one piece.
Abdullah has never been through tests like these. But he has been tested.
In 1987, when he was a 25-year-old armored corps officer, stuck out in Jordan's eastern desert, the army's commanders, never keen to have the king's son among them -- competition," Abdullah says today -- began a campaign of intense harassment designed to drive him into early retirement. "Mine was the only company that would constantly be inspected," the king, who spent 18 years in uniform, recalled. "In the middle of the night, they'd come in and inspect my unit, check my stores. I was the only one -- this was real harassment, but my soldiers were very loyal to me. After six months, the soldiers were paying the price. The final day of this, they came in to inspect my company. The battalion commander was in on this. They tipped the beds over, they stepped on my soldiers' shoes and then they went and struck one of my senior sergeants.
"I waited until the delegation went out -- this is the only time I've ever done this -- I went to my battalion commander and I pulled a gun out and stuck it to his head and said, 'Anybody comes to my company like that again I swear to God I'll shoot him.' They wouldn't come near me. They probably thought I was crazy. I was out there alone for the next three or four months."
I told him his story sounded improbable -- how could the son of the supreme commander be treated this way?
"They knew that I wouldn't run to Daddy and complain," he said. "I never did that in my life, and I wasn't about to start."
King Hussein, it turned out, knew of his son's problems. Two of the late king's confidants said King Hussein was made aware of the harassment. "It pained him, but he let it happen," one of the confidants, a high-ranking official in the current government, said. "He wasn't going to intervene if his son didn't want him to."
This incident, the confidant said, sealed Abdullah's reputation with his father: "This was the test, and Prince Abdullah passed."
Just hours after King Hussein died, on Feb. 7 of last year, Abdullah was standing before the Jordanian Parliament. Stone-faced, he swore an oath and became Jordan's fourth king. The next days were a whirlwind: his father's funeral, televised worldwide, was attended by dozens of kings, presidents and prime ministers, each of whom took time to meet with the new, young king. He says he never got a chance to mourn for his father. He told me this matter-of-factly, as if to say: this is the price you pay.
He did go on to tell me that, every so often, his father visits him in his dreams and brings him a message of comfort. "I'm not a person who's really into spirituality, but I've had a couple of dreams that have been so unique," the king said. "One of the times His Majesty came to me was the day I went to the Baqa camp, the Palestinian camp. I went just to tell Hamas: 'Oh, yeah, you think you have support here? Well, I have support, too.' That night, I had a dream that H. M. stepped off an airplane -- we were in Tanzania or something, I don't know why, you know how dreams are -- and he just came and gave me a big hug and said, 'I'm so proud of you."'
When I first spent time with King Abdullah early last fall, it was clear that the work didn't intimidate him. But the title seemed to. "There's still this thought in my mind that I'm holding the fort until His Majesty comes back," he said at one point. That thought seems to have dissipated. He is now very much the king.
Being king, however, is likely to become a more difficult job. The world made it rather easy for him during his first year. His father's old rivals, Arafat and Assad and the rest, kissed him on both cheeks and promised him their friendship. President Clinton made him feel at ease in the corridors of Washington power. The titans of the New Economy, perhaps intrigued by the exoticism of it all -- the Arab king of Deerfield, his beautiful wife with high-tech skills -- gave him a most respectful hearing.
And at home, he had the warm sympathies of his people.
But sympathy has a way of drying up in stagnant, corrupt places like Zarqa, and the region in which he rules remains tough and volatile, and the international businessmen he has met have so far extended him only their attention, not their money. The honeymoon will end, and the memory of King Hussein will grow more faint. Only then will the world see for sure if that king's final decision was the right one.

HEADLINE: A Stalinist Antibiotic Alternative

BYLINE: By Lawrence Osborne; Lawrence Osborne is the author of "Paris Dreambook." He last wrote for the magazine about Nicaraguan sign language.

 BODY:
In a barely heated ward for newborns on the top floor of the Georgian Republic Children's Hospital, Tamila Gogitidze carefully opens a glass ampul filled with amber liquid. The hospital, in the Degomi suburb of Georgia's decaying capital city, Tbilisi, is a spartan affair: its radiators are ramshackle, the electricity intermittent and the raw concrete heavy on the eyes. A few American posters of babies cavorting in cabbages seem direly out of place. The liquid trapped inside the ampul, meanwhile, can be identified from a box on the floor. Its label is Latin: Bacteriophagum Intestinalis Fluidum. Gogitidze, a nurse on the intensive care unit for newborns, cracks open the ampul, pours the liquid onto a teaspoon and prepares to administer it to one of her babies, a 3-month-old boy abandoned at the hospital a few days before by his impoverished family. He is screaming lustily.
"Look," Gogitidze says, holding up a tiny wrist. "The parents made a kind of crude tattoo so that they can identify him later on. But for now, we must focus on his intestinal infection." 
 The fluidum is tipped like any cough syrup into the boy's blubbering mouth. His face contorts into a horrible wince; I look apprehensive. But Dr. Tamar Gotua, head of the intensive care unit, takes my arm and says: "We use them with almost all our children. Don't look so worried!"
It's hard not to feel worried in Georgia. After years of bloody civil war following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republic is in free fall. Electricity runs for only part of the day; blackouts are a daily, if not hourly, occurrence. Nevertheless, in this dilapidated neonatal ward a possibly revolutionary medicine, one essentially unknown in the West, is being casually administered on a simple teaspoon: bacteriophages, or microscopic viruses that actually "eat" bacteria.
Downstairs in the same hospital, I talk with Dr. Irakli Pavlenishvili, head of pediatrics, in an office so cold that our breath mists. The doctor offers me some Greek brandy and warms his hands by a portable electric heater. We chain-smoke furiously. "We've been using phages for years," he says briskly, looking up nervously at the flickering lights. "There are no major side effects. They're a living, natural force, not a toxic chemical. I wish our electricity were as reliable!"
Today, the West is paying renewed attention to this unheralded therapy created behind the Iron Curtain. The reason: antibiotic resistance. Although drugs like penicillin have held killer bacteria at bay for half a century, the bugs keep genetically adapting to them, evolving into tougher, smarter variants of ancient adversaries. The systematic overuse of antibiotics by doctors, especially in the United States, has helped breed "superbugs" -- bacteria resistant to even the most potent antibiotics, like vancomycin.
Last year, The New England Journal of Medicine published an alarming editorial about superbugs. "The outlook is rather grim," it wrote. "The adaptive potential of the microbial world is such that for each new antibiotic that is introduced, several escape mechanisms are soon devised."
Alexander Tomasz, a leading microbiologist at Rockefeller University, agrees: "The miracle days of antibiotics are over. We simply didn't think enough about the evolutionary consequences of drug use." With leading medical researchers in the West looking anxiously for antibiotic alternatives, bacteriophage therapy is suddenly looking "very promising," as Tomasz puts it.
"I'm convinced that bacteriophages will work," says Carl Merril, chief of the biochemical genetics laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. "But there's the psychological obstacle of a new treatment coming from the former Soviet Union. It's unusual, to say the least."
They may sound exotic, but bacteriophages are in fact among the most common organisms on earth. (The word derives from the Greek phagin, "to eat.") Viral predators only one-fortieth the size of the average bacteria cell, they swarm unseen around us, busily searching and destroying their favorite food: germs. In electron microscope images, phages show up as ghostly, spiderlike creatures with transparent box-shaped heads, rigid tails and a tangle of legs for gripping their prey. They are so tiny that a single drop of tap water may contain a billion of them.
How do phages kill bacteria? The answer is, with chilling efficiency. Latching onto the walls of a bacteria cell, the phage injects it with the genetic material stored in its very own head. Like a living syringe, it gradually empties itself into the victim and takes over its genetic machinery. Inside the helpless bacteria, bits and pieces of "daughter" phages begin to appear with sinister rapidity: rows of little heads, lines of tails, then legs. These different body parts assemble into miniphages, using the host cell as a kind of factory. As the phages multiply exponentially inside it, the bacterium's walls weaken -- then explode like a soap bubble. Scientists call this rather nightmarish process "lysis." It is the flash point of a gigantic microbial war between phages and bacteria, in which humans are a mere side issue.
These deadly microscopic hit men were discovered independently during World War I by the English microbiologist Frederick Twort and the flamboyant Canadian biologist Felix d'Herelle, then working in a laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. It was d'Herelle who gave them their name in a 1917 paper that predicted a revolution in the treatment of infectious diseases.
D'Herelle first discovered bacteriophages while working in the Mexican state of Yucatan in 1910. He noticed them in the most unlikely of places: the diarrhea of locusts. During an invasion of these insects, d'Herelle collected sick specimens and observed their abundant stools. He concluded that the locusts were suffering from septicemia caused by coccobacilli bacteria. D'Herelle smeared some of the diarrhea onto plates of agar to grow cultures, but then noticed something odd. After a while, clear circular spots a few millimeters across had appeared in the agar, suggesting that something was munching away at the coccobacilli. What were these tiny bacteria-eaters?
Back at the Institut Pasteur, d'Herelle repeated the experiment in 1915 with stools taken from a Paris-based squadron addled with dysentery. In the excrement of the officers, d'Herelle again detected agents that consumed the bacteria spontaneously. Nature, d'Herelle boldly announced to the world, had provided humankind with a living, natural weapon against germs.
Phages were popularized by Sinclair Lewis in his 1925 novel "Arrowsmith," about a young doctor who goes to the West Indies to use them against an epidemic of bubonic plague. "You may," says one of the novel's characters to Martin Arrowsmith, who was inspired by the real-life d'Herelle, "have hit on the supreme way to kill pathogenic bacteria!"
But it was not to be. Phages proved to be a hit-or-miss affair as a therapy. One problem was that there are hundreds of types of phages, and each type kills only one variety of bacteria. Predator and prey must be perfectly matched, a daunting process. What's more, there were early problems with purification. When phages burst out of the victim's cell, they leave behind debris that can contaminate the solution. This debris can prove fatal to humans, a problem that the purification technologies of the early days were unable to solve.
As a result of these difficulties, phages were quickly outpaced by a rival drug: penicillin. Although Eli Lilly actually manufactured therapeutic phages for the United States market in the 1930's, after World War II they were largely consigned to the margins of Western medicine -- even as they took center stage in DNA research, where their simple molecular structure made them an ideal tool for peering into the inner workings of genes. Sir Francis Crick and Max Delbruck, two architects of DNA theory, were phage researchers. Phage research helped unlock molecular biology at the very moment that they disappeared from the medical scene.
Yet there is a twist to this story. The aristocratic d'Herelle was a passionate Communist and admirer of Stalin. In 1934, he accepted an invitation from the Soviet government to join the Institute of Bacteriology in Tbilisi, recently set up by a young Georgian microbiologist named George Eliava. The Eliava Institute, as it became known, became the world's leading center of therapeutic phage research. One of its first successes was a powerful dysentery phage for the Red Army during the World War II. Over the ensuing decades, the institute began supplying precisely targeted phages to hospitals all over the Soviet bloc. The Eliava Institute became the largest phage library in the world, with a permanent "museum" of more than 300 phage clones.
"We've been perfecting bacteriophages as a medicine for over 70 years, just as d'Herelle said we could," explains Nina Chanishvili, a senior researcher at the Eliava Institute today. "But has anyone been listening?"
On an icy December day, Chanishvili and I walk through the hilly Tbilisi district of Saburtalo on our way down to the Eliava Institute. The path winds vertiginously through plots of spindly pomegranate trees touched with snow. Clumped along the hillside are rotting Soviet-era apartment blocks. On the streets, the shops are lighted only with candles.
Nina's uncle, Teimuraz Chanishvili, has helped direct the Eliava Institute for a quarter of a century, and she, too, has devoted most of her life to phage research. But the last 10 years have been cruel. In recent years, she says, the institute's phage output has dwindled alarmingly. Virtually unpaid, the institute's workers now cling to a fading infrastructure. When high-tech equipment breaks down, they must work with improvised materials. Also, adds Chanishvili, "because of the power cuts, we've lost about half of our phage library." (Phage cultures must be refrigerated.) Georgia's economic collapse has dwindled the demand for phages as well. Once the institute manufactured phage sprays, salves, ointments, tablets -- you name it. But now, even at $3 to $5 for a box of 10 ampuls, many of Tbilisi's sick simply cannot afford them.
The institute, however, still sits in its graceful park of cypresses overlooking the Mtkvari River, and over the wall I see the handsome cottage that Stalin had specially built for d'Herelle. It is still called "d'Herelle's cottage," though it was later occupied by the Georgian K.G.B. Inside, the institute is a cavelike labyrinth of damp cement corridors, stairwells dripping wires and mournfully antiquated labs. The old fermentation vats that used to churn out phage preparations for the Soviet Ministry of Health stand abandoned in a room with no glass in the windows.
Upstairs, Chanishvili shares a cramped and unheated lab with a fellow researcher, Marina Tediashvili, and half a dozen young medical students. They are all women. They are all shivering. "Of course," says Tediashvili, "the men naturally move on to better things." Equipment is largely rudimentary. Among the centrifuges, water baths and piles of petri dishes stand dozens of beer and vodka bottles that the women use as containers for their solid agar. To melt the agar, they pop one of the vodka bottles inside an old Nescafe tin sitting on a hot plate. "We like vodka bottles," Chanishvili feels obliged to explain, "because they're so transparent."
The interns spend most of their time on the tedious chore of planting phage cultures in the specimens of bacteria, turning each petri dish into a kind of phage farm. I watch as one of the women sterilizes the tip of an applicator in a Bunsen burner, drips a blob of phage solution onto a plate of E. coli and carefully closes the plastic lid. "E. coli causes epidemics worldwide," explains Tediashvili. "But these phages find E. coli tasty. They go through it like Oreos."
Holding up an E. coli dish that has been incubated for two days, she points to a smattering of irregular, clear circles carved out of the agar. They look like the perforations of a shotgun blast. "Isn't that beautiful?" she whispers. A dish of salmonella is peppered with smaller, more regular bullet holes.
Chanishvili explains that she and her colleagues initially catch phages in gunky places where the creatures are known to thrive: sewage water, for example. They are then stored in a liquid broth kept in a refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius. Oddly enough, they don't need to be fed with tasty germs to stay alive. "Phages can live for months without food," Chanishvili says. "Without additional germs to feed on, they cannot multiply out of control." If their numbers begin to decrease, however, a few bugs are thrown to them and they multiply again.
In the same wing, I am taken to see Amiran Meipariani, head of phage research. Meipariani has been here since 1946, at the height of the Stalin era, and his sardonic blue eyes seem to have seen it all. Like most Georgian doctors, he chain-smokes and shrugs frequently. His office is filled with disconnected Soviet telephones; on the wall hangs a faded portrait of Felix d'Herelle.
"As you can see, we've fallen on hard times," he says, shrugging. "But it is now realized worldwide that an alternative to antibiotics should be sought and that the best one is bacteriophages. Perhaps it's a boon for us. Did you know that NATO is now interested in one of our inventions?" His eyes light up puckishly. He is referring to a topical phage application invented by the Eliava Institute and known as a "PhageBioDerm," a kind of bandage saturated with a cocktail of five to nine different phages that can treat infected burn wounds. It is the perfect military Band-Aid. Russian soldiers have used them in Chechnya. "Of course, women and kids can use them in the kitchen, too," he adds with a sales-pitch smile.
The Eliava has a local patent on the phagoderm, which it manufactures itself along with the "intestiphage," the 17-phage cocktail I saw being administered to the abandoned baby. All in all, the Eliava produces about 10 different phage applications that target about 15 different bacteria genera. By creating drugs that combine many phages at once, their administration can be simplified to a single dose.
Considering the difficulties involved in doing science in Georgia, the advancements made by the Eliava are remarkable. Chief among these has been the creation of an intravenous remedy to the deadly staph aureus bacteria, a strain that threatens to one day outpace vancomycin. According to the Eliava, it's been used successfully on dozens of patients.
In the past few years, the Eliava's skill has attracted the attention of Western entrepreneurs eager to harness the knowledge bottled up in Tbilisi's laboratories. But the Georgian scientists worry about this development as much as they celebrate it. Who will ultimately benefit from the commercial exploitation of their work? Will the Americans and Europeans simply steal their expertise and innovations? "The local market has collapsed," says Meiparinai with a final shrug. "But who will patent phages in the West? Who's going to make the millions?" Then he corrects himself. "The billions, I mean." Indeed, the worldwide antibacterials market is estimated to be worth $25 billion a year.
So far, the Eliava's experience of cooperation with American companies interested in phages has not exactly been propitious. In 1996, a Canadian venture capitalist named Caisey Harlingten came to Tbilisi, eager to talk to the Chanishvilis about their work. What happened next was, as Chanishvili puts it tersely, a "culture clash." Although a start-up company that came to be named Phage Therapeutics was quickly set up in Seattle, the planned Tbilisi affiliate was closed almost as soon as it opened. "Harlingten told me," says Chanishvili bitterly, "that the American consumer would never accept a medical product from the Soviet Union." Meanwhile, Phage Therapeutics is busy readying Eliava-inspired medicines for the U.S. market.
"We gave the Americans access to all this background research," she goes on, "and they simply walked away with it. They told us we were stupid at business. Well, that at least was true."
That evening, I meet with Teimuraz Chanishvili at his home on Kazbegi Street, a lampless street of elegant 19th-century Russian houses. A Nabokovian charmer now in his 70's, he greets me at the top of the stairs in his dressing gown. "Come and look at the TV," he says excitedly. "The Americans have stolen my phage photographs!" By one of those coincidences that even a journalist couldn't invent, there indeed is an American documentary about phages playing on the TV. Teimuraz's uncopyrighted images of phages float like extraterrestrial prawns across the screen. "I didn't get a cent!" he cries, shaking his finger at the screen.
Later, we have a calmer chat over chestnut soda, and he tells me the sad story of George Eliava. The man who established the bacteriophage's central place in Soviet medicine was not exactly rewarded for his efforts. When not doing brilliant science, Eliava was a handsome playboy who had the misfortune to fall in love with a woman also admired by Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's secret police chief. Despite Stalin's high regard for bacteriophages, it was Eliava's death warrant.
"Beria had Eliava shot in 1937 on a pretext," Teimuraz says matter-of-factly. "That's the way it was back then." He adds with a chuckle, "Thankless work, bacteriophages!"
As if on cue, the lights go out.
In the well-lighted laboratories in europe and the United States, however, the prospects for phages are glittering. In this country alone, at least three start-up companies are vying to be the first to push a phage therapy through Food and Drug Administration approval. In addition to Harlingten's Phage Therapeutics in Seattle, there are Intralytix in Baltimore -- a company with numerous Georgian expats on the payroll -- and Exponential Biotherapies on Long Island, a small biotech company run by Dr. Richard Carlton that expects to petition the F.D.A. to begin clinical trials on a phage drug this spring.
Big challenges face these companies. One pitfall of early phage therapy was that wild phages are expelled very quickly by the body's filtering system, often reducing their effectiveness. The immune system, in other words, treats them as foreign bodies. Can new technologies, however, pinpoint "domesticated" phages that can linger longer in the body? While the Eliava has had some success on this front, American scientists hope to do even better.
The work of Carl Merril has led the way. In the April 1996 edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the N.I.H. researcher published the result of some intriguing experiments with phages and mice. Essentially, he was able to selectively breed "mutant" phages that remained in the mice far longer than the wild variety. "We altered the code proteins in the phages," Merril explains, "to make them more durable." In the same issue, the Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg of Rockefeller University wrote, "This is an ingenious surmounting of one of the hurdles to the use of phage in therapy."
It was Merril, recalls Carlton of Exponential Biotherapies, "who told me that phages had been used as a therapy back in the 30's. What sometimes limited them, though, was this problem of making them stick around inside your body. But today, with genetic engineering, we can selectively breed phages that can last thousands of times longer." This represents a huge advance. After all, a single phage can produce 40,000 daughters in an hour; one hour later, the number increases exponentially to 4 billion. As Carlton puts it, "It's the only drug that makes more of itself as it's actually being used!" In recent experiments with mice infected with the E. coli bacteria, Merril reports, he cured every single animal with these long-life phages.
At University of Maryland labs used by Intralytix, Zemphira Alavidze, who also runs her own lab at the Eliava Institute, presides over the same array of petri dishes, jars of agar and phage phials. But the difference between Baltimore and Tbilisi is twofold. "Here," she says, "we have lots of mice to experiment on. And we can purify phage solutions using chromatography. Purification is much more tricky in Tbilisi -- and mice are just out of the question."
Purification and in-depth animal testing are essential first steps toward commercializing phages in the painstaking medical culture of the West. Clinical trials involving human patients are yet to come. On this front, the Georgians are way ahead of the Americans. Indeed, the Soviet bloc's headlong experiment with human patients may well turn out to be the greatest contribution of the embattled Tbilisi doctors to the eventual medical use of phages.
Dr. David Shrayer, now a cancer researcher at Brown University, worked as a medical officer on the construction of the Baikal-Amur railroad in Siberia in the 1970's, where he says he regularly administered bacteriophages to Soviet construction workers. "Even back then," Schrayer says, "these Siberian workers were suffering from infections that were resistant to antibiotics. The phages worked splendidly. But here's the catch. D'Herelle and then the Soviets ruined the image of phages in the West by testing them on people without first conducting proper animal tests. Animal tests were expensive; patients were cheap. That was the tragedy of phages in the East. But it was also their trump card. We learned that they really work."
the most exclusive private clinic in tbilisi is the plastic surgery unit within the Clinical Diagnostic Center, a stone's throw from the university. The contrast with the children's hospital couldn't be greater. A small vestibule sports a soothing green fish tank, while Tchaikovsky burbles on the sound system. Open just a year, the clinic serves the liposuction needs of Tbilisi's rich. Here I sit with the elegant Dr. Iva Kuzanov, Georgia's top plastic surgeon, looking at an album of post-op photographs. They are stomach-turning.
"This man was bitten in the nose by a pit bull. See how handsome he is now? This woman came to us from San Francisco for a sex-change operation. What do you think of her penis?"
"Marvelous," I say.
There is an alarm clock hanging from it. "To prove the strength," Kuzanov says with a totally straight face. "We amputated her finger and put it inside. Amazing, no?"
What is really remarkable about the clinic, however, is the frequency with which phages are used to counter surgical-wound infections in these complex (if bizarre) cosmetic operations. Many of Kuzanov's patients are from the West, he says. "They come because of the low prices here." As for phages, Kuzanov claims, they've proved to be excellent for burn traumas or infections arising from accidents. He holds up a picture of a breast-reduction job. "We treated her lesions with phages. Look, a perfect recovery."
To see one of these phage patients for myself, however, I decide to call on the first person ever to have been treated with intravenous phages. His name is Prince Avtandil Chkheidze, M.D. He is a prince and a doctor. Chkheidze receives me in an imposingly austere office at his private clinic. Although it is freezing cold, he wears only a snappy maroon blazer. After first showing me a copy of his family's coat of arms, he hands me a more welcome glass of steaming Turkish coffee. "So you want to hear about phages?" he whispers like a character out of Edgar Allen Poe.
Chkheidze spins out his story. After graduating in 1976 from a Tbilisi medical school, he was posted to a gynecology clinic in Leningrad. Overworked and exhausted, he eventually fell ill with a severe lung infection. In time, he came to be additionally afflicted with a long-term purulent skin infection. Even though his hospital placed him in a top Soviet clinic with state-of-the-art Western medicine, its antibiotics made no difference. His skin infection worsened, and he begged to be allowed to return to Tbilisi. Once there, he asked his father, one of the city's leading doctors, to see if he could be treated with intravenous phages -- a procedure never carried out before. The risks were great. But unable to move and now dependent on crutches, Chkheidze didn't much care.
"At first," he says, "my father was horrified by my proposal. Then Teimuraz Chanishvili told us he had a staph aureus phage already tested on animals. But he was afraid to use it on humans."
They therefore had to find someone willing to administer the phages. In the end, Dr. Vakhtang Bochozishvili, a famous professor at the Sepsis Center in Tbilisi, agreed to do so. "It was a bit of a conspiracy," Chkheidze says. "I was the ultimate guinea pig."
On the fifth day of treatment, the prince threw away his crutches and went to a late-night party with his friends. The taboo on intravenous phages, he notes, was shattered with one blow. "On the seventh day I was completely cured. It was quite miraculous."
The possible implications of this strange fragment of medical history are enormous. Chkheidze says that he would like to introduce widespread intravenous phages into his clinic. In fact, he claims, his clinic doesn't use antibiotics at all to treat infection. He also claims that during the last 10 years of the Soviet system, approximately 20,000 people were cured of chronic sepsis by phages, though it is hard to verify such statistics. As it is, he adds: "I use them every day in my practice. They are excellent for pregnant women, extremely safe." He lowers his voice. "I use them in vaginal suppository form. They are pure gold."
But what of human patients in the West? This is a far more shadowy affair, since phages can be used only in extreme cases in which a dying patient's family gives explicit permission for their use. So far, such cases have been extremely rare. Last year, Nina Chanishvili was contacted by two Belgian brothers who had read about phage therapy on the Internet. Their 23-year-old sister lay dying of a severe post-measles viral infection of the brain. A trepanation in her skull to inject antibiotics, the brothers explained, had become infected with staphylococcus areus. Could Chanishvili treat the secondary infection with phages?
"I just had to go," she says. "I brought the phages myself." According to Chanishvili, the secondary staph infection cleared up within days, though the girl remained mortally ill from her untreatable primary condition.
In another recent case, a woman dying of a Marfan-related heart problem in Toronto was treated for a staph infection by having a solution of phages sprayed directly onto her aorta. The infection was vanquished within 20 hours. (Two months later, the woman died of her heart condition.) Phage Technologies, which provided the medicine, hyperbolically hailed it as "the first use of phage therapy in the West in modern times."
Of course, one patient is far from the rigorous proof Western medicine requires; perhaps the staph infection would have cleared up on its own. Nevertheless, says Elizabeth Kutter, a leading American phage researcher at Evergreen State College in Olympia, "what this shows is that phages are ready to be used in the West."
The next international phage conference will be held this June in Montreal, d'Herelle's birthplace. It is difficult not to imagine the old Communist iconoclast smiling in his grave -- not to mention Comrade Stalin. "It's strange to think," says Nina Chanishvili, "that Stalin might be considered a medical benefactor of the 21st century!"

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Getting to Laos Ahead of the Guidebooks

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
THE stranger approached. He wore a tie-dyed shirt and a nylon zippered waist pouch. A gray ponytail; late 50's, I'd say. "So," he opened, "You're going to Laos?"
I pulled my nose out of the Laos Guidebook and disentangled my chopsticks from the pad thai. "Why yes," I replied. 
 In any other city I would've figured this for a lame pickup attempt. But in Bangkok, the main node of the international backpacker's circuit, this was networking.
Mr. Tie-Dye leaned close. "You'll love Laos," he said, then glanced around to make sure no one was listening, "It's much nicer than Thailand." We got down to business. In return for my travel tips on the Philippines, I acquired the name of the travel agent who had booked his discount flight to Vientiane, the lowdown on the ever-changing Laotian visa regulations, and -- the choicest tidbit -- directions to a guest house in Luang Prabang that wasn't in the Lonely Planet yet. We finished the transaction before my noodles cooled.
I'd stopped off in Bangkok late last November to organize my trips onward to Laos and Cambodia. While it's possible to book flights and tours to these countries from the United States, I didn't do it -- partly because I enjoy traveling more when I'm moving spontaneously, but mostly because I knew that arranging my trips would be easier from there, and much cheaper. All the things I needed -- from tickets and visas and mosquito nets and recent first-hand information to a good Thai massage -- were available in a one-stop traveler's shopping mall, the Khao San Road.
At least a hundred travel agencies elbow for space among Khao San Road's quarter-mile-long crunch of budget guest houses, cut-rate noodle joints, Thai massage parlors, bars, and internet cafes. I strolled down one side of the street and up the other, wondering where to begin. Some agencies looked like regular air-conditioned storefront offices. Others looked like this: a metal chair unfolded on the sidewalk, a half-asleep Thai woman, a plastic electric fan perched atop a pile of blank air ticket forms.
Were these the fabled ticket brokers I'd heard about, the agents who could book you from Bangkok to Timbuktu for 50 bucks on airlines so obscure the F.A.A. hadn't issued safety warnings about them yet?
Every traveler has an inner risk-o-meter, and testing the legitimacy of a travel agent who operates from a folding table pushed my needle into the red zone. So I started with the air-conditioned offices, one by one: How much for a round-trip ticket from Bangkok to Vientiane?
The storefront agents offered similar prices (they negotiate in the Thai bhat, and charge extra to use a credit card) -- cheaper, by at least $50, than the prices I'd been quoted back home. Word-of-mouth sold me on the Blue and White agency (Mr. Tie-Dye's tip). It was owned, curiously, by an Israeli who kept up telephone conversations in Hebrew, English and Thai while I waited. The prices were on the low end of what I'd found -- $134 round trip on Lao Aviation, $171 round trip on Thai Airways. They could arrange my visa in two days, for $34 (including the $24 visa fee), saving me two tiresome trips to the Laotian embassy. The only question was which airline. Lao Aviation was cheaper, but the State Department had issued a travel advisory about it. I caved and bought the Thai Airways ticket.)
Thai Airways hands out orchid corsages to all the women as they get off the plane. I stuck mine in my hair and practiced a big smile for the immigration officer. I was preparing myself for Socialist bureaucracy -- Laos is one of the last countries in the world whose official name contains the words "People's Democratic Republic."
Since 1975, after Communist victories in Vietnam and Cambodia, the country has been run by the Pathet Lao, a junta whose closest ally is neighboring Vietnam. Until quite recently, getting a tourist visa into Laos was a complicated and expensive process. But Laos, which once vied with Myanmar as the most restrictive Southeast Asian country for tourism, decided to get tourist-friendly about two years ago, around the time it joined Asean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The government slashed visa fees and loosened requirements. Not only that, it proclaimed 1998-99 Visit Laos Year.
As I entered the immigration area at the Vientiane airport, I noticed that the Visit Lao Year banners now read: Visit Lao Year 1999-2000. I also noticed that I'd lost my orchid. No matter. The official behind the desk looked at my American passport, smiled warmly, said, "Sabaidee," ("Greetings"), and I was in.
Countries that have put up barriers to modernity and its Mc-trappings beckon to tourists in search of the unexplored, the "authentic," the road-less-traveled, which is why Laos, at this moment, is the favorite destination of Khao San Road's cognoscenti.
Downtown Vientiane, a city of around 150,000, has no Pizza Huts. It has wide and impressive, if potholed, avenues, imposing, down-at-heels French colonial mansions, most of themoverrun by a tangle of vegetation, and a long, unpaved waterfront promenade along the Mekong River where Laotians and foreigners gather at sunset to drink beer and play cards. Old Asia hands had told me that Vientiane, more than any other city in the region, retained the allure of colonial Indochina. Instinctively I dismissed this as foreigners' romanticism.
But on my first morning in town, I strolled down one of those broad avenues toward the Patuxai, an imposing monument that looked like an Arc de Triomphe redesigned by a Laotian potentate. The light reflected golden off the dust kicked up by cyclists, scooters, and motorcycles -- and few cars other than an occasional sleek Toyota Pajero (the favored wheels of the diplomatic and development agency set). I watched a sidewalk vendor selling fresh baguettes, sliced in two and spread with condensed milk. I watched a monk, in a temple courtyard, hanging out orange laundry. Serenity kicked in. I'd lost my place on the map, and couldn't speak a word of Laotian, yet felt as if I'd just drifted out of a yoga class.
"We've all fallen in love with Laos," said Sarah, an Englishwoman on a year's contract with a Swiss development agency. We sat, at adjacent tables, at the Scandinavian Bakery -- like a bloodhound, I'd ended up my morning stroll in one of Vientiane's two cafes that serve fresh-brewed coffee and croissants. It's an expatriate's watering hole; CNN plays on the TV screen upstairs. Foreign aid is one of the backbones of the Laotian economy, and Vientiane's tourist population is almost invisible next to the hundreds of resident foreigners. Most, like Sarah, are both intoxicated and frustrated by the country. "The people are wonderful," she told me. "But it's a poor country, where nothing ever changes."
I enjoyed their company, and found it useful, because guidebooks to Laos are quickly obsolete. Vientiane, thanks to its French heritage, is a restaurant town, but quality fluctuates. Sarah's friend John steered me to Nizam, which serves excellent South Indian food for around $2. Another foreigner gave me his list of favorite "upscale" restaurants, including an excellent Italian bistro, Stivale. Upscale, in Vientiane, means dinner for $12.
The expats knew everything: from restaurants and shops, to which of the dusty antiques shops selling celadon teapots and silver bracelets on Setthathirat Road were fronts for opium dens. (While Vientiane today is far from wild and woolly, it still retains some illicit corners). I was interested when Sarah mentioned a meditation session, open to foreigners, at one of the Buddhist temples. I thought perhaps I'd try it -- but later, because I had plans.
At the airport I'd met a driver named Pheng who had an air-conditioned car. He spoke a bit of English and negotiated fairly -- I paid him about $4 to drive me into town to look at guest houses. When I decided on the Lani 1 Guest House -- a well-run, clean, tropical-style place of 1960's vintage with air-conditioned rooms (I took a big one with terrace overlooking the adjacent Wat Hai Sok temple for $35) and a friendly, helpful staff, I arranged for him to take me sightseeing the next morning.
Pheng was early, already waiting when I drifted back from breakfast. We set out on a tour of Vientiane's major temples -- there are half a dozen or so, splendidly peaked and gilded, of fairly recent vintage -- the oldest, Wat Si Saket, was built in 1818. I spent the rest of the morning in that state of awe and contemplation that comes from strolling among hundreds of silver and bronze Buddhas and admiring intricately carved wooden panels. When the sun got too hot I asked Pheng to drop me off at the guest house and return at 3:30. I wanted to enjoy Vientiane's most famous landmark, the That Luang, as the long rays of the sun bounced brilliantly off the towers covered in tons of gold leaf. That Luang is a stupa, a reliquary, not a temple; the legend is that it houses some of Buddha's bones.
There's a monastery adjacent to That Luang; shy young boy-novices in orange robes eyed me as I circled the stupa's perimeter. I thought they were staring out of curiosity; in fact they were working up the courage to approach me and practice their English.
Photong was 14. He said he had been studying English for only nine months. Slowly and carefully, he told me his story: his family was poor, from southern Laos. He was studying hard and very good in math; if he did well on exams, he might be sent to study at one of the Buddhist universities in Thailand.
When I mentioned that I might be going to a meditation class at Wat Sok Pa Luang the next day, Photong got excited. He took classes there, with the monks who studied under Abbot Ajaan Saali, the famous master of a technique called Vipassana. He insisted on accompanying me to the class, to show me around his school and the temple.
We arranged to meet the next day, and then Pheng dropped me off downtown, on Fa Ngum, the boulevard that fronts the Mekong River. In the cool of early evening, Laotians and foreigners sat on plastic stools at folding tables in improvised waterfront cafes, drinking Tiger beer, slurping noodles, and playing cards. I strolled along the banks for about half a mile, following the sound of gongs and drums, until I came upon an outdoor stage set up in a dusty lot. There a visiting Chinese opera company in full regalia was moving through its paces, slowly and elegantly. The opera was free, and so I sat down to enjoy the spectacle.
Walking home, about 100 yards from my guest house, I heard the sounds of Italian disco blasting from tinny speakers. Inside a storefront, about 20 Laotians of all ages were spilling out onto the street, waving glasses of beer. I paused to peek inside, and one of the women, laughing, grabbed my wrist and pulled me in; a man handed me a glass spilling over with beer, and a young girl started to dance with me. I went with the flow. But when an ancient, bearded Lao great-grandpa came over with the second tumbler of beer, I beat a polite retreat -- after all, I had a meditation date the next day.
Pheng drove me by the monastery the next afternoon to pick up Photong and we continued to Wat Sok Pa Luang. Pheng took a snooze while Photong led me into what looked like the jungle. The wat, a few miles out of town, is surrounded by thick tropical forest, which gives it a moody, otherworldly feel. We walked along a narrow path that led past wooden huts billowing smoke -- the wat, like Bangkok's Wat Po, is a center for herbal medicine, sauna and massage.
A bell was tinkling, and two nuns in white robes beckoned me and a handful of other Laotians and foreigners into an open-air temple. I spotted Sarah seated crosslegged on a straw mat. Another bell tinkled, and the aged abbot silently walked in, trailing sandalwood incense. I sat, closed my eyes, and drifted off.
Some time later -- I'm not sure how long -- the bell tinkled again. The nuns in white indicated with hand motions that we were to stand up and start walking -- in Vipassana meditation one learns to meditate in motion. And so, shoeless, our group formed a tiny parade on a dusty path that encircled the temple. Following the nuns' example, we took long, careful strides with a dramatic pause in the middle -- a stride I remembered from high school graduation. Around the path we went, and around and around again.
The path to enlightenment is long, and I didn't get there that afternoon. But that was O.K. Because, stepping slowly and carefully in my bare feet in Vientiane, I knew I had found the road less traveled.
 
The bottom line in one of the last of the People's Republics
I spent $46.50 a day on meals, transport and hotels in Vientiane.
 
Air fare
At the Blue and White Travel Center, 108/12-13 Khao San Road, Banglamphu, Bangkok, (66-2) 282-7705, fax (66-2) 281-3792, I booked a round-trip flight on Thai Airways from Bangkok to Vientiane. The fare was $174 including all taxes.
 
Visa
United States citizens require a visa for entry to Laos. Two-week and one-month visas are available. The fees and regulations have been in flux for the last year, as the Lao government adjusts itself to tourism. Visas can be obtained in Bangkok, where the Laotian Embassy usually processes a two-week tourist visa in two business days for $25. The Blue and White Travel Center will do the legwork for a fee of $8.50.
To apply for a visa from the United States, contact the Laotian Embassy, 2222 S Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20008; (202) 332-6416, fax (202) 332-4923. The charge is $35 plus a $15 service fee.
Malaria is a problem in rural areas of Laos. Anyone planning to visit should consult a doctor.
 
Hotels
The Lani 1 Guest House, 281 Set thathirat Road, Post Office Box 58, Vientiane, (856-21) 214919, fax (856-21) 215639, is a lovely hotel with about a dozen rooms in a cool, two-story tropical house, downtown within walking distance of restaurants, shops and the Mekong. The air-conditioned rooms have overhead fans, telephones (but no TV's), and high ceilings. Try to get one of the larger rooms ($30) that open onto a small terrace. The smaller rooms are $25. Book ahead.
I spent my first night at Le Parasol Blanc, 263 Sibounheuang Street, (856-21) 216091, fax (856-21) 222290), a favorite of foreign journalists. It has a swimming pool and an excellent restaurant set in a lush, hanging garden. But the management has changed recently, and my single motel-like air-conditioned room ($28) was dark and not very clean. It is also about a mile from downtown.
 
Restaurants
The in spots of the lively restaurant scene are constantly changing. Ask around over cappuccino at the Scandinavian Bakery, Namphou (Fountain) Circle, 215-199. Continental breakfast at the bakery costs about $2 to $3.
At Le Cote d'Azur, 62-62 Fa Ngum Road, a simple but well-prepared French meal of watercress salad, roast chicken, and a glass of Beaujolais nouveau was $7.
At Lo Stivale, 43 Setthathirat Road, I had a delicious Italian lunch: fresh handmade ravioli, insalata caprese, tiramisu and a glass of san giovese for $12.
Nazim's, Fa Ngum Road, (856-21) 233-480, is always crowded -- it serves very good, very fresh, and very cheap North and South Indian food. Dinner there, with a large Lao beer, came to around $5.
 
Activities
Every Saturday afternoon from 4 to 5, Abbot Ajaan Sali of Wat Sok Pa Luang leads a session of Vipassana meditation. It is free, but a small donation is customary.
Major temples are open to the public. Dress respectfully and be prepared to take your shoes off. Some charge a negligible admission fee.
 
Transportation
Taxis aren't cruising the streets in Vientiane, so if you want a driver you have to find one at the airport as you come in (the ride from the airport to town should cost about $3 to $4), or through your hotel. For sightseeing I paid $10 a day.
Motorcycles with jury-rigged passenger coaches ply the main streets of Vientiane; it's a hot, dusty way to travel but a cheap one -- about 60 cents to anywhere in town. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 2-6-00: The Ethicist;
The Talented Mr. Rip-Off

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
I'm an assistant to a screenwriter in Los Angeles. Here your boss is your mentor who will guide you to Your Next Big Opportunity. I believe in this system and I depend on it, as it has served me well, but now I'm being held back. Our scripts are valued at over $100,000 a draft, and these days every script is half mine. Meanwhile, I can't afford a new muffler for my car. It would be simple to get a job if I told the studio executives that the pages they were "loving" were mine. But this would mean breaching a business relationship with my boss. May I do it? -- Anonymous, Los Angeles
Let me make sure I understand the system you've come to believe in and depend on: you help your boss get credit for work he didn't do, and in return, he helps you get ahead through influence and connections. Well, you've certainly found the right industry and the right town for you. 
 I admire your faith in those studio executives and their ability to recognize merit, and that they'd of course believe you when you say the really good work in those scripts is yours. But here's another view.
"Almost everyone who contributes anything to a script develops the delusion that it's 'half mine,"' says the screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr., whose credits include "Three Days of the Condor" and "The Parallax View," "so I strongly doubt that going to studio execs with this plaint would make it 'simple to get a job.' On the contrary, he'd be labeled a disloyal nut case and be booted out the gate."
But to answer your question more directly: no, you may not violate your agreement with your boss. Fortunately, you have more honorable options.
You can tell your boss what you've told me. If he places the same value on your work that you do, he might be willing to promote you from apprentice dupe to journeyman dupe and share credit and money on your next project. Or, he'll find some other hungry young writer to exploit.
You can quit. Then go home, write a spec script on your own, sign your name to it and sell it on its merits. (You are free to use your contacts to make sure your script lands on the right desk.) Of course, relying on your own ability is a risky strategy, particularly in your business, where nearly everything that's written fails to sell.
You can work for someone better. That is, for a more honest thief, someone more likely to keep his end of a corrupt bargain. I suggest Satan. But it is surprisingly hard even to get an appointment without the right connections. Maybe your boss can hook you up.
By comparing prescription-drug prices, I found I could save $600 a year if I switched pharmacies. I showed my present pharmacist, and he agreed to meet the lowest prices. When I told my daughter that I should help other elderly people by publicizing the savings, she exploded, claiming that I was proposing to undermine the price system, driving a business into bankruptcy. What do you think? -John Maher, Prior Lake, Minn.
I think you are upholding an essential mechanism of the free market: informed customers, aware of their options, choose wisely, and merchants adjust to those economic decisions. Or as my Aunt Bernice, so fond of misquoting John Stuart Mill, summed up the great man's economic theories: "Shop around for the best price." You have not revealed state secrets; spread the word with a full heart.
A physician, I recently prescribed Viagra to a patient. Shortly after, his wife, also my patient, disclosed that they've not been intimate for months. On the one hand, his private affairs are none of my business. On the other, his wife is likely to feel betrayed if she discovers I've given him the means to satisfy his needs. What should I do? -P.M., Ohio
Unless he is doing real physical damage, you must respect the husband's confidence. Few would seek medical care if a physician could take it on herself to violate a patient's privacy. It would be a different matter if you were treating the wife for, say, a venereal disease contracted from the husband; then you'd have to speak up. (As 19th-century doctors often did not. Indeed, they frequently lied to the wife about what they were treating her for.)
As you've discovered, the interests of husband and wife do not always coincide. The best way for you to avoid such conflicts in the future is to see only one member of a family, a practice many psychiatrists observe. As things stand now, without violating anyone's privacy, you can still draw out either of these patients about their marital discontents or suggest counseling.
On the bright side, perhaps the husband is not unfaithful, but has found some other, socially beneficial, use for Viagra. Didn't I read about corn that grows straight and strong, 50 feet high? Isn't there a car that goes a thousand miles on a single tablet?
Do you have ethical queries that you need answered? Send them to ethicist@nytimes.com or The Ethicist, The New York Times Magazine, 229 West 43rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

Costly Active-Adult Homes Find a Niche in Chester

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
FROM a distance the big new homes rising just off Old Chester-Gladstone Road in Chester Township look like most others rising in and around this wealthy Morris County community. But they are attached homes, side-by-side, designed to look like one of their stately neighbors -- and they are only for active adults age 55 and older.
With an average selling price of $421,000, the 120 houses, each 2,100 to 2,900 square feet in size, that make up the Four Seasons at Chester are considered both large and expensive by market standards. 
 But K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, which is developing the Chester project, and a small group of other developers say there is a demand for active adult communities with large homes.
At present, the average active-adult home is 1,800 square feet in size and costs $170,000, said William E. Becker, a housing consultant in Teaneck specializing in adult communities. Such communities cater to people in their retirement and pre-retirement years and offer a maintenance-free lifestyle with recreation and socializing.
Mr. Becker said the reason for the demand is simple. "People in this age group today have more money," he said referring to them as the "bounty generation." And the strong economy and a robust housing market have made it easier for them to sell their existing homes at an increasing profit, Mr. Becker added.
About 15 active-adult communities, with a total of 6,500 units, are under way in the state and an additional 1,000 to 2,000 units are planned, Mr. Becker said. Just 5 to 10 percent of those units carry price tags of $200,000 or more, he added.
There are other factors stoking the state's active-adult housing market in general and, by extension, the luxury end of it. Among them is the fact that people 55 and over are living more active lives, are working longer and continue to choose to stay close to where their families are and to where they always lived, industry professionals said. Despite an increasing sentiment against growth, some municipalities where development is occurring prefer adult homes to other housing types because they do not have school-age children in the households.
Demographics is another factor, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Urban Policy and Planning at Rutgers University. "Next year the first boomers, who make up 2.8 million of the state's 8.1 million population, turn the double nickel and then we're in for an 18-year surge in the number of people age 55 and over," Dr. Hughes said. "It is the market to go after. But the question is, 'What house type do they want?' "
Developers are betting there will be a sizable wave of buyers who will choose active-adult housing and the lifestyle it offers and that some of them will opt for luxury as well.
The $50 million Chester project, which is expected to be completed in two years, will test the market's upper limits. It is the highest-priced active-adult community Hovnanian has developed in the state since 1994 when it re-entered the retirement market after a 10-year absence. The company has since developed or is developing six other such projects, totaling 2,927 units. Prices average $140,000 in the least expensive complex to $256,000, not including Chester.
The Chester project is a "niche community," and makes sense for several reasons, said Gabe Pasquale, vice president of marketing and sales for Hovnanian's northeast region. One factor, he said, is that it is near Route 206 and in north Jersey, where there are few active-adult communities. The market is affulent couples in Morris, Hunterdon and Warren Counties who are still working and want to remain in the area where they now live.
Such couples, Mr. Pasquale said, are moving from large homes and want a maintenance-free lifestyle, but do not want to compromise on space. He noted that new single-family homes in the area were selling from $700,000 to over $1 million, adding that Chester wanted active-adult housing.
The 120 stucco and stone-clad two-story houses will have three or four bedrooms, with the master bedroom on the first floor in most models, two-car garages and basements. They will be clustered on a 60-acre gently sloping site. It is small compared with sprawling active-adult developments of the past, most of them in Ocean County, where large tracts are still available.
But Mr. Pasquale said the project's size appeals to affulent buyers who also don't mind the lack of a golf course, an amenity in many of the larger communities, because "they usually already belong to a country club." Amenities planned include a clubhouse and a swimming pool; common charges will be $203 a month.
I 'M not going to say there wasn't a little 'hmmmm' before starting a project at this price range," Mr. Pasquale said. But, he said, since construction and sales started in November contracts have been signed for 40 of the homes, priced from $390,000 to $450,000. He said the company, "which has always followed the baby boomers," is planning other upscale active-adult communities, including one in Readington Township with 180 units.
Continental Properties of Woodbridge also thinks there is a market for such projects and will start construction this fall on Cedar Village at Holmdel, with 158 single-family detached homes for active adults. It will rise over the next two and a half years on 60 acres along Laurel Avenue at the intersection of Route 35 in this Monmouth County suburb.
Location is a key factor, said Steven Fisch, a Continental principal. "Holmdel," he added, "is an affulent area where there is a high demand for such housing from an aging baby boomer population, who love the area, still work, and live within a 15-mile radius of this site."
The trend toward smaller-scale communities is driven by the lack of large buildable sites in established areas, like Holmdel, and the perception that mammoth developments are impersonal, he said. Each of the four other active adult projects his company is planning comprise less than 300 units and is in a wealthy community, he added.
The $40 million Cedar Village at Holmdel is part of a large mixed-use project that will offer a 235,000-square-foot retail center as well as 110 assisted-living units and a nursing home. The other components each will be built by separate developers.
Mr. Fisch said the proximity to the other uses will be an advantage because it will offer a village-like setting with easy access to shopping and, "if they want, a transition" from independent to assisted living.
He added that at Cedar Village, which will be a gated community, the homes will be heavily landscaped, with post-and-rail fences between lots to provide privacy. The homes will have 1,500 to 2,500 square feet of space on two floors and such features as two-car garages and basements. There will also be a 5,000-square-foot recreation center. Though prices have not yet been set, Mr. Fisch said he expected them to range from $275,000 to $375,000. Monthly maintenance fees are expected to be $200 to $250.
Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., a relative newcomer to the adult-housing market, is also planning upscale communities. "The market is ripe and boomers in general have more money to put into their homes," said Wayne S. Patterson, senior vice president at the company, which is known for its high end single-family detached homes.
One project, off Route 9 in Freehold Township, is now planned to have 300 homes with 1,900 to 2,400 square feet of space, with prices expected to start in the $250,000 range. Mr. Patterson said his company also was in discussions with officials in a wealthy north Jersey community, whose name he would not disclose, to build 75 attached single-family homes with 2,400 to 3,000 square feet priced in the mid- to upper-$300,000 range.
"Ultimately, our objective is to position ourselves in this market like we have in the non-age-restricted single-family move-up market," he said.
Dr. Hughes said the success of such projects would determine how many other developers will follow suit and "give us evidence of what boomers want." But, he said, he wonders about the tag age-restricted, given that many of the intended buyers "don't want to be labeled mature."

The Dwindling Population of Fishers Island Is Isolated by State Borders and Winter's Winds

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

DATELINE: FISHERS ISLAND

 BODY:
WILLIAM BLOETHE pulled his grocery van up to the pier at Silver Eel Cove at 7:30 one January morning to collect his morning delivery, a bundle of newspapers and magazines. With the temperature in the single digits and the wind blowing to make it feel like 30 below, he left the engine running while he went aboard the ferry, but even a few minutes outside was enough to leave his fingers near frozen.
"Fishers Island is a great place to live if you can stand the winters," Mr. Bloethe said, pulling his hands from their gloves and rubbing them briskly. "Every winter you get aggravated and you want to give it up, but nobody wants to move in the middle of winter. Then in April the weather starts to warm up and the people start to come back and things get real busy, and you don't have any time to think about it." 
 In the winter, the Fishers Island movie theater shuts down. So do the coffee shop and the barber. There are three churches (Catholic, Episcopalian, which also closes for the winter, and United Church of Christ) and two gas stations, but no dentist.
In the summer, the island supports two golf courses. In the winter, sportsmen hunt pheasant on one. Residents get to use the other at no charge because there is no staff to collect the greens fees. The two state troopers who are here from May 1 to Thanksgiving leave the island to part-time constables.
Fishers Island is part of Southold town, whose officials worry whether Fishers Island can maintain a large enough year-round population to sustain itself. In the 1960's, more than 600 people lived there year round; there are fewer than 300 today.
"It's a constant concern out here," said Louisa Evans, the Fishers Island representative to the Southold Town Council. "We worry all the time about how we can keep people, and how we might be able to attract more.
"What's optimal? Certainly more people than we have now. In the school it would be nice to have more children in the classroom. If the population gets much older, will there be enough young people for the fire department?"
The school, a "magnet" school with 12 grades, has 75 students, including 19 who commute from Connecticut and one from Rhode Island, who pay tuition.
Also in the winter, the peculiarity of its local government becomes a little more apparent. Southold is 20 miles -- or two ferry trips -- away. The only ferry serving Fishers Island operates out of New London.
As the Southold town supervisor, Jean Cochran, notes, "They even have a Connecticut ZIP code; when it had a New York ZIP code, no one could figure out how to get the mail out there."
But she added, "We have people stationed over there from our fire department. We have our police constables over there. Our highway department serves Fishers Island, and we go over once a year as a town board, in the summertime, and have one of our board meetings there. It's a good connection, and we enjoy going over to visit."
At just seven miles long and never much more than a mile wide, with frigid winds off the Sound whipping the island into a deep freeze from Thanksgiving to Easter, it is hard to figure out why people might want to live here year-round.
"Can you really call this living?" Charles J. Morgan asks as he warms himself with a cup of coffee in Mr. Bloethe's store. He came to the island 50 years ago. "To live here year-round, you have to be a certain type of individual, self-reliant and able to live on your own. You've got to have hobbies. I wouldn't go to the movies if they had it open all year round. I read and I have my photography and I play golf, even in the winter."
But the real islanders, not the 4,000 residents who show up in warm weather, take perverse pride in being able to eke out an existence. They boast openly about how many things shut down, about how they tough it out until the ice is off the rocky shores and the tourists return.
The winter population is also steeped in tradition. They refer to the "new" firehouse, built in 1964, and the "new" schoolhouse, which two generations of islanders have already attended.
A semiretired gardener, Mr. Morgan still looks after two homes on the island, including one where he has tended plants for almost 40 years. If he has enough time, he also tinkers with two old cars, a BMW and a Toyota.
"Everybody here is pretty self-sufficient. We just kind of take winter in stride," Mr. Morgan said. "Some people come up here and the first winter, the first time the boat gets cancelled, they panic. Well, where are you going to go if there's a bad storm, even if the ferry was running? It's not like it's never going to come back."
It's a question of perspective. A visitor may complain that roads are unplowed days after a storm. An islander says it slows down the traffic. In fact, people tend to walk their dogs down the middle of the road, and seem genuinely surprised when they have to move over for traffic. But the islanders are friendly; city dwellers may be surprised to see that drivers wave with all their fingers.
Everyone helps out when he can. When one resident had a flat tire on her way to Bloethe's Market, a passer-by gave her a ride, even though it was out of his way. After she called the service station, Mr. Bloethe offered her the use of the delivery van to get her groceries home. When Mr. Bloethe's Jack Russell terrier saw the keys come out, he started bouncing around, looking for a ride, so she took the dog with her, promising to return him later that day.
"That's the way it is when you know everybody," Mr. Bloethe said.
For a long time, the island did not have a doctor, but it had an arrangement with a New York teaching hospital that rotated internists out to the island every two weeks. "You knew right away who the doctor was when they got off the ferry," Mr. Bloethe said. "It was the only person you didn't know."
There is a resident doctor now, semiretired, but an important safeguard for the islanders.
First settled in 1615, Fishers Island has attracted tourists since the late 19th century. The year-round population has never been large, though, in part because of the winters. Jobs are few: a couple of positions at what is referred to with a smile as the Boroleum factory, a small building that packages an ointment for skin ailments; a few lobstermen, some jobs at the utilities department and on the road crew.
But some famous people have called it home during the summers: Rockefellers and Roosevelts, DuPonts and Firestones. Many still maintain homes there, but the seasonal residents (islanders call them "the families") value their privacy, and the year-rounders respect that. There is a strong economic interest to observe the policy: many islanders work at the seasonal homes.
Paul Rogan, who came to the island in 1931, will tell you that he has been handyman, bartender, groundskeeper and gardener for a succession of famous people, but he will not tell you which ones.
When Mr. Rogan, who is known as Joe, was growing up on the island, the Army still operated Fort H. G. Wright at the western end. The concrete bunkers that once held heavy artillery to fight off a feared invasion force from Germany stand empty; a fence around the 1,800-acre post is rusting.
One house on Hay Harbor, the next bay east, is familiar to visitors: the shingled summer house where Robin Williams and Glenn Close filmed "The World According to Garp." (Mr. Rogan's daughter was an extra in the film.)
Since the military left half a century ago, Mr. Rogan has made his living on the eastern end of the island, where only residents and guests may travel; the roads there are privately owned by the Fishers Island Development Corporation.
He says the lack of Burger Kings or Dunkin Donuts does not bother him. "I like seafood, and I can dig all the clams I want when everyone leaves," Mr. Rogan said. "I don't like to do it in the summertime because it'll show people where my spots are, and they'll go in and clean them right out."
He tries to get over to Connecticut every week or 10 days, and he generally tries to accomplish several errands: shop, see a doctor, do some banking. If you forget to buy aspirin and come down with a headache in the middle of the night, you have only one choice: "You have to call Billy and get him to open the store."
Fishers Island is desolate when the temperature drops, and Marlin Bloethe, who runs the grocery store with her husband, said islanders think of their ferry trips to Connecticut as more than just a jaunt to the mainland.
"It's nice, but sometimes it gets too quiet, and you have to get on the boat and go back to America," she said. "All there is to do is work around the store and walk the dog."
The highest point on the island is just 140 feet above sea level, a promontory where the utilities district has mounted a water tower. No matter where you are on the island, you can see the ocean all around. And no matter which way the wind blows, you can feel it anywhere.
"People out here call Connecticut 'the mainland,' " said Justin Fisher, 20, who moved to the island with his mother last year. "The first time you hear that, it gets to you. It's not like we're in another country. But after 20 years in Connecticut, it was a bit of a culture shock. I mean, one store on the whole island? When I was back home there was a Cumberland Farms down the street, and a McDonald's. You miss things like that. Just to have a mall would be great."
Alison Scroxton, 21, who works in Bloethe's Market, grew up on the island, and said she used to feel the same way.
"My class was a big class, and it was a class of six," she said. "One boy; all the rest were girls. None of us could wait to graduate high school; we all were going to get out. It was boring, nothing to do, nowhere to go.
"Now I love it. The majority of my classmates, when I talk to them, they regret ever having left. They couldn't wait to get off this rock, but when they have a school break, they can't wait to come back."
Winters are still not the busiest times, she said, but the islanders keep busy. "A few of us just started up our aerobics class,." Miss Scroxton said. "We have a girls' softball league. And we go down to the American Legion once in a while and play cards."
Her father, Edward, a 20-year member of the Fishers Island highway crew, is commander and head bartender at the Legion Post, the only wintertime nightspot, open 365 days a year. There is microwave popcorn and toaster pizza, and a barbecue pit if someone wants to grill a cheeseburger in good weather.
"To a degree, it takes an exceptional individual to live out here in the wintertime," Mr. Scroxton said. "You see the steam rising off the salt water like that, and you know the air temperature is going to be cold when you step out the door. So you spend time inside when you have to. I'll sit in my chair and break apart a fishing reel and clean it or repair it. Everybody keeps busy."
"But it also tends to bring out the best in a few people," he continued. "I've thought about leaving before, but I just can't seem to get it out of my system."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.;
Interest on Security, Less a Fee

 BODY:

Q. I have received a formal notice from a bank saying that I received $33.45 in interest on my security deposit. The notice also indicates that $16.13 of that amount was being deducted by the bank as an "agent administration fee." What right does my landlord have to give any part of my interest to others? May I insist that the full amount of the interest be paid to me? . . . Richard Ferris, Manhattan.
 
A. Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that under current law a landlord who has deposited a tenant's security deposit in an interest-bearing account is entitled to receive an "administration fee" of 1 percent of the amount on deposit. That fee, Ms. McGuire said, is typically deducted from the interest earned on the tenant's deposit. And since the interest rate on such accounts to be as low as 2 percent per year, she said, it would not be unusual for the landlord's administration fee to amount to half of the total interest paid on the deposit. 
 Ms. McGuire added that since the landlord is entitled to the administration fee, he is also entitled to assign his right to collect the fee to someone else, such as the bank at which the deposit is held.
 
Succession Rights In a Second Marriage
 
Q. I am the shareholder of an occupied, rent-stabilized co-op apartment. When I purchased the apartment from the prior shareholder, the tenant was an elderly gentleman whose name was the only one on the lease. Prior to his death last year, he married. Under the law, I was required to offer his lease to his widow. She has informed me that in the near future she may marry. If she does legally marry and passes away, am I obligated to offer her lease to her new spouse? . . . Michael L. Altman, Jackson Heights, Queens.
 
A. Felix Nihamin, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under the Rent Stabilization Law, a husband or wife becomes entitled to succession rights to a spouse's apartment upon the commencement of the marriage.
Accordingly, Mr. Nihamin said, the original tenant's new wife was indeed entitled to succeed to her husband's lease under the same terms and conditions he had as long as the apartment was her principal residence when he died.
Mr. Nihamin added, however, that the same would not apply to the current tenant's potential husband. He explained that while a new husband would be entitled by law to remain in the apartment upon the death of the wife, he would probably have to pay a higher rent.
"The law says that the first succeeding tenant continues to be treated in the same manner as the original tenant," Mr. Nihamin said. "But with the second succeeding tenant -- in this case, the new husband -- the landlord is entitled to treat the succession as a new tenancy and impose a vacancy allowance." In most cases, he said, the current vacancy allowance is 20 percent for a two-year lease and 18 percent for a one-year lease.

HEADLINE: After Much Delay, a Plan for Raymark Site

BYLINE: By ANNE M. AMATO

 BODY:
IT looks like the world's biggest parking lot. Just off Interstate 95 in Stratford, the 34-acre site where thousands of workers once produced brake linings and one of the best women's softball teams played is now paved over and vacant. But after years of delays, a massive cleanup of hazardous waste and several lawsuits, the area is about to become a mall.
The site where the Raymark plant was once located was sold to three retailers, Shaw's Supermarkets, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, last month for $24 million. The first store is expected to open next year. 
 "It's been a long time coming, but well worth the wait," said Diane Toolan, the director of Community and Economic Development for Stratford. "The land will become the gateway to our town."
Raymark, formerly known as Raybestos, manufactured brake linings from 1919 to 1988 at the East Main Street site. At the height of its operations, it employed about 4,000 and made nearly 11 million feet of linings each year. Its woman's softball team, the Raybestos Brakettes, was so good that it toured around the world.
But the asbestos used in making the brake linings contaminated the soil, resulting in a Superfund cleanup by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which cost the federal government nearly $100 million. Other contaminants, like lead, PCBs and dioxin, were also discovered there.
The cleanup, which involved putting a protective cap over the layers of contamination, was completed in 1997, but the land sat empty due to lawsuits that eventually led to an auction on Jan. 19, ordered by a federal judge at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport handling the bankruptcy of the company.
Details, including how much each company will pay for the land, are still being negotiated, said Keith Morris, community affairs director for Wal-Mart of Bentonville, Ark.
He said Wal-Mart would build a 139,000-square-foot store, which will have the "usual 36 departments of general merchandise." The store will employ about 250 people, with about 70 percent of them full-time. "We should be open by the end of 2001," he said. This will be the 15th Wal-Mart in the state and the second in Fairfield County. A 120,000-square-foot Wal-Mart opened in Shelton a couple of years ago.
"Based on the success of that store, and on Stratford's population and the proximity of the site to I-95, we thought this location would be ideal for another one," Mr. Morris said.
Atlanta-based Home Depot, which has 14 stores in Connecticut, plans to build one of its standard size stores, said John Simley, a company spokesman. He said the store would be 115,000 square feet with a 16,000-square-foot outdoor garden. It will employ 150 to 200 people, a mix of full- and part-timers. "We haven't set a completion date for construction," he said. "That all depends on town permitting approvals. But we would like to move into Stratford as soon as possible. It's a very good location and with two other major retailers, we will be able to feed off each other."
Bernard Rogan, a spokesman for Shaw's, said it was a long time coming, but the end result was worth it. "We couldn't be happier," he said. "This site is very valuable and was much sought after. It couldn't be in a better location."
Once Shaw's builds its 65,000-square-foot supermarket on the site, it will close another store just up the road on Barnum Avenue, near the intersection with Main Street. At 25,000 square feet, that store is Shaw's smallest, employing less than 100 people. The new store, which will include a bakery and pharmacy, will have double that number of workers, Mr. Rogan said.
Shaw's, based in Brockton, Mass., operates 165 supermarkets in New England, 21 of them in Connecticut.
Construction on the new store should take from 8 to 10 months after they get permits. "We would like to move this along quickly, once we get the necessary permits from the town," Mr. Rogan said.
That shouldn't be a problem, according to Gary Lorentson, Stratford's Planning and Zoning administrator, who said the property is already zoned for commercial use.
He said there had been "enough preliminary hearings" on the property to rule out any major glitches.
"As long as the buildings are within zoning regulations, I don't foresee any problems," Mr. Lorentson said.
Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat, called the sale of the Raymark site "great news for the people of Stratford." She said the development of the property would bring in jobs, critical for the "economic viability of our community."
She said she was pleased not only because the land was being put to good use, but also because "Stratford will gain nearly a half million dollars in back taxes" on the site.
"The town has been dragging in economic growth and this will only help us," added State Senator George Gunther, a Republican of Stratford.
James Leach, a developer from Rhode Island, had also seen the potential of the site and once had a purchase agreement on the property. But the bankruptcy auction halted his plans and Mr. Leach was one of several unsuccessful bidders at the auction. "I spotted it one day and realized its potential," Mr. Leach said about the site.
Although he is no longer involved with the property, Mr. Leach said he was happy with the results.
"Those are the companies we brought to the site and had been working with," he said about the retailers.
 Raymark had its beginnings in 1902 in Bridgeport when the A. H. Raymond Company, which made brake linings for cars, was formed. In 1906, a process for making the linings, called Raybestos, was patented. Raybestos also became the name of the company when it moved to the Stratford location in 1919, said Lewis Knapp, Stratford's historian.
He said demand for the brake linings soared when Buick pioneered its 4-wheel drive automobiles. In 1927, the company merged with Manhattan Rubber to become Raybestos-Manhattan.
"There was an upswing during the 1940's, especially due to World War II, when the company supplied brake linings and clutches for the U.S. military," said Mr. Knapp. That upswing continued into the 1950's.
The company did about $83 million worth of sales in 1953, he said.
In the 1950's and 1960's the company diversified and opened factories in Wisconsin and New Jersey where bowling balls were made, he said. About the same time environmental concerns began to surface, especially due to the asbestos used in the manufacture of the brake linings, Mr. Knapp said. This led to lawsuits and a slowdown in business and by 1989, when the company closed its doors for good, there were only 190 employees, he said.
Then, in the spring of 1993, a public health advisory was issued based on the discovery of elevated levels of lead, asbestos and PCB's at the factory site, prompting the Superfund cleanup. That began in September 1995 and was completed two years later, in October 1997.
The cleanup included the demolition of factory buildings that had become an eyesore.
"It's really a shame the way it happened," Mr. Knapp said. "I knew people who worked there, including a general manager and no one knew about the problems with asbestos. Sometimes I think they wanted to portray everyone there as monsters and that's just not the case."
Now that the future of the site has been settled, the town is happy at the outcome.
"I think we are all very eager to move forward with this," said Ms. Toolan. "We have three well-known retail giants ready, willing, and able to move here. This bodes very well for our town."

The number to call to register for free limited seating or to obtain more information is (203) 238-2344.
Landlord High Jinks
The Da Capo Opera Company of Redding will present a performace of Sir Arthur Sullivan's "Cox and Box," suitable for family audiences, today at 3 p.m. in the Community Room of the Easton Library on Morehouse Road.
William S. Gilbert, Sir Arthur's customary collaborator, did not participate in this production. The lyrics were written by Francis Burnand, who later became the editor of Punch, the British humor magazine.
The story revolves around Bouncer, an unscrupulous landlord who finds it economically advantageous to rent the same room to Mr. Cox, who works days, and Mr. Box, who works nights, since they will occupy it at different times. Until one of them gets a day off and all heck breaks loose. Admission is free. The number to call for more information or directions is (203) 372-9586.
Cool Portraits
Alex Katz, whose outsized, probing yet cool portraits have intrigued viewers for decades, will give a talk about his work on Wednesday at 6:30 at the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street.
His portraits and landscapes, seeming so effortlessly meticulous, have been assembled by museums many times and sent on tours of the United States and Europe. Solo exhibitions are currently on display in Italy and Germany, and he is represented in numerous museum and private collections.
Admission is free. The number to call is (203) 432-0600.
 
Gentlemen in Tuxes
Now in their third year, the Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus Singing Valentines are a definite hit. On Saturday and next Sunday, the chorus's office will dispatch small groups of tuxedo-clad gentlemen to serenade the designated beloveds (male or female) on their doorsteps, anywhere within the state of Connecticut. The balladeers bear Valentine gifts of chocolates and bottles of bubbly (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) with two glasses. The price: $75 for everything.
Greater dedication hath no tenor, baritone or basso than to stand in the snow and sing love songs to a total stranger. Senders must place their orders no later than Tuesday by calling (800) 644-CGMC.
 
'Love Letters'
Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman will give a single performance of A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" next Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Westport Country Playhouse as a benefit for the theater's regeneration.
Ms. Woodward has been a prime mover in rescuing the building from a succession of development plans that would have insured its demolition. Together with a small group of regional theater stalwarts, and with the support of Mr. Newman and virtually the entire town, she is determined to see the playhouse thrive once again.
Tickets range from $150 to $750. For the top ticket the bearer gets to break bread from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. with Ms. Woodward and Mr. Newmanas well as Frank Converse, James Naughton, Christopher Plummer, Jane Powell, Jason Robards, Marlo Thomas and Gene Wilder, among others.
The number to call for reservations or more information is (203) 227-5137. The theater is at 25 Powers Court, near the junction of Route 1 and Route 136.
 
Pristine Keepsakes
Art conservation is not necessarily confined to the hallowed works in museums and high-powered collections. Ordinary folk with a few prints, family documents, old maps picked up at a garage sale, a tear-stained dance program, are just as entitled to keep their paper keepsakes as pristine as possible.
Today at 2:30, at the Pine Street Library in Cornwall, they can learn how to go about it by attending a slide-talk by Lilly Hollander, a Fellow of the American Institution of Conservation. Some problems, they will learn, are best left to a professional, but others can be handled at home, and most importantly, the proper methods of safeguarding such treasures in the first place could be worth substantial dollars in repairs. Admission is $10 and the number to call for more information is (860) 672-6874.
 
Ben and Jerry
How did they do that? And after they did it so successfully, did they or did they not sell out? Jerry Greenfield of the ice cream makers Ben and Jerry -- environmentalists as well as socially reponsible and innovative entrepreneurs -- will tell it like it is (and was) on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Kelley Theater at Quick Center for the Arts, Fairfield University.
To hear how two boys from Brooklyn and Merrick, Long Island, wound up famous from behind an ice cream counter in Vermont (and for a product sample) call (203) 254-4010 for a $15 ticket, children and those 65 and older $10. ELEANOR CHARLES

A Town's Awkward Silence

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY DUMAS; Timothy Dumas is the author of "A Wealth of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America's Richest Community." (Warner Books, 1999)

 BODY:
WHEN the Moxleys of Greenwich could no longer abide living across the street from a young man they suspected of murdering their daughter, they sold their house to an actor named Jon Lee.
Mr. Lee was pleased with his good fortune. The Spanish-style mansion sat stolidly in the middle of the waterfront enclave Belle Haven. Yes, the place needed sprucing up, and some sort of pall seemed to envelop it, but Mr. Lee could not complain: he had paid $290,000 for 24 rooms on two acres, a bargain in 1977. 
 Soon he noticed something odd. When he told friends where he was moving, they would arch their brows and say, "Ooh, the Moxley house," as if it were the Bates Motel.
Eventually, he learned his estate was a kind of unofficial landmark, ground zero of a bizarre local mystery. Since it was seldom discussed openly, Mr. Lee got the story in pieces: On the night of Oct. 30, 1975, as Martha Moxley made her way up the darkened front lawn, someone attacked her with a lady's six iron. With multiple blows, the killer crushed her skull, and then rammed a fragment of broken shaft through her neck. Martha Moxley was only 15 when she died, a girl whose only misfortune, it seems, was being the object of someone's intense desire.
A couple of months into the investigation, police detectives focused on Thomas Skakel, who was 17 and a known as a hothead. He was also a nephew of Ethel and the late Robert F. Kennedy. Over the next quarter century this murder story would take some preposterous turns, but the Skakel family never did break into the clear. On Jan 19, Thomas's younger brother Michael, 15 in October 1975 and 39 now, was arrested and charged with the murder. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Stamford on Tuesday.
In 1977, Mr. Lee, who has acted on Broadway and in movies, was curious about what had transpired on the lawn that was now his, but he was careful about asking too much. For one thing, nobody ever mentioned Martha's name: Mr. Lee likened her presence in Belle Haven to that of 19th-century pregnant girls who would just seem to vanish. For another thing, few found the business of this unsolved murder terribly pressing, though suspects lived in their midst. When the subject did arise, Mr. Lee said, it was in the context of an annoyance to be groused about over cocktails: Did you see they're dragging that up again?
Mr. Lee was puzzled by this attitude. When it came to an issue like goose poop in the parks or keeping outsiders off the town beach, sparks could fly. Indeed, when a dermatologist built a nice house in Greenwich but cut down all his trees and a few of the town's, some residents shouted obscenities at the house and sent anti-Semitic remarks, even death threats, through his phone line. That is worse than the Skakels ever got.
Yet with this murder, he saw little anger and no concerted push for justice. He did not believe his neighbors hoped for Martha's killer to go free, but rather that they naively wished the bad publicity away. It was, in essence, an invasion of privacy, a subject unfit for polite discussion.
How is such an attitude born? Let me start with a few safe opinions. Greenwich is a town of extraordinary beauty; a town that functions smoothly and safely; a town where all economic classes are represented, but where the wealthy are (especially nowadays, as in the 1920's) gaudily conspicuous.
For many residents, Greenwich is not merely a great place to live. It also symbolizes the fulfillment of one's ambitions. Arriving there means arriving in life. Natives like me also harbor a sense of the town's superiority, though I admit there's a fine line between feeling proud and being arrogant. Greenwich brims with good and thoughtful people, but it also has its share of snobs whose image of the town, so bound up in their images of themselves, admits no evil.
And here they do Greenwich a disservice. If you cannot own up to problems, you cannot fix them. When I was a young reporter for a Greenwich weekly newspaper, a drug counselor told me of rampant drug use at Greenwich High School. Of course, I had known about the problem from my days as a student there. But when we published the story, the newspaper got irate calls from the headmaster, and the drug counselor lost his job. Soon after, a couple of courageous students chastised the headmaster for failing to act on the drug problem that everyone knew existed.
This was far from the only time Greenwich was forced to admit to problems that dogged every other town. Racism had long simmered quietly beneath the surface, only to erupt in a series of ugly incidents in the 1990's: a near riot in a town housing project; a real estate agent caught on TV steering a black couple to Stamford and a white couple away from Stamford; and a racial hate message encoded by students in the Greenwich High School yearbook.
Perceptive Greenwich residents welcome a ruckus despite the unpleasantness, realizing that exposure is a means to resolution. But too often, the importance of image has triumphed over reality.
Big news stories out of Greenwich often follow the same trajectory. Like the Moxley murder and racism stories, they begin as subjects too indelicate for open discussion and end up, as though spring-loaded, detonating in the national news media, who always marry the act to the community's stupendous wealth.
It might seem contradictory, the outrage over small issues like geese and trees and the burying of deep, dark ones. But it makes perfect sense if you understand that Greenwich views itself as a suburban sanctuary, the closest thing to Eden in a fickle and ruthless world.
That is why so many residents seem on the one hand to refuse a knowledge of evil, and on the other to vigorously combat direct assaults on its way of life. Greenwich residents are aware that they live in a special place, and, no matter what it takes, they want it to stay that way.

HEADLINE: $1 Billion in Projects for Johns Hopkins in Baltimore

BYLINE: By CHARLES BELFOURE

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
JOHNS HOPKINS is known for its medical center and university, but its impact on its hometown is more concrete. Together the Johns Hopkins University and its medical center, with the help of their own development company, are the biggest builders in Baltimore. Over the next five years they plan to complete or begin work on $1 billion worth of buildings to expand and update their facilities.
This would have pleased its founder, Johns Hopkins, a merchant remembered for his dedication to the economic prosperity of his city. In the fall of 1873 he single-handedly averted a major financial crisis in Baltimore like those that were sweeping New York and other cities. By using his own money and his reputation, Hopkins guaranteed the stability of investments held by local businesses. When he died a few months later he left $7 million, a huge sum in its day, to create a university and a hospital to serve the people of Baltimore. 
 The influence of the university and the Johns Hopkins Health System cannot be overstated. In addition to being Maryland's largest private employers with 37,900 jobs, together they spent a total of $176 million for construction last year, the most of any business or institution in Baltimore.
Both entities will replace outdated academic and medical facilities and build new space for research, creating an estimated 4,500 construction-related jobs by the year 2004. Most of the planned construction is expected to be completed in the next decade.
"Hopkins is considered a top customer of the Baltimore Development Corporation for economic development in the city," said Jay Brodie, president of the quasi-governmental entity that promotes development.
Many feel that Baltimore, a city that has lost a third of its population since 1970, would be in far worst straits if it didn't have Hopkins as an employer and builder.
Hopkins has its own full-service real estate development subsidiary. Called Dome Corporation, its name is inspired by the famous dome of the original Johns Hopkins Hospital completed in 1889 that still stands on its East Baltimore medical center.
Dome Real Estate, a division of the corporation, develops and builds for Hopkins, but mainly for tenants of its research facilities -- private biomedical companies and federally financed laboratories. "We offer a complete range of development expertise," said Lester Conley, president of Dome Real Estate, "including programming, land planning, financing, construction, and property management." Development has been concentrated mainly within Baltimore City.
A for-profit entity, Dome was created in 1984 when Hopkins purchased the Baltimore City Hospital, a money-losing municipal health center. Its first job was to create a master plan for the 130-acre parcel, renamed Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus, which included new research facilities for private industry.
BECAUSE so many private companies want to be identified with Hopkins because of its reputation, they turn to Dome for its expertise in helping to develop their own facilities "while offering institutional sensitivity to their research needs," according to Mr. Conley.
Dome's biggest client at Bayview is the Institutes on Aging and Drug Abuse Addiction, part of the National Institutes of Health. The agency has a total of 276,000 square feet of laboratory and research space at Bayview.
In 1988, Dome built the 100,000-square-foot Triad Technology Center at Bayview, which provides space for biomedical firms, government and academic laboratories. A year later, Dome completed the 25,000-square-foot Alpha Center, a biomedical incubator building that offers inexpensive lab space for startup biotech firms.
When tenants such as the National Institutes of Health need to expand or renovate their facilities, they usually come to Dome for design and construction services. On most of the projects it develops, Dome stays on as property manager.
Dome builds directly for Hopkins at Bayview as well. It constructed the Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Center in 1989 and its Behavioral Biology Research Center in 1991. Dome is currently revising the master plan to increase the total campus development from 3.5 million to 5 million square feet.
Currently Dome's largest project is the $17 million renovation of the former Eastern High School in north central Baltimore. Built in 1936, the 200,000-square-foot Collegiate Gothic building will be used primarily for university administrative and academic functions, but will have space for tenants. "We'll be trying to attract businesses that relate to high technology and sciences, but not necessarily medical," explained Mr. Conley.
The school is on a 26-acre site on East 33rd Street, a major thoroughfare that connects with Homewood, the university's main campus less than a half mile away. It is hoped that the project will stimulate new development along this linkage. The size of the parcel also lends itself to future development of more buildings, Mr. Conley said.
Not all buildings for Hopkins are done by Dome. The facilities for the hospital, the university and the medical school, which is a part of the university, are done by the entities themselves using a traditional method of hiring an architect and putting the project out to bid.
The two newest buildings on the East Baltimore medical campus are prime examples of how this is done. The $125 million, 540,000-square-foot Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Building will house cancer patients as well as facilities for their surgery and treatment, explained Sally MacConnell, vice president of facilities for the Johns Hopkins Health System.
"We got extensive input from nurses, doctors, and families of patients to see how we could design it to be supportive and not look institutional," she added. The Weinberg Building is built next to the original hospital and was designed to harmonize with the building's Queen Anne style.
The $59 million Bunting-Blaustein Research Building, completed last December, houses all cancer research, which had been scattered in five buildings. It emphasizes bench to bedside research, bringing the latest treatment protocols from the laboratory to the patients as quickly as possible, said Ms. MacConnell.
Projects totaling more than $400 million on the East Baltimore medical campus in the next five years will include the 292-bed Women's and Children's Hospital; the 196-bed Critical Care Tower, which has its own heliport; the 300,000-square-foot Broadway Research Building and the 1,500-car Caroline Garage. Negotiations are currently under way to acquire an eight-acre parcel adjacent to the medical campus to construct a parking garage that may include a hotel with retail space and more medical facilities.
THE university is expanding its presence in downtown Baltimore by renovating a 38,000-square-foot building leased from Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles. It will become the School of Professional Studies, whose main offerings will be graduate degrees in business and education. Most of the $6.1 million cost of renovating the building, which is expected to be completed in December, is being borne by Mr. Angelos.
In 1988, Hopkins looked beyond Baltimore to suburban Washington to create a new campus. The university broke ground this past fall for its second building on the 38-acre site in Rockville, Md., in Montgomery County. The 50,000-square-foot building will add needed space for its part-time graduate programs. With course registration projected to increase 30 percent in each of the next five years, three more buildings are being planned.
Homewood, the university's main campus, will continue to grow with $173 million of construction including a new student arts center, a dorm, a recreation center, and a renovation of its original building, Gilman Hall. A new master plan to be completed this spring will probably identify the need for more improvements, said James McGill, senior vice president for administration.

New Jersey Fits the Prescription

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
IF you want to run with the big dogs, you have to go where the big dogs are," said Gerald P. Belle, the president of Aventis Pharmaceutical, about the company's decision to shift the operating headquarters of his newly merged company from Kansas City and suburban Philadelphia to Parsippany, N.J.
The pharmaceutical industry is in a phase of consolidation as companies seek to spread the cost of developing new drugs over a broader sales base. Increasingly, it is consolidating in New Jersey. 
 Drug company executives and consultants say there are a variety of reasons, some of them historical, that have led to the industry's concentration in New Jersey. And, as the recent decisions of a number of companies to move into the state or expand their New Jersey operations indicate, many leaders of the industry believe that a location in the state offers the advantageous combination of access to business and technical talent, regulatory agencies and global markets.
Pharmacia A.B. of Sweden and Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., initially chose an area near London as an operating base after the two companies merged in 1995. But within a year of the appointment of a former American Home Products executive, Fred Hassan, as chief executive, the company was hunting for headquarters space on the East Coast of the United States.
It landed first in Bridgewater, N.J., and then moved on to nearby Peapack, where it currently has over 1,000 employees in a 550,000-square-foot building once occupied by Beneficial Corporation. If the company completes its merger with Monsanto Company, as expected in the second quarter of this year, a spokesman said, much of Monsanto's pharmaceutical operations will be transferred from St. Louis to New Jersey.
"New Jersey was the jewel we were looking for," Mr. Hassan said after signing a 12-year lease for the Peapack building. "With 15 of the world's largest drug companies dotting the landscape, New Jersey truly was the nation's medicine chest." Mr. Hassan has also called New Jersey "the global center of gravity of the pharmaceutical industry."
Now called Pharmacia & Upjohn, the company will change its name to Pharmacia Corporation once the merger with Monsanto is completed, with the names Upjohn and Monsanto used to designate divisions within the overall company.
And another heavy hitter may be on the way. Two British companies, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham have announced their intention to merge, a merger that would create the largest drug company in the world.
The companies have already said they plan to place an operating headquarters in the United States, although the corporate headquarters will remain in London. The company has said they plan to build in the general vicinity of New York City and the betting in real estate circles is that it will be somewhere near Princeton.
Aventis will be staying in the state, but plans to move from Parsippany in Morris County to Bridgewater in Somerset County when two buildings, each with 310,000 square feet of space, are built. In the meantime it is renting 340,000 square feet of space as an interim headquarters from SJP Properties, a New Jersey-based developer and property owner that is also building the Bridgewater structures.
Mr. Belle said it was important to have the company's major administrative and research operations in one location to help create a brand image to go with a new name. "We have an opportunity to put a united front on Aventis before the financial community and the world at large," he said.
Some companies that have long been established in the state are expanding to keep up in the race to develop new medicines. Merck & Company has said it is investing $1 billion in its research and development facility in Rahway. Hoffman-LaRoche is building a new factory on its 125-acre tract in the towns of Clifton and Nutley that will be dedicated to its new anti-obesity drug, Xenical. Other companies have major projects under way as well.
The wave of mergers has meant that some properties are coming to market. Since research and development centers are costly and take a long time to build, the properties are attractive to companies who want to enter the United States market or expand their operations here.
"The pharmaceutical industry's capital investment is enormous," said Thomas Glerum, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage and services company. "Those research and development buildings cost $400 a square foot without equipment," he said. "High-end office buildings do not exceed $220 a square foot."
James J. Garibaldi, chief executive of the Garibaldi Group, a brokerage and services concern in Chatham, said that among the interesting properties coming on the market as a result of mergers is Aventis's research and development complex in Collegeville, Pa.
Aventis, which was formed by the merger of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, is consolidating its research and development at Hoechst's facility in Bridgewater, making Rhone-Poulenc's Collegeville facility surplus.
Another is a 1.7 million-square-foot research campus in Summit that is being offered for sale by Novartis. The company was formed in 1997 by the merger of the pharmaceutical division of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, and the combined company has decided to consolidate its research facilities and offices at the former Sandoz headquarters in East Hanover.
That leaves the former Ciba-Geigy property in Summit on the market. "A lot of pharmaceutical companies want to acquire it, but they want it instantly," said Andrew Merin, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey. But since construction in East Hanover will probably not be completed until 2003 or 2004, he said, instant gratification is not possible, at least for the entire property.
Mr. Merin said he expects the sale to take place this year, but Novartis is expected to lease about 400,000 square feet of space at the Summit site until the East Hanover buildings are completed.
All this activity and investment is producing results, according to a study underwritten by the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a trade group for the larger pharmaceutical companies in the state. More than 40 percent of all the new medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999 were developed by companies based in New Jersey.
Of the 40 new drugs and biological agents approved by the federal agency last year, 17 were from New Jersey companies. California, home to many new biological-development companies, was second with six approvals, and North Carolina was third with three.
THE industry has an outsized economic impact on the state, according to an economic survey conducted for the institute by the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting and consulting company. The survey, using 1998 data, found that the industry was responsible for 140,000 direct and indirect jobs in New Jersey and contributed $10.3 billion to the state's economy.
The report noted that the pharmaceutical companies themselves represent 57,629 full-time jobs, with 43,716 more in services, such as overseeing clinical trials, shifted from the companies to outside suppliers. Indirectly supported jobs, such as those in restaurants and other services used by pharmaceutical employees, brought the total to 140,000, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Those drug industry workers certainly have money to spend. Total compensation of workers at pharmaceutical companies, excluding benefits, averaged $80,223 per worker, the study found.
"The compensation level reflects the high proportion of industry employees with advanced scientific and business degrees, as well as the fact that almost one-fourth of the industry's employees work in the sophisticated research and development functions," the report said.
William H. Tremayne, president of the institute, which was formed in 1997 to give the hotly competitive industry a single voice, said the number of jobs makes the drug industry the largest manufacturing industry in the state, with twice as many as the second-ranking category, printing and publishing.
Patrick J. Zenner, the chairman of the institute and president of the American operations of the Swiss-based HoffmanLaRoche, said the industry's need for common voice was the result of the health care debates of the early 1990's. He said the industry was surprised to find that it was unpopular in some quarters.
"We were heavily criticized and realized we needed to do a better job of communications," he said. He said criticism based on the cost of new medicines overlooked the costly and complex nature of inventing new drugs. "It takes from 12 to 14 years between when a discovery" is made and when it comes to market as a drug, he said, "and it costs $500 million to bring a new medicine to the public. We don't think that message went out."
As to why the drug industry is concentrated in New Jersey, he said that in Hoffman-LaRoche's case, it was the result of a drive in the country.
The company, founded in 1896 in Basel, Switzerland, came to the United States in 1905, opening an office in New York City to sell medicines imported from Europe. As the business grew, it became clear that the company would have to begin doing research and manufacturing in this country and that doing so would be difficult in the cramped confines of Manhattan.
According to Mr. Zenner, Nelson Peterson, then the head of the company's United States operations, went for a drive in New Jersey in 1928. At that time, large tracts of land in the northern part of the state were still devoted to farms. Stopping for gas, he decided that a site straddling the Clifton-Nutley border just south of Route 3 would do nicely for a production plant and offices.
(A similar tale is told of why Johnson & Johnson is in New Brunswick. According to a corporate history, one of the brothers for whom the company is named, James, was on a Pennsylvania Railroad train headed for Philadelphia in 1886. As it slowed to cross the Raritan River at New Brunswick, he spotted a "To Let" sign on a four-story brick building in the town. It became the first headquarters of the company.)
Unlike some pharmaceutical companies that put manufacturing, administration and R. & D. in different locations, Hoffman-LaRoche does all three on its main campus. In addition to the building being constructed to make Xenical, Mr. Zenner said some older buildings have been demolished to make way for a new research complex.
Many of the other companies now in New Jersey have their roots in New York or, if foreign based, opened their first offices there. But as they grew, the cheap farmland in New Jersey beckoned because it was still close to the city and its port. At first they stayed close to the city or along the railroad lines, but as the state's highway system developed, they scattered around the northern part of the state.
Later, the easy accessibility to Newark International Airport became an important factor. "Accessibility to an international airport is important because these are global businesses," said Mr. Tremayne. "If you are located in the hinterland, you have to take a domestic flight to get to the international flight."
IN addition to international travel, New Jersey's location about an hour's flight from Washington is important to companies that have to be in regular contact with the Food and Drug Administration during the drawn-out process of seeking approval of new medicines, Mr. Tremayne said.
Many in the pharmaceutical industry observe that the concentration of drug companies in New Jersey has produced a pool of talent in the state that companies moving in can tap. This allows new entrants to hire researchers and executives without the expense of moving them from other parts of the country and allows individuals to move up the ladder without disrupting their families.
Within the pool of pharmaceutical talent, "New Jersey has the largest concentration of scientists in the nation," said Gualberto Medina, the state's director of economic development.
Joseph Palo, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who helped conduct the economic study for the HealthCare Institute, said that "access to talent is no small issue."
"We are talking about Ph.D.'s, M.B.A.'s and masters in public health," Mr. Palo said. "When pharmaceutical companies go shopping for these kind of people, they do so in large numbers."
He said the sites for meetings of professional and scientific societies was an indication of the number of highly educated people living and working in the state. "They are almost always in New Jersey, at places like the Newark Airport Marriott or the Princeton Hyatt," he said.
But the drug companies are often not happy about the prospect of their scientists mingling with those from other companies, out of a concern that research secrets may leak out and the danger that their brightest talents will be recruited by others. As a result they tend to build campus-like research facilities, both to replicate the academic settings where researchers received their training and to keep them on the reservation.
"These companies build self-contained developments with a ton of amenities to keep their scientists at home," said Mr. Merin of Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Medina said it became apparent about five years ago that the pharmaceutical industry was going to globalize and that his agency has been wooing companies still based offshore. "When Pharmacia & Upjohn was still in London, we sent a letter to Fred Hassan reminding him about New Jersey," he said.
Mr. Medina predicted that by the time the globalization process was completed, New Jersey would have gained 50,000 additional jobs in the industry, despite the layoffs that will come as a result of combining companies.
But Mr. Belle said state incentives were not the critical factor in the decision to locate Aventis in the state. "Missouri and Pennsylvania were pretty interested, too," he said. "So it is not a question of New Jersey winning the incentive pool. It was no better and no worse than the other states."
In the end, geography may have been destiny. Mr. Palo noted that about 32 percent of the drug industry's dollar sales are in the United States, 28 percent in Europe and 20 percent in Japan, with the rest scattered around the rest of the world. In a global industry, he said, drugs are launched simultaneously in the major markets.
"New Jersey is a pretty good place to be," he said. "It's about halfway between Europe and Japan."

In its 14-year history, the ChoDae Presbyterian Church in New Jersey has blossomed into one of the biggest Korean-American congregations in northern New Jersey. Its membership has grown to about 700 people from 50, and many of its three Sunday services in a rented 250-seat Lutheran church in Paramus are filled to overflowing.
After a four-year search for new land, ChoDae has chosen seven wooded acres near the ball fields and swim club of this quiet suburb of 5,700 people in northeastern Bergen County and has drafted plans for a handsome new $5 million church. Besides a 720-seat sanctuary, the building would include 14 classrooms for Sunday school and Bible study and a fellowship hall with two gymnasiums. ChoDae's senior pastor, the Rev. Young-Chin Cho, called the proposed church "our dream and our vision." 
 Yet pursuing the dream has led to a squabble, as so many development issues do in northeast New Jersey, whether the property at issue is being considered for a school, a synagogue or a Home Depot. The Norwood battle is not the only one connected with the rapid growth of Korean-American churches in the state since the mid-1980's, but it is one of the nastiest involving a congregation seeking to build a home of its own. Of the 170 members of the Council of Korean Churches in New Jersey, 140 do not yet have their own buildings.
Norwood's residents seem equally upset with the size of the church and with the town's board of adjustment for approving a zoning variance for the church last August without getting any advice from environmental, traffic or planning experts.
The outcry prompted the board last December to reverse itself and order new hearings on the necessary variance. ChoDae and its lawyer, Allen M. Bell, of Tenafly, responded by filing suit in New Jersey Superior Court, charging that the reversal violated the state's municipal land-use law.
So far, ChoDae has prevailed. Judge Jonathan Harris has blocked any new hearings by the board of adjustment and ordered it to legally justify its attempt to withdraw the variance. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 16.
Korean-American religious leaders in the state say they believe the ChoDae-Norwood fight -- with foes mounting townwide opposition and a church going to court -- is the most intense in the 15 years since first-generation Korean immigrants began establishing their churches in New Jersey. Although the number of Korean-American churches, most of them Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist, has grown sharply, most congregations rent space in other churches for Sunday services, weekday Bible studies and fellowship meetings.
About 200 Korean-American congregations exist in the state now, 170 of them belonging to the Council of Korean Churches, said the council president, the Rev. Hee Moon Lee, a Methodist minister whose 70-member congregation rents from an Episcopalian church in Edison.
Most of the 30 congregations in the council that have their own buildings purchased them from churches that had closed, he said. All pastors long for their own building, he said, but most congregations are small and are still raising money to buy land or build a church.
Mr. Lee said opposition from town governments or residents was "not a big problem" facing Korean-American congregations. He said the council planned to stay out of the ChoDae-Norwood dispute.
"Under our concept -- our Korean-Christian concept -- we usually don't participate in political issues," Mr. Lee said. "I don't want to have us participate in their struggle." He said the council's primary function was helping first-generation immigrants, primarily those struggling to learn English, with personal, social and economic problems.
Last November, Norwood's foes formed a townwide nonprofit organization, the Norwood Civic Association, to fight approval of the church. In two months, about 700 of Norwood's 1,850 families have joined the association, said the group's treasurer, Nejhla) Shaw.
Ms. Shaw said the association considered the proposed church too big. She contended it would create traffic congestion near the swim club and the athletic complex during Sunday games. In addition, she argued, dozens of trees in the wooded plot, which includes some wetlands, would be cut down, raising the risk of floods during heavy rains.
"It has nothing to do with Koreans," Ms. Shaw said. "It has nothing to do with a church. It has nothing to do with who has the church. It's the building, the complex. The building is too big. We've never had a building go up that big in town. It really doesn't serve the community or its residents."
The association's president, Joseph Vitale, denied the group was racially motivated. "Our issue is with the size," he said. "We're just looking to conserve the rural texture of the town."
He and Ms. Shaw both said many Norwood residents were surprised when the board of adjustment granted the variance in August..
"How does something this big pass without calling experts?" she asked. "That's what puzzles Norwood residents. No one understands it."
Town officials, including the four-term Mayor, Gus D'Ercole, a Democrat and lifelong resident, declined comment because of ChoDae's lawsuit.
Ms. Shaw and Mr. Vitale discounted notions that the civic association had political aspirations. But their contention that the organization represents about half the families in Norwood suggests it could exercise considerable political power in the future.
Pastors of Norwood's three existing churches -- which are Catholic, Episcopalian and Presbyterian -- all declined to comment on the ChoDae situation.
In recent weeks, the association has circulated fliers around town denouncing the proposed church. The fliers say the building will be 64,000 square feet.
ChoDae officials said that figure was incorrect and the actual size of the structure was 47,000 square feet.
Mr. Cho, the pastor, said critics were also incorrectly portraying the proposed Bible classrooms as a regular school.
"I don't understand why," he said. "The correct information is open to them."
Mr. Cho, a 41-year-old graduate of the New York Theological Seminary, said the classrooms and the gymnasiums would be open to the community when parishioners were not using them.
"The American system teaches us to learn about other cultures and to share with other cultures and harmonize," he said. "We want to open our building to the community, not only to Koreans but to everybody. We are not the enemy. We are your neighbors, too. We want to be a good neighbor."
He said ChoDae was prepared to contribute to Norwood's schools, library, fire department and ambulance squad, as it has in Paramus for years. He also said the congregation planned to continue the practice it started in Paramus of providing $3,000 a year for two scholarships for college students who are volunteers in the local ambulance squad.
Both the mayor of Paramus, Cliff Gennarelli, and the Rev. Thomas Hjembo, pastor of the Mission Church in Paramus, where ChoDae has paid rent for 14 years, praised the congregation in letters to Norwood's officials.
Mayor Gennarelli said ChoDae's departure from Paramus would create "an enormous void in our community."
Pastor Hjembo wrote that ChoDae had been "very generous" and had contributed to a new roof, a new organ and new carpeting at the Mission Church.
"America is a place where all people from other nations are welcome to seek freedom of religion without discrimination," he wrote. "Is Norwood part of America? Be generous and put up with a little traffic on Sunday morning."

Proposed Bank Merger Prompts Claims of Bias

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
While the longest economic expansion in history trickles down fitfully to city neighborhoods, a coalition of community groups working to rebuild them is recalling a problem that seemed to fade with the 1970's: the old-fashioned practice of redlining.
The accusations have arisen as a statewide consumer advocacy group, group New Jersey Citizen Action, has challenged the proposed merger of two giants, Hudson United Bank and the Dime Savings Bank of New York. 
 Last week, the New Jersey Black Ministers Council joined Citizen Action in calling on the state banking authorities to intervene in the merger on the ground that Hudson has written off minority neighborhoods and low- and moderate-income homebuyers.
Of more than 1,000 loans that Hudson made in New Jersey in 1998, only 9 went to blacks, according to data that Citizen Action compiled from reports to federal regulators. In Essex, Union and Morris Counties, two loans went to black applicants. The group said the bank made no loans to blacks or to low-income applicants in Hudson County, the bank's home base.
The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the ministers' council, said that "the bank has not made a serious effort to lend to qualified minorities."
While Mr. Jackson said there was "no more blatant example" than Hudson of a lender refusing to work with community leaders, he said the challenge to Hudson's merger "will remind other banks that they have an obligation to be fair in lending."
The ministers' council and Citizen Action also accuse the bank of reneging on a 1997 agreement with Citizen Action in which it pledged to set aside $4 million for investment in Newark, including home mortgages, housing development and loans to small businesses. Of that amount, it has lent $323,000, Citizen Action said.
Hudson officials have declined to respond to the complaints. A spokesman, Richard Edmonds, referred to a brief statement in which the bank said it was "cooperating to the fullest with the regulators in their review process."
The statement also said that in December the two banks pledged that the merged company, to be called Dime United Bancorp, would set aside $2.5 billion for low- and moderate-income borrowers in its new four-state market. The statement said that in annual reviews of its compliance with a 23-year-old anti-redlining law, federal regulators had given Hudson "satisfactory" ratings.
It is the 1977 law, called the Community Reinvestment Act, that gives groups like Citizen Action and the Black Ministers Council a role in policing banks. The law provides that when a bank applies for a merger or expansion, community groups can register a challenge if they believe it has failed to meet local banking needs.
As a result, many banks have negotiated agreements with coalitions of community groups -- in New Jersey, Citizen Action -- to invest in the urban areas where they have branches.
The law was supposed to have written an end to redlining. While several national studies in the last decade have shown that minority applicants were still significantly more likely to be turned down for mortgages than whites with similar incomes, they also found that, particularly after a flurry of enforcement efforts by the Clinton administration, mortgage lending to low-income people had risen significantly.
But more recently, those efforts have flagged, said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an umbrella group of community-based nonprofits.
"This is the kind of stuff that impacts millions of people, but people don't see it until branches close, and it becomes difficult getting small business loans, and they try to get a mortgage," he said.
Mr. Taylor added: "If I were the mayor of a major city, or a state legislator, I would wake up. What in the hell is in these banks but the assets of the people of New Jersey? It's not like the banks manufactured this money. It's borrowed from the people of New Jersey."
The Dime-Hudson merger was announced in September. The proposal was submitted to federal banking authorities in December and to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on Jan. 7. New Jersey Citizen Action has filed challenges with the Federal Reserve and the state banking department, which has until March 7 to review the merger application.
In the meantime, the organization picketed Hudson branches in several cities, including Newark, Woodbridge and Union City. Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, the director of Citizen Action, said it had enlisted the formal support of some elected officials, including the Hudson County Board of Freeholders and the Woodbridge City Council and its mayor, Jim McGreevey.
Ms. Salowe-Kaye said Citizen Action had agreements with 29 banks, including Hudson.
"All banks are not good," she said, "but none are this bad." Since the merger was announced, she said, Hudson has refused to discuss an agreement for the new bank, which will have more than 330 branches. "The attitude has been total arrogance," she said.
Ms. Salowe-Kaye said the 1997 agreement made no reference to race but only to income levels. Still, she said, "it's so jarring" to find that the bank made only two loans to African-Americans in the Newark metropolitan area in 1998.
The federal reports show that Hudson made 133 home loans to whites in the metropolitan area. Among other lenders, First Union Mortgage Corporation made 268 loans to blacks and 1,603 to whites; Summit Bank made 159 loans to blacks and 2,780 to whites; and Fleet Bank made 5 loans to blacks and 87 to whites.
Hudson's detractors allow that the bank did not deny many applications from minority applicants; the problem, they say, is that Hudson has had only a handful of them despite its presence in areas with large black and Latino populations.
"Other banks market their programs," said Wayne Smith, the council president in Irvington, who works with Citizen Action in counseling minority home-buyers. "They're out beating the drums for business. Some are working with local churches, some with nonprofit organizations, community development organizations. They advertise. They'll advertise in church bulletins."

HEADLINE: IN THE GARDEN;
Some Seedlings Really Need a Head Start

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
ALL too often when the garden season begins, there is a dash to the garden center, supermarket or hardware store to buy young plants. The choices may be limited, depending on the retailer, or the stock of a particular favorite may be gone.
Those who plan ahead and grow their own plants from seed don't have these problems. In addition, raising your own annuals and vegetables is deeply satisfying and economical. 
 This ritual should begin soon. Garden planners will have to be clear on what they will want to grow. The catalogs are here, for the most part. So decisions should have been made and the seed packets ordered.
When to plant? The tiniest seeds are the ones that seem to be the most difficult, requiring the longest time to get started. The almost pepperlike seed of snapdragons, petunias and begonias needs a good head start. The end of this month is not too soon. Pansy seed also could benefit from an early start as the plants can be set out to provide an early spring show along with the bulb flowers.
Other seeds for vegetables such as peppers, melons and squash, along with many showy summer flowers can be started in March. Tomato seed does not need to be planted until the end of March as the seedlings grow rapidly. The trick for strong tomato plants is to set the seedlings out when they are young and vigorous. Large tomato plants usually take a week or so to get settled in the garden before they truly amount to anything.
There is no mystique about starting plants from seed. There are many aids to make this task much easier, including one that comes from the Gardener's Supply Company, 128 Intervale Road, Burlington, Vt., 05401.
This company has developed, and patented, a special seed-starting system called the Accelerated Propagation System.
The system, which comes in several sizes, all easy to place in the home, consists of a greenhouse cover to retain heat and moisture, a growing tray, capillary watering mat, pegboard stand for the seedling tray and a water reservoir on the bottom. It will supply enough water for the plants for an entire week, which means you can go on vacation and all will be well until you get back.
To fill these trays the same company also supplies seedling starting soil mix, which is finely milled, plus potting mixes that can be used for later transplanting when the seedlings mature.
More skill is required when planting other seeds for specialty plants and wildflowers.
Many wildflowers take two years or even more before they even appear above ground, and many require a cold period before they will grow. Somehow storing the seed in the refrigerator for a few months has never seemed to work for this learner.
One dear friend who seems to be able to grow seed with the greatest of ease has the best success by leaving her wooden flats of seed outdoors in the rain and snow. Her husband fashioned seed flats for her and tacked a polyethylene screen over the top to keep out rodents and pets, but leaves the seed area open to the snow and rain.
Other gardeners have had great success by placing their seed flats in a cold frame.
One of the great sources for wildflower seed is the New England Wildflower Society in Framingham, Mass. The society's chief propagator, Bill Cullina, provides practical advice on growing wild flowers when he notes that it takes a great deal of patience.
In a recent presentation he made to a national organization of plant propagators, he spoke of a case in point: the wildflower society's great success in growing the much coveted large-flowered Trillium from seed. It takes five years to grow these plants from seed to salable-size plants.
The first year seed is sown in July. Germination takes place the following spring (year 1). At this time the young seedlings are fertilized, and again in May of Year 2. In the spring of year 3, the seedlings are transplanted to individual pots. Mr. Cullina said that this deed is tricky because the rhizomes of the seedlings must be set just under the potting soil surface so that a good root system develops.
In the spring of year 4, the seedlings begin to develop and form three leaflets. By this time they are large enough to be moved to quart-size pots. Then in year 5 , they should be developed well enough to be ready for planting or sale. Maybe by this time a few of the trilliums may even have blooms.
Seed growing can be a broadening facet of gardening. It is one to try boldly and you will be pleased with the results.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL / Saab 9-5 Aero and 9-3 Viggen;
New Turbo Jets From Air Saab

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHEN I bought a new 900 Turbo in 1985, Saab was basking in its image as the purveyor of eccentric Swedish sport sedans for 30-somethings who couldn't afford BMW's and couldn't abide anything as sensible as a Volvo.
Economic realities have since driven Saab up the luxury scale and toward the conventional. Saab shares a lot of parts with Opel, its buttoned-down cousin in General Motors' global family. And it now costs almost as much to own a Saab as a BMW. 
 But the old fire occasionally still shows. Nowhere is it more evident than in the company's flagships, the 9-3 Viggen and the 9-5 Aero. Though very different cars, they share Saab trademarks: an off-the-beaten-path design, remarkable pep and surprising versatility. In short, both the Viggen and the Aero are niche vehicles for affluent drivers who value being different almost as much as they like performance and comfort.
Start with the Viggen, named for the delta-wing jet fighter made by the Saab aerospace company. Introduced in the United States in the 1999 model year, the Viggen can be distinguished from Saab's standard 9-3 midsize car by the front and rear spoilers. Saab says, by the way, that the bad-boy styling is more than a marketing ploy, that it reduces wind resistance by 8 percent.
Complementing the modifications are jazzy 17-inch alloy wheels that show off the disk brakes and low-profile Dunlop tires (with a Z, or high-speed, rating). And the eye-catching package is rounded out with special colors: "lightning blue," silver or black. For 2000, a Viggen sedan and convertible join the coupe.
Inside, the Viggen has terrific front bucket seats in leather with supportive side bolsters, eight-way power adjustments and optional heating elements. The rest of the interior accouterments, more or less what you'd expect on "near luxury" cars these days, are borrowed from the 9-3 SE. These include an excellent sound system, automatic climate control, automatic-dimming rear-view mirror, trip computer and antitheft system with keyless locking. OnStar, General Motors' concierge in the sky, is an $895 option.
The list of safety features common to all 2000 Saabs borders on the obsessive: antilock brakes, front air bags and belt tensioners, side air bags for the front seat, head restraints that cradle the head in a crash, side window defrosters, daytime running lights, audio controls on the steering wheel, headlamp washers and wipers. There's even a night-panel button that shuts off the instrument panel illumination to minimize glare but pops awake on a need-to-know basis -- say, when the engine is revving near the red line or the fuel is low.
Of course, the market is crowded with safe, luxurious, well-made cars, many for less than $38,000. Apart from its innate Saab-ness, the Viggen's main selling point is performance, and here the verdict is mixed.
On the bright side, there's the engine. Everyone knows that Americans like cylinders: six good, eight better. Four-cylinder powerplants seem indelibly associated with vibration, weak acceleration and save-the-planet bumper stickers.
Saab learned this the hard way in the early 1990's, when it was forced to discount deeply to move its big 9000 model, the forerunner to the 9-5. Today you can buy the 9-5 with a 200-horsepower V6. But Saab engineers' hearts are still in four-cylinder engines, and both the Viggen and the Aero get along nicely with 2.3-liter, dual-overhead-cam versions equipped with potent turbochargers that yield 230 horsepower.
Thanks to the monster turbocharger and fancy electronics, this pocket workhorse produces 258 foot-pounds of torque at a modest 2,500 engine revolutions per minute, with no discernible "turbo lag." That means the relatively light Viggen (3,100 pounds) is a rocket ship -- a jet fighter? -- when it counts: passing on a two-lane road or merging with high-speed traffic. Indeed, the turbo's kick in third gear at 60 m.p.h. provided one of the most satisfying driving experiences I can remember.
Car and Driver magazine pushed the Viggen from a stop to 60 miles an hour in 6.5 seconds. And, not that many Americans care these days, the combination of big turbocharger and little engine also produces pretty good mileage figures: 20 m.p.g. in town, 29 on the highway. I averaged 24 while pushing the car hard every chance I got.
In most circumstances, the handling is up to the standard set by the engine. The brakes feel great. And while the suspension is softer and busier than one might expect of a serious road car, it does the job.
So, why am I less than than ecstatic over the Viggen? One might quibble about the vague five-speed shifter and clutch. Or the limited visibility: The high hood and rear deck make parallel parking a challenge. Or the rear seat: Getting in the back isn't easy and the legroom is tight.
My real beef, though, is with the steering. The Viggen usually goes where it's pointed, and the power assist is nicely tempered to allow adequate road feel. But with the pedal to the metal in second or third gear, the Viggen exhibits the classic systems of "torque steer" -- the tendency of high-powered front-drive cars to veer erratically to the left or right under heavy acceleration.
The Saab people try to make a virtue of torque steer, saying that it adds to the excitement of driving the Viggen. Even so, the company has set the engine's computer to take the edge off the torque steer by limiting the power available in first and second gear.
Is the Viggen worth $38,000 and change? For about the same money you could take home the far more polished and only slightly less peppy BMW 328i. But the BMW makes your upward mobility all too obvious; a Viggen will have your friends and neighbors scratching their heads.
With the Aero, there is both less pain and less gain. The steering manners in the version I drove were impeccable, most likely because the Aero weighed 400 pounds more than the Viggen, had wider tires and came with a slightly detuned four-speed automatic transmission. The cabin is huge, with big, ergonomically correct seats up front, a back seat that is adequate for three adults and a trunk that almost looks as though it could hold an old VW Beetle.
But every Saab 9-5 is big and comfy. The real question here is what you get in the Aero for the $2,000 premium over the dressed-for-success 9-5 SE.
Well, there is the trim: The Aero has a ground-effects chin spoiler plus minor modifications to the lower body to offset the extra drag created by that spoiler.
There is also the engine: The 2.3-liter four-cylinder is a bit noisier than the 3-liter V6 in the 9-5 SE, but it manages 30 more horsepower. More important, the torque is a bit higher over a broader range of engine speeds, though the Aero's transmission limits peak torque to 243 foot-pounds.
Then there's the wheel-tire combination. The Aero comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, as opposed to the SE's 16-inchers, and the fatter, lower-profile tires are rated for higher speeds. The suspension has been tuned for surer footing on curves.
All this adds up to a noticeable improvement in an already excellent sport sedan. The low-profile tires felt surprisingly good, with none of the ride harshness usually found in rubber designed for maximum performance. And though the car dives a bit more than expected in heavy braking and leans a bit more than expected in hard turns, the handling is a pleasure.
With the 400-pound weight disadvantage, the Aero is noticeably tamer than the Viggen. But again, the turbo offers punch when you need it. And with the smooth automatic set to "sport" mode, a nudge of the throttle brings forth the turbo boost.
The Aero is too close to a normal car in looks and performance to attract the dyed-in-the-wool Saab crowd drawn to the Viggen. But at a shade above $40,000, it is arguably a better buy. Like the other 9-5's, the Aero is a practical luxury sedan with more interior room than, say, the Mercedes E-Class. But its acceleration, unlike that of the other 9-5's, can make you feel young again.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Small is beautiful, as long as it's turbocharged.

The Unequal Glow Of Liberty's Lamp

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
GLENDY SAGASTUME, who is 13, will not spend Valentine's Day dreaming of hearts and flowers or the cute boys at her school in Far Rockaway, Queens. Glendy and her mother, refugees from the long nightmare in El Salvador, will mark the day with an asylum hearing in their quest to stay together in this country after years apart.
In 1987, Glendy's mother, Maria Cristina Batres, fled Texistepeque Santa Ana, a tiny rural Salvadoran town, for San Ysidro, Calif., near San Diego and the Mexican border. By bus and by foot, in the darkness of night, she made her way to New York. She worked as a cleaning woman, usually earning less than $200 a week. But it was enough to survive and to help Glendy and her other children left behind in El Salvador. 
 That country's 12-year civil war, which had the Salvadoran military and right-wing death squads battling left-wing guerrillas and their sympathizers, left 75,000 people dead in a nation of five million. The guerrillas destroyed Ms. Batres's family home and killed the father of one of her daughters. The death squads kidnapped and tortured one of her brothers along with the father of four of her seven children. Fearing for her life, Ms. Batres fled. Her sister in El Salvador agreed to take in the children for a while.
Ms. Batres's story emerged during interviews with her and her lawyer, Anne Pilsbury, executive director of Central American Legal Assistance in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The group gives free and low-cost legal help to Central American refugees. Even as the story of the 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez has dominated the news, Ms. Pilsbury has had to tell some Salvadoran parents who win residency that their children will be deported.
"We had to run," Ms. Batres said, her voice breaking. "We were very poor. We had nothing. I came with the hope of work. I didn't want my children to live in Salvador." Over the years, her other children were able to leave El Salvador. One was born in New York.
In August 1997 Ms. Batres's sister called to tell her that she had sent Glendy to the United States because she had become too ill to care for her. Glendy was arrested by immigration officials at the Mexican border. Her aunt died a month later.
Now Glendy, who has been with her mother while waiting for her case to be heard, may be separated from her again.
On Feb. 14, the Immigration and Naturalization Service will hear Ms. Batres's requests for asylum and for permanent resident status. Ms. Pilsbury said she believed that Ms. Batres had no chance of receiving asylum, which would allow Glendy to stay here, because of the government's position that Salvadorans are economic rather than political refugees. The war in El Salvador ended in 1991; past persecution does not warrant asylum. These days, Cubans are the only foreigners who can receive asylum almost automatically.
The United States, of course, armed and financed the army whose brutality sent thousands of Salvadorans into exile here. But few Salvadorans could obtain the refugee status granted to Cubans, Vietnamese, Kuwaitis and others whose governments had received American support at various times, mostly because of powerful political lobbies or American economic interests.
Maria Cristina Batres's best chance is to obtain permanent resident status through a 1997 immigration act exempting refugees from civil wars in Central America from more stringent deportation rules. Some of her other children may also qualify.
But because Glendy was arrested as an illegal immigrant, unlike her sisters and brothers, she will be forced to go back to El Salvador before she can apply to stay in the United States legally. It can take 3 to 10 years before she will be allowed to return.
Glendy's "removal hearing" is set for May 12. Ms. Pilsbury will ask that she be allowed to stay with her mother, pointing out that Glendy is a minor with no relatives in El Salvador. Yet she knows such requests are routinely denied for Salvadorans.
"I am not afraid," Glendy said last weekend. Her voice was very soft. "I will tell the judge, 'Let me stay here.' "
"I am very sad to be away from my mother," she said. "Who will I go with? Who will take me? I have many more opportunities here."
An eighth grader at Intermediate School 63 in Far Rockaway, Glendy likes baseball, basketball and the Backstreet Boys. Her friends at school do not know her story.
"These are families who got separated by the war, who faced a Hobson's choice of staying and being killed or leaving their children behind," Ms. Pilsbury said. "If people could wrap their minds around how heartbreaking this is, they'd say, 'Oh no.' "
But the climate these days seems mostly anti-immigration, with a few notable exceptions. Some political winds blow refugee children into the embrace of the United States. Other political winds blow them far, far away.

The Labor Shortage: Color It Gray

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
BEVERLY GOLDBERG has a warning for corporate America: Change your attitude toward older workers or face the consequences.
Ms. Goldberg, author of "Age Works" (The Free Press, $25), notes that in 10 years vast numbers of the baby-boom generation will begin reaching the traditional retirement age of 65. But, she says, few companies have noticed that there will not be enough younger workers to replace them. By comparison, today's tight labor market could look benign. 
 Even if the economy turned sour, the labor shortage would ease only temporarily, says Ms. Goldberg, who is also a management consultant and vice president of the Century Foundation, a New York public policy research institute formerly known as the Twentieth Century Fund.
"The most problematic possibility is a continued strong economy that collides with the retirement of the baby boomers," she writes. "That scenario would mean an economic catastrophe."
As early as 2005, when some boomers begin retiring early, a sharp increase in the number of workers over 55 will be needed to maintain the percentage of the population that is employed, she says.
A lot of companies will have to scramble to retain or hire older workers or retirees, many of whom are sitting atop fat 401(k) accounts. Money alone may not lure them. An adjustment in corporate attitudes may be necessary.
That is not good news for companies that have engaged in even the most subtle age bias. It is also a problem for big corporations that -- through mergers, downsizings and restructurings -- have sowed anger, fear and disillusionment among their workers, especially their older ones.
In her book, Ms. Goldberg calls the current workplace a "world of anxiety and distrust." Despite a tight labor market, she says, demands for higher wages remain weak, because many workers fear losing their jobs.
"Whenever I talk to older workers in big corporations, the one thing I most often hear is how they just can't wait to retire," Ms. Goldberg said in an interview. "They have had it. Not that they want to quit working, but that they want to do something on their own terms, or work hours that suit them."
ONE company that is heeding such warnings is the McDonald's Corporation. Its image as an employer of teenagers is changing through its efforts to recruit more older workers.
"We're still going to see a mix of ages working in our restaurants,"' said Barry Mehrmann, director of McDonald's Human Resources Design Center in Oak Brook, Ill. "But from a strategy point of view, we are clearly looking at older workers and the things we can do to attract them."
McDonald's is looking specifically to increase the share of older workers in its company-owned restaurants. Right now, about 7 percent, or three workers per restaurant, are 60 or older. The company attracts older workers by offering flexible schedules and, for those on Social Security, help in tracking earnings to avoid losing benefits. It also offers management opportunities.
Older workers are often good role models, Mr. Mehrmann said. "Their retention rate is very high," he explained. "They go through our training program just as fast and just as well as younger workers. They are great employees that stay with us and add stability."
MS. GOLDBERG said more companies needed to follow the McDonald's example.
"Many companies fail to train older workers, because they think they're going to leave," she said. "They really don't consider them a part of the team or essential to the work that's being done. They see them as sort of hanging around, which is a big mistake. It's discouraging to the workers and doesn't get the best out of them."
Just wait a few years, when these companies try to retain or rehire older workers, she added: "These workers are going to say, 'never mind.' They're going to go off and do something else in retirement -- start their own businesses, pursue hobbies or go back to school and get a degree. And that's going to be a disaster for these companies when workers are ever harder to find."

BackHome, Tough Path For an Entrepreneur

BYLINE: By DAVID HECHT 

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal

 BODY:
MASSATA THIOUNE left Senegal for New York in 1986 with just $250 in his pocket. He had no Western education and spoke no English. But he knew how to sew clothes; he had been apprenticed to his father, a tailor, from the age of 6. He was also imbued with the credo of the Sufi Islamic brotherhood to which his family belongs: "Pray as if you will die tomorrow, and work as if you will live forever."
By 1988, Mr. Thioune (pronounced choon) had a factory on Seventh Avenue, making office attire with a West African style and sensibility. Two years later, Massata Fashions was taking orders from national retail chains like T. J. Maxx and Marshall's and directly from consumers through a mail order catalog. The company was soon averaging $2 million a year in sales. 
 Then, in 1996, Mr. Thioune took a fateful step: he moved his factory home to Senegal.
"Coming here seemed like such a good idea at the time," said Mr. Thioune, 40, in his Dakar factory, amid dozens of sewing machines that are now idle. Senior Senegalese government officials had approached him with offers of tax breaks and easy financing to buy the building he would need. And he knew that the country, a former French colony where fashion consciousness runs high, had plenty of skilled tailors who would not demand American wages. "I figured, why pay U.S. workers $250 a week, when you can pay Senegalese workers $150 a month for better work?"
But problems appeared quickly. The first was getting timely deliveries from local textile companies. "There was always an excuse," Mr. Thioune said. "One day a machine was broken, and the only person who knew how to fix it had not come in. The next day it was someone's birthday, and nobody had come to work."
Once he had the fabric he needed, his own plant's output was hampered by frequent blackouts, which not only cost him work time but also damaged his sewing machines when the power came and went without warning. By the time spare parts could be obtained, he said, he had missed the deadline for a recurring $260,000 order, a huge chunk of his annual sales. Similar problems over the next two years cut his revenue by more than half and left him with $2.5 million of canceled goods.
"I had to stop taking orders," he said. "For now, I'm just trying to sell off what I've got."
Since President Clinton visited the continent in 1998, administration officials have been describing sub-Saharan Africa as one of the world's big untapped business opportunities. But the region produces few internationally competitive goods other than raw materials, and its share of world trade is tiny and falling.
Several American initiatives are meant to help entrepreneurs like Mr. Thioune get started in the region. The Overseas Private Investment Cooperation, a government-sponsored agency, has set up new loan funds for Africa, including $350 million to improve infrastructure. A bill before Congress would relax quotas and tariffs on clothing made in Africa; different versions were passed by the House and Senate last year and have yet to be reconciled.
Businesses face many obstacles in Africa, from corruption to inflation to poor infrastructure, but there is little agreement about how difficult they are to overcome or which is the most harmful. To Mr. Thioune, the local mind-set is the biggest problem. "Even I forgot how things worked here," he said. "There is still a slave-and-master attitude here that undermines efforts to work together."
 MOST African economies have two aspects: a moribund official one and a more energetic informal one, full of unregistered businesses and ad hoc markets. Informal economic activity tends to organize around ethnic or cultural affiliations rather than corporate entities.
In Senegal, less than 30 percent of the urban population is formally employed, but what is called the "real economy" provides livelihoods for the rest. It operates mainly through the country's networks of Sufi Islamic brotherhoods, to which nearly all Senegalese belong.
Under French rule, the Sufi brotherhoods formed the basis for fishing and agricultural collectives; when drought in the 1970's accelerated migration to the cities, the brotherhoods diversified into cottage industries and trade. Through daras, or prayer groups, brotherhood members pool resources and gain access to small-scale credit. Thousands of members of the most visible brotherhood, the Moruide, sell watches and sunglasses on the streets of New York and other major cities.
Some of the brotherhoods have formalized their business activities, according to Allione Ndoe, a Senegalese business consultant. But he said the enterprises tend to be "hierarchical and labor intensive, which is only good for certain kinds of activities, like farming and petty trade."
"Creating industry requires strategic planning," he said, "and at this stage they're mostly just concerned with the short term."
Mr. Thioune belongs to the Mouride brotherhood, but he said he runs Massata Fashions on American lines. "Many of my workers are from other brotherhoods," he said. "All I care about is that they're honest and hard working."
Some Mourides are critical of Mr. Thioune and his approach. "If a Mouride has difficulties," one leader of the brotherhood said, "he should meet with other Mourides to discuss the problems and they will then help."
But Mr. Thioune sees the brotherhood's role differently. "Mouridism provides the motivation and discipline for prayer and work," he said. "That's it." He said some "opportunistic" members try to get money from him by claiming to be marabouts, or spiritual guides. "They're not real marabouts," he said, "and I never give them anything."
Unlike Mr. Thioune, many West African businesspeople intertwine the spiritual and the secular. Supernatural powers have been attributed to some of the most powerful, like Babani Sissoko, a Malian who built a billion-dollar empire of international hotels, diamond mines and a regional airline, only to see it collapse under heavy debts after he ran into legal trouble in the United States.
The businesses of most of Africa's informal entrepreneurs are more stable than Mr. Sissoko's, but Western investors know little about working with them. And critics of the recent United States initiatives for Africa say that even American-style entrepreneurs like Mr. Thioune are being left out.
The investment agency recently set up a $105 million direct equity fund to invest in African private enterprises in amounts of $4.5 million to $7.5 million, according to Mr. Ndoe, who advises the fund. "But it is projecting American scale on Africa," he said. Except in South Africa, where the fund does not invest, "few African companies are big enough to qualify."
Mr. Thioune says financing is not his problem. "I know plenty of ways to generate capital here," he said. And he has looked far afield for opportunities; lately he has begun importing New York-style pickles, cranberry juice and other American foods for sale to expatriates and Senegal's small middle class, which considers the goods exotic.
"It's a stopgap measure until Massata Fashions gets going again," he said. "I know I can mass-produce clothing here cheaper and better than anywhere in the world. I just have to figure out how."

Advice and Dissent

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
The chief economic adviser of one candidate is the co-author of an exuberant book claiming that investors ain't seen nothing yet; unfortunately, the exuberance is a bit, well, irrational. The chief adviser of the other is a pessimist, deeply skeptical about the durability of our current prosperity. One candidate proposes huge tax cuts that will break the budget unless the long boom not only continues but accelerates. The other prefers not to count his fiscal chickens before they hatch. Which is which?
George W. Bush, of course, is the tax-slasher. John McCain is his cautious rival. Kevin Hassett is the raging bull. Lawrence Lindsey is the dour bear. Now for the punch line: Mr. Lindsey is advising Mr. Bush; Mr. Hassett is advising Mr. McCain. 
 The story of the Bush economic program is deja vu all over again. Just like Bob Dole's advisers in 1996 (who by and large were the same people), Mr. Bush's economists have allowed the presumed political appeal of tax cuts to override their professional scruples. The other story is less well known. Indeed, like most other people, I have only started paying serious attention to the McCain campaign in the last few days, and I have to admit that discovering that Mr. Hassett, of all people, is his chief economic adviser was a shock.
Who is Kevin Hassett? Until quite recently he had a solid, not at all flashy reputation in fiscal economics, with a career that moved from Columbia University to the Federal Reserve and then to the American Enterprise Institute, an establishment-conservative think tank. There he teamed up with the investment writer James K. Glassman to write a couple of articles in The Wall Street Journal, followed up by a book expanding on those articles entitled "Dow 36,000" -- a catchy title backed up by a thesis that was ingenious, exciting and unfortunately quite silly.
I don't mean that their forecast was wrong. For all I or anyone else knows, the Dow may indeed go to 36,000. But the way the book justifies that forecast involves a series of conceptual confusions about such things as the sources of risk and the difference between dividends and earnings. (To be fair, when I talked to Mr. Hassett, he offered a plausible explanation -- much better than Mr. Glassman's indignant denials that he said what he actually said -- of why the most glaring apparent error in the book might not be too bad an approximation, but the other objections remain.)
How did someone like Mr. Hassett end up writing that kind of book? As I understand it, a casual, back-of-the-envelope calculation led to a huge publisher's advance so quickly that the authors never had a chance to have second thoughts. Yes, Virginia, that is the way the world works.
The more interesting question is, How did Mr. McCain end up designating Mr. Hassett, hardly a household name until that book, as his chief economic adviser? The answer, which comes as something of a relief, is that it apparently had nothing to do with "Dow 36,000." Instead, it was that inevitability thing: all the usual Republican policy suspects believed that if you worked against Mr. Bush, you would never eat a free lunch in Washington again. (And you might find a horse's head in your bed.) So Mr. McCain had to take what he could get. Mr. Hassett was one of the few identifiably Republican fiscal experts who wasn't intimidated. And if we ignore the brief foray into stock-market hype, the senator could have done worse: before Mr. Hassett succumbed to the imperatives of the book trade he was regarded as quietly sensible, and freed from those imperatives he seems likely to revert to type.
But you have to admit that it's a depressing spectacle. The Republican tent is a big one, which probably contains at least as many first-rate economists as its rival. Yet that huge pool of talent has not only been locked up by the Anointed One; it has been forced to genuflect to the legacy of a crank doctrine -- supply-side economics -- that even party loyalists don't believe in. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's main rival has been forced to assemble a scratch team from the handful of Republican economists who know something about policy yet are sufficiently remote from the corridors of power to be immune to pressure.
Is this any way to run a Grand Old Party?

HEADLINE: Fed's Faulty Logic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I find it somewhat hypocritical of Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve to use the threat of inflation to justify rate increases when the effect of higher interest rates is itself inflationary ("Federal Reserve Gives a Nudge to 2 Key Rates," front page, Feb. 3). 
 If inflation is defined as higher costs and prices, interest rate increases drive producers' costs higher because most corporations find that interest is their third-largest cost, after the cost of labor and material. For consumers, higher interest rates drive up prices on virtually everything they buy or consume. If that is not inflation, what is?

A View That Needs No Windows

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
LIKE Bill Gates and Michael Dell, Larry Augustin spent his spare time in college toying with computers and wound up starting a company that made him a zillionaire. But unlike them, Mr. Augustin earned a college degree, at Notre Dame, and later a doctorate, at Stanford.
And so he comes across as less the entrepreneur from birth than the nerd's nerd, never happier than when up to his eyes in bits and bytes and the esoterica of hardware and software. He proudly asserts that he was a charter subscriber to Sys Admin, a trade magazine devoted to systems administrators, the unsung heroes who keep computer systems running. "I've been a systems administrator for every operating system created in the last 20 years," he said. 
 Mr. Augustin's company, VA Linux Systems, a maker of computer systems in Sunnyvale, Calif., does not yet have billions of dollars in revenue. But it does have a multibillion-dollar market capitalization, thanks to an initial public offering in December that set records for first-day gains. And the stock provided most of the $1 billion that VA Linux agreed to pay last week for Andover.Net, an owner of Web sites offering technology news.
From a high of $320, VA Linux shares have dropped, closing at $125 on Friday. But at age 37, Mr. Augustin still has a net worth of about $825 million.
VA Linux is a standard-bearer for the Linux operating system and the Open Source movement. Mr. Augustin and other founders of the company, and the movement, contend that by making computer code underlying a program freely available, and readily modified by anyone, a stronger system with fewer crashes results, ending the domination of operating systems owned by one company, especially Microsoft Windows.
Linux is named for Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who wrote a key component, though he has no connection with the company beyond his friendship with Mr. Augustin. In the hands of Mr. Torvalds and Mr. Augustin, Linux has practically become a cult, although one with a sense of humor. Mr. Augustin breaks out in high-pitched bursts of laughter as he describes an esoteric online parody of slashdot.com, a Linux news site ("News for nerds. Stuff that matters.") owned by Andover.Net that doesn't take itself too seriously to begin with.
But go back to the late 80's and early 90's. Mr. Augustin had gone to Stanford after three years at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where he worked on high-speed digital switching. He ultimately wrote his Ph.D. thesis on electronic automated design tools, the software used to create new chips.
He also played scavenger -- collecting, among other things, cast-off disk drives, in the days when 30 megabytes filled a refrigerator-sized box. He used these castoffs to create a giant site, in a Stanford basement, that allowed the rapid exchange of information over the Internet before the days of the World Wide Web.
He also collected early workstations made by Sun Microsystems. His goal was to build a machine at his home that could use Unix, a sophisticated operating system widely found in academia and industry.
In 1993, Mr. Torvald released Linux on the Internet. Using this software, Mr. Augustin said, "I was able to put together my own computer for $2,000, and it was one and a half to two times faster than these old Suns, which cost about $7,000. Other people saw what I had and wanted one, so in November '93, I put up a Web page and said, 'I will sell people these systems.' I got my first check at the end of the month from someone I didn't know. I consider that the start of the business."
A couple of dozen companies have joined the Linux cause, on the premise that there is money to be made selling an operating system anyone can obtain for free. VA Linux is unusual in that it sells complete computer systems that come loaded with Linux (but not Windows).
"We're designing from the ground up for Linux," he declared. "And what we offer to our customers is not just a system. It's full service, a single point of contact, service and support for building their entire infrastructure."
SO far, VA Linux's major customers are all Web start-ups themselves, companies like Akamai Technologies and eToys, and most are less than two years old. But Mr. Augustin, whose buttoned-down shirts, neatly creased khakis and well-trimmed hair may qualify as the height of formality among Linux users, has positioned himself as the person to take the Linux message to corporate America.
"I make the argument that the current model of software development is just economically inefficient," he said. "I think this is the next big revolution in the software industry."
Stoking the revolution means long hours. He described his previous day, which began in New York and ended in Silicon Valley. "Yesterday I got up at 3 a.m. California time, went into a set of meetings, got on an airplane, got back here at 3 in the afternoon and worked in the office until 7 p.m. when my wife started calling."
Balancing work and family can mean taking his wife, Alice Kitsuta Augustin, and daughter, Andrea, to industry gatherings like last week's Linux World in New York. "That's fine because we get together with Linus and the kids can play," he said, alluding to the fact that both men have 3-year-old daughters.
Mr. Augustin tells employees not to think about VA Linux's share price, and he tries to take his own advice. "I didn't start this thing to cash in and get out," he said. "I started this to build a real company."

HEADLINE: Loss of a Landmark

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Sadly, appeals to halt the demolition of the historic Mapes Hotel in Reno, Nev., fell on deaf ears. The famed Art Deco high-rise was dynamited on Jan. 30 (news item, Jan. 31). The Mapes was a uniquely American landmark. Its groundbreaking design became the blueprint for the hundreds of casinos now scattered across the United States. 
 As legalized gambling became more prevalent around the country, Reno hit upon hard times. Instead of resorting to demolition as a quick-fix effort to repackage a struggling gambling town, the city should have developed a plan to adapt the Mapes to address the city's longer-term needs. The reuse of older buildings can help jump-start a town's economic engine. In a city that relies heavily on tourist dollars, a renovated Mapes Hotel would have been a valuable asset.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Reading the Signals Of a Baffled Bond Market

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
THE Treasury bond market went haywire last week. What exactly does the chaos in this huge and hugely significant market mean to investors?
The turmoil hit traders hardest at the nation's banks, brokerage firms and hedge funds. Many of these players had bet -- accurately -- that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates. Normally, such a move would push up yields on both short-term and long-term securities. 
 Not this time. Even as the Fed voted to raise short-term rates by one-quarter point, yields on long-term Treasuries declined, from 6.48 percent on Monday to 6.26 percent on Friday. Two-year Treasury notes ended the week at 6.61 percent.
It isn't often that short-term rates are a good deal higher than longer-term rates. And when it happens, it traditionally portends an economic slowdown. That is in large part because financial institutions -- which borrow at short-term rates and lend long -- have no incentive to make loans in such an environment. If credit is tight, companies cannot finance their growth and economic output declines.
Almost nobody thinks that last week's bond market action is pointing to a slowdown. Indeed, all the data point to a blazing economy, which is why the Fed feels compelled to raise rates.
Rather, traders say, the bond market is embroiled in a technical move unrelated to economic fundamentals. Lower yields on long-term bonds are a direct result, they say, of the Treasury's plan to both reduce the amount of debt it will issue and to buy back many existing bonds. With the Treasury focusing its aim on securities with 10- to 30-year durations, investors made a mad scramble to buy long-term bonds ahead of a shortage.
This widely held view worries Andrew S. Teufel, research director at Fisher Investments Inc. in Woodside, Calif. While he agrees that the Treasury refinancing plan is having a huge impact on the bond market, he is troubled by the idea that everyone is writing off the interest rate inversion as merely technical. He wonders if the market is indeed trying to send investors a warning -- one that is being ignored.
"It's a sentiment gauge, and our early sense of it is that people are dismissing it," he said. "If everyone is paying attention, it's innocuous. If no one is paying attention to it, it's dangerous. If people are paying attention to it but writing it off as not dangerous, then there is some danger, too."
It is too soon to tell whether the bond market is signaling a slowdown. But the rise in short-term rates is hurting shares in financial institutions, whose borrowing costs are increasing.
Investors don't have to own bank stocks to feel their pain. Shares of financial companies make up 13 percent of the value of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Even if the rally in long bonds winds up being solely related to the reduced supply of Treasuries, investors should not expect things to go back to normal anytime soon. Interest rate strategists say that when the bond market undergoes a structural change, as it is now, it takes months for investors to adjust fully to the change. The adjustment may not be pretty.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Globalization: If You Can't Beat It, Reshape It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
WITH security agents toting submachine guns, army helicopters buzzing overhead and protesters breaking windows in yet another McDonald's, Davos man, the elite agent of global capitalism, is under siege.
It's not hard to reach that conclusion after attending this year's session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where government officials, chief executives and leading economists gathered to schmooze and ponder globalization under heavy guard. The road to the Alpine resort was icy, and the confidence of the power brokers there seemed to be slipping. Since the disastrous global trade talks in Seattle not long ago, many of those who have long favored closer integration between nations are on the defensive. 
 But it's probably a mistake to think that globalization itself is threatened. On the contrary, the unions and environmental groups that assail the World Trade Organization seem on the whole to prefer that nations become more like one another faster -- and in a greater variety of ways. They are not so much trying to block globalization as to hitch a ride.
Thousands of groups are seeking to influence the Davos crowd in the service of causes from protection of sea turtles to elimination of child labor. They do not speak with a single voice. But their pleas no longer fall on deaf ears.
The human rights group Amnesty International, the environmental action organization Greenpeace and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. were all invited to Davos this year, and they pushed similar agendas. Globalization cannot really be resisted, they said, but neither should it be limited to commerce.
"Globalization is happening one way or another and it can't be stopped," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., "but it must be made to work for workers." Beyond going slow with new trade agreements to protect union jobs in the developed world, that means compelling poor countries to rewrite their labor laws to conform more closely with those of rich countries -- in effect, globalizing labor standards.
Groups like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund are taking a similar tack. They want the W.T.O. to inject some environmental horse-trading into trade talks -- say, freer imports of third-world textiles in exchange for stricter limits on logging in rain forests.
That some protest groups accept globalization -- albeit on their own terms -- helps explain why President Clinton, whose free-trade credentials are well established, extended an olive branch to those who led the Seattle demonstrations. In Davos, Mr. Clinton embraced the "new forces" that demand a say in how nations relate to one another, effectively offering them a seat at the negotiating table. And he agreed with them that defining globalization merely in trade terms is no longer enough; instead, the world should start talking about the globalization of society.
"We cannot isolate economics as distinct from the environment and labor," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. "That's a distinction that's artificial."
The idea struck a responsive chord with the executives at Davos. In fact, this year's conference may be remembered as the time businesses and advocacy groups stopped fighting each other and started talking.
Business leaders proposed a flurry of ways they could become more socially conscious. Louis Schweitzer of Renault, for example, suggested restricting political contributions by multinationals, to restore faith that public policy is not beholden to corporate interests.
Monsanto was another company welcoming a "new dialogue" with its adversaries. "Companies need to understand what society's expectations are and be ready to change a strategy if it does not meet this test," said Nick E. Rosa, senior vice president. The company has overhauled the way it uses genetics to modify crops, largely in response to pressure from Greenpeace and other environmental groups, Mr. Rosa said.
The big problem with all this coziness is that poorer countries like Mexico, South Africa, India and China -- the ones that would have to do all the changing and harmonizing to suit rich-country standards -- are balking at this expanded view of globalization.
"Most developing countries have a knee-jerk reaction to this -- they are not ready to discuss it," said Supachai Panitchpakdi, a deputy premier of Thailand, who is due to take over the leadership of the World Trade Organization in 2002. "I'm afraid we won't see much progress on trade right away."
That prediction remains to be tested. The Clinton administration is still hoping to kick-start a new round of global trade talks before its term expires. And if Davos was any indication, globalization in the broadest sense is just getting started.

HEADLINE: Learning to Think Smaller at Coke

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
AT Coca-Cola, Roberto C. Goizueta remains a legend, the chief executive whose vision and drive transformed the giant company into a global power. For his successor, M. Douglas Ivester, mastery of the inner workings of the Coke system could not make up for an uninterrupted streak of falling profits and personal faux pas.
Now the corner office at Coke is to be occupied by Douglas N. Daft, a cheerful, unassuming Australian who spent 30 years rising through the ranks. Practically a stranger in Atlanta, because of his overseas postings and constant travel, in just a few weeks he has turned the world of Coca-Cola upside down. 
 He announced a plan to push worldwide decision-making at the company down to the local level -- a plan requiring the layoff of 6,000 workers, including nearly half of those at Coke headquarters in Atlanta. He said the company would embrace local brands and flavors more than it had in the past. He conceded that Coke could not meet long-term targets for earnings growth and that profits had been eroded by bad investments and bad management.
The stock -- for most of the last decade as iconic as Coke's brand -- has been in a tailspin since, closing on Friday at $56.25, down $6.8125 since the layoffs were announced on Jan. 26.
Whether Mr. Daft, 56, is executing his own plan or one he merely helped to create is not clear. Coke's board is known to have grown more frustrated and demanding over the last year; for his part, Mr. Daft radiates a kind of shock that it is his turn to run the world's best-known soft-drink company.
But the changes he is putting in place surely reflect his view of the way a global company ought to operate -- a view developed through a series of assignments in Asia, where he learned the hard way what sold Coca-Cola, and what didn't.
"To me it was so natural and logical," Mr. Daft said in an interview in New York last week, reflecting on the way his restructured Coca-Cola will let local managers make decisions about products, advertising and other functions that previously were controlled from Atlanta. "It's something I've always lived by."
Mr. Daft -- now Coke's president, and scheduled to succeed Mr. Ivester as chairman and chief executive on April 19 -- takes over as the company is discovering the flawed underpinnings of the global expansion model that enshrined the late Mr. Goizueta in the business pantheon.
Mr. Goizueta, Coke's chief executive for 16 years until his death in 1997, long maintained that the company could instill a craving for products like Coca-Cola and Sprite all over the world, from the foothill shantytowns of Venezuela to the boulevards of Paris and Berlin. Mr. Goizueta's early successes in emerging markets, in particular, fueled strong growth at Coke and made it one of Wall Street's best-loved stocks.
But lately, Coke has had to come to terms with a conflicting reality. In many parts of the world, consumers have become pickier, more penny-wise, or a little more nationalistic, and they are spending more of their money on local drinks whose flavors or brand names are not part of the Coca-Cola lineup. The company took an $813 million charge for the costs of carrying poorly performing assets in Russia and the Baltics last year, and more charges are expected for similar investments in India.
"They had the world's greatest brand, and they believed that by the mere fact that Coke was Coke, they could sell it," said Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting company. "It worked in the good times."
Moreover, the company's worldwide bottler system -- Mr. Goizueta's brainchild, Mr. Ivester's handiwork and the envy of competitors like PepsiCo -- faltered as regional economies fell apart, and many bottlers fumed that Coke was greedily profiting at their expense by raising concentrate prices. Along with its dismal earnings news last month, the company disclosed that bottlers in some key markets had too much soft-drink concentrate on hand, suggesting to some analysts that Coke had stuffed the pipeline to meet its own volume targets.
THE bleak performance left Coca-Cola looking more vulnerable as its once impeccable public image was stained by crises -- from the biggest product recall in company history to a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of its black employees. The company has run afoul of regulators in Europe, Mexico and Australia over its plan to acquire the Cadbury Schweppes brands and over marketing practices like giving incentives to retailers to sell Coke instead of competing products. Then there was the vending machine that Mr. Ivester admired for its ability to raise prices automatically in hot weather.
From an investor's point of view, Coke was broken. But now there is a New Coke -- no, not that New Coke, but the restructuring plan devised over the last six months by Mr. Daft and others. The huge layoffs are meant to clear the way for Coke to become a quicker company, a marketer better attuned to customers and other constituents. The central bureaucracy that reacted so clumsily when children in Belgium said they felt sick after drinking Coke products last spring has been pruned to its bare essentials; Coke says it expects to be more responsive to political and social concerns.
And Coke will sell more kinds of soft drinks, catering to local tastes for a change. "They were ignoring the local flavors for years," said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. "The opportunities were always there. Now they've put a structure in place to go after them."
While trying not to criticize his predecessor, Mr. Daft conveys his belief that Coca-Cola dropped the ball more than a few times. Asked what happened in Belgium, where Coke was perceived as arrogant and uncaring because of its slow response, he said: "Maybe there was no one there who understood the environment. Or, if we had people who understood the environment, we didn't listen to them."
Late last year, the demonstrations during the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle drove home the point that global companies like Coke are viewed with growing hostility by some groups. The critics are especially irritated by what they regard as the multinationals' belief that the world should play by their rules.
"Consumer democracy is becoming more and more of an issue," said Carl Ware, Coke's executive vice president for communications and corporate affairs. "We have to address it on a local basis."
Call it the next wave of globalization, or the natural byproduct of the consumer culture that Coke helped build up around the world. "They finally see the light," said Jerry Wind, a marketing specialist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, adding that other companies, including Procter & Gamble, have been quicker to respond to local markets. "The world is heterogeneous. You have local preferences and tastes. It makes a lot of sense for them to acknowledge the regional or local differences and try to manage their franchise as a portfolio of products that try to cater to different segments."
The light first came on for Mr. Daft when he was assigned to Indonesia in the early 1970's. His job was to sell Coca-Cola, lots of it. "I launched Coke and I pushed Coke for three years," he recalled. "Then I launched Fanta," an orange soda, "and the business just tripled and quadrupled." The lesson? "Brand Coke is the core of our company, then you add on to that the volume that you generate by competing in a wider market."
Subsequent stints in Hong Kong and Japan, and a lot of time spent building Coke's business in China, taught him the value of relationships, of quick decision-making, and of that thing called face time that he says is still key in business. When he was made group president for Asia but posted to Atlanta in 1991, "that just meant I had to travel all the time," Mr. Daft said.
"You have to be in a place in order to understand it," he explained. "You've got to give attention to people. You've got to be able to see the people within the organization and outside the organization."
Nothing so revolutionary there, but it was not the Coke way. "We had backups in Atlanta in case people failed," he said, "monitoring them, constantly checking on information and receiving information." That was not so helpful to new product development -- or to morale. A local manager who wanted to shift advertising dollars among brands, for example, had to wait for clearance from Atlanta before doing so.
And the global "mind-set," to borrow a term from Mr. Ivester's lexicon that Mr. Daft rarely utters, had its drawbacks. Bottled water was a recent example.
"Looking for a worldwide strategy for water slowed us down," Mr. Daft says now. Most Americans consider bottled water an occasional luxury; Europeans cannot live without it. "You can't apply a global standard of measurement to consumers," Mr. Daft says, "because it reduces everything to the lowest common denominator." Coke settled on a plan that required bottlers to buy packages of mineral additives for its Dasani brand water, which is being marketed across the United States; another Coke water, Bonaqua, continues to be sold abroad.
Mr. Daft has also pledged to help improve returns for Coke bottlers. "I think it's very positive," said Morris Strickland, area manager for Coca-Cola Enterprises in Jackson, Miss. "The focus is right. I was at a meeting in Atlanta and I felt more unified with the Coca-Cola Company than I have in a long, long time."
IF Mr. Daft's ideas are different, so is his personality. Mr. Goizueta was charming until crossed. Mr. Ivester was great with numbers but not necessarily with people. Mr. Daft is universally described as even-tempered and comfortable with stressful situations. A healer, perhaps.
"The fellow is the right man at the right time at the right place," said Donald R. Keough, the former president of Coke who is now chairman of Allen & Company, the New York investment bank whose president and chief executive, Herbert A. Allen, is a member of Coke's board. Mr. Daft, he said, "can be surgical" in his decision-making, but is also easygoing, a combination Mr. Keough said he valued in a leader.
"He's going to have a lot of fun with it, when all is said and done," Mr. Keough said. "To be a dour, uptight person selling Coca-Cola is a contradiction in terms."
Mr. Daft's conciliatory side was in evidence in one of his first acts upon becoming president on Dec. 6: retaining Mr. Ware, the company's highest-ranking black executive, who to the consternation of civil rights leaders in Atlanta had announced his resignation after a management shuffle left him outside the chief executive's circle.
Mr. Ware changed his mind, he said, after talking with Mr. Daft about his plans for the company. "We had an agreement that much of what we had done in Africa and in Asia could be replicated in other parts of the world," Mr. Ware said. "He's open to ideas from a whole lot of sources. He has encouraged dialogue, encouraged debate, encouraged everyone to have an opinion, no matter what the issue is." Mr. Daft also moved swiftly to name a second in command, Jack L. Stahl, a concept Mr. Ivester had resisted.
Other colleagues who have worked closely with Mr. Daft say he is quick to decide what needs to be done, but steps back to allow subordinates to make up their minds about how to do it.
"He's very careful about delineating his point of view, but at the end of the day it's: You live here, you're accountable, you make the decision," said Stephen C. Jones, who was the No. 2 executive in Japan and was recently appointed by Mr. Daft as chief marketing officer for Coke.
On trips they took around Japan, Mr. Daft embraced the local culture more deeply than Mr. Jones did, particularly in restaurants. "I avoided the sea urchin," Mr. Jones said, "but he orders it."
Japan has turned out to be Coke's most lucrative market, accounting for 20 percent of the company's profits -- about $1 billion last year, on just 5 percent of its overall volume. It is also the place where, under Mr. Daft's direction, Coca-Cola has gone farthest in encouraging local brands that suit local tastes. In Japan, Coke's most popular product is a canned coffee, closely followed by canned teas.
Keeping that market profitable will be a chore. Coke has the largest share of the Japanese cola market, but sales have been hurt lately because Japanese consumers consider other drinks healthier. And the Japanese market is also going through a major shift; increasingly, sales are centered on retail and discount stores rather than on vending machines, where the profit margins are much higher.
Mr. Keough, for one, thinks Mr. Daft can handle the issues he will face. "Wherever there was a place where there was a problem, there he went, and guess what, there was no problem," he said of Mr. Daft's record in Asia. "And you didn't get any six-page report about it."
THE child of a shoe-store owner in Cessnock, New South Wales, Mr. Daft joined Coke's planning department in Sydney in 1970, after brief stints as a high school teacher and a computer analyst for an oil company. He was soon sent to Indonesia for a year, which turned into five. In 1975, he left Coke to start a chain of liquor stores in Australia with a friend.
A year later he was back at Coke, assigned to Hong Kong as a marketing manager. He moved to Singapore in 1981, and returned to Hong Kong in 1984 to oversee Coke's business in China for four years.
"In China, I really learned the value of relationships and understanding political agendas, and there was a real need to understand that you sold and marketed to consumers on a local basis," Mr. Daft said. "In a country that large, with that many people, you would really miss a lot if you tried to generalize."
China was one of Coke's fastest-growing markets in the 1990's. But last spring, after American warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- an act the United States calls an accident -- sales fell off as anti-American sentiment focused on Coke, McDonald's and other American companies in China. Mr. Daft quietly arranged to spend an evening at the theater in New York with China's deputy ambassador to the United States, hoping to smooth some of the anger.
Mr. Daft is said to closely follow changing tastes, not only in soft drinks but also in pop culture, something that he may owe to his 26-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who lives in Portland, Ore., and 22-year-old son, Nicholas, a senior at Williams College. For five years, he held an annual conference for his Asian managers in Park City, Utah. The days were spent in business discussions, the nights spent viewing films like "Big Night" and "When We Were Kings" ahead of the rest of the country, since Mr. Daft timed the conference to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival.
"He said, 'Let's meet for eight hours a day, and then go out at night to see how independent people are telling stories these days,' " Mr. Jones recalled.
Mr. Daft's biggest challenge may be persuading Wall Street the company has righted itself and is positioned to grow. One concern is that there may be more bad news to come.
"I think you're looking at not only this year as a year of recovery, but also part of next year," said Marc Cohen, a beverage stocks analyst at Goldman Sachs. "It could take 12 to 24 months before they hit their stride."
Among the problems yet to be fully aired is India, where costly write-downs are expected to be detailed before long. And the plans to sell more soft-drink brands tailored to local tastes will not be so easy to put into place, Mr. Cohen said; new brands take time to develop, and few are likely to be as profitable as Coke itself.
The circumstances give Mr. Daft at least a chance to come out a corporate hero. If Mr. Ivester succeeded a legend, taking control when Coke was riding high, Mr. Daft has been handed a Coca-Cola at half-staff, with Mr. Goizueta's shadow fading. The market, and his board, will demand results, but the expectations may be easier to manage.
"Unless there is a remarkable recovery in economic growth beyond what people foresee at the moment, this will be a case where they gradually build momentum," Mr. Cohen said. "As they iron out the significant challenges the company has come to face in the last few years, we should expect them to produce better performances. What remains to be spelled out is, how much better?"

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: DYSFUNCTIONS;
Forget the Kid. The Real Custody Fight Is Over an Island.

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
WHILE they have yet to appear in one of those pop-psych quizzes that offer instant analyses of your home life, here are two questions to see if your family problems have gone from domestic dispute to full-blown dysfunction:
Has Fidel Castro ever rallied thousands of people to denounce you as a kidnapper while your nephew went on network television to say he'd like to come to your hometown and break some necks? 
 Have you ever enlisted a member of Congress to bestow honorary citizenship on your nephew's son, saying he would be better off with you than with his father in Cuba?
If you answered yes to either question, chances are you and your relatives suffer from a peculiar form of dysfunction that has befallen the Gonzalez family of Cuba and Miami. And not just them.
This syndrome involves a breakdown in an extended family that includes all of Cuba and about half of Miami, not to mention much of the political establishments in Washington and Havana. In fact, it has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and dysfunction of the last four decades in the last confrontation of the cold war.
The facts are familiar: Since November, the Gonzalez clans of Miami, Florida and Cardenas, Cuba, have been waging a loud custody battle over Elian Gonzalez and whether he should stay in Miami or be returned to his father in Cuba. The father has said he would like to come to Miami with a rifle, as well as "break the necks" of his relatives' political allies. The relatives have crowed that Elian was "more on this side than on that side" after his recent, brief meeting with his two grandmothers, who returned to Cuba without him. Both sides mutter about each other's failings, tossing out epithets ranging from "criminal" to "Communist."
But how different is that from the potshots traded over the years between Miami's exiles, Cuba's Communists, their supporters on both sides and, for that matter, between the various bickering camps within the Cuban exile community? The unraveling of Elian's family ties is just the latest example of a bigger but just as tortured relationship between the exile community and Cuba, and between Washington and Mr. Castro.
Nor are the emotions seen in the custody fight anything new. As in family matters, denunciation rather than reconciliation is often the goal in most exchanges between the Castro regime and its sworn enemies in Miami. Mr. Castro has always manipulated such animosities for political advantage. And with the political power that southern Florida exerts, the tit-for-tat response of the Cuban exiles spills over into American policy. Often reason loses out.
Take one example: Several years ago, Cuba shot down exile planes that had invaded its airspace while searching for rafters. The Clinton Administration, which had wanted to lower tensions, found itself instead tightening America's trade embargo, which Mr. Castro uses as an excuse for his excesses. The reason: the most vocal Cubans here support the embargo as a weapon against Mr. Castro, even though the people harmed most, it seems, are their own relatives.
The animosity filters down into areas that would be apolitical anywhere else. A few weeks ago, the organizers of the Latin Grammy Awards bolted to California after their plans to stage the event in South Florida fell through because of worries that the presence of some wrinkled musicians from Cuba might spark protests. In past years, exhibitions featuring Cuban artists have prompted bomb threats from people intent on keeping America safe from offending oils.
Regardless of the issue at hand, the response is the same: Name-calling replaces conversation. Fear that the other side may get satisfaction blocks any chance to solve a problem. Each side digs in its heels and hurls verbal thunderbolts. Communist! Imperialist! Traitor!
These vitriolic accusations have a ring very familiar to anyone who has been listening in on the Gonzalez case. Or, for that matter, to what happens every day in Family Court. "All of the family's laundry is aired in family cases," said Bernard Perlmutter, the director of the Children and Youth Law Clinic at the University of Miami. "We have grandparents and uncles who stand before the judge and they whine and they accuse and they complain and they defend. The kinds of families that come before family court judges are families that have broken down and are almost irremediably dysfunctional. That's what we see playing out on the world stage in Elian's case."
Even in more obscure custody cases, relatives often resort to lawsuits or outright abduction. They try to sway the child with gifts, or sour him on the other parent with whispered, disparaging remarks. In a way, the child becomes a bystander in these fights.
"When adults fight with each other, they tend to forget how to insulate the child from it and maintain a relationship with the child while fighting," said Albert J. Solnit, the former director of the Yale Child Study Center. "In custody conflicts you often see people fighting about getting even with each other and using the child as the pawn."
In Elian's case, all this seems to have happened, and on an epic scale. The demand that the boy be allowed to stay in Miami "strikes to the heart of what this community is about, that exile is a good thing," said Lisandro Perez, the director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. "The early Russians who were exiled by the Bolsheviks saw exile as the worst that could happen. Cubans do not see it that way. They almost demand the people become exiles."
But those demands have been met with equally loud, if more orchestrated, responses in Havana, where the government has seized the case to revive flagging revolutionary sentiment. Even neighbors in Elian's hometown, while feeling for the family, speak of the custody case as a showdown between capitalists and Communists. "The world knows that if a country is powerful economically it is because it has been exploiting underdeveloped countries," said Agustin Serrano. "If those poor countries try to protest and claim what is theirs, must they succumb? Must they die? That is the case of Elian."
Elian -- remember him? Dr. Solnit said the longer Elian is away from his father, the more attached he will become to his Miami relatives, making it all the more difficult to resume a normal relationship with him. "No country is perfect," Dr. Solnit said. "I prefer to live here. But I don't know if that makes much sense to a child whose main country is really his parents."
THAT is pretty much the case the Clinton administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have argued as a basis for returning Elian to Cuba. But even they are part of a larger struggle, and with the courts, Congress and Mr. Castro all involved, a meeting of minds seems unlikely for now. Perhaps, Mr. Perlmutter suggested, it is time for a third party to step in.
"One way of working out family problems is to rely on alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or referring the family to counseling," he said. "But I don't know how you are going to psychoanalyze the Cuban family in this case and mediate 40 years of enmity and anger that is so deep rooted."

Tired of News That Rocks the Boat? Visit Japan

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN Japan's largest newspaper recently refused advertising from two of the country's most popular weekly magazines, citing their sexually explicit content, it put Mizuho Fukushima in a quandary.
As a leading feminist here, she found the magazines' big displays of women posing nude or engaging in sex acts deeply troubling. But as a member of parliament, she found the coverage of current events by these same weeklies indispensable. 
 "Women should take the initiative in eliminating the nudity from these magazines," Ms. Fukushima said. "But I must buy them because they always carry stories on subjects that I need to know about, subjects that the newspapers don't cover."
Ms. Fukushima's statement was a stinging indictment of Japan's huge daily press, and one shared by growing numbers of readers in this country.
Media critics here say that Japan, virtually alone among advanced industrialized democracies, combines a lack of aggressive, independent-spirited daily newspapers with a lack of commercially successful weekly newsmagazines in the vein of Time, Newsweek, The Economist or Der Spiegel.
Japan's daily newspapers boast the highest circulation figures in the world. In the 19th century they were an instrument of nation-building and patriotism, and critics say they have evolved in the postwar period into increasingly complacent entities that routinely leave a large host of taboo subjects -- from the imperial family to corruption in sumo -- untouched. Most other matters, meanwhile, are reported in uncritical, gazette-like snippets. "Newspapers here don't write lies, but they avoid dealing with uncomfortable truths," said Tatsuya Iwase, author of "The Reason Newspapers are not Interesting," a 1999 book. "Japan has the hardware of the Western press, but there is no software. The inside is empty."
Mr. Iwase said Japanese newspapers have little more than a formulaic recognition of the freedom of speech and "disregard the readers' right to know." The public, he said, would eagerly welcome a new newspaper that carried feistier reporting and better analysis, but the system, from the government to the advertising powers, would do everything to prevent this.
The textbook case illustrating the reluctance of Japan's newspapers to dig up controversial or embarrassing stories dates to the 1970's, when a reporter for Mainichi Shimbun produced a major scoop about the United States' compensation to residents for damages by the American military in Okinawa. Rather than being rewarded, the reporter was accused of having had an affair with a source and was fired.
Japan's racy weeklies regularly plunge into this void with gusto, revealing scandals in government and delving into many other subjects that the dailies deem too controversial. Recently there have been articles asserting that the government kept the victim of a recent nuclear accident alive just long enough to get a new nuclear safety bill passed. Other reports have detailed heavy, behind-the-scenes pressures to produce an heir that were placed on the crown prince's wife prior to her recent miscarriage, and scandals within the finance ministry.
"We present articles that the newspapers should write, but don't touch," said Tetsu Suzuki, editor in chief of Shukan Gendai, which claims a weekly circulation of 930,000.
BUT what news these magazines carry is buried among nude photos, obscene comics, serialized fiction and titillating reports. For many readers, the result is that no matter how serious an article is -- and a good number are based on hard fact -- it is usually taken with a large grain of salt.
So the weeklies seem to serve more as pressure valves for burdensome matters in a society that shuns open disputes and confrontational debate, than they do as journalistic crusaders for the truth. Ivan Hall, a historian and author of "Cartels of the Mind," a powerful recent critique of Japan's intellectual closed-mindedness, likened the role to the Japanese salaryman's ritual of drinking after work with superiors. Once drunk, all manner of truths may be safely spoken -- and are sure to be forgotten, or at least played down, the morning after.
Even seen in this light, Japan's pulp weeklies are somewhat less than meet the eye. "The taboos for newspapers involve anything to do with power: the government, the parliament, justice," said Yasunari Okadome, publisher and editor of Uwasa no Shinso, a crusading monthly that refuses major corporate advertising. "These matters go to the weeklies. But the weeklies cannot be totally free either, because they are afraid of Dentsu, and of the tax investigators."
Indeed, a growing body of press criticism says Japan's mainstream dailies suffer from their cosseted relationships with the government and other powerful institutions, while the fat, glossy-covered weeklies pull some of their punches out of fear of Japan's huge and omnipresent advertising agency, Dentsu, an integral part of a deeply conservative establishment.
In particular, Mr. Okadome and others say, Japanese journalism is weakened by tax codes and other legal favors that inhibit competition among newspapers and help keep them tame. But the most important factor, many say, is the institution of the kisha clubs -- press clubs paid for by government agencies and private industries for the mainstream reporters that cover them. These are typically the places of work of the reporters, who often simply wait for news to be handed out to them and compare notes before writing. Mr. Hall likened them to cartels: "They keep out the weeklies, they keep out the foreign press and they tamp down embarrassing matters on behalf of their sources."
Defenders of Japanese newspapers admit that the kisha clubs pose problems, but argue that critics who focus on them miss the point. Culture, they say, more than anything else, divides Western journalism from its Japanese counterpart.
Japan lacks the adversarial, fiercely independent spirit that is the ideal in Western journalism, according to Yoshibumi Wakamiya, a deputy managing editor at the daily Asahi Shimbun, who declared himself unsatisfied with his country's journalism but aware that another country's style cannot be easily transplanted.
"In Japanese society, it is difficult to hold healthy debates," he said. "The person you are debating will feel their personality is under attack, and will hold a grudge. That is Japanese society, and we have to get information from our politicians. If you ask sharp questions, you may end up being isolated, even from other journalists."

HEADLINE: Congo Leader, Once Neighbors' Puppet and Now Their Foe, Clings to Power

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo, Feb. 4

 BODY:
After languishing for three decades in the mountains of eastern Congo, a little-known rebel was picked by the Rwandans to lead the overthrow of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. And so Laurent D. Kabila suddenly found himself president of a country a third of the size of the United States.
Three years later, having angered his former patrons so much that they are now trying to topple him, with half of his nation occupied by foreign forces and all of it in economic ruin, Mr. Kabila is, against the predictions of many people, still in power. 
 The former puppet, who had survived over the years by reportedly leading a small band of rebels who illegally mined gold and once kidnapped some Western scientists, was even the star guest at a special United Nations Security Council session two weeks ago. Seven months after a cease-fire was signed -- and quickly violated by all warring parties -- the United Nations is considering sending a 5,500-member force to monitor the accord.
At the United Nations and in televised interviews, Mr. Kabila forcefully made the point he had been making since the current war began in August 1998 but had been falling on deaf ears: The Congo conflict is not a civil war, but an invasion by two countries, Rwanda and Uganda, which happen to be among Washington's closest allies in Africa.
Meanwhile, talk of a coup against Mr. Kabila, which had swirled around Kinshasa a few months ago, seems to have quieted down for now. Although the outbreak of the current war helped Mr. Kabila's popularity at first, deteriorating economic and social conditions have caused a steady decline in his standing here.
To supporters, Mr. Kabila is a liberator who began changing Congo for the better, but whose plans were derailed by the war. "He would have already organized elections," said Delphin Banza, a lawyer whom Mr. Kabila appointed vice president of a committee to organize a national debate on Congo's future. "Let's give him the time to restore order in this country. Then he'll step down."
But to his detractors, Mr. Kabila is a more brutal dictator than Mr. Mobutu and is using the war as an excuse to clamp down on freedom. "Kabila is governing the Congo as if it were an aquarium," said Joseph Olenghankoy, an opposition figure here who spent 18 months in prison for criticizing Mr. Kabila's government. "He controls the oxygen flow, and we, the Congolese people, are the fish that are suffocating to death."
To fight the war, Mr. Kabila has sought and received help from some unsavory characters. They include Libya; the hard-core Hutu militia that led the 1994 Rwandan genocide; and North Korea.
Mr. Kabila arrived here three years ago as a giant question mark. The coalition that brought him to power, led by Rwanda but also including Uganda and Angola, wanted a friendly power in Congo and needed a Congolese face to head an otherwise foreign assault on Mr. Mobutu's government. Initially, Mr. Kabila even received the praise of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on a visit here.
What was known of Mr. Kabila, though, did not necessarily augur well for the West. He was a follower of Patrice Lumumba, post-independent Congo's first prime minister and a hero of African nationalism. Mr. Lumumba frightened cold war American policy makers; in 1961, he was assassinated with what is believed to have been the participation of the Central Intelligence Agency. The C.I.A. then created Mr. Mobutu and supported him until the end of the cold war made him irrelevant.
In the 1970's, Mr. Kabila's rebel band made news when it kidnapped Western scientists studying gorillas, but afterward slipped into obscurity, said Salih Booker, director of the Africa Studies Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. "He awakened at the moment when a motivated coalition had the power to overthrow Mobutu," Mr. Booker said. "Kabila -- by now a sort of commercial/political entrepreneur -- rode the wave to Kinshasa, but he lacked a plan, a movement, and grew tired of some of his allies and their more focused agenda."
The agenda of Rwanda's Tutsi-led government was essentially to install a Congolese leader willing to help it secure eastern Congo. That area concealed Hutu militias responsible for the 1994 genocide in which at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed.
But Mr. Kabila's closeness to the Tutsi, who are despised in distant Kinshasa, made him unpopular here. He eventually cut his ties with them -- causing the Rwandans to organize a second rebellion, this time against Mr. Kabila, in August 1998. Mr. Kabila's government was close to falling, but he persuaded the Angolans and Zimbabweans to rescue him.
At home, most of the reforms Mr. Kabila undertook in his first year -- the successful introduction of a new currency, the stabilization of the economy and a campaign against corruption -- ground to a halt. Today, the economy has collapsed. Soldiers from Mr. Kabila's presidential guard prey on Congolese and foreigners here, invading cars and demanding money.
A European diplomat based here said the president "had, and for all I know still has, a genuine ambition to improve the conditions in this country." But others -- especially political opponents who have been intimidated or jailed -- say Mr. Kabila is indistinguishable from other African despots who are willing to sacrifice anything to remain in power
"Kabila likes power," said Christophe Gbenye, a Lumumba follower who knew Mr. Kabila in the early 1960's and who is now an opposition figure here. "He wants this war to continue. That way he remains in power. He has absolute control over the country's finances. Money is spent all in the name of war."

HEADLINE: Herbert I. Schiller, 80, Critic of the Corporate Control of Television

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Herbert I. Schiller, a teacher, writer and critic who studied the subject of communication, died on Jan. 29 in La Jolla, Calif. He was 80 and a longtime La Jolla resident.
The cause of death was not disclosed. 
 Dr. Schiller was trained as an economist, began studying the media in the 1960's and was a professor of communication at the University of California, San Diego, from 1970 until he retired in 1990.
"He gave shape and texture to the modern study of communication and culture in America," said Neil Postman, a professor of media ecology at New York University, where Dr. Schiller taught frequently in his last years.
One of the targets in his books was television. In "Culture, Inc.: The Corporate Takeover of Public Expression" (Oxford University Press, 1989), he asserted that commercial television represented "the daily ideological instruction of the viewers."
In 1991, the New York Times television critic John J. O'Connor said the television series "Beverly Hills 90210" with its emphasis on fashion was a "perfect illustration" of Dr. Schiller's point.
Dr. Schiller's last book, finished recently, is "Living in the Number One Country: Reflections From a Critic of American Empire." It is to be published by Seven Stories Press this year.
A native New Yorker, he grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from City College of New York, a master's degree in 1941 from Columbia and, after serving in the Army during World War II, his doctorate in 1960 from New York University.
He lectured at City College and was a government economist, a professor of economics at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and a research professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana before moving to the University of California, San Diego.
He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Anita L. Rosenbaum; two sons, Dan of Del Mar, Calif., and Zach of Cleveland, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Anna Clark, Adviser to La Guardia, Dies at 95

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Anna Holbrook Clark, who transcended a secretarial job to become an influential policy adviser to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and worked at five levels of government, died on Jan. 28 in a Manhattan nursing home. She was 95.
The era in which Ms. Clark served the dynamic mayor known as "the Little Flower" seems almost impossibly quaint: he had no telephone on his desk and wandered into her cubbyhole to take calls. But it was the Depression era, and as the country moved toward World War II she was at the center of events during a turbulent period at City Hall. 
 "I do not think that anyone who stops to consider it can deny that we are in the midst of a social revolution," Ms. Clark said in a paper on economic strategies written for Mayor La Guardia in 1940. She saw the mayor's office as "one of the nerve centers of the world," according to an oral history she prepared in the 1980's.
The pace of life -- eventually as secretary of the Board of Estimate, the panel of top elected officials that then ran city government -- was blistering: Mayor La Guardia resented staff members taking lunch, barely tolerated their vacations and routinely punished unproductive commissioners by making them wait five or six hours for appointments.
Ms. Clark was one of dozens of women promoted by Mayor La Guardia to positions of influence as part of his reformist philosophy. She eventually held jobs at the city, county, state, federal and international levels. Her approach to her often-chaotic working environment was steady, soft-spoken and utterly attentive.
"You told her something once," said Susan Alt, former president of the Women's Civic Club, a policy analysis and advocacy organization of which Ms. Clark was a member throughout her adult life.
Ms. Clark possessed a steely determination learned from her grandmother Kate, a suffragist and prohibitionist who frequently campaigned on street corners.
Women won the right to vote when Ms. Clark was 16. Her mother took her along to the polling place even though she was too young to vote. Smiling broadly, the mother told officials that her daughter was 21 -- a bit of calculated revenge for centuries of female disenfranchisement.
Anna Clark was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights in 1904. She was the oldest of five children. One sister contracted polio and another died of influenza in 1918, leaving a long shadow over the family, said a niece, Cheryl Chalmers.
But spirited discussions of public affairs obscured the sadness. Talk often revolved around corruption cases that her father, John Kirkland Clark, investigated as a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
Ms. Clark attended the Barnard School for Girls, but she later regretted that the school taught her little science. She graduated from Smith College, majoring in government. Her first job was with a magazine published for social workers.
She then received a one-year fellowship to Bryn Mawr College to study bias in the news. Her next job was as a writer for The American City, a technical journal for city government managers. She was laid off during the Depression.
"I remember saying to my family that I thought if I were a man I might try for a job in city government," she said in her oral history. Her father suggested speaking to his secretary, who just happened to be Mayor La Guardia's sister. "I'm not averse to using contacts," Ms. Clark said.
The result was an interview with the mayor at his temporary offices in the Empire State Building during a renovation of City Hall. In the middle of the session, an aide scurried in and whispered in the mayor's ear. The mayor jumped up. "I have to go to a fire," he said. "Come back on Monday."
She was not sure she wanted the job, which involved reorganizing extensive files, supervising three secretaries and much more. But when it was offered, at a salary of $2,600 a year, she grabbed it. Eight months later she received a raise of $280 a year, according to a one-paragraph report in The New York Times.
She was meeting people like Robert Moses, the man behind the city and state's highways, bridges and parks. Introducing her, Mayor La Guardia said, "She's a career woman." Mr. Moses looked at her and asked how long that would last.
She never married, perhaps because her social life was circumscribed by the mountains of work she habitually brought home. She was tall and slender, and had "a sweet manner of speaking," said Edith Spivack, 89, a lawyer who worked in the La Guardia administration. Her voice was authoritative, and she squinted a bit when making an important point, said Richard K. Lieberman, director of the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.
Ms. Spivack said: "She was neat and tidy. She was all the things a lady should be."
As the war deepened, the Board of Estimate did less and less. So Ms. Clark went to Washington to work in the Pentagon, the State Department and the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.
After the war she used a recommendation from Mr. Moses to get a job working on transportation issues in Nassau County. She then worked for the United Nations, raising money for Unicef and helping refugees in Bremen, Germany.
For years Ms. Clark continued to fight for civic improvements, as a member of her Upper East Side community board and in other forums. She led the successful fight to expand bus service on First Avenue to better serve the hospitals there. She lobbied to build four tracks rather than the planned two on the Second Avenue subway should that ill-starred line ever be built.
She is survived by a sister, Margaret Vander Veer of Charlotte, N. C.

HEADLINE: 'I Knew It Would Be Rough': Excerpts From Interview With Mrs. Clinton

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Hillary Rodham Clinton's interview on Thursday with The New York Times:
 
THE REASONS TO RUN
Why the Senate? And why here? I'm running for the Senate because of the issues that I think are most important to the future of New York and America. And they happen to be concerns of mine that go back more than 30 years. And I find that those concerns are the concerns of New Yorkers. 
 It is also true that I believe that it matters who is in the Senate for New York. We do not need to go back to policies that undermined the prosperity and the future of New Yorkers. We need to build on what's been accomplished, and go further.
So I will be speaking throughout this campaign about experiences that I've had before I moved to New York, and experiences I've had since I've been out listening to New Yorkers. And whether it's improving the upstate economy, or improving education, or improving health care, or dealing with the challenges that families face, I believe that my experience is experience that will benefit issues that New Yorkers care about. . . .
We have too many families, and too many children in New York that are not doing as well as we need them to do and that they need to do themselves. Whether it is lack of economic activity for their parents, or crumbling and inadequate schools with poorly prepared teachers, or inaccessible, unaffordable child care, or health care, or too many guns and too much media violence.
We now have an opportunity in our society to look at these fundamental issues because our economy is doing so well. . . .
When the presidential campaign started, and I traveled all through New York for the New York primary, there was such a sense of, well, disappointment about what was happening in the economy. That it just didn't seem to be working for everybody. . . .
We know a lot more about how to make sure that this economy stays on track. And that will be one of my primary objectives, is to keep to the fiscal discipline, the balanced budget approach, using these surpluses to deal with our continuing structural and entitlement challenges. . . .
There are not government solutions for most of these issues. But there are ways you can have public-private partnerships. Ways in which government can encourage families to be responsible. Ways in which government can help to create conditions for schools to be better. So there's a lot that we can do. And I think that's the unfinished business that we need to turn our attention to. . . .
Now when I think about the upcoming race, I think that New York will have a choice between two very different visions of the world, and how we solve problems together. The role of the federal government. The use of the budget surplus. There will be a very strong contrast. And I look forward to making that contrast.
 
ON THE ISSUES
I agree with those who believe that we should take this moment in time to deal with the problems of Social Security, Medicare and paying down the national debt. Therefore I would not support the kind of very large tax cuts that the Republicans are endorsing, and will make the case to the people of New York that that is not in our short-term or long-term interest.
I believe that we know a lot about what it takes to fix public education. So I do not support draining away public resources for vouchers. I've been involved in reforming public education for 17 years. I was probably one of the very first people in public life who called for high standards and called for teacher testing, but also called for additional resources, where appropriate. So I have a long experience in seeing what works in public education and knowing that with the kind of positive leadership that I've seen at work in other cities and states, there's a lot we can do to turn around failing schools. And hold schools and teachers and students to high standards. And I don't think vouchers is the way to get things done. So on a number of issues, we're going to have some very different visions and ideas of what will work.
 
ON REPRESENTING NEW YORK
I don't think the Republicans need any more votes to block campaign finance reform, or turn back the clock on our budget and deficit policies, or to side with the majority of Republican leadership on issues ranging from school vouchers to whether or not we deal with health care in a step-by-step way to try to eventually reach a goal of providing quality affordable health care for everybody. And certainly as I have watched both Senators Schumer and Moynihan lead the fight on behalf of New York's needs, we've seen that two strong Democratic members -- especially if we take back the Senate, which I think is possible -- would be in the best interest of New York.
 
ON GIULIANI
I do think the mayor and I have some issues in common. But you wouldn't know it from his mailings. I am very curious about whether he's giving full disclosure to all of these people he's sending letters to, calling me all these names, as to where he stands on some of the issues that he and I share. What he doesn't tell the readers of his letters is I supported welfare reforms. He didn't.
I support the balanced budget and the continuation of those fiscal policies. He has supported very large tax cuts that would undermine the capacity to continue the paying down of the debt and dealing with Medicare and Social Security.
I support a real patients' bill of rights. He's gone along with Republicans. I support the death penalty. I support a lot of the positions that I think the majority of New Yorkers support.
So I'm always amused when I read these accounts of his mailings trying to get people all agitated about the possibility of my running. There ought to be a big-print disclosure on the bottom that he agrees with many of the positions that I've advocated. And where he disagrees, I think he should be very clear.
 
INTRODUCING HERSELF
I'm certainly well known, for better or worse. People know my name and my face and my many changing hairdos. What I have found is that people don't know anything, really, about the work that I did before Bill was elected president. And know very little -- except about health care -- about the work that I've done in the White House. It became so apparent to me that in order to introduce myself to the voters of New York, I was going to have to go back and really share a lot of my lifestyle. Which is what I intend to do, starting on Sunday, with the brochure and with my campaign. . . .
I think it is perfectly understandable that New Yorkers would say to themselves, "Prove it: show me why I should vote for you." And I can only say, I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to the concerns of New Yorkers. And in the small groups I've been meeting with -- primarily of women -- a lot of women come very skeptical, because they have an idea in their mind of what I am going to be like.
They think I must kind of be carried around in some kind of a chariot, with liveried servants, or something -- so when they meet me, and we start talking about what life is like, and what my experiences have been like, we have an immediate bond. Because I've been there. I mean, I've been the harried, pressured working mom. I've been the concerned, anguished parent about everything from ballet recitals to school curriculum. I've lived through the death of one of my parents and my mother-in-law. I have all the experiences that women today face. The more we are able to talk about that and to share those experiences, the more common ground I find we have.
I went grocery shopping for the first time in years the other day. And I felt like I was sort of back home. Because before the White House, even though we lived in the Governor's Mansion, I drove my own car most of the time. I picked my daughter up. I would take her to run errands. I would go to visit my friends. I would go shopping. I would cook on weekends. I did all of that.
 
ON THE CAMPAIGN
I meant what I said when I started on Senator Moynihan's farm: I was going to go listen and at some point make up my mind about whether thought this would be the right thing for me and the right thing for New York. So I did not have a full-fledged campaign. . . .
And I really worked hard from July into the fall, to test myself, to ask myself, am I doing this for the right reasons? Do I really want to make the commitment to this campaign? Am I willing to go through the fire that I know is waiting for me? Do I think I could make a difference in the Senate? Do I get up every day and know I'm going to make some mistakes and keep going, because I know that's part of learning about how to do it and not get deterred about what may come my way.
I had to go through that whole process. I've never done this before. I knew it would be rough, but I didn't know how I would respond to it. . . .
I think a professional political observer is going to watch me evolve as a candidate. I think that's fair. I hope I'm better now than I was in July or August, and I hope that I'll be better still in May or June. I know I have the qualities and the commitment and the temperament and the experience to be a good senator.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: Who Needs an Image Makeover?;
Sure, Van Gundy Seems Dour, but He Gets Results From His Knicks

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Amid the feel-good vibes emanating through the sheen of the National Basketball Association finals last June, Jeff Van Gundy was still in character. More rumpled than bedsheets in the morning, he peered through his raccoon eyes during a news conference and uttered a line fit for a mob scene.
"If they can't get you on results, they get you on relationships," Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, said before Game 3 against the San Antonio Spurs. "So they're going to get you on something." 
 Under the circumstances, the remark was as unnecessarily rough as a bouncer at a tea party. After all, no one had gotten Van Gundy.
In mid-April, he survived the team's dysfunctional journey when Ernie Grunfeld was sacrificed by Dave Checketts, the Garden's president.
In mid-May, he watched destiny fall his way on Allan Houston's runner while Miami Coach Pat Riley fell crestfallen.
In mid-June, Van Gundy coached a team hanging on by its Band-Aids into the finals, knocking Indiana off its pedestal.
In the end, he had beaten everyone but David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Van Gundy had dodged the bucking political beast inside Madison Square Garden like a rodeo clown.
After he dusted himself off last summer, Van Gundy signed a contract extension and will earn $14 million over the next four years. He knew the reward was coming, but he had also internalized a tumultuous season.
So on that June afternoon in San Antonio, he had an untimely catharsis masked as paranoia.
"In my own way, I was probably giving it a 'in your face' to everybody," Van Gundy said. "Hey, I'm being honest. That's what it probably was. I was venting. Was it the wrong time? Yes. But the difference is, when people hear something they don't agree with, they instantly call it paranoia. If they walked in your shoes, and knew what you had to deal with, they wouldn't see it as paranoia, they'd see it as your take on everything."
The take on Van Gundy has changed through his 11 years with the Knicks. He is less the martyr now after his unlikely ascension from assistant five years ago to the All-Star Game coach of the Eastern Conference next Sunday.
Over time, the romance of Van Gundy the Underdog has faded. As a multimillionaire, his preference for hamburgers and shakes and choice of driving a banged-up Honda aren't so blue-collar anymore. Over time, his grim referendums on his team have worn as thin and transparent as cellophane.
Even members of the organization have crossed their fingers for a more positive approach. While he hasn't been confronted by team officials directly, Van Gundy has taken some well-placed hints about his dour demeanor.
"It's about image, I think," Van Gundy said. "I don't think they should care. This is the way I coach. If it's worn out its welcome, then they'll make a change. I am who I am. I coach the way I coach."
Somehow, he is still standing. Perhaps he has maneuvered through the Garden politics by being a self-deprecating former college honors student who outsmarted the system. Or maybe he is just an example of how fine the line is between a skilled coach being unemployed and being named to guide the All-Star team.
"It's all fragile," he said. "One bounce, one decision."
That one bounce came against the same Miami Heat team that will visit the Garden this afternoon. After Houston's magical shot bounced off the rim and glass and finally gulped by the net, and the last-second shot by the Heat went awry, Van Gundy wasn't celebrating the potential save of his job; he was slinging his coat on the floor like a whip.
"I wanted to kill the ref because of that last play," Van Gundy said, referring to the excessive time Terry Porter got for the Heat's final shot. "But once I hit the locker room, I was happy for the team. My job never entered my mind. Honest. For one thing, I didn't think necessarily I'd get fired if we lost. Now, I will say, the chances were pretty good."
Instead, a trip fantastic played out. But praise for that achievement has been spare. At times, Van Gundy still finds himself taking jabs from inside and outside the locker room.
"I forgot who told me this but it was another coach," Van Gundy said. "He said that each year you lose about 10 percent of your support. So I figure, well, it's my 11th year, and I'm at a negative 10 percent."
If Van Gundy's personality traits are considered to be his shtick outside of his locker room, he can live with that. If his team begins to tune him out, if he begins to lose the ears of his players, there is a threat to his staying power. In every difficult moment, his core players have huddled around him as tightly as a bonfire.
Often, there has been the unflagging support of Patrick Ewing. When his Achilles' tendon was aching last year, part of the reason Ewing said he kept playing was because Van Gundy's job was on the line. When the truth about a meeting Checketts had with Phil Jackson in April was disclosed, Ewing declared he wouldn't play for the former Bulls coach.
Now, Ewing sulks over his diminished role and playing time and hears his name bandied about amid trade exploration. This is new territory for an aging superstar whose 15-year tie to the organization has grown more frayed while his relationship with Van Gundy has shown increasing signs of wear.
It's a delicate situation.
"I read a book Bill Walsh wrote," Van Gundy said of the San Francisco 49ers' former coach. "One thing that stood out is the one thing that applies to every coach: the hardest thing to do is coach the star as he gets older. And Patrick has made it easy to this point. My admiration for him hasn't changed, but I know that he wants more. And I understand that. But I still, in my mind, have to do what's best for the team."
Van Gundy might resist the notion, but some of his players see the coach's departure from a Ewing-based system as a sign of progress. One Knick player sighed and said, "It's about time."
At his own pace, Van Gundy has adjusted to his ever-changing personnel. Under his watch, the once passive Houston has developed into an All-Star; the once impetuous Latrell Sprewell has morphed into a team player and the once isolated Marcus Camby has been brought into the fold as an impact player.
"Once he told me he respected me as a player and a person, everything was fine," Camby said, referring to a summertime meeting he had with Van Gundy.
One thing has remained the same over the years: Van Gundy's image as a players' coach. But he is not immune to criticism. When the season hit a peak in tension last season -- with an inept 76-63 loss to Chicago on March 12 -- Van Gundy moved swiftly to waive the happy-go-lucky Dennis Scott.
"Jeff used me as a scapegoat," Scott said the night he was cut. "That's how he is."
Manipulator or not, Van Gundy has been effective. Not to say that his players have not rolled their eyes at Van Gundy this season, but the Knicks are currently neck-and-neck with the Heat for the Atlantic Division lead. Something must still be working for Van Gundy.
It was much different last April. The newness of Knick personnel, the severity of injuries and the crunch of the lockout led to disarray behind the scenes and acrimony between management and the coach.
"I'll say this about Ernie Grunfeld," Van Gundy said. "The relationship we had was never as bad as it was portrayed. We had problems, but they were born from losing."
But the Knicks, strapped with the league's highest payroll, were on the verge of collapse. Perhaps rationalizing his decision -- leaning on the something-has-to-change philosophy -- Checketts picked Van Gundy over Grunfeld.
"Sometimes you get lucky," Checketts said. "I don't want to rehash the past, but I have to say that Jeff had the respect of his players."
What motivates Van Gundy is his relentless pursuit of winning. To that end, some wonder if he does calculate every word when he discusses the state of his team, an opponent or officials.
"No one took me to task for things earlier, when I was young, saying things that were on my mind," Van Gundy said. "All of this has crept in recently. Think about it; I once called Michael Jordan a con man. I was more up front then. People say they want honesty, but most of the time they don't."
He discovered the perils of honesty in January of 1997. Van Gundy walked into a food court at a mall in Indiana the night after Jordan responded to the "con man" reference by scoring 51 points in a 1-point victory by the Bulls over the Knicks.
"The players saw me, and they were giving it to me like there was no tomorrow," Van Gundy said. "It was funny, but they were letting me have it, like, 'Couldn't you pick on somebody else?' "
That is not his nature. Van Gundy is the same coach who lunged in the middle of a fight between Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning two years ago, grabbed onto the ankle of Heat's center like a terrier and held on for the humiliating ride. Has he grown from each embarrassing experience? Has he changed or matured?
"I think if you look at coaches and their ability to last in New York, it's tough for a lot of reasons," Checketts said. "But we all have the ability to change and grow and remake ourselves. I'm not saying he needs to do that, but I think he has done that in a way."
In a way, Van Gundy has. He has been more reserved this season. But this year it is easier to measure his words and actions. The Knicks are winning. There is no tension behind the scenes, and all seems healthier under the guidance of General Manager Scott Layden.
"Scott has a wonderful sense of humor and a great way with people," Checketts said. "Scott and Jeff have a great relationship."
Of course, Van Gundy has an answer for this. "Scott's new," he said. "He hasn't grown tired of me yet."
As he stood in his rumpled blue sweats, with an unshaven chin, he either meant what he said or he was just in character.
"That's the thing after 11 years," Van Gundy said. "No one takes you at face value."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Facing Wider Issues In Its Actions Over Austria

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton's top foreign policy adviser says Washington's decision this week to impose diplomatic sanctions against Austria is driven partly by a desire to send a message that the United States will not stand by idly if other anti-immigrant, far-right parties try to join other coalition governments in Europe.
"There is a concern about whether the extreme hateful right could emerge in Europe," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said in an interview on Friday evening. "There are extreme small parties that exist in some countries," he added, clearly referring to Germany and France though carefully not mentioning them by name. The United States, he said, had to make it clear that "democracy is about more than elections, it is also about shared values." 
 This was the first time that a senior American official had publicly voiced fears that the inclusion of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party in the new Austrian government could inspire similar groups elsewhere in Europe. In private, some American officials have expressed particular concern about Germany, fearing that the troubles of the scandal-ridden Christian Democrats could create a political vacuum that far-right parties might try to exploit.
Mr. Berger peppered his remarks with praise for the swiftness with which the European Union acted to downgrade diplomatic relations with Austria, a formal step the United States has so far not joined. Instead, it has temporarily recalled the American ambassador, Kathryn Walt-Hall, for "consultations," and on Friday barred the Austrian defense attache from a relatively routine meeting of American and European officials here. "It's the Europeans themselves who have set the pace on this," he said.
President Clinton, Mr. Berger said, was deeply involved in the decision to condemn the Austrian action, but he has yet to talk to Austria's leaders, a step left to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. "We had to send a signal, to say, like the Europeans, that there will not be business as usual," he said.
Yet the American response, Mr. Berger acknowledged, was being carefully measured in hopes of not inciting a greater nationalist backlash in Austria.
"We have to walk a fine line here between expressing our concern and not fueling" Austrian passions, he said.
It is far from clear that strategy is working. Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel defended the inclusion of the Freedom Party, led by Jorg Haider, in the new government and said he "sharply" rejected what he called "unjustified accusations" from Europe and the United States.
"I must defend myself against unacceptable comparisons," said Mr. Schussel, who heads the Austrian People's Party. "There is no new Hitler on the rise in Austria."
Washington's reaction, in fact, broke from the Clinton administration's usual playbook. Except in rare instances, the inclusion of extremist minority parties or politicians in democratic foreign governments is termed an "internal affair" in the State Department's lexicon, a matter to be left to the voters of the nation involved. And in recent years Washington has stood silent while Japanese cabinet officials have expressed sympathy with the invasion of China and Korea during World War II, for example, and while far-left governments have come to power in Europe.
But Mr. Berger made clear that he saw the events in Austria as qualitatively different, and he seemed unimpressed by a declaration issued by the new government that it would commit itself to "understanding all human beings irrespective of their origin."
Mr. Haider seemed to backtrack on that statement almost as soon as he signed it, saying it was an "affront" that Austria had to sign such statements.
Despite the verbal barrage unleashed here this week against Austria, however, the Clinton administration still seems unwilling to take actions that would truly hurt Austria or that could speed the fall of the coalition government.
For example, it does not appear to be examining any economic sanctions, although the vocal criticism of the new government could discourage new American or European investment in the country. And it is unclear how Europe could economically punish a nation with which it will soon share a currency -- a diplomatic complication with no real precedent.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE POPULIST APPEAL;
The Inside Outsiders Behind John McCain

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
It was just about this time three years ago that John Weaver, a tall, terse Texan, dragged Senator John McCain from a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to tell him he should run for president.
Mr. Weaver, a Republican political consultant from San Antonio, had worked with Mr. McCain as field director of Senator Phil Gramm's short-lived presidential campaign in 1996. 
 He had decided that Mr. McCain, with his compelling personal biography and maverick stances, had just the right resume for the post-Clinton years. And perhaps more important, he thought the Republican Party had lost its way and let President Clinton emerge as the one who understood the concerns of middle-class voters.
Neither Mr. Weaver nor Mr. McCain knew what they were on their way to creating that day: a seat-of-the pants populist candidacy that has turned the Republican Party establishment on its head and is now threatening its chosen candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Now Mr. Weaver, 40, the constant brooding presence on the campaign bus -- Mr. McCain impishly calls him Sunny because he is not -- is one of a small band of Republican insiders who are helping Mr. McCain mount a campaign that often seems to run on gut instincts, impulse and wit.
Even Mr. McCain acknowledges some surprise at how his populist reform message is growing into something larger than the sum of its parts.
His New Hampshire primary upset -- if replicated elsewhere -- suggests that he has an appeal that stretches broadly across the political spectrum.
"It's fair to say we knew what we were trying to do," Mr. McCain said. "But we didn't realize that it was catching on."
There is still a hard road ahead of Mr. McCain, and many potential pitfalls. The senator's appeal is built on intangibles that include a public infatuation with his personality and his gripping biography. Some of the luster could fade as voters focus more on his policy positions over time. Mr. Bush is already trying to tar him as a hypocrite on campaign finance reform because he has accepted campaign donations from lobbyists. And it may still turn out that Mr. Bush's money and organization kick in and stem the insurgency.
Mr. McCain's success so far has been a combination of some early planning, some risks that paid off and some clever off-the-cuff decision making. His gamble to skip Iowa and concentrate on New Hampshire worked out spectacularly, as did his certainty that he could generate a bonanza of media coverage through his accessibility.
Mr. McCain has also benefited from the strangely ineffective campaign that the front-runner has conducted. Mr. Bush has seemed diffident, and he has kept piling on endorsements even after signs that they were backfiring.
For now the McCain candidacy has hit a nerve.
"McCain set out to create an insurgency," said William Kristol, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and editor of The Weekly Standard, "but as often happens in these situations, it's almost bigger than him and bigger than any of the proposals. And it goes beyond his personal ambitions or intentions."
Mr. McCain said the first one in his circle to notice what was happening was Mark Salter, his speechwriter and longtime Senate administrative assistant, who saw the excitement grow in Mr. McCain's New Hampshire crowds.
"He said to me three or four times, 'Look at the look in these people's eyes,' " Mr. McCain said.
Some of Mr. McCain's themes were meticulously planned from the beginning -- the emphasis on character, national security expertise, campaign finance overhaul and the devotion of much of the surplus to Social Security.
But some of the populist tones of the campaign arose from snap decisions made along the way, like Mr. McCain's antic appearance before the Russian consulate accusing New York Republicans of acting like apparatchiks seeking to preserve a one-party state.
The stunt was dreamed up the day before by Mike Murphy, Mr. McCain's bomb-throwing senior strategist, as a way of fighting the party's effort to keep Mr. McCain off the ballot for the state's primary. The candidate loved it.
And no one quite expected Mr. McCain's campaign bus, "Straight Talk Express," to become a symbol in itself of his live-off-the-land campaign.
"The bus just kind of evolved," Mr. Weaver said. "I'm a big believer in bus tours. John wanted to have the press with him, and one thing led to another and it became a tradition that, unfortunately, I don't think we could ever stop."
Greg Stevens, Mr. McCain's media consultant, said simply, "We were trying to win. We are creating a new party in the process of trying to win." He said, "There wasn't this overt decision on the part of the campaign six months ago to try to create McCain Republicans."
What is threatening to the Republican Party is that Mr. McCain in many ways is running against its Congressional leadership, against its big-business wing and against some of its conservative allies, groups like Americans for Tax Reform and the National Right to Life Committee, which have both run advertisements against him. He tars all of them as the Washington establishment that has lost touch with the people.
There is an unlikely group of battle-scared campaign veterans from across the spectrum of the Republican Party who are helping Mr. McCain do this. And they are hardly outsiders. Rick Davis, 42, the campaign manager, is a Washington lobbyist and merchant banker known as a fund-raising whiz who has close ties to the same business establishment that Mr. McCain likes to rail against.
Mr. Murphy, 37, is known for some of the most rough-edged commercials in the business and has worked for clients as diverse as Christine Todd Whitman and Oliver North. He did not join the McCain campaign formally until Lamar Alexander had dropped out of the race because he had been with Mr. Alexander in 1996 and remained loyal.
Mr. Stevens, 51, the media consultant, began his political career as chief of staff to former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, and he worked for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole. Bill McInturff, 46, Mr. McCain's pollster, was Mr. Dole's pollster.
Mr. Salter, 44, is the McCain loyalist who helped write Mr. McCain's autobiography. Mr. Weaver was once the executive director of the Texas Republican Party and has counted 11 senators as his political clients.
"All of us came together for different reasons," Mr. Weaver said, "but we're unified in thinking the party has to change its way. We've lost two national elections and are in danger of losing Congress."
Mr. McCain, 63, had been intrigued by the idea of running for president ever since he accompanied his friend Bob Dole on the campaign trail in 1996, acting as what he calls Mr. Dole's designated smiler. He says his role was to sit in front of Mr. Dole in audiences and grin as a way of trying to remind the candidate not to look so dour.
He made his decision to run in December 1998. From the start his campaign emphasized his character and extraordinary experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam to distinguish him from Mr. Clinton.
This laid the groundwork for what could have been a fairly traditional Republican campaign, appealing to conservative voters through the emphasis on a strong military and military traditions of honor and patriotism. Mr. Dole, who had been grievously wounded in World War II, had himself sometimes emphasized his biography and had certainly tried to run against Mr. Clinton's character.
But Mr. McCain also had in his quiver of issues his Senate crusade to overhaul the campaign finance law. His aides were concerned that this would not resonate with the voters and they hoped to persuade him to play it down.
But when they tested it in the polling they used to start the campaign they were surprised to find that in four critical primary states, 60 percent of Republican voters said a change in the finance system was important. Only 15 percent said it was not.
"We knew that John would talk about it," Mr. Weaver said. "We didn't think he should stress it. So we had to eat a lot of crow."
It was also Mr. McCain himself, his aides say, who decided early on that he wanted to depart from the tax-cutting wing of his party that advocated supply-side economics and put more of an emphasis on using the budget surplus for Social Security and debt reduction.
His plans to make this point last spring were disrupted when the United States bombing of Yugoslavia began and Mr. McCain decided he would not formally announce his candidacy during a military campaign. Mr. McCain returned to the Social Security issue this winter, making it a critical point of distinction between him and Mr. Bush.
Some of the nature of the McCain campaign was developed because of his comparative lack of money, which forced some unorthodox thinking. Mr. Murphy remembers gathering with Mr. McCain and a few aides in 1998 in his Senate office. He pulled out his laptop computer full of slides and data and argued for 40 minutes that the senator should save money by skipping the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Davis, who had also been courted sporadically by Elizabeth Dole's campaign, then built an organization that was lean by presidential standards, allowing as much money as possible to be put into television advertising. The lack of staff -- Mr. McCain has 65 full-time aides compared with about 180 for Mr. Bush -- has shown at times in the campaign's inability to turn out polished position papers.
But it has also made the campaign flexible and able to change gears fast. Earlier this year, for example, after reading in a newspaper that minority journalists felt insulted that Mr. Bush had turned down an invitation to stop by their convention, Mr. McCain decided to toss out his schedule and go to the convention.
Some of Mr. McCain's populist, establishment-bashing tones have come in reaction to the Bush campaign and the establishment opposition to him. He would not have been making gleeful attacks on the New York Republican leaders if they had not tried to keep him off the ballot.
"When the establishment pushes, he pushes back," Mr. Murphy said. "Weighing in as they have they've created some of this. There's poetic justice in all of this."
On Friday, in a vindication of Mr. McCain's effort, a federal judge put the senator's name on the ballot all over the state.
At moments, members of Mr. McCain's inner circle have started to fear the populism of their own campaign. On the stump, Mr. McCain began skewering Mr. Bush's tax plan as too tilted to the rich after he read a magazine article that made that analysis. But when the campaign weighed whether to put that line of argument into a commercial, aides say there was quite a debate about whether to go forward with a class warfare tactic usually more the province of Democrats.
According to participants in the discussion Vin Weber, a lobbyist who is a member of Mr. McCain's informal kitchen cabinet, opposed the move. Mr. Davis wanted any decision to run the advertisement to be made deliberately and carefully. Mr. Weaver, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Stevens were all for it. The commercial was broadcast.
And as Mr. McCain's campaign goes on, its rebel spirit is only growing stronger. Mr. Salter joined Mr. McCain's Senate staff after working for Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. He does not have the profile of a rabble-rouser. But on the night of the New Hampshire primary, when Mr. McCain promised to "break the Washington iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation," Mr. Salter was in the audience shouting, "Burn it down."

HEADLINE: Murder Trial Reveals More Than a Killing

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
It looked like the handiwork of a brazen killer. On a busy shopping corridor in Jackson Heights, Queens, a man gunned down a couple at point-blank range as they sat in their Lexus. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, went to the crime scene himself. When a local grocer named Peter Bok Lee was charged with the slayings two days later, prosecutors considered seeking the death penalty.
Since then, the sensational tale of the May 1998 double murder has spun out several curious subplots. The suspect, Mr. Lee, the son of a prominent Korean-American pastor in Queens, has been showered with support from local clergymen, many of whom pooled their money to offer a reward they say is for finding the real killer. The defense lawyer charged the police with bungling the investigation, arguing that an elderly Korean-speaking man was coaxed by the police to identify his client. 
 And finally, the trial, now under way in Queens Criminal Court, has cast light on an underground, unregulated financial system inside the Korean-American community in which cash loans can be procured quickly at steep interest rates, an often illegal practice.
The couple gunned down in Jackson Heights, Kyung Sok Lee, 35, and So Hui Green, 31, were well-known moneylenders. Prosecutors say that the defendant, Mr. Lee, the owner of Sunny Supermarket in Sunnyside, owed them $34,694. He is not related to Kyung Sok Lee. In a signed contract, the defendant pledged to repay it by 4 p.m. that Sunday, or turn over equipment from his store, prosecutors said. Twenty minutes after the debt was due, the couple was killed.
The killings took place on Broadway near 75th Street, one of the busiest commercial corridors in Queens. Prosecutors have said the defendant was sitting in the back seat of the couple's car. He shot the couple, Mr. Lee in the head first, they said, and when Ms. Green tried to run, he shot her in the head, too.
The arrest initially shocked the Korean-American religious community, and drew non-Korean clergy to Mr. Lee's side. His father, the Rev. James K. Lee, pastor of the New York Korean Church of the Nazarene, once headed the local Korean-American clergy group. Soon after Mr. Lee was charged, a delegation of religious leaders urged prosecutors to reconsider the case. The reward fund that was collected has since turned up no leads. Mr. Lee's lawyer, Dino J. Lombardi, acknowledges the debt and said it was being paid down. At the time of their deaths, the defense lawyer said, Mr. Lee, 36, owed about $15,000 and had agreed to enter into a partnership with the couple on a second grocery store.
The defendant's sister, Karen Lee, described the couple as loan sharks. Her family, she said, had heard from several small business owners who had dealt with them. Some had lost their businesses, she said, but none wanted to come forward.
The system of sa chae (pronounced SA CHAY) -- the Korean phrase for private loans -- is hardly unusual in Korean immigrant circles. Like the more widely known system of savings pools called kye (pronounced KAY), in which members contribute a small amount and take turns borrowing from the pool, private loans are seen as a quick source of cash without the paperwork or sound credit history required by conventional lenders.
Richard Yoon, a former Queens prosecutor who now represents mostly Korean-American clients, estimates that more than half of the small Korean-owned businesses in the city rely on this credit. Sa chae is almost unheard of outside of the Korean-American community. Officials with the State Banking Department, the attorney general's office and the city's Department of Consumer Affairs said they were unaware of it.
It offers little protection for lender or debtor. But cynicism and fear of government authorities make most Korean-Americans wary of bringing complaints, Mr. Yoon said.
Edward Chang, a professor at the University of California at Riverside, says the practice of private loans comes from Korea, where entrepreneurs have difficulty getting bank loans. In this country, cash businesses in particular, like groceries and nail salons, rely on private lenders.
In the immigrant community, reputation is collateral. "Saving one's face is highly valued," Mr. Chang said; lenders trust their clients to make their monthly payments. Interest rates vary. Neither side in the Queens murder trial has specified how much was being charged, though Mr. Lombardi, the defense attorney, said it was around the 20 percent limit set by state law.
As the trial has unfolded over the last two weeks in Queens Criminal Court, the assistant district attorney, Jack Warsawsky, has shown the jury documents that he says spell out Mr. Lee's debt. Other evidence includes Mr. Lee's passport, which was found in the car. And he has called two witnesses. One said he saw Mr. Lee point a gun at a woman who was lying on the ground. The other, Jae Chun Pak, identified Mr. Lee in a line-up.
The defense has said the passport was in the car because it had been taken as security on the loan. No forensic evidence connects Mr. Lee to the killing, Mr. Lombardi said. And he has seized on the testimony of Mr. Pak.
An elderly man who speaks only Korean, Mr. Pak's interpreter during the line-up was a Korean-speaking police officer who, Mr. Lombardi suggested, coaxed him to identify Mr. Lee. What's more, Mr. Lombardi said, Mr. Pak was shown Mr. Lee's passport photo before the line-up.
The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case by midweek. If convicted, Mr. Lee could spend the rest of his life in prison.

HEADLINE: McCall Calls for a Moratorium on the Expansion of Gambling

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 5

 BODY:
In an indirect challenge to Gov. George E. Pataki, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall called today for a moratorium on the expansion of gambling in New York and said the state must devote more attention to gambling's social and economic consequences.
Mr. McCall, a Democrat, is considering running for governor in 2002 against Mr. Pataki, a Republican who has made several attempts to expand gambling in New York. Without mentioning Mr. Pataki by name, Mr. McCall's report, to be released Sunday, criticizes state officials for rushing to embrace casinos and new lottery games as ready sources of revenue. "Introducing all this gambling is a gamble itself," he said in a statement. "The state is gambling away good sense for the sake of expediency." 
 But Mr. McCall, who has a reputation as a cautious politician, never makes clear in his report whether he supports or opposes gambling. Instead, the 52-page report is loaded with general information about national and state policies on gambling and the social problems created by gambling addictions. It ends with a call for a moratorium on the expansion of gambling until the state addresses a wide range of gambling-related issues.
Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for Mr. McCall, said the comptroller was "not antigambling" but wanted to focus attention on the issue.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,who is regarded as the most powerful Democrat in the Legislature, wants to allow casino gambling in economically depressed areas like Niagara Falls and the Catskills.
Mr. Pataki has lobbied to bring Powerball, the lottery game sponsored by 20 states and the District of Columbia, to the state, and he won legislative approval for Quick Draw -- a keno-style lottery game played on video monitors in bars and delis -- in 1995 with the promise of new revenue. But last year, as antigambling forces mobilized, the Legislature passed on his request to expand Quick Draw.
More recently, Mr. Pataki has given tacit support to a proposal for an Indian casino in Monticello that is awaiting approval from the federal government. In 1997, he backed an unsuccessful amendment that would have changed the Constitution to allow non-Indian casinos.
Joe Conway, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Pataki had not yet seen Mr. McCall's report but questioned its intent. "If it's like most of Carl McCall's recent work products, I'm sure it will be long on political rhetoric and very short on the facts," Mr. Conway said.
Mr. McCall's efforts were welcomed by at least one group. Laura M. Letson, executive director of the New York Council on Problem Gambling, a nonprofit group, estimated that nearly 11 percent of adults in the state, or about one million people, had gambling-related problems.
"It does seem that every time you turn around, the governor is promoting one form of gambling or another as a means of moving forward," she said.
"We take objection to these recommendations being made without having a comprehensive plan of action that would address the adverse effects."

HEADLINE: CUNY Tests, A Last Hurdle, Stump Many

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Hundreds of students -- both freshmen and transfers -- who otherwise met the admissions criteria at four senior colleges of the City University of New York were recently barred from registering at these colleges because they failed the university's English or mathematics placement tests.
They are the first casualties in CUNY's effort to raise standards as its bitterly debated new entrance policy took effect at Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and Baruch Colleges with the beginning of spring semester. 
 One of those affected was Tasha Vila, who just completed three semesters of study at New York University. Hoping to save money, Ms. Vila, 22, a nursing student from Brooklyn, tried to transfer to Hunter College last month. But when she failed the writing and mathematics tests, she was urged to register as a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College instead.
"This is so ridiculous," she said. "People get admitted to a college and say no to other colleges, and then find they're not allowed in. I'm not dumb, but I get a little scared of tests sometimes."
By early January, of approximately 6,000 students who had been accepted into the four senior colleges for the spring term (some on a provisional basis), about 600 -- one student in 10 -- had still not managed to pass all three of the examinations required for enrollment.
Some won a last-minute reprieve; about 350 passed the necessary tests after brief intensive workshops that CUNY offered free during January. But other students who were admitted later also failed the test, and as classes started last week, CUNY officials estimated that more than 300 students had still failed to clear the academic hurdle.
CUNY is just one of a growing number of public university systems from Florida to California that are trying to remove remedial classes from their catalogs and poorly prepared students from their classrooms.
But CUNY has drawn national attention because it is denying entry to students who otherwise qualify for admission but then do not earn high enough scores on diagnostic tests, sometimes on the eve of registration.
Although there has been much hand-wringing over the weak academic preparation of many high school graduates, many of the students caught in the remedial net in January at CUNY were not entering freshmen. Rather, like Ms. Vila, they were transfers from other colleges, some of whom had spent two or three years in college. Some were graduates of community colleges, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester, in the State University of New York system. Others came from bachelor's degree programs, some fairly selective. Besides New York University, they included Long Island University, Pace, Adelphi, the University of Maryland and SUNY campuses at Buffalo, Purchase and Old Westbury.
Trying to make the best of a difficult situation, CUNY is offering a new program called Prelude to Success that allows students who failed one or more of the exams to enroll for one semester as community college students but take their classes on the senior college campuses, taught by faculty members imported from the community colleges. Ms. Vila, for example, is taking her courses at Hunter.
Besides noncredit remedial courses, the students take community college courses (or, in special cases, senior college courses) for credit in the expectation that most will qualify as full-fledged senior college students after passing the tests at the end of the semester. If they fail the tests again, they will be told to remain as community college students or go elsewhere.
Created by Hunter and Borough of Manhattan Community College and backed enthusiastically by CUNY officials, the Prelude program offers a fig leaf to all involved. It allows students to say they are at a senior college and allows CUNY to declare that it has raised standards. It also fills empty senior college classrooms and relieves a potential space crunch at the community colleges.
CUNY officials estimate that nearly 200 students have signed on for the new program, but the numbers are expected to balloon in September, when many more students typically start college. CUNY's seven other senior colleges will also adopt the remedial policy either later this year or next year. The other colleges, whose admissions criteria are less demanding than those at Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and Baruch, are expected to face greater numbers of students who cannot pass the tests.
Students who attended non-English-speaking foreign high schools or whose families are economically disadvantaged are permitted to delay by one year passing the entrance exams. Students who score at least 500 on the verbal or math SAT exams or at least 75 on the English or math Regents tests do not have to pass the entrance exams.
To some CUNY administrators and professors, the fact that transfer students are failing freshmen placement tests demonstrates both the rigor of CUNY's tests and the uneven education students receive at other colleges. "This says that our standards really are pretty high," said Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice chancellor for academic affairs. "Second, it says that the preparation students are receiving at some other institutions has gaps."
But Bernard Sohmer, a mathematics professor at City College and the faculty representative on the CUNY board, said that seeing the new policy introduced reinforced his belief that CUNY was turning away solid students. "This is foolish," he said, pointing to a top student from the University of California who failed CUNY's math placement exam. "It's not like she's inept; she just never saw any of that stuff. CUNY is barring transfer students who would be a credit to the institution."
Students who were told last month they could not register at Hunter had mixed feelings about their plight.
Some, like Monique Tannenbaum, 19, a transfer student from C. W. Post College on Long Island, were indignant. "To me, a placement test is to find out what level to put me in, not to kick me out of school," she said, adding that she withdrew from C. W. Post under the mistaken impression that she had been accepted by Hunter. She said her mother had even called several political officials seeking help to get her into Hunter.
Rosa V. Lara, an 18-year-old from Venezuela who graduated from Edgemont High School in Scarsdale while her father worked for the United Nations, was more stoic. She figured the remedial mathematics course she would have to take would eventually help her pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. "This program is great because it gives you the opportunity to prepare well for things you didn't do well in in high school," she said.
Still others seemed hurt and bewildered, as if left without seats during a game of musical chairs.
Elvin Gomez, 19, a freshman in a bulky black ski jacket, barreled into the fourth-floor classroom where students who had failed the placement tests were being offered the opportunity to enroll in the Prelude program as Bronx Community College students at Hunter.
Mr. Gomez, who came to New York from the Santiago Christian School in the Dominican Republic, said he narrowly failed both the math and reading tests. The reading did not surprise him; the math did. "In algebra, I was like, rocking," he said. "A lot of people passed because I helped them with their homework."
Evelyn Lalamaa, 18, who is from the Bronx, also seemed stunned that she had failed the math exam. She took three years of high school math at William Howard Taft High School and graduated 30th in her class of about 360 last June. St. John's, Pace and St. Francis all accepted her. But now she was being advised to register at a two-year college, the Borough of Manhattan Community College, rather than at Hunter.
As classes started last week -- the Prelude courses conducted by professors from the Borough of Manhattan Community College in Hunter classrooms -- teachers tried to be encouraging. "Many of the students are really very good," Gail Mansouri, a government professor at Borough of Manhattan, said as she prepared to dash from Hunter to her next class at B.M.C.C., downtown. "Their skills just need to be developed."

HEADLINE: CHAOS IN CONGO: A primer.;
Many Armies Ravage Rich Land In the 'First World War' of Africa

BYLINE: This article was reported by Ian Fisher, Norimitsu Onishi, Rachel L. Swarns, Blaine Harden and Alan Cowell, and written by Mr. Fisher and Mr. Onishi. 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo

 BODY:
Congo and the nine nations around it sit on what may be the richest patch of this planet: there are diamonds, oil, uranium, gold, plentiful water, fertile land and exquisite wildlife.
It is now also one of the biggest battlefields in Africa's history, the object of a conflict that has been dubbed "Africa's first world war." 
 Six outside states are fighting inside Congo alone, with at least 35,000 soldiers, men and boys, battling for a bewildering number of reasons. Some armies are allied with rebel groups to oust President Laurent Kabila of Congo. Others are protecting him. Nine rebel groups in Congo are fighting to overthrow governments in neighboring countries. Nearly everyone carts off Congo's riches.
These conflicts are a series of related wars, fueled by ethnic conflict, by a scramble for power and riches among people with very little of either, and by leaders with little idea of responsibility for those people. Rooted in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the fighting has smoldered inconclusively for 18 months; in that time rebels and invading armies have expanded their reach to half of Congo's vast expanse, but the war remains largely a stalemate.
Neither Mr. Kabila nor the rebels have strong support in the population. The foreign armies on both sides have been reluctant to commit their men to all-out battles that could explode into even greater warfare, perhaps beyond Congo.
Now, into this chaos, the United Nations is considering the deployment of the oddly precise number of 5,537 troops to monitor a cease-fire signed last summer, but violated with impunity by all sides ever since.
In late January, seven African presidents met at the United Nations in New York for a special Security Council session, convened by Richard C. Holbrooke, the American representative, in an attempt to make the cease-fire stick. They did little beyond reasserting the goals of the agreement, and continuing negotiations at a lower level hold out only minimal hope.
The worries are clear, the solutions elusive. Experts say Africa has not been so consumed by conflict since colonial days. Tens of thousands have died. Hundreds of thousands have been uprooted from their homes. Elephants and gorillas are poached for food. Economies, already as diseased and undernourished as their people, are dying.
Many experts argue that the force contemplated by the United Nations is far too small, considering the sheer size and terrain of Congo -- a decomposed nation of thick jungle, poor communications and ghost tracks that once were roads. But for some of the nations that would pay for the peacekeeping force -- the United States first among them -- any number of soldiers is too many unless the warring nations and factions in Congo show that they are serious about peace. The peacekeepers, they argue, would simply not be safe.
Practically, the proposed deployment would probably mean battalions of soldiers placed in three strategic spots around an area roughly as big as Western Europe.
"It's totally inadequate," said Jakkie Potgieter, senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South Africa. After all, this is a conflict of unprecedented scale in Africa. On the eastern borders, two nations that had helped to install Mr. Kabila only three years ago, Rwanda and Uganda, are now fighting just as fiercely to overthrow him. They are allied with three Congolese rebel groups, which have also skirmished with one another.
On the other side, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia saved Mr. Kabila from almost certain defeat when the war started in August 1998, and Mr. Kabila has also allied himself with tens of thousands of Hutu militiamen responsible for the Rwandan genocide, as well as indigenous warriors known as the Mayi-Mayi, who believe that water has magical qualities that protect them from bullets.
The motives are as tangled as the conflicts. For those arrayed against Mr. Kabila, the keystone is the devastating Hutu-Tutsi rivalry that has kept Rwanda and Burundi in convulsions for years. The Tutsi-led government of Rwanda is there to curb the Hutu militia; Uganda joined in the fray to support Rwanda and to curb its own rebels based in Congo. Burundi has also sent forces into Congo to fight Hutu rebels of its own.
From the south, Angola needs Mr. Kabila to fight its own Unita rebels, based in southern Congo. Namibia is there to help Angola. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, has come to Mr. Kabila's support out of personal ambition to be a force in the region, and because his generals are growing rich exploiting Congolese resources of timber, gold, diamonds and metals.
The participation of those nations, in turn, has sent shock waves further afield, in the form of fleeing refugees or opportunistic rebellions, to Zambia, Burundi, Tanzania, Sudan. What further confuses matters is the rivalry for regional authority between Mr. Mugabe and Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni -- and, on all sides, the lure of Congo's riches.
All this raises the question: Is now a time for a return of pessimism about Africa? Will its unending problems merely give rich nations yet another excuse to write off Africa, already largely forgotten without the cold war to keep the continent strategically relevant?
Just two years ago, President Clinton traveled here proclaiming a "renaissance" of vital new leaders, vibrant economies and great hopes. And optimists say there is still plenty of good: South Africa and many southern nations are thriving, and Nigeria, where one in six Africans lives, returned to democracy last May after nearly 16 years of military rule. In 1975, only three heads of state were chosen through elections. Last year, 32 of 54 leaders were elected.
Still, many of the leaders singled out as models by Mr. Clinton are at war. Fighting burns in an unbroken line from the South Atlantic to the Red Sea: Angola, Namibia, Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea (not to mention a military coup in Ivory Coast, a West African nation that was once the model of stability).
It is virtually impossible for outsiders to witness the fighting around Central Africa, often because it takes place far inside jungles so dense that United Nations logisticians have debated whether peacekeepers should bother to carry binoculars.
It is a war both modern and primitive, fought in helicopter gunships and aerial bombings, but more often by bands of men armed with rifles and machetes darting in and out of forest that has become as inaccessible as when King Leopold II of Belgium first commissioned Henry Stanley to explore it in 1878.
Nobody knows the toll; the estimate most often cited is 100,000 combatants, refugees and civilians killed since fighting in Congo began.
But it is easy enough to assemble a collage of the devastation. Recently a newspaper in Kinshasa carried a front-page photograph of a decapitated body from fighting in eastern Congo. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented scores of cases of civilians being killed by combatants, for food or money, or because they were merely in the way.
At the main hospital in Kinshasa, the largest in Congo, a wounded soldier, Sipriant Ndaki, 27, hobbled from his bed to the street, to beg for food. He managed to come up with a quarter of a corncob, which he clutched in his hand as he described how he was shot in the left leg in a battle in Boende in December.
He said his battalion of 300 men had been attacked by Ugandan soldiers. Many died, some drowning when they tried to flee in the river. "I am prepared to die so that the people can be saved," he insisted. Still, he said he was lying in a bed with no sheets or mattress and had not been treated properly. He lifted up his pant leg showing open sores that still bled every day.
Despite its fabulous potential wealth, Congo itself was nearly bled dry by the time this latest war broke out. Three decades of pillage by Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator who was propped up by the country's riches and the cold war patronage of the United States, had ravaged the land that Mr. Mobutu had renamed Zaire.
But nearly three years after Mr. Mobutu was overthrown by Mr. Kabila -- with widespread hopes among locals, Congo's neighbors and more distant foreign powers -- life here remains surreally broken down.
What state hospitals there are must survive on their own. Only a handful of private airlines connect the vast expanse; phones are scarce in Kinshasa and nonexistent in many parts of the country; the roads are terrible.
On the outskirts of Kinshasa -- Congo's capital and westernmost major city, which has grown to six million people from only 400,000 at independence from Belgium in 1960 -- one in 10 children and mothers are malnourished. Rituals as basic as family meals have broken down, as the prices of certain staples like yams have tripled since November.
The outside world shares much of the blame for the plight of Congo and its neighbors: European colonists divided the continent up into nations that rarely bore a relation to geographic or ethnic boundaries. During the cold war, the superpowers picked their proxies, overlooking corruption and abuse of ordinary people.
Today, at a minimum, the West is often accused of lacking the imagination to find solutions in Africa. At worst, the United States in particular is accused of keeping the Congo war going by failing to strongly condemn its allies, Rwanda and Uganda, who entered Congo in August 1998, hiding behind rebel forces that they financed. "Since President Kabila came to power, we have received no assistance from the United States, while Rwanda and Uganda have continued to receive aid," said Uba Thassinda, the Congo vice president for international cooperation. "How can the United States keep helping those countries?"
American officials say they have privately urged Rwanda and Uganda to pull out of Congo. But there are obstacles to pressing too hard: Uganda stands as a bulwark against an Islamic extremist government in Sudan that has harbored anti-American terrorists; and Mr. Clinton has acknowledged a moral debt to Rwanda because the United States did not do enough to stop the genocide.
And all the while, the wars rage on. In Kinshasa, the government has erected billboards in recent months seemingly preparing the Congolese for a long war: "Peace has a price. Be prepared for any sacrifice."
Some experts argue that the war in Congo is actually three wars:
The first is the battle between Mr. Kabila and the Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow him. The second war is an ethnic war in the eastern provinces of Congo, primarily against ethnic Congolese Tutsi. The third war -- really a series of conflicts -- involves all the outside countries: Rwanda and Uganda on the side of the rebels; Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the side of Mr. Kabila.
Following, country by country, is a look at these wars:
 
Congo
After pursuing a somewhat quixotic rebellion against Mr. Mobutu for decades from eastern Congo (then Zaire), Mr. Kabila came to power in 1997, largely through the patronage of Rwanda and Uganda, which needed someone Congolese to head an anti-Mobutu movement.
Once in power, Mr. Kabila was joined in the Kinshasa government by many advisers from Rwanda. Their presence angered the Congolese, and Mr. Kabila cut his ties with the Rwandans. They started a new war, now against Mr. Kabila, in August 1998. Rebels now occupy about half of Congo, roughly the east and northeast. What that usually means is that they nominally hold pivotal towns, airstrips and roads, but remain highly unpopular.
Mr. Kabila inherited an army of about 70,000 when he seized power. He has been joined by several thousand soldiers from the southern province of Katanga, and the government has begun a major recruitment drive. Although Mr. Kabila's own army has improved in the last year, his forces remain poorly trained, and poorly paid. Many are simply boys.
But in many areas nominally under Mr. Kabila's control, it is Angola and Zimbabwe, and not the Congo Army, that are the real power.
Although Western diplomats generally acknowledge that Rwanda and Uganda have invaded Congo, almost no one has publicly supported the Kabila government.
First, Mr. Kabila himself came to power in what could be described as Rwanda and Uganda's first invasion of Congo in 1997; after that war, he allowed his Rwanda-Tutsi allies to seek out and sometimes slaughter Hutu responsible for the Rwanda genocide.
Second, Mr. Kabila's government, after promising reforms, openness and elections, has turned into a repressive rule that has tolerated little or no political opposition, jailed journalists and failed to respect basic human rights.
Third, Mr. Kabila, in his struggle to survive, has made dubious alliances, most notably with the genocidal Hutu, who were largely responsible for the Rwandan genocide and who have taken refuge in Congo.
In July, Mr. Kabila signed the Lusaka accord, calling for a cease-fire and peace talks, but his commitment has been in doubt. Still, he is under increasing pressure to negotiate; of his allies, Angola has reduced its participation in the war, and Zimbabwe's efforts are proving increasingly costly for the government of President Mugabe.
 
Rebels
Nearly half of Congo is occupied by three rebel groups. With some exceptions, the rebels hold all areas of northern and eastern Congo bordering the Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and most of Lake Tanganyika.
Despite the peace accord last summer, fighting has been intense in several areas -- in the northwest corner of Congo around Gemena and south across the Congo River, southwest of Kisangani, and in the North and South Kivu provinces in the far east of Congo. Mbuji-Mayi, the major diamond mining town, is held by the government but surrounded on the north and east by rebels.
Since late in 1999, the rebel groups have tried to work together, with limited success. The major groups are:
The Movement for the Liberation of Congo, headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba, a cell-phone entrepreneur and son of an influential Congolese businessman. Mr. Bemba is backed by Uganda, whose soldiers occupy all the territory he holds. The group is believed to have something fewer than 10,000 guerrillas.
The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma, the main branch of a rebel group that later split into two. Based in Goma, it is headed by a medical doctor, Emile Ilunga. This group has a fighting force estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 men, headed by many disaffected Congolese officers, many of them Congolese Tutsi. It is backed by Rwanda, which has many thousands of troops in Congo.
The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement, headed by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a university professor once jailed by Mr. Mobutu who was kicked out as president of the main movement last summer. Its soldiers number fewer than 3,500. Ugandan troops occupy most of the territory the movement vaguely claims.
The presence of groups sometimes termed "nonstate actors" further complicates the situation in Congo. These are mostly aligned with Mr. Kabila. They include:
Hutu militias, which carried out much of the killing in Rwanda in 1994, and then escaped to Congo. Rwanda and Uganda claim that Mr. Kabila and Zimbabwe have trained thousands of them, some in Zimbabwe itself. They are said to be at the front around the Mbuji-Mayi diamond mines in the thousands. They are also active in the Kivus, crossing occasionally into Rwanda. Many of the Hutu militias have also crossed into Burundi, linking up with other Hutu rebels fighting against the Tutsi-led government there. Rwanda has said it will not leave the Congo until it is convinced that the Hutu militias are under control.
Estimates of the number of Hutu militiamen vary widely; Rwanda has cited figures between 5,000 and 25,000.
The Mayi-Mayi warriors: These are groups of indigenous fighters with shifting loyalties in the eastern Congo, North and South Kivu. Most of them work for Mr. Kabila and alongside the Hutu. The Mayi-Mayi believe that water protects them from bullets, and some of them go into battle wearing things like rubber tub stoppers.
Many experts believe that eastern Congo has become ungovernable, and that the Mayi-Mayi have emerged as the warlords of a disintegrated land. Their numbers are unknown.
 
Rwanda
The problems facing Rwanda are in many ways the driving force of the Congo war. If Rwanda's security could be resolved, diplomats believe that it is at least possible that the conflict in Congo could be settled.
The problem began in 1994, when hundreds of thousands of Hutu fled into what was then Zaire, fearing retribution after Hutu extremists massacred at least 500,000 Tutsi in Rwanda.
Those extremists, allied with Mr. Mobutu, in turn began attacking Rwanda from Zaire. In 1996, the new Tutsi-led government in Rwanda and its ally and neighbor, Uganda, decided to put an end to those attacks by putting their power behind Mr. Kabila. After Mr. Kabila came to power, he began to distance himself from Rwanda, and Rwanda accused him, like Mr. Mobutu, of allying himself with Hutu fighters.
So in August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda teamed up again, behind another rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, to start another rebellion. Rwanda reportedly has about a quarter of its 40,000 members.
The Rwanda government has not disclosed what the war is costing in terms of money, but there is no doubt it has been effective in terms of security. Northwestern Rwanda -- a Hutu extremist stronghold -- has been largely quiet since Rwanda invaded Congo. Rwanda says it will leave Congo only if the safety of its borders is guaranteed and the Hutu fighters are disarmed -- a task that most experts believe is far too dangerous for the United Nations to take on.
The Tutsi now make up only 15 percent of Rwanda's population. But they argue that it will take time to recover from the genocide sufficiently to share power.
 
Uganda
Uganda is often accused of being involved in Congo largely for opportunistic reasons, and it may be eager to get out now that the war no longer serves the interests of Mr. Museveni, the Ugandan president -- a man with a reputation as one of Africa's brightest and most progressive leaders. But withdrawal might make Ugandans question the worthiness of the adventure in the first place.
Uganda reportedly has between 8,000 and 10,000 soldiers in Congo, some as deep as 750 miles from the Ugandan border, at Basankusu. Uganda backs two rebel groups, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, in the northwest, and the splinter group of the Rally for Democracy headed by Mr. Wamba dia Wamba.
What is most contentious is that Ugandan soldiers are reported to be the most vigorous in cashing in on Congo's wealth, taking out diamonds, gold, timber and ivory. Despite the looting, the war has been a drain on the Ugandan economy and is thus increasingly unpopular at home.
Like Rwanda, Uganda backed both the 1996 and 1998 rebellions in Congo by arguing that it needed to protect its border from from rebels in eastern Congo. Uganda also said it was siding with Rwanda, a longtime ally, to prevent another genocide.
Other factors behind Uganda's involvement are Mr. Museveni's ambition to be perceived as a major leader on the continent, and his close personal ties with Paul Kagame, the vice president of Rwanda who is considered the real power there. Mr. Kagame fled to Uganda during anti-Tutsi riots in 1959 and became a star in the Ugandan Army, helping Mr. Museveni come to power.
Yet the war has also strained relations between Rwanda and Uganda to the point that the nations fought a bloody battle in Kisangani in the summer of 1999.
The Uganda government faces two major rebel groups. One, the Allied Democratic Forces, is fighting from bases in eastern Congo. The second, the Lord's Resistance Army, is supported by Sudan and attacks Uganda from the north. Uganda in turn, has supported the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
 
Burundi
Burundi has also admitted to having soldiers in Congo. It says it is not allied with either side, but is fighting Hutu rebels. Burundi has the same ethnic division as Rwanda between Hutu and Tutsi, who have been locked in civil war since 1983.
The war has sharply escalated in recent months, and the Burundi government has herded 300,000 people, mostly poor Hutu farmers, into "regroupment camps" in the hills surrounding the capital, Bujumbura. The government has partly lost control over the nation's southeast, where fighting is pushing some 1,000 refugees a day into neighboring Tanzania.
 
Tanzania
Tanzania's role in the war has been mostly that of a haven for hundreds of thousands of Hutu who have fled there since 1994. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are 320,000 Burundians in camps in western Tanzania. Since October, when the fighting in Burundi began to escalate, 50,000 more have arrived. Refugees from Congo are also arriving at a steady, though lower, rate.
 
Sudan
Sudan has reportedly helped Mr. Kabila several times, providing aircraft to bomb towns in rebel zones in northern Congo last year. Sudan denies it, but Mr. Kabila is clearly on friendly terms with the Sudanese government, apparently on the theory that the enemy of an enemy -- in this case Uganda -- is a friend.
Though Uganda and Sudan agreed late last year to end hostilities, the Ugandan government supports the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting the Islamist Sudanese government for 16 years. Fighting, disease and famine generated by the conflict in Sudan have reportedly taken an estimated two million lives since 1983.
 
Angola
After the fall of Mr. Mobutu in 1997, the Angolan government led by Jose Eduardo dos Santos plunged into Congo, largely for its own strategic reasons -- to attack the Congo bases of Unita, the Angolan insurgent movement led by Jonas Savimbi. The Mobutu government had been helping Unita for decades.
Unita, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, is believed to command about 35,000 troops, and the Angolan government, about 90,000.
In the last six months, the government has pulled off its most successful offensive in a civil war that dates to Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. After spending nearly $900 million in oil revenues on new military equipment, the government has routed Unita from nearly every major population center.
Unita's military losses are closely tied to its loss of Congo as an ally. The rebels, experts at financing war by mining Angolan diamonds, no longer have a conduit for selling diamonds on the international market or for military supply. Unita's access to fuel and spare parts has been seriously reduced.
Although routed in the cities and much less capable of waging conventional war, Unita remains a formidable guerrilla force. In the last month, in part to steal food and fuel, it has begun striking at civilian targets in rural areas.
Government soldiers are also overextended and undersupplied. They, too, have been attacking civilians and stealing. All this has caused a humanitarian mess. The World Food Program says more than 4 million people have been internally displaced out of a population of about 12 million.
Unita, meanwhile, still has a few bases in Congo, near the Angolan border. The Kinshasa government, focused on rebels in eastern Congo, has been unwilling to flush Unita out. Unita uses its bases to stage attacks against Angolan government forces. Angolan troops, in response, give chase as if the border were not there.
 
Namibia
Namibia joined the fighting in Congo almost a year and a half ago, and in December began allowing the Angolans to fight from Namibian soil. Namibia, which has often accused Unita of helping a Namibian insurgency, and apparently believed that Angola was finally in a position to crush Unita, reportedly has 2,000 soldiers in Congo -- anywhere from a third to half its army.
Military experts say Namibia was persuaded to enter the fighting in Congo by Zimbabwe. The two presidents, Sam Nujoma and Robert Mugabe, are quite close and had supported each other during the years when South Africa's apartheid government was busy trying to stamp out their black liberation movements. Last year, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Congo even formalized a mutual defense pact.
Unita has threatened retaliation against Namibia's involvement, and has already carried out several attacks. Namibia announced last month that it would spend about $120 million on the military this fiscal year, a 65 percent increase over the previous year.
Local newspapers, meanwhile, have questioned Namibia's involvement in both wars. The Namibian, in an editorial that ran on Jan. 28, raised concerns about the growing cost of the wars, at a time when the country needs money for social spending.
"While one would not argue with spending on the need to protect our country's borders, one could certainly argue with the fact that wars a long way from our borders are continuing to be a drain on our state coffers," the editorial read.
 
Zimbabwe
The Zimbabwe government of Mr. Mugabe has sent between 7,000 and 11,000 troops to Congo to support Mr. Kabila, according to varying reports. The intervention is motivated in part by Mr. Mugabe's longing to be a major force in southern Africa and his rivalry with the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda. Zimbabwe has taken advantage of access to diamond mines under the control of Mr. Kabila.
But Zimbabwe's military involvement in Congo is deeply unpopular at home. The full cost of the deployment has been concealed from international donors and, a Zimbabwean banker said, is seen by many Zimbabweans as contributing to the country's economic crisis.
Indeed, the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to Zimbabwe last year because of suspicion that Mr. Mugabe misled it about the cost of supporting Mr. Kabila. That suspension of aid, among other things, has left Zimbabwe struggling to pay for fuel and facing inflation as high as 60 percent. So low are Zimbabwe's reserves of dollars and other foreign currencies that the country can no longer afford to import diesel fuel, which is in scarce supply.
 
Zambia
Landlocked and abutted by several troubled lands, Zambia has long sought to cast itself as an island of stability in Central Africa's turbulence. Like former President Kenneth D. Kaunda, President Frederick Chiluba, in power since 1991, has acted as a broker in the wars that have consumed the region from the independence struggles of the 1970's to the present-day conflagrations in Angola and Congo. That has led to peace deals in Angola and Congo, though these have been undermined by the combatants' refusal to lay down their arms.
Despite the statesmanlike stance of its first two leaders, Zambia has invariably suffered from the wars around it. Little of its potential -- in tourism, agriculture and mining -- has been realized. In the 1970's, Mr. Kaunda supported liberation movements in Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and the former Rhodesia. In exchange, the white minority governments of the time in southern Africa strangled Zambia's trade routes and attacked nationalist guerrillas based in Zambia.
In the current Angolan war, the effect is more insidious. Over the years, some 200,000 refugees -- 160,000 of them from Angola -- have flowed into Zambia. According to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, some 20,000 have crossed into the country in recent weeks as the war in Angola has broadened. And Zambia has sent troops to its border to prevent Angolan troops from entering in pursuit of fleeing Unita rebels. The easy availability of weapons in Angola has fostered arms trade and a surge of violent crime.
Angola last year accused Zambia of supplying Unita with arms and other logistical supports. President Chiluba vigorously denied it, but South African military experts suspect that some officials in Zambia are still helping Mr. Savimbi.
 
Mission Would Be Area's First Since 60's
If it is approved by the Security Council, the new peacekeeping mission to Congo will be the second the United Nations has dispatched to the area. The first, called the United Nations Operation in Congo and known by its French acronym ONUC, lasted from July 1960 to June 1964, and represents a particularly bitter interlude in the organization's history.
Within weeks of Congo's independence from Belgium in June 1960, the country was on the verge of collapse. The government declared martial law and asked the United Nations to help ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces and assist the government in maintaining law and order. When the copper-rich province of Katanga then seceded, the United Nations found itself trying to maintain Congo's territorial integrity and independence, get all foreigners not under United Nations command out of the country and prevent civil war.
For the first time, United Nations personnel had to assume responsibilities beyond normal peacekeeping duties. At its peak in July 1961, ONUC, originally 4,000 troops, had almost 20,000 military personnel and 2,000 civilians.
As envisioned, the new peacekeeping operation in Congo will be about one-quarter that size.
On September 17, 1961, while trying to secure a cease-fire between Congolese and Katangan forces, Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold and seven other United Nations staff members were killed when their plane crashed en route to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia.
The United Nations force suffered 250 fatalities during the Congo operation. By comparison, during its three-year deployment in the Balkans, the United Nations Protection Force lost 167 people.
The secession of Katanga ended in January 1963. ONUC helped consolidate the government and retrain Congolese soldiers and security forces before withdrawing in 1964.

Map/Chart
When Laurent Kabila led a successful coup three years ago against the decades-long regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, hopes for a fledgling democracy and stability in the region were high. Today, however, Congo is a bloody chessboard, crisscrossed with troops from neighboring countries and violent rebel groups from within, all with varying interests in the political and economic future of this resource-rich nation. A look at the players:
 
Forces Loyal to Kabila
 
ANGOLA: 2,000 TROOPS
Locked into a 25-year-old war against its own rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (known by its Portuguese acronym, Unita), Angola quickly came to the aid of Mr. Kabila in order to prevent Unita attacks from inside southern Congo.
 
NAMIBIA: 2,000 TROOPS
Although it is located far from the southern border of Congo, the country is closely allied with Angola and so became the third nation to come to the aid of Mr. Kabila. It also extended military cooperation to Angola by allowing it to launch an attack on Unita bases from Namibian soil in December.
 
ZIMBABWE: 10,000 TROOPS
Under President Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe came to Mr. Kabila's rescue almost immediately and has remained his strongest supporter since hostilities first arose in 1998. But that support has come at a price for both countries, as Zimbabwe's economy sags with the costly war and Congo is forced to grant sweetheart deals to Zimbabwean businesses interested in tapping its rich diamond and agricultural resources.
 
REBEL MILITIAS LOYAL TO KABILA
 
THE HUTU
Enlisted by Mr. Kabila, these are the hard-core Hutu fighters who were largely responsible for the massacres in Rwanda in 1994 -- and who ultimately fled into neighboring Congo.
 
THE MAYI-MAYI
Local Congolese fighters who have allied themselves with the Hutu rebels because of their shared hatred for Tutsi
 
Forces Allied Against Kabila
 
UGANDA: 9,000 TROOPS
Uganda is accused of being largely opportunistic. It claims to support both the rebellion that installed Mr. Kabila and the current one in order to protect its border. But its soldiers are also reported to be cashing in on Congo's wealth, taking out diamonds, gold, timber and ivory.
 
RWANDA: 10,000 TROOPS
Rwanda is in many ways the driving force behind the battle in Congo. In 1996, it was subject to attacks on its border by Hutu extremists living in Congo. It hoped to end these attacks by supporting Mr. Kabila's rebellion against Mr. Mobutu in 1997. But Mr. Kabila quickly distanced himself from Rwanda, ultimately allying with the Hutu extremists and prompting Rwanda to support a new rebellion in Congo, this time against Mr. Kabila.
 
BURUNDI: NUMBER OF TROOPS UNKNOWN
Although Burundi claims to have no stake in the current conflict, it is battling the pro-Kabila Hutu inside Congo. The country is also facing a Hutu rebellion of its own.
 
REBEL MILITIAS FIGHTING AGAINST KABILA
 
M.L.C. Movement for the Liberation of Congo
Located largely in the north-central region of Congo, this group is headed by Jean Pierre Bemba, son of an influential Congolese businessman. The M.L.C. receives much of its support from Uganda.
 
R.C.D.-GOMA Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma

HEADLINE: U.S. ANTIDRUG PLAN TO AID COLOMBIA FACES SKEPTICISM

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Clinton administration's $1.3 billion plan to help Colombia fight drug trafficking and leftist insurgents is facing skepticism from military and law-enforcement officials concerned that the United States could be dragged into a long and costly struggle that may ultimately have little impact on the drug trade.
The aid plan, which is to be presented in detail to Congress on Monday, is intended to reduce the booming production of cocaine and heroin in Colombia, strengthen the government and help it take control of a large part of its southern territory now dominated by the rebels. 
 Privately, though, some senior defense officials are decidedly unenthusiastic about the American military's growing role in the antidrug effort and are worried that it may be dragged deeper into the civil war that has ravaged Colombia for almost 40 years.
Many drug-enforcement and Coast Guard officials are similarly concerned, officials said. While the aid package may help Colombia's army fight the guerrillas, they said, it does not reflect a coherent strategy to fight illegal drugs.
Virtually none of these complaints have been aired publicly. Officials said that the arguments have been heard repeatedly in the debate over the aid plan, but that most of the criticisms have been overridden by administration officials determined to establish a new American commitment to Colombia's stability.
"Their attitude is, 'We don't really want to do this,' " one senior administration official said of generals in the Pentagon. Referring to the insurgency, he added: "The last thing they need is another level of engagement that has the 'I' word in it. That always has stress for the military -- it has ever since Vietnam."
The White House drug policy chief, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, dismissed skeptics of the plan, noting that some of the criticism came from agencies disappointed by their failure to get funding increases under the Colombia aid package.
"Everybody tried to get aboard this mule," General McCaffrey said in an interview, referring to the administration's request for $955 million on top of the $330 million budgeted for Colombia aid this year. But he added, "There wasn't a huge fight among agencies over this package."
Senior administration officials said they were confident that the proposed aid, about two-thirds of which would go to Colombian security forces, would be approved.
Republicans in Congress have been an important part of the impetus for greater American assistance, warning that the Clinton White House risked "losing" Colombia to rebel groups that have been battling the military with increasing success. A few Congressional liberals have criticized the aid program as militaristic and shortsighted, but they are unlikely to slow its passage except by attaching conditions meant to promote greater respect for human rights by the Colombian military.
Still, the package is only a first step in what many United States officials acknowledge will probably be a huge effort, lasting for years, to strengthen Colombian institutions and help the government reach a peace with three leftist guerrilla groups and various right-wing paramilitary forces that operate in different parts of the country.
Both Colombian and American officials continue to say the United States will not engage the guerrillas directly. Nor, they said, will they aid the fight against the guerrillas -- except those who hire themselves out to the traffickers to protect drug fields, drug laboratories or clandestine airstrips. "If they are not involved in the business," President Andres Pastrana said in an interview, "they should be confident that nothing is going to happen to them."
At the same time, though, United States officials are clearly softening their positions that American aid will not be used for counterinsurgency.
In a program summary released last month, the White House listed the primary component of the aid plan as, "Helping the Colombian government push into the coca-growing regions of southern Colombia, which are now dominated by insurgent guerrillas."
Gen. Fred F. Woerner, a former commander of United States military forces in Latin America, said the statement represented a significant clarification of the administration's goal. "How do you push into an area dominated by these guys without having anything to do with them?" he asked, referring to the rebels. "Anyone who believes that these counternarcotics battalions will not be involved in counterinsurgency is naive."
Administration officials said they would argue to Congress that the situation is dire now because of an explosion in the cultivation of coca, the raw material of cocaine, in areas of southern Colombia that the rebels dominate. Their main evidence will be a new study by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration showing that Colombia's coca production over the last two years was about three times greater than what American analysts had thought.
Until the last few years, nearly all the world's coca was grown in Bolivia and Peru. But with the introduction of new varieties of the coca plant, Colombia has more than made up for major reductions of coca growing in the neighboring countries. Moreover, intelligence officials said that new refining techniques are enabling Colombian traffickers to produce more cocaine from their crop than ever before.
While the C.I.A. said last year that Colombia grew 182 tons of coca in 1998, officials said the new study would show that it actually grew a staggering 480 tons, or more than half the worldwide total. That total, however, is not expected to rise significantly. "We do not see any signs of an explosion," one official said. He added that, despite a surging cocaine market in Europe and the former Soviet Union, "at some point, there has to be an issue of supply and demand."
American military officials agree that the Colombian military should be strengthened. But many of them are reluctant for the United States to get more involved in that process -- both because more trainers would represent a bigger American target for the rebels and because of the stress that their deployment would put on Pentagon resources.
Many Defense Department officials fear being drawn more deeply into Colombia's civil war.
"It depends on who you talk to; I am personally concerned about that," one senior military official said. But he added: "Here's the dilemma: Do you just let them go down the tubes? It is far preferable for us to try to train them and equip them than it is for American troops to ultimately have to be there."
In the first major draft of the administration's aid plan, put forward last fall, officials proposed nearly three years of intensive United States training to create six new special Colombian Army battalions to operate against drug traffickers and insurgents who support them.
After objections by senior American military officials, the proposal was scaled back to the creation of two new battalions over about eight months, administration officials said. A first battalion has already been trained, and the number of United States military trainers in Colombia will not be significantly increased, they said.
Some Pentagon officials said they were also concerned about the single biggest piece of the aid package: 30 sophisticated UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters being provided to the Colombian military at a cost of more than $400 million. The aircraft, which will remain State Department property, are not only very expensive but will also require extensive pilot training and cost tens of millions of dollars to operate each year, officials said.
Law enforcement officials, for the most part, have more strategic concerns.
Drug enforcement officials argue essentially that the push into southern Colombia -- intended to destroy coca-processing laboratories and secure growing areas from guerrillas -- is important, but not that important. Under the administration's plan, that campaign is to cost about $600 million, or nearly half the $1.28 billion to be spent on the package.
By contrast, officials say, successful Drug Enforcement Administration programs to train and support special Colombian police teams that work against the country's biggest traffickers cost only a few million dollars a year.
Other officials assert that Washington should start by pressing the Colombian government to make important policy changes that would cost almost nothing. Those may include increasing prison sentences for drug offenses, reorganizing the judiciary, and taking cellular telephones away from jailed traffickers so they cannot operate from prison.
"Many of the changes that are required there could be made overnight," one American official said. "And they would require no or nominal amounts of money."
United States Coast Guard officials also argued for a bigger piece of the new package, officials said. With its own cocaine seizures booming, the agency sought new funding for innovating programs to detect drug shipments and deploy armed helicopters against high-speed drug boats in the Caribbean.
Administration officials said that while they had not included any new money for those programs in the proposed Colombia package, they had agreed to ask for about $17 million for the helicopter program next year, $7 million more than in the current year. But some money for other high-priority Coast Guard drug programs has already been denied, officials said.
Last year, administration debate over the aid plan was mainly between officials who sought greater support for the Colombian military and those who argued strongly for a bigger complement of social and economic programs.
Now, administration officials said funding would rise most sharply of all for nonmilitary programs like crop-substitution efforts, strengthening human rights and economic development.
"This was a case in which we really said to people, 'How fast can you spend money?' " one budget official said, referring to United States economic development officials. "It gets to a question of what is achievable; almost none of these programs are in place in Colombia now."

Plots for Hire

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
The politicians and propagandists who wage our war on drugs have really outdone themselves. After bloating the prisons and creating a vast antidrug industrial complex, they have now bribed our networks to deliver prime-time audiences for indoctrination and even corralled many newspapers as do-good collaborators.
Not even during the cold war, with our faith in democracy at stake, did federal authorities dare so to subsidize and subvert our media. Back then, Congress explicitly forbade the agencies promoting anti-Communism -- notably the United States Information Agency, its Voice of America and even the Central Intelligence Agency -- to aim their propaganda at Americans. Why? Because everyone understood that the government's heavy hand on the scale of public opinion could distort the weight of any argument and diminish the public's freedom. 
 That principle seems in urgent need of reinforcement. For it has been shown that the bait of a few million dollars was all it took to get our once fiercely independent broadcasters to submit to government tutelage and to lure many papers, including The Times, into taking government rewards for what appeared to be independent public service.
The furtive broadcast scheme was discovered by Daniel Forbes, a writer for Salon.com, the Internet magazine, and covered with due concern by a few newspapers. In response, President Clinton and the television industry made light of their collusion and disclosed the lesser involvement of their newspaper critics. Just a bit of chummy cooperation in a good cause, they argued when their two years of secret dealing became known. (The Times, for its part, explained that it was rendering only advertising and circulation services, without affecting its news coverage or content.)
I would like to believe that the broadcasters' collaboration, though deplorable, had nothing to do with government's recent gifts to them of spectrum space worth about $70billion and of regulations permitting unprecedented concentrations of station ownership. And I know the newspapers think they merit praise, not blame, for disseminating socially useful messages. But it is odd that an industry usually quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment would so readily invite the government to read and influence the content of TV programs and accept government rewards for community service.
This sad bending of principle began in 1997, when Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, who heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House, was authorized by Congress to spend up to $1 billion over five years to buy television time and newspaper ads to agitate against drug use. To take the curse off this media subsidy, Congress insisted on paying only half-price; for every ad purchased, it wanted another run free of charge.
But when a booming economy made commercial time scarce and expensive, the networks longed for relief from their commitment to discounts. So they were told they could meet their obligation by another route. Rather than matching the government's paid ads one for one, the broadcasters were invited to plant antidrug messages in their prime-time dramas and sitcoms. And newspapers were allowed to exchange ad space for things like teaching guides and pamphlets. (In the case of The Times, pamphlets were distributed with a sales pitch for school subscriptions).
In belatedly hinting at all these deals at a little-noticed Congressional hearing last fall, General McCaffrey never let on that his office had been turned into a full-blown script-review board. It decided which TV stories and newspaper programs were "on message" and "on strategy," which needed "guidance" and improvement and how much relief from matching ad time or space each message and activity was worth.
Without apparent hesitation, the networks showered the White House with scripts and tapes that could qualify for reward, including even unfinished scripts that could still be altered. Though their producers and writers were never told of the practice, almost all major shows were at some time offered for credit -- The Simpsons," "Ally McBeal," "Law and Order," "The Drew Carey Show," "Beverly Hills 90210," "Cosby," "Home Improvement" and many more.
A show that portrayed parents confronting a joint-smoking child in ways the White House deemed effective could redeem the equivalent of two or three 30-second ads, worth at least $100,000. An even larger amount might be earned by showing a youth resisting peer pressure to take up cocaine. And if a whole story line were judged helpful, well, then shows like "E.R." or "The Practice," to offer just two examples, recouped commercial time worth a million dollars or more.
Some network executives accepted the government's "guidance" to reshape a script; some badgered unsuspecting writers to insert antidrug messages into their plots. One producer, John Tinker, recalls being urged to rush ahead with an antidrug script of "Chicago Hope" even though it had been kicking around unappreciated for years. Several hundred newspapers and their Web sites also took in White House ads and matched them in different ways; besides running a free ad for every paid one, The Times won credits for its schools pamphlets, which the White House checked "simply for accuracy."
The best proof that the arrangement was dangerously misguided is that it was long treated as secret. When the story broke, ABC announced that it had stopped participating after the government had asked it to submit all scripts in advance. Calling this a "misconception," the White House promised to end all "previews" and to settle for post-broadcast "reviews." This may dispel the odor of censorship, but it leaves in place the payments of government payola for propaganda.
If that represents high-minded media service, why stop with antidrug scenarios? Why not pay the media for shielding young minds from sex and gunplay? And one day soon -- depending on which party controls the government purse -- why not subsidize scripts and ads that sanction, or discourage, abortion?
President Clinton artfully distinguished the antidrug payola from any effort "to regulate content." And General McCaffrey's spokesman said: "We do not clear scripts. . . . Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the drug issue."
A much better use of public money would be to re-educate all concerned in the values of First Amendment independence. Our public officials obviously need reminding that they belong in front of the camera, not behind it. And our media executives should have learned long ago that those who feed at government honeypots inevitably get stuck.

HEADLINE: Report Rings Alarm Bells About Privacy On the Internet

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
A report last week that most health-related Web sites were not honoring their promises to keep personal information about visitors private offered a somewhat alarming snapshot of the state of privacy on the Internet.
The group that conducted the survey from which the report was drawn, the California HealthCare Foundation, said its intent was to help health sites live up to their promises and win the trust of consumers. 
 But it caught government officials and privacy enforcement groups off guard with disclosures that confidential information was being disseminated through banner ads and third-party service providers. And it underscored the growing policy debate over whether federal officials and private groups can adequately police such a fast-growing and constantly changing new medium as the Net.
In the five years since the Federal Trade Commission began monitoring electronic commerce about five years ago, few privacy violations have come to light. And none of the major groups formed to certify and oversee privacy practices has ever pulled a seal of approval from a member Web site.
So when the California foundation said its study had determined that all but 3 of 19 sites surveyed were violating their own stated practices, privacy advocates held up the results as proof of their longtime assertions that self-regulation of online privacy, as promoted by the F.T.C. and the Clinton administration, defies effective enforcement.
"They are not keeping pace with the Internet explosion," said Jason Catlett, president of the Junkbusters Corporation, a privacy consulting concern in New Jersey. "If you count the number of people in charge of enforcement and look at the growth of e-commerce sites, any way you measure it you'd come to the conclusion that protection is not keeping up -- if indeed it ever was adequate."
The California study said the problems stemmed mostly from new technology that enables some banner advertisers to pick up any personal information a customer enters on the page where an ad is displayed. In addition, the study's Internet security consultant, Richard M. Smith, said he found a leakage of information between the Web sites that promise to keep information confidential and the third-party companies that gain access to that information while running services on the sites.
TRUSTe, one of the first and largest privacy certification programs, acknowledged on Friday that it was surprised and alarmed to read the study, which identified potential violations by seven members of TRUSTe.
Dave Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, said it was investigating the sites identified in the study and was doing random audits of other members to see if they were disclosing information to advertisers and other third parties without saying so in their posted privacy policies.
TRUSTe said last week that it would alert all 1,300 of its members that they must include in their posted privacy policies disclosures of any contracts with third parties that could track the members or gain access to their personal data.
The F.T.C. declined to comment on the health survey. But an agency employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said the agency was "taking these concerns very seriously."
On Friday, a special 40-member advisory committee held its first meeting at the F.T.C. It will help write a report to Congress on what steps companies should take to keep their databases secure and how much access consumers should have to the data collected about them.
Further, the commission announced that it was planning a third annual Internet sweep to survey privacy practices on the Web. But as with past studies, the F.T.C.'s announcement indicated that the agency would analyze only stated policies, not the actual practices that the California HealthCare Foundation examined.
Though the California study looked only at health sites, Mr. Catlett and Mr. Smith both said it begged the question whether privacy problems on the Internet were widespread.
"There are similar problems on other sites," Mr. Smith said. "When you have one company working with another, that's when privacy tends to fall by the wayside."
Despite the troubling indicators, Mr. Steer of TRUSTe said the government should maintain its hands-off approach to the Internet since laws can be quickly outdated by new technologies. In contrast, he said, TRUSTe requires its members to undergo annual reviews, a process that allows TRUSTe to educate sites about challenges posed by new technologies.
Mr. Catlett, however, said baseline laws were needed to spell out for companies what they can and cannot do with private information they collect online and to allow consumers to take civil action when they think their rights have been violated.
"At the moment, with the Clinton administration saying self-regulation is the way we are going to go, that basically says, 'Do whatever you want or do as little as you want,' " Mr. Catlett said. "That's exactly the wrong message to send to companies that have strong economic incentives to collect and use personal information."

HEADLINE: Gold Rush In Silicon Alley;
Venture Capital Moves East

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
It was the sort of "elevator pitch" that Timothy C. Draper listens to impatiently every day -- a business plan breathlessly delivered.
Four entrepreneurs -- three in their 30's and the obligatory gray-haired chief financial officer -- were rushing last Tuesday to describe a business they hoped would be the next big thing on the Internet. In this case, it was a service called Sticky Networks, which hopes to let people search the Web using pictures rather than words. 
 They knew that Mr. Draper's venture capital firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, based in Redwood City, Calif., could help finance their business and, more important, open doors with its prestige.
Mr. Draper peppered them with his usual questions: Where did you go to school? What have you done before? What is the business model? What's to stop anyone else from doing the same thing?
But there was one thing that was quite different from Mr. Draper's routine. This pitch was not in the conference room of his office in Silicon Valley, but in a 39th-floor suite of the New York Palace Hotel, overlooking Rockefeller Center and the heart of New York's corporate life.
Attention New York entrepreneurs: the checkbooks have landed.
When the first people tried to start Internet companies here in the mid-90's, they had to scrounge to raise money. To their chagrin, the big Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Draper largely shunned New York as a backwater with no history of entrepreneurship or technological innovation.
But now with the success of a wide range of Internet and new-media companies in and around New York City, including the stock market darlings DoubleClick and StarMedia Network, there are an abundance of new and newly expanded venture capital funds in New York, with many hundreds of millions of fresh dollars looking for young Internet businesses to invest in -- in hopes of a big payoff when the company eventually goes public or gets acquired.
"The vacuum of venture capital on the East Coast has been filled," said Alexander D. Lynch, a partner at Brobeck Phleger & Harrison, a law firm that represents a number of Internet start-ups. "There is so much money chasing deals from the existing funds and the new funds. This is now a very good market to raise money if you are an entrepreneur."
Of course, some investors have begun to wonder whether there may soon be too much money chasing too few marketable business plans in Silicon Alley -- a label that once denoted the new-media scene in downtown Manhattan but now refers loosely to Internet-related activities throughout the metropolitan area.
What is clear is that some Wall Street powerhouses that used to ignore deals that could not be measured in the billions -- including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buyout tycoons -- now deign to put mere millions into digital start-ups. Established New York venture capital firms -- like Venrock Associates, the Rockefeller family's venture investing arm -- are embracing the sort of Internet deals they would have snubbed even a year ago. And the few firms that did invest early in Silicon Alley are growing much larger.
Bear Stearns's Constellation Ventures and Wit Capital's Dawntreader fund, for example, are both said to be in the process of raising new funds of more than $200 million each. And Flatiron Partners, perhaps the most prominent New York Internet fund, is investing money on behalf of Chase Manhattan at an accelerating pace.
Many more people with money and rich friends are for the first time putting together funds to seek their fortunes as venture capitalists. One of these is I-Hatch Ventures, a new fund started by Chip Austin, former head of Bertelsmann's online bookstore; Derek Reisfield, who once ran CBS's Internet unit; and Brad Farkas, a former venture capitalist at Lazard Freres. I-Hatch expects to raise $150 million, an unusually large amount for a first-time fund.
Perhaps most significant, a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists are expanding into New York. Draper, for example, hired two former Wall Street executives who had been trying to start their own fund -- Dan Schultz and Ross Goldstein -- to open a New York affiliate, Draper Fisher Gotham, which had an elaborate debut party last Wednesday at which Mr. Draper appeared in a Batman costume. It also made its first investment last week: Mimeo.com, a sort of Internet Kinko's that plans to offer express shipment of copied documents; Draper has not yet decided whether to invest in Sticky Networks.
And Adam Dell, who late last year left Crosspoint Venture Partners, a Silicon Valley firm where he was a partner, has started Impact Venture Partners, a $100 million fund in New York devoted to business-to-business Internet investments.
"There is a great opportunity here because there are so many old-line companies that will be reinvented on the Internet and so many great operations people," said Mr. Dell, who is the younger brother of the computer mogul Michael S. Dell. "And on the East Coast there just aren't the sheer number of investment firms that exist on the West Coast."
To be sure, the $760 million in venture capital investments in New York during the first nine months of 1999 was dwarfed by the $8.1 billion invested in Bay Area start-ups during the same period, according to Venture One, a San Francisco market research firm. But New York venture investments were increasing at an annual rate of 205 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 145 percent increase in Silicon Valley.
New York is growing as an Internet center because most of its traditional industries -- finance, retailing, broadcasting, publishing, advertising and the rest -- are becoming more involved than ever in the Internet and the Web.
"The West Coast creates technology and the East Coast creates brands," said Robert H. Lessin, chairman of Wit Capital. "Now that technology is becoming off-the-shelf, companies need media companies as partners to build their brands. And every media company other than Disney is here."
In addition to investing in Internet start-ups, Wit has helped companies trade equity for promotion. Wit, for example, last year helped Iwon.com, a Web site that offers its users chances to win cash prizes, obtain broadcast advertising time on CBS in exchange for CBS's acquiring a stake in the company.
As elsewhere, venture capitalists in New York are now looking to invest much earlier in a company's life cycle than venture investors did in the past. That is because the stock market nowadays is willing to embrace initial public offerings from companies so young they have barely any revenue -- let alone profits. So companies do not need to go back and raise the traditional second or third rounds of financing that venture capitalists previously specialized in.
Few venture funds want to wait that long, given the buoyant market for the stocks of Internet companies, which have made astounding profits for the earliest investors in such companies.
"We have seen fewer opportunities to invest at later stages, so we have refocused our energy on earlier-stage investments," said William E. Ford, a managing partner with General Atlantic Partners, a $2 billion, 20-year-old venture fund in Greenwich, Conn. General Atlantic, for example, invested in Priceline.com before it even opened for business -- something Mr. Ford's firm would never have considered in the pre-Web days.
Meanwhile, the smaller funds are moving to compete with the so-called angel investors -- wealthy individuals who traditionally provided initial grubstakes to companies too young to seek financing from the venture funds, which are run by professional money managers and which pool the resources of many investors.
New venture funds, like I-Hatch, now play the role of an angel investor. "We want to find the guy as he is just looking for the cocktail napkin to write his idea on," Mr. Austin of I-Hatch said.
Like all venture capital firms, I-Hatch hopes to attract companies with its advice and contacts as well as its cash. I-Hatch, in other words, helps do much of the work that the entrepreneurs themselves formerly had to do before daring to ask anyone for money. "We help people refine their fuzzy ideas and get to the next level," Mr. Austin said.
In addition to advice, investors like I-Hatch and Rare Medium -- a Web development firm with a venture capital arm -- are setting up "incubators" where very young companies can receive office space and technical services in return for equity stakes.
Draper's new New York affiliate will not go as far as providing office space, but Mr. Draper says the companies it backs get something even more useful: invitations to the firm's frequent cocktail receptions, where the 200 other companies backed by Draper affiliates in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Virginia can flirt with one another and form alliances.
"An Internet company is only as valuable as the deals it has made," Mr. Draper said.
Of course, determining the value of an Internet company can be a puzzle for venture capitalists these days, especially when the company is at the prerevenue or even pre-cocktail-napkin stage. The frenzied competition among venture firms and among the firms and angel investors, is causing some qualms in the investment community.
"We'll see a company with great prospects, but it is overpriced," said Clifford H. Friedman, managing partner of Constellation Ventures. "The angels invested at a $25 million valuation, and we think it's worth only $15 million or $20 million. That's not a comfortable situation and we've lost some deals because of it."
To Fred Wilson of Flatiron Partners -- which was an early player in Silicon Alley, having been formed way back in 1996 -- this surge in investment at ever higher values is a sign that there is in fact too much venture capital in New York.
"The rate of company creation going on is unsustainable," Mr. Wilson said. "I would not be surprised if there were 20 or 30 new Internet companies a day being formed in New York. That's scary.
"People are forming companies for the wrong reasons," he added. "They aren't passionate about their ideas. They just want to be millionaires like all their friends, and there is so much capital in New York that anybody can start a company today."

HEADLINE: After Turbulent Week, Treasury Says Bond Market Will Be Orderly With Less Supply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

DATELINE: RIO GRANDE, P.R., Feb. 6

 BODY:
A top Treasury Department official sought to assure bond investors on Saturday that they will be able to adjust to the government's new policy of reducing the supply of Treasury bonds.
The official, Lewis A. Sachs, assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial markets, also said that Federal Reserve officials "are confident they will be able to conduct monetary policy," as well, in the new environment as in the old. 
 The comments, made at the annual meeting of the Bond Market Association here, came after a week in which the bond market was roiled by news of a sharp decline in the issuance of 30-year Treasury bonds and by the rising prices and plunging long-term yields that resulted.
Many investors, including big Wall Street firms, had been betting that long-term interest rates would rise after the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest-rate target in an effort to slow economic growth and forestall inflation.
But on Wednesday, the Treasury Department surprised investors with an announcement that the sale of 30-year bonds in May would be "significantly smaller" than current sales. Analysts estimated May sales around $5 billion, about half of what had been expected.
Long-term prices soared and yields, which move in the opposite direction, plummeted as investors, learning of the planned reduction in the quantity of bonds to be issued, scrambled to buy. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.28 percent on Wednesday from 6.42 percent on Tuesday, and Thursday, the rush to buy continued. The price of the 30-year bond jumped almost two full points and the yield fell to 6.13 percent. But on Friday, investors seemed to change sentiment, and as bonds were sold, the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.23 percent as selling predominated.
A strong January employment report, with nonfarm jobs rising by almost 400,000, contributed to the selloff. But some bond traders here said that the market just had gone too far in one direction. Still, there is talk of big losses among major bond dealers. And the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday denied a rumor that it was holding an emergency meeting to deal with financially troubled firms.
Mr. Sachs maintained that bond investors had been given plenty of notice about the Treasury's intention to reduce the issuance of notes and bonds as growing federal budget surpluses allowed the paying off of publicly held government debt, which totaled $2.8 trillion at the end of last year. He said the Treasury expects to pay off $300 billion of the debt in the current fiscal year.
Mr. Sachs, who spoke at a panel here, was asked if the Treasury was committed to issuing long-term bonds, even as the need to borrow dwindled.
"I can't say what we will be doing years from now," he replied. "We don't have plans beyond that at this point." But he said the Treasury would "maintain liquidity in our benchmark issues as long as we can." Maintaining liquidity means ensuring that each new issue of bonds is large enough so that trades of large size will not distort prices.
The Treasury currently plans to have just one auction of new 30-year bonds a year, in February, followed by a smaller sale of the same bond in May to add to its liquidity. Based on current estimates, the Treasury is expected in this fiscal year to issue less than half the $45 billion in 30-year bonds sold last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.
The other matter on the minds of the traders and executives involved in the corporate, municipal, mortgage and government bond markets was what would replace prices and yields in the long-term Treasury market as the benchmark for the other fixed-income markets. It was clear there is a debate over what alternatives might work.
"At some point," Mr. Sachs said, "the debt of other issuers will become larger than ours, but that will not happen overnight." And he added, "While there will be a period of adjustment, we have every confidence the market will adjust and other instruments will replace the role the Treasury plays."
For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two agencies that raise money to underwrite home mortgages, are trying to establish their bonds as a benchmark for the rest of the fixed-income market. Linda K. Knight, Fannie Mae's treasurer, said the agency is working to have a range of fixed-income securities from 3-month bills to 30-year bonds that will have the liquidity needed to serve as a benchmark. In fact, many of Fannie Mae's issues are already being used as a base to price corporate issues and also for hedging.
But Gumersindo Oliveros, the director of the treasury finance department at the World Bank, a major issuer of bonds, said, "It's a tall order for agency bonds to become a government surrogate."
He pointed to the interest-rate swaps market, where investors exchange fixed-rate debt for variable-rate debt, as a possible benchmark for the rest of the fixed-income market.

Out of Africa, but Not Out of Character

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
AUnited States Embassy employee held up a sign during the Davis Cup doubles match here Saturday. It said: "Hi Mom. Send Diesel."
The President's wife, Grace Mugabe, was said to be furious over this highly public and televised reference to the fuel shortage that has rocked Zimbabwe. She proceeded to snub the United States Tennis Association president, Judy Levering, and didn't return for the third and last day. 
 These things happen when countries mix and when crowds come out. It also puts the presence of John McEnroe into a necessary broader perspective. He apparently wasn't the only source of binational irritation here this weekend.
It only seemed that way, every time a call went against the United States and McEnroe rose from his captain's chair.
"Disgraceful," Wayne Black said yesterday after McEnroe's United States team had claimed the first-round competition, defeating Zimbabwe by 3-2 after winning both reverse singles matches. "They've got a great team full of great guys. I think if they don't win the cup, it will be largely due to McEnroe."
It was pointed out to Black that the American players had all marched into the interview room at the Harare Sports Center to proclaim their devotion to the man they had asked the U.S.T.A. to give them. Alex O'Brien called McEnroe "the best coach in the world." Chris Woodruff credited McEnroe for teaching what it takes to compete under rabid road conditions. Andre Agassi reiterated that he had grown tired of the milquetoast mind-set, and that McEnroe, more than anyone, had the passion to galvanize more interest in the States.
"If you lose the feeling, you're just asking for another week on the road in brutal conditions," Agassi said. "I don't need that anymore."
Black conceded that he only had the outsider's view of McEnroe, and there likely was more to the situation than meets the ear.
There always has been. As a young player, McEnroe tormented officials and opponents, but when other players jumped at the opportunity to earn big bucks in South Africa during the apartheid era, he simply said no.
Upon arrival in Harare, he was charming dinner guests and promising sneakers for the barefoot children with whom he had hit tennis balls on hardcourts in the economically ravaged township of Chitungwiza. Then he was infuriating the host Zimbabwe team and sprinkling his news conferences with his special brand of colorful rebuttals.
"Those guys were giving us a hard time and then pretending like I'm being difficult," he said, in summary. "As difficult as I supposedly was, I guarantee that those guys were giving my teammates a tougher time."
When they announced McEnroe as Davis Cup captain, people should have known they weren't getting a public-relations executive. He could feel persecuted in a soup kitchen, and is about as subtle as an Agassi forehand. "Big deal," was his ambassadorial commentary on the fact that the United States government had built one of the four hardcourts in Chitungwiza.
McEnroe has crossed the line of reasonable comportment enough times but on my personal Mac-o-meter, his performance here was barely enough to make people wince, the equivalent of a sign that said: "Send diesel." He argued calls, which in his mind comes with the territory. When Black revealed what had set him off against McEnroe during the doubles, veteran Mac attack chroniclers looked around and said, "That's it?"
"I'm serving 5-6, and there was a shuffling with the balls," Black said. "I thought it was a new ball. So I said, 'Are these new?' He said, 'You should be so lucky.' "
Black said he couldn't believe his eyes during the fourth game of his match with Woodruff yesterday, when McEnroe stood up and yelled just as Woodruff was about to hammer a forehand winner. They played a let. "I would go crazy if my captain did something like that," said Black, missing the point.
McEnroe, who sheepishly apologized, was so excited he couldn't contain himself. "I was jumping out of my pants," he said.
The hypocrites who wait for McEnroe to so much as sneeze to call him a brat usually go skipping off to watch managers kick dirt on umpires or hockey players slap each other around with sticks. More than anything, McEnroe has always seemed like an athlete who got lost as a youngster and wandered into a country club. For 20 years, he has extolled the virtues of the Davis Cup. This being my first competition in another country, I can better understand him. Those of us who came to Harare, the players included, didn't sit in gas lines, or worry about dinner. But this was a refreshing change from the sterility of tournament tennis, of the luxury-suite-driven sports industry in general.
"You have to have the experience to get a lot out of it," Agassi said when asked what Pete Sampras had missed by pulling out.
In the end, Sampras did everyone a favor. It gave Zimbabwe a chance. It gave Woodruff a chance. It gave McEnroe a cause. He and his players left here last night feeling like Duke surviving in the first round of March Madness. They did it without holding up a sign that said: "Send Pete."

HEADLINE: Clinton to Seek Big Increase in Funds to Fight Child Labor Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to ask Congress to more than double the nation's spending on reducing child labor overseas, administration officials said yesterday.
The officials said Mr. Clinton, in the budget he is submitting to Congress today, would ask for $110 million over all toward fighting the use of child labor, up from $45 million budgeted for the current fiscal year. The proposed spending increase would be used primarily to move children out of the workplace and into school. 
 The International Labor Organization estimates that around the world, more than 250 million children age 14 and under are working, in fields that include making apparel, rugs and fireworks, mining, domestic work and prostitution.
Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's national economic adviser, said the proposed spending increase reflected a greater focus on reducing child labor and on softening the harshest effects of globalization. When Mr. Clinton came into office, the United States was spending $3 million annually on trying to reduce child labor.
The planned spending increase comes after developing nations denounced the administration's proposal, made at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in December, to create a task force that might recommend trade sanctions against countries that allowed the use of child labor or violations of other basic labor rights.
Officials from third world countries have said that if the United States is serious about wanting to reduce child labor, it should not threaten trade sanctions. Instead, they say, it should work with developing nations to move child workers into schools and to create better-paying jobs for poor parents so they do not feel the need to send their children to work.
"This child labor initiative is very significant, because we are definitely taking the lead in the world community in the money the president is putting up to fight this problem," said Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who has sponsored numerous bills against child labor.
The administration's plan calls for giving $45 million, up from $30 million this year, to the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor run by the International Labor Organization. Child labor experts say this program has been successful in reducing child labor in apparel factories in Bangladesh:children represented 3 percent of apparel industry workers in 1999, down from 34 percent three years earlier.
In a new initiative, the administration is proposing $55 million in financing for the United States Department of Labor, working with the Agency for International Development, to promote efforts with countries where child labor is prevalent. Much of this money would be used to build schools, train teachers or transport children to distant schools.
"Lack of educational opportunity is a major contributor to child labor," White House officials said in a background paper.
The administration also plans to double financing for the Customs Service -- to $10 million -- to enforce the ban on imports made with forced or indentured child labor.

HEADLINE: The Durable Expansion

 BODY:
Economic expansions do not die of old age. The current expansion, the longest in recorded history, will not end from exhaustion. A nine-year-old expansion is no more likely to end than a two-year-old expansion. Indeed, the term business cycle is a misnomer. Recoveries and recessions do not occur in regular cycles. There are ups and downs but no pattern.
Though unrecognized at the time, the current recovery began in March 1991, long before Bill Clinton defeated President George Bush on the assertion that he did not know how to manage the economy. This expansion, like all those that have come before, will end. No one knows when. But there are clues about how it will end. 
 Prof. John Taylor of Stanford points out that "the start of every recession since World War II has been preceded by a run-up of inflation." Once inflation begins to rise, the Federal Reserve is forced to crack down, raising interest rates to slow spending and bring prices under control. Mr. Taylor pictures the job of the Fed as a constant struggle to keep spending growing at about the same pace as the capacity of the economy to produce new goods and services. The task is difficult because the actions the Fed takes today will not affect inflation for months if not years into the future. That forces the Fed to anticipate the future. When it errs, inflation can take off.
In the late 1960's, spending on the Vietnam War fueled inflationary pressure. OPEC added to the problem by jacking up the price of foreign oil. By the middle of the 1970's, inflation accelerated and the Fed intervened, producing a prolonged recession. Even so, at the end of the decade, inflation and interest rates soared above 10 percent, and the Fed, under Paul Volcker, cracked down hard. The economy fell into the steepest recession since the Great Depression. A similar story -- recovery leading to inflation leading to Fed intervention and recession -- can be told about the downturn in the late 1950's.
The remarkable feature of the current recovery is that, after almost nine years, there is still little whiff of rising inflation. There is no need for the Fed to crack down. Its decision last week to raise interest rates a quarter of a percentage point was more of a pinprick than a body blow to the economy. The Fed has proved over the last 20 years that it recognizes its obligation to control inflation and marshal its tools appropriately. According to Mr. Taylor's calculations, the Fed reacts today to initial bumps in inflation twice as aggressively -- measured by the size of interest-rate hikes -- as it did in the 1960's and 70's.
Yet no one thinks the Fed can keep the economy growing forever. It will make mistakes. It may let spending grow too quickly, and then be forced to clamp down. Or it may keep spending from growing fast enough to keep workers fully employed, as has happened in Japan. Beyond technical mistakes by the Fed, the economy will some day be rocked by events beyond anyone's control. OPEC has tripled oil prices over the past year and could drive them even higher. Another financial crisis could sweep through Asia or Latin America or both. Stock prices may plunge from their lofty perch, as they did one day in 1987 when they fell a frightening 25 percent. But such shocks in recent years have not thrown the economy into recession, in large part because the Fed reacted quickly to keep spending growing at a healthy clip.
The real danger is something unseen and as yet unknown. But some trends are encouraging. Recessions are getting milder. Expansions are getting longer. Indeed, except for a mild recession at the beginning of the 1990's, the American economy has enjoyed uninterrupted growth for almost 18 years. The important point is that these good times have not been solely due to luck.

HEADLINE: Frederick Vanderbilt Field, Wealthy Leftist, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY 

 BODY:
Frederick Vanderbilt Field, who supported Communist causes in the 1930's, 40's and 50's and was once described as "the Reds' pet blueblood," died Feb. 1 at the Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis. A great-great-grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and a descendant of several other prestigious American families, he was 94 and had lived in Minneapolis for almost two decades.
Mr. Field first ventured into politics when he offered his services to the Democratic Party after returning to the United States from a year at the London School of Economics. He had previously been interested in socialist ideas, and when he discovered that Democratic Party leaders were not in a great hurry to change society, he drifted further in socialism's direction. 
 He began to proclaim the gospel of socialism at every opportunity and made a number of street-corner speeches, although he later said they were not very good.
He first publicly proclaimed his adherence to the socialist cause in 1928, when he announced that he intended to vote for Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party candidate for president. He was cut off without a penny by Frederick Vanderbilt, his great-uncle, for whom he had been named. Frederick Vanderbilt, who had no children, had earlier said he would leave his fortune, estimated at more than $70 million Depression-era dollars, to his namesake.
Socialism paled within a half-dozen years for Mr. Field, who termed it "a splendid shell of an idea without anything important growing inside it." His disillusionment moved him further to the left.
After his return from London, he also went to work for the Institute of Pacific Relations, a federation of 10 national councils working to solve the problems of the Pacific area. The organization was considered respectable throughout most of the 1930's, but the Soviet Union became increasingly influential after joining in 1931, and when Congressional investigators began searching for Communists after World War II, the institute was represented as an umbrella for subversives. Mr. Field remained with the organization until 1940 and was on its board until 1947.
In the 40's, Mr. Field was an organizer and executive secretary of the American Peace Mobilization, an organization with ties to the Soviet Union that was dedicated to keeping the United States from entering the war. In 1941 the group picketed the White House for more than 1,000 hours. The picketing ended suddenly when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
One of Mr. Field's sisters said that until the early 40's he had considered himself as good an American as anyone else. When the United States entered the war, he tried to get a commission in Army intelligence but was turned down as a security risk. That rejection, his sister said, was the final straw.
He became dedicated to Communism, although whether he joined the party was never known. He did acknowledge in 1951 that he had been an unpaid, registered agent for four companies in Communist China.
In a 1951 Life magazine article, Mr. Field tried to explain his political philosophy. "Understanding your own motives is one of the most obscure pursuits in the world," he said. "I'm not terribly interested in introspection but I do have deep convictions."
He said it was possible that if he had had a job to lose, he might have done things differently. But, he added, "I've really had nothing to lose." He picketed and entertained for the Communist Party, but his most important contributions were, as he was not unaware, his prestigious name and his financial generosity.
In 1951, as secretary of the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress -- an organization designated a Communist front by the attorney general -- he was convicted of contempt of court for refusing to reveal who had put up bond for four Communists who had jumped bail. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and served two months.
Two years later, Mr. Field moved to Mexico, where he took up archaeology. He remained there until 1982, when he returned to the United States.
Mr. Field was born on April 13, 1905. His father was William Osgood Field, a descendant of Samuel Osgood, the country's first postmaster general, and Cyrus Field, who was responsible for laying the first trans-Atlantic cable. His mother was Lila Vanderbilt Sloane. His parents' 1902 wedding involved a special train that transported family members and friends to the ceremony in Lenox, Mass., and four detectives to guard the car that carried the wedding gifts, estimated to be worth $1 million, back to Manhattan.
Mr. Field, his brother and his two sisters were raised with every luxury. In his autobiography, "From Right to Left," published in 1983, Mr. Field, writing of himself in the third person, said he had grown up "surrounded by servants who did everything for him but sneeze."
After graduating from the Hotchkiss School in 1923, Mr. Field entered Harvard, where he was a member of Hasty Pudding and an editor of The Crimson. He graduated from Harvard in 1927 and went on to the London School of Economics, where he came under the influence of the socialist Harold Laski.
Mr. Field is survived by his fourth wife, the former Nieves Orozco, who had been a favorite model of Diego Rivera and whom he married in Mexico in 1958. Three earlier marriages ended in divorce. He was married to Elizabeth Brown in 1929 and, three years after his 1935 divorce, to Edith Chamberlain Hunter. That marriage ended in 1949, and four months later he married Anita Boyer, whose first husband, Dr. Raymond Boyer, was convicted in Canada as part of a Russian spy plot.
Survivors also include four daughters, Lila Field Jacob of Minneapolis, Nievska Gonzales of Cuernevaca, Mexico, and Princeton, N.J., Federika Field of Mexico City and Xochitl Field of Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren; 16 great-grandchildren; and a sister, Mary Jackson of Milton, Mass.
Mr. Field, considered a maverick most of his life, never bowed to public or political pressure or to ostracism by his peers.
"You can get stinking drunk at the Stork Club every night and still be held in the highest esteem," Life magazine quoted him as saying in 1951, "but if you write or even believe anything different, then you're a traitor to your class."

McEnroe and Americans Save Their Best for Last

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The American no one expected to faint almost did, and the one who many believed would shrink stood tall.
More predictably, the United States Davis Cup captain irritated the umpire and infuriated his opponents, but ultimately landed on his feet, instead of his hard head. 
 John McEnroe's maiden Davis Cup team achieved what Arthur Ashe's first team did 19 years ago, when a wild-haired and stormy tempered guy named McEnroe won the fifth match against Mexico's Raul Ramirez in Carlsbad, Calif., and rallied the United States to a first-round victory from a 2-1 deficit. This setting was, well, different and the end-game hero was a 27-year-old journeyman, not a budding legend.
As far as a relieved and subsequently jubilant McEnroe was concerned, Chris Woodruff was himself, Jimmy Connors and Pete Sampras all rolled into one today at the Harare Sports Arena. With a barrage of winners and powerful first serves, he battered Wayne Black to clinch a 3-2 victory over gritty Zimbabwe.
Woodruff's 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4 mastery of Black came with one rather important member of McEnroe's team back at the hotel, under a doctor's care. In the process of trying to close out Byron Black in straight sets, Andre Agassi was overcome by cramps and nausea. He held on in a third-set tie breaker, vomiting behind the baseline just before and into a basket right after his 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (4) decision over the elder Black brother.
Agassi repaired to his bed for treatment by George Fareed, a member of the team's medical staff, and watched on television as Woodruff emerged from the cocoon, in which he was so tightly wrapped Friday during a straight-set surrender to Byron Black.
"He has so much heart and character," said McEnroe, grateful that Agassi showed up here at all after winning the Australian Open and being on the road since Dec. 28.
"It was such a great example for these guys," McEnroe said. McEnroe suddenly slipped into his television announcer's skin and, extending his arm toward Woodruff, said, "How about a round of applause for this guy?"
There might have been a temptation to respond with a favorite expression of McEnroe's -- big deal. Wayne Black, in the world of singular achievement, is ranked in the mid-100's. Yet, under these extreme conditions, in a cacophony of noise and a cauldron of heat, the day pretty much began with this economically roiled nation of 13 million believing that the fifth-match victory was all but assured.
Woodruff had looked stiff and even scared against Byron Black. He had little control of his strokes on the fast hardcourt, in the thin nearly mile-high air. The most vociferous local fans from the Mufakose Supporters Club thus had Zimbabwe's national sports anthem -- "Yave Nyoma Yekugocha" (This meat is ready for roasting) ready and rehearsed, in the indigenous Shona tongue.
In the absence of a sanctioned team psychologist, however, Woodruff had received counseling and support from a variety of sources, including McEnroe, his teammates and a couple of Davis Cup veterans from back home.
There was, on Saturday, an e-mail from Jim Courier wishing him luck, and then a telephone chat with Todd Martin, whose viral infection illness -- along with Sampras's injury -- was the reason the 6-foot-4-inch Tennessean found himself in this delicate situation in the first place.
"Did you have any fun Friday?" Martin said.
"I didn't have a bit of fun," Woodruff said.
Martin reminded Woodruff that, contrary to what it felt like on the court, the Wayne Black showdown was going to be only another tennis match against a player he was better than. And when Woodruff took the court today, what he soon began to realize was that the first match, if nothing else, had prepared him for the second. He was comfortable with the environment, familiar with the chanting and the conga drum. He was more than ready for Jojo the clown.
He also quickly demonstrated he had more than enough weaponry, too much power, for the quick, resilient but undersized (at 5-7) Black.
All Woodruff had to do was measure his ground strokes, apply enough topspin to keep them from flying and generate a good percentage of first serves. That he did, dominating the first set and going up an early break in the second, before Black began to run everything down, send it back and wait for the mistake.
Black broke back in the fifth game, won the tie breaker, and broke again for 2-0 in the third set. This was about the time, Woodruff said, he began to feel the humidity, and had trouble taking air into his lungs.
Never has this been a problem for McEnroe, who laced into his player, or as Woodruff put it, "got into my kitchen." Coincidence or not, Woodruff was soon whipping up a souffle of winners that would carry him to a two-sets-to-one lead, up a break in the fourth.
Having gotten back on serve in the third game, Woodruff seized control of the match in the fifth game, breaking again with two heavy forehands. Including the last 2 points of that game, he went on a Sampras-like roll, winning 22 of 25 points and eight straight games.
He noticed that Black was chewing tablets during changeovers. Black later said he was "maybe a step slow," at least. He had lost in straight sets to Agassi Friday, and won the five-set doubles Saturday with Kevin Ullyet. Shumba, his Shona nickname paying tribute to his "heart of a lion," was one tired cat.
Woodruff, who had 73 winners to Black's 23, finished him off with his 15th ace, down the middle. He tossed his racquet so high it crashed against the overhead light structure. McEnroe rushed the court, into his arms. "Eighty four," McEnroe would say when asked when the last felt this good -- the year of his last Grand Slam title.
Unimpressed, Black would later say that McEnroe's match behavior was "disgraceful," and that the umpire, Bruno Rebeuh, should have tossed him for excessive whining.
In the end, the Americans were dancing in Harare and on their way to the second round, against the Czech Republic in April. Agassi, by evening, was feeling better and saying, by phone, that he was "so proud." And all things considered, it didn't turn so badly for Zimbabwe either.
Its next opponent in the relegation round is none other than Old Mother England. As they say here, Yave Nyoma Yekugocha.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Hearing Loss, but Now Not Loss of Opportunity

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
When she was growing up in Honduras, Maria Bustamante never went to school. When she was older, she never held a job. Because she is deaf, those around her thought Ms. Bustamante was incapable of work, and they did not see a need to educate her. She spent most of her time doing housework with her mother.
In 1985, after years of being ignored and pushed aside, Ms. Bustamante decided to go to New York, in her 20's and with a child, in search of dignity and a job. But when she arrived in the city, Ms. Bustamante found only low-level employment at restaurants and cafeterias where she said people still did not treat her with respect. 
 "I didn't know what they were saying," Ms. Bustamante, speaking through a sign-language interpreter, said of her former co-workers at a corporate cafeteria, where she served food and wiped down tables and chairs under a training program, but was never hired. "I tried to stick in there with them, and I tried to do what I thought I had to do."
For more than 10 years, Ms. Bustamante, now 42, was either unemployed or shifting from one lackluster job to another, trying to support herself and her son, Christian, now 21.
"The food, the apartment, the clothes -- it was all a heartache," Ms. Bustamante said. She struggled in a strange land -- made more difficult to understand without a sense of hearing -- to the point of exhaustion. "I left it in God's hands," she said.
But eventually she vowed to plow ahead and search in earnest for a better paying, long-term job. She started seeing a job placement counselor, who put her in touch with the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
She began attending the bureau's vocational readiness group for the deaf, which helps participants navigate the job application process and teaches interviewing techniques and how to communicate with bosses.
She also enrolled in the bureau's vocational training program, which assessed her skills and placed her in training programs, first at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals' employee food services and then at Pibbs Industries in Flushing, Queens.
At about the same time, emboldened by her involvement with the bureau's training programs, she began working to earn her general equivalency diploma, or G.E.D., by taking classes at La Guardia Community College. And one special afternoon last May, after countless hours of study, she became an American citizen.
At Pibbs, a family-owned and operated business that, among other things, makes furniture for beauty salons, Ms. Bustamante has found a steady job for the first time. She helps assemble, package and ship furniture and has a large group of friends at work with whom she can communicate.
"There's Bibi and Christopher," she said. "We get together at lunch for our chitchat. You know, the deaf crew."
About a quarter of the 100 employees at Pibbs are deaf, said Giulio Petruccelli, the company's production manager. "They find an atmosphere that is very amenable to them," he said. Many of the company's job applicants, hearing and deaf alike, arrive from the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service.
Dominic Liantonio, a counselor for the bureau who places people at a number of work sites, said Pibbs employed more deaf people than any other company he has worked with. "What makes this place so compatible with the deaf is that they have camaraderie here," he said. "They don't mind doing a job that might not be 100 percent what they want to do if they have an enjoyable working environment."
"They've had great success here," he added. The deaf, he said, "just really need an opportunity, and Giulio gives them that opportunity."
Now that Ms. Bustamante's life has stabilized, she can concentrate on her quest to learn English and can spend more time with her son in their Astoria apartment. Despite all the hardships she has faced in New York, she said she is glad she came.
"It's a better life here," she said. "There's more opportunity. In Honduras, you didn't have that kind of opportunity."

HEADLINE: IN AMERICA;
Another Glass Ceiling

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The bad news is that 16 percent of the women in this country and 17 percent of the men say they would not vote for a woman for president.
The good news is that those percentages are sharply lower than just eight years ago, when 26 percent of American women and nearly 4 out of every 10 men said they could not pull the lever for a woman running for president. 
 We may be in the 21st century, and life may be improving, but a fair number of us still hold some ancient attitudes.
The presidential race this year is wide open and the most exciting in a long time. But all of the contenders, as usual, are men in suits (or earth-tone sweaters and cowboy boots). Elizabeth Dole spent a minute or two warming up, but she couldn't even rally the wholehearted support of her husband.
A woman in the White House? What if a war were to break out? What if the economy went south? What in the world would she do?
Marie Wilson, the president of the Ms. Foundation for Women and one of the creators of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, has had enough of the bogus fears and the stereotyping and the ignorance. She is on a campaign to raise the consciousness of Americans to the leadership potential in that half of the population that is routinely taken less seriously than men.
She calls her campaign, which has $3 million in financing so far, the White House Project. Her goal is to hasten the day when a woman is elected president, but not just that.
"What we're trying to do is change the climate in America, to make it friendly toward women's leadership," she said. "As long as there are only one or two women who are seen as potential leaders, the focus will be on gender. We want to permanently increase the number of women who run for office in this country. We want to normalize the whole process so that it is not about one woman at a time."
People were calling 1992 the "year of the woman" in politics. But now, nearly a decade later, there are only 9 women among the 100 U.S. senators, 56 women in the 435-member House of Representatives and just 3 women among the 50 governors.
The women who aspire to high public office are often viewed differently than male candidates. A survey commissioned by Deloitte & Touche and released last month found that the public, in general, "puts more stock in a male candidate's ability to tackle tough issues."
Thus, the tougher the job is perceived to be -- and nothing is considered tougher than the presidency -- the less likely it is that a woman will get the nod.
A report that accompanied the Deloitte & Touche survey said:
"The results of the poll show that on the surface Americans express widespread support for women in high political office. However, the public's underlying attitudes toward women reveal persistent stereotypes that serve to undermine women's chances for election to high public office."
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who officially announced her run for the Senate yesterday, was asked by a radio reporter a couple of weeks ago about the venomous reaction she elicits in some quarters. She replied: "I know it's out there and I think some of it is because of the positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is because I'm a woman taking those positions. And maybe some of it is people don't like my hair style. I don't know what it is."
There was a venomous reaction in some quarters to that answer. And maybe it wasn't particularly politic. But, surely, some of the heat Mrs. Clinton is taking is because she's a woman.
Marie Wilson has been scrupulously nonpartisan in her campaign to promote women for high public office. And she doesn't want voters to vote for women simply because they are women.
What she wants, she says, is to accelerate the improvement in the public's acceptance of women in high office that has been occurring over the past several years, and to radically expand the number of women seeking top leadership positions.
She is sponsoring media campaigns, commissioning surveys, conducting mock elections, doing whatever it takes to spread the word that women are as capable as men of running the government of the United States of America.

HEADLINE: CLINTON, IN BUDGET, SEEKS TO BOLSTER MEDICARE PROGRAM

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton on Monday will submit a $1.84 trillion federal budget for next year and will call for using much of the projected budget surplus over the next decade to strengthen and expand the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly, administration officials said today.
Mr. Clinton's plan calls for spending on government programs outside of Social Security and Medicare, the third of the total budget that Congress revisits each year, to grow 3.9 percent next year, and at slightly less than the rate of inflation over the next decade. The administration projects that inflation will be about 2.6 percent a year over the period. 
 Assuming such a growth rate in so-called discretionary spending, the administration calculated that the budget surplus outside of Social Security over the next 10 years would total $746 billion, considerably lower than the projections likely to be adopted by Congress.
The White House's approach is certain to set off a partisan, election-year clash over spending levels, tax cuts and how to define the size of the surplus, and with the Republicans in control of both houses of Congress Mr. Clinton's budget stands no chance of being enacted in anything close to its current form.
But because they take the first step in the annual budget process, presidents get a chance to frame the debate, and the administration's emphasis this year is on defining the amount of money available to the parties as they push their agendas.
Mr. Clinton is trying to take a chunk of the surplus off the table by earmarking it for what administration officials said were realistic spending increases over the next 10 years for general government operations including things as diverse as Head Start and new fighter planes. In doing so, he is formally abandoning the spending limits required by the 1997 balanced budget act.
Those limits have been all but ignored by both parties for two years as the government's balance sheet has shifted from deficit into surplus.
The administration plan would allocate much of the surplus to shoring up Medicare's deteriorating finances and to adding prescription drug coverage to the program. Altogether, $432 billion out of the administration's projection of a $746 billion surplus would go to Medicare over the next decade.
The administration would also use the surplus to help give poor children and their families better access to health insurance, to pay for modest tax cuts and for programs like aid to farmers.
The administration is proposing $350 billion in tax cuts over a decade, offset in part by $100 billion in revenues from closing corporate tax loopholes. Republicans are sure to seek far larger tax cuts, as they have done in each of the previous few years.
To make its numbers add up, the administration is also counting on $66 billion in revenues over the next decade from a 25-cents-a-pack cigarette tax and penalties on tobacco companies that do not reduce teenage smoking.
The administration would use all of the surplus generated by Social Security, about $2 trillion over the next decade, for reducing the national debt, with a goal of eliminating the $3.6 trillion in debt held by the public by 2013.
"By starting with a realistic projection of the surplus and making decisions and tradeoffs on priorities, it's possible to accomplish a great deal and remain on the path of fiscal discipline," said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
The Republican-led budget committees in the House and Senate are only beginning to put their proposals together. But they are expected to start with far lower spending assumptions than the administration and far bigger surplus estimates, allowing more room for tax cuts.
The Congressional Budget Office projected last month that the non-Social Security surplus over the next decade could be as little as $838 billion using assumptions similar to those adopted by the administration, and as much as $1.9 trillion if spending were cut for the next few years before beginning to grow again. Republican leaders have indicated that they will choose a number in between.
Rehearsing a theme that they are sure to stress on Monday, when Mr. Clinton's budget is formally unveiled and sent to Congress, Republicans criticized the White House plan today as bloated and developed with an eye more toward the election in the fall than toward getting legislation enacted.
"From what we know of this budget, it would appear that the era of big government is back with a vengeance," said Robert G. Stevenson, the spokesman for the Senate Budget Committee.
"It's one thing to invest smartly in needed government programs," Mr. Stevenson continued. "This budget throws open the vault and says let's spend it all."
Terry Holt, the spokesman for the House Budget Committee, said that by building spending increases into the budget each year Mr. Clinton was proposing government by autopilot and that his extensive spending proposals were political in nature.
"It's like a laundry list of promises to groups that Al Gore will need to get elected president," Mr. Holt said.
Republicans said it was bad policy to assume that discretionary spending would increase each year at around the rate of inflation. In setting surplus projections, Republicans generally prefer to assume a spending freeze, saying Congress should decide each year how much money gets spent and which programs deserve to be cut.
Bigger surplus projections like those favored by Republicans would also leave more room for big tax cuts.
Mr. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut that Republicans passed last year, and in the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is pressing for a 10-year tax cut of $1.3 billion or more.
Over the last month Mr. Clinton has unveiled a host of initiatives that will be included in his budget, from an increase in tax credits for the working poor to more money for AIDS research to an expansion of programs to enforce gun laws.
Many of the initiatives are likely to go nowhere on Capitol Hill. But there is some prospect of action this year on a few big issues, including adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
Mr. Clinton's plan would cost $168 billion over 10 years, including $98 billion out of the budget surplus and another $70 billion from savings within the existing Medicare system.
While many Republicans also favor adding drug coverage to Medicare, they would prefer a smaller program than Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: It's Official: First Lady Is Now Candidate Clinton

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 6

 BODY:
With her husband seated as a mere onlooker at the rear of the stage, Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her candidacy for the United States Senate this afternoon, presenting herself as a "new Democrat" who views government as neither the cause of nor the solution to the nation's problems.
In a spectacle of media and politics, all packed into a loud and raucous gymnasium at the State University of New York campus here, Mrs. Clinton formally inaugurated what was as much a rite of family passage as a political one. It was Mrs. Clinton who was the center of attention today; President Clinton, whose term in office ends in just 11 months, did not utter a single public word during the 32 minutes he spent on stage. 
 But he did not have to. Mrs. Clinton adopted the message President Clinton rode to the White House in 1992 -- much the way Vice President Al Gore has during his campaign for president -- as she sought to begin what her aides hope will be a new, and less troubled, phase of her campaign against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City.
"I am a new Democrat," Mrs. Clinton said. "I don't believe that government is the source of all our problems or the solution to them. But I do believe that when people live up to their responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours, to help them build better lives. I believe that's the basic bargain we owe to one another in America today."
With her announcement, a ceremony in American politics that has traditionally offered candidates an unfettered chance to make their case to voters, she went to great pains to present herself as a public figure in her own right, and not just a product of her husband's success. The day, choreographed down to the last camera shot, was filled with reminders of this, from the gauzy 18-minute biographical video that introduced her, to the personal anecdotes sprinkled through her speech, to what was written on the huge banner at her back: just "Hillary."
As a rule, politicians tend to step aside on the days when their rivals formally declare their candidacy. But Mr. Giuliani, who takes some pleasure in defying traditional political rules, was anything but a recluse. He rode the morning talk show circuit today with vigor, presenting the case for his candidacy, and the case against Mrs. Clinton, on five separate news programs. He took great pains to note his long years in public service, and repeatedly referred to his official duties in contrast to what he called the Hollywood-style event unfolding upstate.
"I think ultimately it's bigger than any one issue or any one personality," Mr. Giuliani said of a viable candidacy for the Senate. "It's a sense of trust that people have to have. And I guess what I would say to them is, in my case, they have a record of public service in the state of New York for a very long time."
He shuttled from studio to studio, and at the ABC studio on Times Square, where he appeared on "This Week," he indicated that unlike his opponent, he probably would forgo announcing altogether, because he had, in the past, won the elections where he had never announced.
Asked whether he was superstitious, he replied: "I think so. I have to admit."
Democrats had anxiously looked forward to Mrs. Clinton's speech today, hoping that she would restore their confidence in her candidacy after what they viewed as an unsteady start and also hoping that she would offer a compelling case for New Yorkers to elect someone to the Senate who has not held public office or lived in the state until a month ago.
"Now I know, some people are asking why I'm doing this, here and now," she said. "And that's a fair question. Here's my answer, and why I hope you'll put me to work for you: I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns."
In pomp and scale and sheer spectacle, Mrs. Clinton's announcement was, almost certainly, unlike any other staged by a candidate running for public office in New York before. The gym at Purchase College, which is about 10 miles south of Mrs. Clinton's new home in Chappaqua, began filling up with news crews at 7 a.m.; by 1 p.m., there was not a spot to be had on the risers that were set up for photographers and television crews. It was broadcast live on CNN, C-Span, New York 1 and MSNBC.
The event attracted an eclectic mixture of supporters and critics of the first family. Sidney Blumenthal, the White House aide and longtime Clinton adviser, and Ann Lewis, Mr. Clinton's communications director, milled around in a gymnasium that also included John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator and New York Post columnist, and Lucianne Goldberg, the book agent associated with the Linda Tripp tapes.
Most of the state's Democratic members of Congress had been flown from a party retreat in Virginia as a show of support for Mrs. Clinton's entry. Other prominent New York politicians, including Fernado Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, were lined up outside the gym trying to get in.
Mrs. Clinton did not mention Mr. Giuliani's name during her speech. But she made some obvious references to her opponent as she signaled some of the roads of attack that she intended to follow.
"There's one other thing I'll fight against: the politics of revenge and retribution," she said as shouts of "Yes" could be heard in the by-invitation-only crowd. "If you put me to work for you, I'll work to lift people up -- not push them down."
Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the four-term New York Democrat who is retiring at the end of this term. Mr. Moynihan has been suffering from back difficulties, so his attendance was in doubt until the last minute. Walking with evident difficulty onto the stage, he compared Mrs. Clinton to Eleanor Roosevelt in a brief tribute and introduction.
The biographical video of Mrs. Clinton marked the start of an effort by her campaign to present a fuller, and softer, portrait of the first lady. Mrs. Clinton, in an interview last week, said she believed that a lack of information about her -- or misinformation spread by enemies -- accounted for the reluctance of some voters to rally behind her candidacy.
Titled just "Hillary," the video was created by the television producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who produced a similar video for Mr. Clinton when he ran for president in 1992. The audience attentively watched the sympathetic portrait of Mrs. Clinton as an aggressive advocate for children, a lawyer and, finally, a standard-issue suburban mother, notwithstanding where she has spent the last seven years of her life.
"I make a mean tossed salad and a great omelet," Mrs. Clinton said, in a pink sweater with a single strand of pearls at her neck. (It was reminiscent of Mrs. Clinton's last foray into cooking, when in 1992, during her husband's first presidential campaign, she remarked that instead of having a professional career, she could have stayed home and baked cookies.)
In her announcement speech, Mrs. Clinton presented herself as an advocate for schools and health care, sounding two of the main themes of the campaign. At times, she sounded much like Mr. Clinton had sounded last month as he delivered his final State of the Union speech. She pledged to support tax deductions to help with college tuition, easing the marriage penalty, raising the minimum wage, and expanding the earned income tax credit.
Without mentioning Mr. Giuliani's name, she raised two issues on which they do not share similar views. "I'll be on your side in the fight against school vouchers, which drain taxpayer dollars from our public schools," she said. "I'll be on your side in the fight against any tax cut so big it would take us back to the bad old days of exploding deficits and deep recessions, making it impossible for us to save Social Security and Medicare, fund our educational needs, and pay down our national debt."
She also tried to make light of her own residency, an issue that Mr. Giuliani has referred to frequently, with what even some supporters conceded was a fairly feeble attempt at a New York accent.
As Mrs. Clinton spoke, supporters held almost 600 house parties across the state to watch Mrs. Clinton speak, and to raise money for her campaign. In Albany, 40 Democrats crowded into a three-story home, dropping more than $1,500 into a crystal bowl, eating fruit and cheese.
"She's ticking off issues that are important to me as a mother and a public official," said Nancy Burton, 48, the city comptroller. "Despite the national economic boom, upstate cities are still suffering."
The night before, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Clinton went to a potluck dinner with neighbors. The Clintons arrived at the party in a gray Suburban sport utility vehicle, bearing a chicken and rice casserole. Dressed casually in sweaters and slacks, the couple mingled with about 100 guests.
At his wife's speech, Mr. Clinton was the first to applaud as she finished presenting herself as a "new Democrat," delivering the line of thought that won him the presidency in 1992. And the moment she finished speaking, after the applause began to die down, Mr. Clinton was the first to dive into the crowd, shaking hands for almost 30 minutes.

Journal Escalates Battle With British Rival

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The Wall Street Journal, long an also-ran to The Financial Times in the competition for European consumers of financial news, has begun marketing its way across the Continent to challenge its rival's dominance -- and The Financial Times is responding in kind.
Today, The Journal will unveil its new Continental persona, a newspaper that colors its name blue and abandons the pinstriped look of the American edition in favor of a colorful, Web-influenced design. 
 More important, it will repackage and supplement its coverage of technology and the new economy in a new section called Networking, with specialized columns on subjects like advertising in Europe, and add about 14 reporters, bringing the total to more than 80.
It will also take advantage of its six-month-old alliance with the von Holtzbrinck Group, publisher of the German business daily Handelsblatt, by increasing the number of Handelsblatt articles it translates and publishes and trading news executives with its German partner. In June, Dow Jones & Company, The Journal's parent, took a 22 percent stake in Handelsblatt, while von Holtzbrinck bought 49 percent of The Wall Street Journal Europe.
Richard J. Tofel, vice president for corporate communications at Dow Jones, said the company intended to step up its challenge to The Financial Times, which outsells The Journal 121,000 to 83,000 on the Continent. The Journal is aiming at a 140,000 circulation by 2003.
The Financial Times currently trounces its American rival in its home base of Britain, 200,000 to 67,000.
The Journal's move comes little more than a year after The Financial Times, which is owned by Pearson P.L.C., made an effort to raise its salmon-pink profile in the United States, where its circulation, now 102,000, has nearly tripled in three years.
The Financial Times has Continental designs of its own. Lionel Barber, the paper's news editor and second in command of the newsroom -- said on Friday that the start of The Financial Times's German-language version, for which it has hired 120 journalists, is imminent.
Mr. Barber also said that the newspaper had hired an additional 120 journalists in London and New York to write for its Web site, ft.com. All their coverage can be used in any of the paper's print or online editions.
Mr. Tofel, for his part, said: "They're not a serious threat to us in America. We've won the game in Latin America. There is no game in Britain -- they won. The game is in the continent of Europe. We're going to step up and play the game much more aggressively." FELICITY BARRINGER

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the European edition of The Wall Street Journal misstated its circulation. The Journal sells 16,000 copies in Britain, not 67,000. The total European circulation -- not the total for copies sold in Europe outside of Britain -- is 83,000.

HEADLINE: Jorg Haider's Other Message

BYLINE: By Ian Buruma; Ian Buruma is the author, most recently, of "Anglomania.'

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Jorg Haider, leader of the Austrian Freedom Party, smirks a lot and wears flashy loden suits. He also trawls in the same rank pool of populist fears and resentments -- mainly of foreigners who "swamp" the nation, "steal our jobs," have criminal habits, and so on -- as Jean-Marie Le Pen in France, the Republicans in Germany, unsavory fringes of the Conservative Party in Britain, and Pat Buchanan in the United States.
This makes him a disturbing figure, but it is not enough reason to break off high-level diplomatic relations with Austria now that his Freedom Party has joined the coalition government. 
 The reactions to his political success have been remarkable. Leaders of the European Union countries said they would not only cut off high-level relations but suspend Austria's membership in the union. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has recalled the United States ambassador in Vienna, at least temporarily. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel referred to the Holocaust when he recalled his ambassador. The foreign minister of Belgium even told his countrymen that it would be immoral to go skiing in the Austrian mountains.
The European Union has a treaty that allows it to suspend a member nation if it should threaten democracy, human rights or the rule of law. There is no evidence that Mr. Haider's Freedom Party has done any such thing. To be sure, his calculated remarks that the Waffen SS contained fine, upstanding folks, or that Hitler had efficient labor policies, or that concentration camps were mere "punishment" camps are nasty. And his habit of apologizing as soon as his utterances run into flak is creepy.
But pan-Germanic nostalgia for the good old days is not widespread enough in Austria to explain why 27 percent of Mr. Haider's fellow citizens voted for his party.
People who dislike foreigners, liberals and city slickers enough to vote for the far right normally make up about 15 percent of the population in any modern Western democracy. In a two-party system like Britain's, this number is absorbed by the Conservative Party. In the United States it has been visible mostly during the primaries. And in France or Germany the extreme right has never been able to form part of any national coalition. Why then the 27 percent in Austria?
Perhaps the fact that Haider is not a rancid old SS veteran, but a smart, sharp operator, who speaks fluent English, accounts for a few more percentage points than he might otherwise have got. But the main reason for Haider's success has less to do with xenophobia or brownshirt nostalgia than a simple flaw in the Austrian political process.
For more than a decade government has been monopolized by a cozy coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, a coalition based more on pork barrels and jobs for the boys than ideological compatibility. Mr. Haider's Freedom Party, as the only serious opposition, managed to exploit all the discontentment that becomes chronic when political monopolies last too long. Far from seeing Mr. Haider as an enemy of democracy, then, many Austrians see him as the man who might restore it.
Mr. Haider's economic ideas are a mixture of left-wing as well as right-wing populism; he has promised to protect the welfare state but also to lower taxes and privatize industry. So for Austrians who are tired of corporatist policies that cramp private enterprise, the Freedom Party also appears to stand for more liberty. Mr. Haider's anti-European Union rhetoric, defensive of national sovereignty, fits the Thatcherite mold. There is a constituency for such views, which are not inherently anti-democratic. They are shared to some extent by other right-wing parties, in northern Italy, for example. We may not like them, but it would be damaging to democracy to stifle them.
In fact, the European Union's highhandedness only draws attention to its own authoritarian tendencies. Pan-European institutions are filled with unelected men and women who seem to spend too much time with their snouts in a very rich trough. Brussels is a city of pork-barrel operators and backroom schmoozers.
E.U. leaders are aware of the bad image this engenders and talk a great deal these days about the "democratic deficit." The sharp reaction to events in Austria might be regarded as their way to beef up their democratic credentials.
If so, it is the wrong way. For as long as the democratic nation-state persists, people should have the right to choose their own governments, even people whose views many of us find distasteful.
Yes, Hitler was elected, too. But Mr. Haider is not Hitler. If he were to advocate violence, which Hitler had done many times before 1933, that would be the time to step in. To intervene now would be to confirm all the darkest suspicions of Jorg Haider's supporters, namely that foreigners are not to be trusted, especially foreigners who preach democracy but act like panic-stricken authoritarians when they don't like the results.

HEADLINE: Megadrought Appears to Loom in Africa

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
Lately, it has become increasingly clear to scientists that in the 10,000 years since the last ice age ended, the world's climate has often served up droughts far surpassing anything seen in the last 150 years, resulting in some cases in the collapse of entire ancient civilizations.
Now a new study has found that over the last millennium in equatorial East Africa, decades-long droughts far longer and more severe than any in recorded weather history have alternated with periods when rainfall was heavier than today. The droughts dwarfed any experienced by humans in the 20th century, including the American Dust Bowl of the 1930's and the African Sahel drought of the 1970's. 
 In each of the earlier droughts, some of which lasted as long as 80 years, according to oral traditions cited in the study, famine ravaged the land, provoking social and political upheaval and forcing large-scale migrations of people.
Given this pattern of naturally occurring, long-term variability in precipitation, say the scientists who performed the study, there is a "very high probability" that a devastating dry period, possibly lasting decades, will visit tropical Africa again in the next 50 to 100 years. This time, it would affect a human population that has doubled in the last 25 years and is increasing its use of water even faster.
"We have to anticipate that a major catastrophic drought will happen sooner or later, and we must prepare for such an event," said Dr. Dirk Verschuren, a scientist at the University of Minnesota and the University of Ghent, in Belgium, who headed the study. While such a drought would not necessarily be unremitting, he said, it could result in large-scale crop failures lasting 10 to 15 years at a stretch.
The study by Dr. Verschuren and Dr. Kathleen R. Laird and Dr. Brian F. Cumming of Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, appeared in a recent issue of the journal Nature.
Natural long-term variations in precipitation, especially dry periods, have long had a major impact on human societies. Researchers have linked a 300-year drought starting about 4,200 years ago to the collapse of the world's first great empire, that of the Akkadians in Mesopotamia. Drought is also believed responsible for the collapse of several pre-Inca civilizations in South America, and to have been a major contributor to the disappearance of the Mayan civilization in Central America.
Over the last 3,500 years, according to one study, drought has been the rule in what is now California, with some dry periods lasting as much as two centuries; today's California climate, despite occasional dry spells, is a relatively wet exception.
Droughts as severe as that of the 1930's Dust Bowl, according to a recent study by federal scientists, have occurred once or twice a century over the last 300 to 400 years. And even more severe dry periods have in the past periodically converted big stretches of the Great Plains to Sahara-like conditions.
Scientists draw such conclusions on the basis of indirect evidence, since widespread direct measurements of weather and climate have been in use only since the mid-19th century.
In the recent African study, Dr. Verschuren and two associates examined clues contained in sediments in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Over the centuries, the shallow lake has collected runoff from its immediate surroundings. In the middle of the lake is a deeper depression formed by the rim of an ancient volcano. Sediment in the runoff has been deposited there in such a way that it has been protected from disturbance.
Dr. Verschuren and his colleagues extracted a 20-foot core from the protected sediments. The strata of sediment preserved in the core reached back 1,100 years. The scientists analyzed the core for three types of indicators of wetness and dryness: varying kinds of soils, the pattern of different species of algae (some thrive in low, saltier water, others in high, fresher water), and patterns of different species of tiny insects called midges, which are also sensitive to salinity.
The analysis enabled the researchers to reconstruct the climatic history of the region, and all three indicators told the same story: over the last millenniums, the region has experienced a constant succession of wetter and drier periods. Most recently, there were serious droughts in the 1870's, just before Europeans colonized the region, and in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Both of these were much longer and more severe than the Dust Bowl and the 1970's Sahel drought, which threatened millions with starvation.
On the other end of the precipitation scale, rainfall was found to have been significantly higher than today in the 17th and early 18th centuries. This coincides with some of the colder periods of what was called, in Europe, the little ice age, a five-century span in which unusual cold afflicted parts of the Northern Hemisphere from time to time. Conversely, one of the major drought periods coincided with a relatively warm time in Europe, which lasted from about A.D. 1000 to 1270.
The practical question raised by the findings, Dr. Verschuren said, is that of how to plan for the eventuality of a future megadrought in Africa, where the survival of the populace depends mostly on rain-fed agriculture.
"These emerging agricultural economies all do their best in trying to feed their populations, but they do so at a major cost of water use," Dr. Verschuren said. "In many cases, there is serious overexploitation of available water resources."
In countries where water availability is chancy and directly dependent on climate, he said, "you're basically setting yourself up for a catastrophe."
One way to prepare for a coming megadrought, he said, would be to switch to drought-resistant crops. Another would be to reduce dependence on irrigation, which requires large quantities of water.
A broader lesson to be drawn from the findings, he said, is that irrespective of any human impact on the world's climate, there is great natural variability in rainfall, and this variability may swamp the effects of any global warming produced by industrial emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
The average surface temperature of the globe is rising, and the dominant view among scientists is that it will increase by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions of the greenhouse gases are not reduced. While attention in the global warming debate has focused mostly on temperature, many experts say the warming's effect on precipitation may be more striking.
Even in the absence of any impact by greenhouse gases, precipitation is often of greater concern than temperature. "Human societies suffer much more from declining or irregular water resources than from changes in temperature," Dr. Frank Oldfield, director of the international Past Global Changes project in Bern, Switzerland, wrote in a commentary in Nature.
In general, a warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate from the earth's surface. This phenomenon can produce heavier rains, but it can also make droughts worse. Scientists expect both of these to happen in the future, but they are at a loss to predict where and when it will rain less or more.
In any case, Dr. Verschuren said, the effect of global warming on rainfall will probably be small in comparison with the natural variations reported in the new study. Warming in theory could either exacerbate an African drought or alleviate it. "But even if it does alleviate the problem," he said, "it is not going to solve it, because the beneficial effects might be relatively minor compared to the natural variability."

When a Money Machine Needs a Helping Hand

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Until reports of hundreds of millions of dollars in losses made the headlines, few Americans had ever heard of hedge funds, the invention of Nobel Prize mathematicians that promised to take the risk out of investing in the stock market. To get in on a company formed in 1992 called Long-Term Capital Management, created to bring about that miracle, you had to invest at least $10 million for three years.
For a time, Long-Term Capital, in Greenwich, Conn., was a Wall Street Wunderkind, paying as much as 43 percent in its best year. The rich got richer. But in 1997 the company ran into deep trouble; its investments lost prodigiously until the company was $100 billion in debt and the government and Wall Street, fearing the effects that its collapse would have on economies around the world, joined to save it from its own misjudgments. 
 How this happened is tidily unraveled by "Trillion Dollar Bet," tonight's cautionary tale about the fallibility of experts and the unpredictability of the market.
Turning finance into a science is the holy grail long sought by investors big and small. In the 1970's mathematicians thought they were moving toward that goal with a way to keep one's investment portfolio in perfect balance with a technique they called "dynamic hedging."
For an explanation of how their system worked or was supposed to work, see tonight's "Nova," which spells out somewhat abstruse matters in an admirably lucid way. The upshot of the theoreticians' labors, which brought a Nobel Prize to Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton in 1997, was a way to cancel out all risks by evaluating the price of options, a kind of insurance that permits investors to buy or sell stock at a specific price by a specific date.
Mr. Scholes and Mr. Merton had already joined a bond trader named John W. Meriwether in a new firm, Long-Term Capital Management, that would operate by the rules of their theory. Their reputations quickly brought in $3 billion of investment money to be bet on continuing assessments of the relationship of markets all around the world.
But then, in 1998, came the Asian economic panic, an event that had never been dreamed of in the economists' mathematical models. As one trader says tonight, "The market will test you and do what you don't expect it to do." Stock prices slid and kept sliding; on one day after Russia's economic default in August 1998, Long-Term Capital dropped $500 million and the Federal Reserve organized a $3.6 billion bailout by Wall Street's biggest power brokers.
The simple lesson that the narrator is left with after all the brilliant theorizing of the economists is, "While models can help us manage risk, they can never tell us when to buy or sell." Another lesson is that unless you are a billionaire, nobody is going to bail you out.

HEADLINE: Coolidge's Democratic Disciples

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor, is professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE , Mass.

 BODY:
One party claims that the budget surplus will be small and that a central goal should be to eliminate the debt. The other says the surplus will be big and we can do ambitious things with it. You'd be forgiven if you thought that the first party was the Republicans and the second the Democrats. But it is the reverse. The Democrats are marching under the banner of fiscal austerity, and the Republicans are proclaiming this the era of large ambition.
"Here's the facts," said George W. Bush the other day, pointing to the latest estimate from the Congressional Budget Office as showing that the nation could well afford his plan to trim income taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10 years and still have enough money to fund social programs. 
 But President Clinton, in his new budget, released today, claims the surplus that's left over after saving all Social Security receipts is a little more than half that -- $746 billion. The president's estimate is even smaller than the most conservative projection coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, which foresees a 10-year non-Social Security surplus of $838 billion to $1.9 trillion.
The administration's budget also makes retiring the debt the nation's biggest financial priority, aside from saving Social Security. "Let's make America debt-free for the first time since 1835!" the president exulted in his State of the Union Message. His new budget seeks to pay off the entire $3.6 trillion tab by 2013. Granted, the new budget also provides a buffet of attractive policy ideas, few of which will be enacted by this Republican Congress in this election year. Debt elimination trumps all of them.
Meanwhile, Vice President Gore is blasting both Mr. Bush and Bill Bradley for counting on large surpluses -- Mr. Bush to finance a tax cut and Mr. Bradley for spending. Mr. Gore says he'll pursue debt reduction even if the economy slows, "just as a corporation has to cut expenses if revenues fall off," adding that a recession should be viewed as an opportunity to push cuts further "before any other options are considered."
Even House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt is sounding a bit like Calvin Coolidge these days, saying that "until the money is in the Treasury" Congress shouldn't make new promises and "if and when it materializes" we should use the surplus for Social Security and Medicare. And what of the non-Social Security surplus that Republicans are drooling over? Use that for "paying down the debt and honoring our existing commitments to health and education," he said. But those existing commitments aren't much to write home about.
It would be one thing if the born-again, fiscally austere Democrats were speaking out of strong conviction backed by sound ideas. But the conviction is paper-thin. Eliminating the national debt has not been a plank of any Democratic economic program in living memory, and most Democrats who are now talking gravely about its importance have never uttered the words "eliminate the debt" before.
Besides, eliminating the debt shouldn't be the nation's goal. As long as the debt doesn't rise as a proportion of national product (and by that measure it's been falling now for several years), the important issue isn't how large it is in absolute dollars but what the borrowed money is used for. Borrow to give all our nation's kids good schools and healthy bodies, and that's a smart investment -- no less important to America's future prosperity than any private-sector machinery or real estate made slightly cheaper because interest rates were driven lower by debt repayment.
So why are Democrats sounding like Coolidge Republicans? Despite polls showing dwindling interest in tax cuts, the Democrats remain spooked by the possibility that voters will be attracted to ambitious Republican tax-cutting plans in the fall, and they haven't the confidence to build public support for an equally ambitious program centered on education and health care. When the surpluses first began ballooning, the president dealt a body blow to Republican tax cutters by telling the public the choice was between cutting taxes or saving Social Security. But last year, as the surpluses continued to mount, the Republicans handed the president a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut that wouldn't touch Social Security revenues. The president vetoed that plan, but the die was cast. The White House felt it had no alternative but to play the debt card if the tax cutters were to be stopped in this election year. The rest of the Democratic establishment is falling into line.
The Democrats are wrong on three counts. First, the public isn't nearly as eager for a tax cut as Democrats fear. During the 1990's, incomes soared only at the top rungs of the ladder, so that most tax revenues are now coming from the well-off. Over 30 percent of income tax revenues are now collected from the top 1 percent of earners, 60 percent from the top 10 percent. Every Republican tax-cutting plan gives most of the money back to the people from whence this money came, leaving peanuts for most other Americans -- and the voters know it.
Second, it's plain dangerous to make the elimination of the national debt a core goal of policy. It is dumb on economic grounds ("He should wash his mouth out with soap," Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow was quoted in The Times as saying of Mr. Gore's plan to continue to pay down the debt even when the economy slows). But it also puts the Democrats in a straitjacket when it comes to any future proposal for universal health care or universally good schools.
Which brings us to the third problem for the Democrats. "Eliminate the debt!" is not the sort of cry likely to rally many loyal Democrats to vote next November, or even to ignite many of the passions of independents.
If the Democrats stand for anything, it should be for helping the little guy who's gotten relatively little out of this buoyant economy so far. Not incidentally, little guys include most voting-age Americans. Little guys could get passionate about good health care and good schools. But faced with a choice between tax cuts for the big guys or fiscal austerity, the little guys may well decide stay home.

HEADLINE: Gad Rausing, 77, Swedish Innovator of Beverage Containers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
A milk carton made Dr. Gad Rausing, who died on Jan. 28 at the age of 77 in Montreux, Switzerland, one of the wealthiest men in the world.
The Swedish-born Dr. Rausing, along with his younger brother, Hans, helped develop their father's idea for a new type of paper carton that extended the shelf life of milk into a global packaging empire, the privately held Tetra Laval Group in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
 The secretive billionaire died after a brief illness, said a company spokesman, Jorgen Haglind, who did not disclose the cause of death.
Gad Rausing's personal fortune -- an estimated net worth of $9 billion, according to Forbes magazine -- grew from the 1952 invention of a tetrahedron-shaped milk carton by his father, Dr. Ruben Rausing.
The Swedish-born Ruben Rausing studied economics at Columbia University and while there took note of the advanced food packaging methods he saw in the United States. Company legend has it that in the 1940's he was watching his wife, Elizabeth, make sausages by tying off the ends, and he wondered if a similar system could be applied to milk.
His attempts, aided by an engineer, Erik Wallenberg, led to a Tetra Pak, a carton made of paper, plastic and aluminum, that eliminated the need for refrigerating milk.
The cartons, now usually shaped more like a small brick and called Tetra Brik, are ubiquitous in Europe. In the United States, the packages are better known simply as the small rectangular juice containers, usually with a built-in plastic straw, that children often take to school.
Dr. Gad Rausing and his brother joined their father's company shortly after the Tetra Pak was invented. Over the next 10 years, they helped the company grow into a conglomerate, selling water purifiers, bank-note dispensers and other products, as well as other types of containers, like Tetra Rex, the gable-topped carton for refrigerated milk that is common in the United States.
In 1965, the family sold every part of the company except for the Tetra Pak. Then, in 1991, the Rausing brothers bought Alfa-Laval, a large packaging group in Sweden, and created Tetra-Laval.
Today, the company, which moved to Switzerland in 1981 to escape Sweden's high inheritance taxes, produces about 85 billion Tetra Paks, Tetra Briks and Tetra Rexes a year, collects about $6.5 billion in sales and has operations in 170 countries.
Gad Rausing was born on May 12, 1922, in Stockholm. At the University of Lund, he earned college degrees in economics and statistics, as well as a doctorate in archaeology.
Dr. Rausing had a lifelong interest in archaeology; his doctoral dissertation was on bows and arrows. He was an expert on prehistoric boats and he financed research and frequent excavations in Sweden, where he was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. He also supported a variety of institutions, among them a chair at Oxford for Icelandic studies.
His wealth made him a target for terrorists and blackmailers, too. In 1969, he received death threats and ransom demands by carrier pigeon. Later, Middle Eastern terrorists in Copenhagen were found guilty of plotting to kidnap his son, Jorn, and hold him for a $25 million ransom.
Besides his son Jorn and his brother Hans, who both live in London, Dr. Rausing is survived by his wife, Birgit; another son, Finn Rausing, of Stockholm; and a daughter, Kirsten Rausing, of England.

HEADLINE: Fed Says Consumer Debt Rose in December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Consumer debt surged in December for the second consecutive month, fueled by holiday spending and capping a year that had the fastest pace of borrowing since 1996, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Consumer credit rose $11.2 billion in December, to $1.4 trillion, after a November gain of $15.8 billion, which was the largest in four years. Borrowing for all of 1999 grew 7.6 percent. That followed a 5.4 percent increase in 1998 and is the largest annual rise since debt climbed 7.9 percent three years earlier. 
 Consumers have supplied the momentum for an economic expansion that became the country's longest this month.
Americans are "bent on spending the windfall" from economic growth, said Vincent Boberski, senior economist at Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. Consumption should start to fall this year, he said, but "underlying demand continues to be extremely strong."
Analysts had expected consumer borrowing to rise $8.3 billion.
Consumer borrowing rose at an annual rate of 9.7 percent in December compared with a 13.8 percent annual pace during November, according to the Fed.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Demand for Technology Shares Drives Nasdaq to Record

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index cruised to a record yesterday, as demand for technology and biotechnology stocks remained strong.
But the strength in technology masked another lackluster session for most stocks. 
 "Technology and biotechnology are good and everything else is blah," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "The broader market is responding to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. There will be more of that."
Led by Cisco Systems and Intel, the Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,321.77, up 77.63 points, or 1.8 percent. It was the sixth consecutive advance for the index and the first time it has closed above 4,300.
Weakness in blue-chip companies like General Electric and Alcoa, however, pulled down the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow dropped 58.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,905.79. Nine of its 30 components gained in price, while the remaining 21 fell. Strong gains in Hewlett-Packard and Intel prevented the Dow from sustaining what would have been a loss of well over 100 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was little changed, falling 0.13 point, to 1,424.24. But strength in technology and biotechnology shares helped to bolster the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks.
The Russell, which so far this year has done much better than either the Dow or the S.& P. 500, gained 6.87, or 1.3 percent, to 532.39.
More than 918 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.6 billion shares.
The continued strength in demand for technology stocks is surprising some analysts, who point to sky-high valuations throughout the sector as well as a long -- and growing -- list of stocks that are trading at bargain-basement levels.
For the moment, at least, it is not an argument that many investors seem to want to hear, or heed.
John Manley, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, just returned from visiting clients in Italy.
"The Italians want to be in this market, and they want to own technology," he said. "That is true throughout Europe."
Much the same seems to be true in the American heartland.
"I am having a hard time getting anyone to listen to anything but technology," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "Our clients want to be in the right stocks, and they want to be in the ones that are moving."
Cisco Systems, which is expected to issue its quarterly earnings report after the market closes today, certainly qualifies as a mover.
The stock gained 4 1/16 yesterday, closing at 125 3/16. From the close of business on Jan. 28, the stock has risen by more than 20 percent.
Among Dow stocks, General Electric shed 1/16, to 141 11/16. Alcoa fell 2 3/8, to 68 1/8. And Boeing dropped 2 3/16, to 41 13/16.
Those losses were mitigated by big gains in Hewlett-Packard, which jumped 10 3/8, to 128 3/8, and in Intel, which gained 3 3/16, to 107 15/16.
It was a very good day for biotechnology shares, which continued their torrid rise.
Among biotech companies, Amgen gained 4 9/16, to 69 3/16. Genentech jumped 6 1/2, to 150 1/2. And Human Genome rose 26 15/16, to 142 1/16.

Treasuries Fall Again, With New Issues Coming

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as the Treasury and Vodafone AirTouch led sales of at least $38 billion of debt this week and on expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate increases.
The government will sell $32 billion of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year securities at its quarterly auctions beginning today. 
 The sales come after selling yesterday and Friday erased much of the biggest two-day rally in almost 13 years.
The rally occurred as the Treasury's debt buyback prompted traders to reverse losing bets that bonds would fall.
The price of the 30-year Treasury fell 2 9/32, to 97 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.34 percent from 6.26 percent on Friday.
Thirty-year yields have dropped more than four-tenths of a percentage point since Jan. 20, buoyed by the Treasury's planned debt buyback and reduced government auctions.
Investors had a chance to add to their holdings of corporate debt at a $5.25 billion sale of 5- , 10- and 30-year debt by Vodafone.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.598	97.083	High Rate	5.54%	5.77%	Investment Rate	5.71%	6.04%	Low Rate	5.47%	5.67%	Median Rate	5.54%	5.75%	Total applied for	$30,648,180	$27,475,831	Accepted	$13,555,340	$11,970,181	Noncompetitive	$1,454,693	$1,213,416	
 
Both issues are dated Feb. 10, 2000. The three-month bills mature on May 11, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 10, 2000.

HEADLINE: Last-Lap Budget

 BODY:
The $1.8 trillion budget proposed by President Clinton yesterday was for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, when he will have only a few months left at the White House. But Mr. Clinton's fiscal priorities could long outlive his tenure. The president called once again for using projected surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare, rather than to grant big tax cuts. He would also spend additional money for education and other domestic needs. Republicans in Congress may rewrite the numbers but are unlikely to reorder his priorities in this election year. In part that is because Senator John McCain's challenge to party orthodoxy in his presidential campaign has thrown Republicans on Capitol Hill into disarray.
Coming after his triumphalist State of the Union Message, Mr. Clinton's valedictory Budget Message spent as much time looking backward as forward. The president credited the longest recorded economic boom in American history to the tough decisions he made in 1993 to restrain spending and increase taxes, and in 1997 to accept budget cuts, especially in Medicare, demanded by Congressional Republicans. His Budget Message was a kind of victory lap for policies reviled by many Republicans and in truth not always welcomed by his fellow Democrats. Indeed, Senator Bill Bradley's presidential campaign appeals to those Democrats tired of Mr. Clinton's embrace of spending restraint. 
 The budget was also significant for injecting a dose of reality into budget calculations. Mr. Clinton wisely called for scrapping the unrealistic spending caps enacted by Congress two and a half years ago, which would destroy domestic spending programs if they were ever adhered to. Congress has all but ignored these caps in the last two years, sometimes by employing gimmicks like labeling regular programs as "emergencies" and therefore outside the caps. The much-quoted projection that there will be more than $2 trillion in budget surpluses in the next decade is predicated on these cuts taking place, which is extremely unlikely. It makes more sense to assume that domestic spending will stay pretty much at current levels, growing at something like the rate of inflation, as Mr. Clinton has proposed.
Only last month the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that, if spending remains at these more realistic levels, the 10-year surplus outside the Social Security system will be only $838 billion. Yesterday the president projected a surplus of $746 billion, roughly in the same ballpark.
Either way, that is not enough money to pay for the large tax cut proposed by Gov. George W. Bush in his presidential campaign. The budget numbers suggest instead that Senator McCain is on sounder ground in favoring more limited tax cuts. Congressional Republicans should not be reluctant to go along with these realistic numbers, even if they undercut the presidential candidate most of them seem to favor.
With the presidential race heating up, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are once again divided over whether it is more advantageous to try for budget compromises or to draw lines in the sand and hope to reap the benefits of confrontation. If they choose to compromise, they could make some progress in bolstering Medicare with money for prescription drugs for the elderly, and they could increase spending for education and children, as the White House wants. A small tax cut acceptable to all sides could become part of this mix.
In their hearts, many voters would prefer results rather than confrontation to provide more fodder for campaign commercials. Mr. Clinton's budget does ratchet domestic spending up, but in a modest way that should be acceptable in Congress. Republicans in Congress should be rethinking their demand for big tax cuts, especially now that the issue is not working even in the Republican presidential race.

Austrians Consider the Cost Of Extremism in the Cabinet

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Austrian economists and policy makers fear that the protests and sanctions against the new government could dampen investment in this country and raise capital costs for companies already doing business here.
But the greater concern seems to be Austria's exclusion from European Union deliberations at a time when the 15-nation group is discussing policies crucial to the country's economic future, including the admission of several formerly Communist East European countries that are Austrian neighbors. 
 The consensus here seems to be that the downgrading of relations by the European Union, and the recall of ambassadors by Israel and the United States, because of the inclusion of ministers from the anti-immigrant Freedom Party of Jorg Haider will not have immediate and serious economic consequences. But that could change if Austria's isolation deepens.
For his part, Mr. Haider sought today to play down the impact of his party's inclusion in the government. "We will have a stable situation in a few weeks," he said in an interview on the "Today" program on NBC.
Financial effects of Austria's political isolation were felt last week, when the country's stock indexes dropped around 10 percent on average. Stocks declined 1.3 percent more today to the lowest level in a year. "No one loves a stock exchange in a country with political problems like this," Ronald Kern, a fund manager here with Constantia Privatbank, told Bloomberg News. "The fears are that the last international investors will leave the market and not return for three to six months."
Only the Dow Jones transportation average and the Brussels stock exchange index have performed worse this year, dropping 13.6 percent and 13 percent respectively.
Austria's financial climate was not helped any last Wednesday, after the Dutch bank ABN Amro announced it was suspending a deal to underwrite asset-backed securities for the Austrian province of Carinthia, where Mr. Haider is governor, because of reports that the securities would be used to finance a children's aid program excluding immigrant families.
One of Austria's most vulnerable industries is tourism, and shares in companies dependent on tourism, like Austrian Airlines and Flughafen Wien A.G. the Vienna airport operator, have been dragged down.
Last week, school authorities in Belgium scrapped ski trips to Austrian resorts and a Belgian tourism trade fair canceled an invitation to a northern Austrian resort, Scharding. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said skiing in Austria this winter would be "immoral." How many people may heed such admonitions is unclear.
Sabine Koppl, spokeswoman for the Austrian National Tourism Board, acknowledged "scattered cancellations" by tour groups, but said it was too early to fully judge the reaction. Austrian tourism has been booming. In 1999, revenue reached a record $14.2 billion, after $13.8 billion the year before. "We live from tourism as never before," Ms. Koppl said.
Although it may be premature to gauge foreign investors' reaction to Austria's political shift, there have been some signs. Rene Siegl, managing director of the Austrian Business Agency, a government office that seeks to attract direct foreign investment, said the new government was "no catastrophe," yet he conceded there was "quite some demand for explanations" from prospective investors in Japan, Taiwan and the United States. In 1999, the agency helped secure 118 foreign investment deals totaling $271 million, he said.
Bernhard Felderer, the director of the economic research institute IHS, said further stock market weakness would penalize Austrian companies by increasing the cost of capital, forcing them to in effect pay a premium for investment. And the success of the new government depends in part on attracting capital to help privatize much of the country's nationalized industry, including the remaining 75 percent it holds in Telekom Austria A.G.
For the moment, Austria hardly seems in economic crisis. Helmut Kramer, the director of WIFO, another economic research group, said growth this year could reach 3 percent, after 2.2 percent in 1999. But he cautioned that extended exclusion from European Union deliberations could damage Austrian interests, preventing the government from influencing future policy, notably toward European enlargement eastward. Austria borders on Hungary and the Czech Republic, which with Poland are the first three candidates for admission to the European Union.
But labor costs in those countries are roughly one-tenth the level here, Mr. Kramer said, and Austria has been urging its European partners away from an immediate opening of East European labor markets to prevent a flood of cheap labor.
Thus, the sanctions resulting from Mr. Haider's electoral success could hamper Austria in obtaining measures to prevent the increased immigration he opposes. "In representing our interests to the European Union," Mr. Kramer said, "we are severely handicapped."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
After Seattle, Trade Group Scales Back Its Agenda

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization, seeking to move beyond its highly publicized failure in Seattle to start a new round of global trade negotiations, has agreed instead to begin negotiations limited to opening markets in agriculture and services.
In the two months since the collapse of the Seattle meeting, the organization's 135 member countries have been groping for ways to resurrect the effort to convene negotiations aimed at dismantling barriers to global commerce. But the members had been unable to agree on a broad agenda. 
 Bowing to these realities, at least for now, the trade organization formally set out today a blueprint for proceeding with a narrower agenda that would attempt to revamp trade rules for farm goods and services. Countries agreed during the 1993-94 trade negotiations in Uruguay that efforts to widen trade in at least these two areas would begin this year.
"The W.T.O. is back in business," said Mike Moore, the organization's director general, expressing relief that it had broken an impasse. Members had been meeting steadily since early January to lay the groundwork for the meeting today, the first formal session of the organization's governing body, called the General Council.
Delegates have set a framework for negotiations, which will be handled within existing W.T.O. committees. This means negotiations on trade in farm goods will probably start in late March, and services, which include insurance and banking, in late February.
Figures compiled by the trade organization show that agriculture and services account for 65 percent of global output and 80 percent of the world's jobs. Agriculture alone employs half the world's work force, according to recent World Bank statistics.
No deadlines were set, however, for concluding the talks, which means they could drag on for months or even years. Agriculture, in particular, is a difficult issue because countries like France and Japan are firmly opposed to the Australian and American view that farm goods should receive no special treatment that protects domestic producers.
Also still under negotiation is a request by developing nations for extensions of deadlines to honor agreements made in the Uruguay round of talks, particularly in the area of intellectual property rights. This request has become a major source of contention between industrialized and developing countries, and contributed to the collapse of the Seattle meeting.
Developing countries are seeking solutions to help meet their obligations to respect intellectual property rights and upgrade customs valuation methods and investment policies.
In January, the biggest trading powers indicated willingness to extend the Dec. 31, 1999, deadline on an individual country basis.

HEADLINE: The Battle of the Decades;
Reaganomics vs. Clintonomics Is a Central Issue in 2000

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
By the reckoning of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the independent group that has the final say on these matters, the current economic expansion -- as of this month the longest on record -- dates from March 1991.
That was nearly two years before Bill Clinton took office as president. But since his two terms in the White House have largely overlapped the extended run of prosperity, Mr. Clinton and his team have not been shy about claiming their share of credit. They point in particular to the administration's record in balancing the budget, thereby keeping long-term interest rates down, stimulating business investment in efficiency-enhancing technology and creating jobs. 
 While deficit spending gave the economy a temporary and ultimately costly lift in the 1980's, Mr. Clinton said in an interview last week, the economy only went on a sustainable long-term growth path after he pushed a deficit-reduction package through Congress over Republican opposition in 1993.
"When we actually passed it, people could see we were serious, and I think it was just like breaking through a dam," Mr. Clinton said.
But by the reckoning of most Republicans, the current expansion is nothing more than an extension of a growth surge that began early in the Reagan administration. With the exception of a short, shallow recession in late 1990 and early 1991 that coincided with the Persian Gulf war, the economy has grown steadily since November 1982, driven by Reagan-era tax cuts and deregulation, they say.
To the degree that the country's improved fiscal position has helped, they say, it was only pressure from Republicans that forced Mr. Clinton to abandon big spending programs and support aggressive efforts to eliminate the deficit.
"For Bill Clinton to be taking credit for this economic boom we're experiencing is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.
Lawrence Kudlow, who was an economist in the Reagan administration, said the reductions in marginal income tax rates in the early 1980's and steps to free a variety of industries from price controls and other regulation "opened the door to a tremendous entrepreneurial burst, which has gained momentum and continues."
This current stretch of good times, however framed, clearly has many factors behind it. There have been dizzying advances in computing power and breakthroughs in new technologies. Investors have proved eager to finance even risky new ideas. The nation's work force, strengthened by a huge wave of capital spending, has become much more productive. The Federal Reserve has conducted monetary policy with skill and flexibility. The United States has benefited to some extent from the problems that have plagued much of the rest of the world.
But this is an election year, making it hard to avoid putting the economy and the longevity of this expansion in a political context.
Representing the Clinton boom is Vice President Al Gore, whose economic platform calls for a combination of fiscal conservatism and incremental government activism that is all but identical to the program pursued by Mr. Clinton.
Representing the forces of Reaganism is Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is running on a big tax cut intended not just to bolster economic growth but to keep politicians in Washington from frittering away the federal budget surplus on what Republicans see as costly and wasteful government programs.
Given the challenge that both front- runners face from within their own parties, especially on fiscal policy, neither camp can be assured of carrying its message into November. On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley is unapologetically calling for big spending programs to deal with big problems like child poverty and access to health care. Among the Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona is making a case that dealing with long-run problems like the solvency of Social Security is more important than tax cuts.
Nonetheless, to a remarkable degree, the economic policy debate this year comes down to the question of the 1980's versus the 1990's -- tax cuts and an emphasis on reducing the size and influence of federal government versus a belief that spending more on priorities like health, education and the environment can coexist with strengthening the national balance sheet.
Economists, never mind politicians, will no doubt argue the merits of both sides for decades. The importance of Washington in shaping the economy has faded in recent years. Still, some credit no doubt goes to both sides, as well as to other players, even some with otherwise poor economic records, like President Jimmy Carter.
Two things happened in the Carter administration that helped shape what came later, said William Niskanen, who was an economist in the Reagan administration and is now chairman of the Cato Institute, a conservative research group.
One was the beginning of a wave of deregulation, starting with the airline industry, that broke a long spell in which the government had steadily taken a more active role in the economy. Over the next decade it spread rapidly through industries including trucking, bus lines, energy and financial services.
The other, Mr. Niskanen said, was President Carter's decision, in 1979, to appoint Paul A. Volcker to lead the Federal Reserve. Although Mr. Carter turned on Mr. Volcker in the early 1980's, Mr. Volcker went on to defeat the high inflation that was crippling the economy, setting the stage for the era of price stability now being managed by Mr. Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan.
At the same time there was a growing clamor for tax cuts among Republicans in Congress, led by Representative Jack Kemp of Buffalo and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware.
"The basics were in place for what later became called Reaganomics," Mr. Niskanen said. "Tax rate reductions, deregulation, tight money."
The biggest change after Ronald Reagan's election was the passage in 1981 of the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which sharply lowered marginal income tax rates, cutting the top rate from 70 percent, to 50 percent.
"The Kemp-Roth tax cut became the rallying cry of the Reagan forces, and it's what turned the country around," Mr. Roth said. "It turned the country from a period of pessimism to confidence in the future, and it freed up money that allowed entrepreneurs to take greater risks. That was the opening shot of the period of prosperity."
But the big tax cuts, combined with a big increase in military spending and an unwillingness on the part of Congress to cut domestic spending, sent the budget deficit and the national debt climbing to previously unheard-of levels.
There were many other developments in the 1980's that had a positive influence on the economy, including a drift in both parties toward supporting free trade and a revolution on Wall Street, which came up with new and sophisticated ways to raise money for entrepreneurs and big corporations.
But in the view of many Democrats, the economy that Mr. Clinton inherited in 1993 was little more than a shell, its strength hollowed out by the strain that rapidly growing deficits were creating. While the economy was growing, it was weak, and another recession did not seem out of the question.
President George Bush and Democrats in Congress had agreed on a deficit-reduction package in 1990, but the deficits had continued to increase. Mr. Clinton originally backed a traditional Keynesian stimulus package of new spending to give the economy a boost, but then went all out to bring down interest rates by persuading Wall Street that he was serious about debt reduction.
"We may have gotten out of the recession of the late 70's and early 80's with this massive deficit spending, but to build it structurally into the economy was a big burden," Mr. Clinton said in the interview last week. "We decided we would break it structurally."
Helped by a steadily improving economy, the deficits have melted away since 1993, replaced lately by huge surpluses that could well continue for many years. The national debt is falling, freeing capital for investment in private industry. Democrats credit the 1993 deficit reduction plan, augmented by the 1997 bipartisan balanced budget act, further moves to tear down trade barriers and the updating of legislation governing key industries like telecommunications and financial services.
"All these things, even before they were actually felt, helped to create a mindset of confidence, which it seems to me is critical for keeping the recovery going this long," Mr. Clinton said. Democrats also point out that nearly all Republicans in Congress opposed the 1993 deficit- reduction plan because it raised rates for upper-income taxpayers. Many Republican leaders openly predicted it would ruin the economy.
Should Governor Bush win the White House in the fall and push through a Reagan-sized tax cut, the president added, the country could ultimately be faced again with painful choices: cutting spending, dipping into the Social Security surplus or returning to budget deficits.
"The likeliest thing would be a slow return to the deficit," Mr. Clinton said, "which I think in the world we're living in would be a bad error."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE GOALS;
One Step at a Time, Clinton Seeks More Help for Poor and Elderly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The budget unveiled today by President Clinton shows his extraordinary persistence as an architect of domestic policy. In health care and other social programs, he is pursuing many of the same goals as in 1993, though often by different means.
Mr. Clinton is still trying to increase health insurance coverage, still trying to expand eligibility for food stamps, still trying to increase the earned-income tax credit, one of the nation's biggest anti-poverty programs. 
 "They don't call him the comeback kid for nothing," said Edward M. Cooney, a special assistant to the secretary of agriculture, noting how Mr. Clinton has pressed on despite setbacks and detours.
In 1993, his first year in office, Mr. Clinton proposed a big expansion of the food stamp program, and Congress approved much of his proposal. The 1996 welfare law cut food stamp spending, especially benefits for legal immigrants. Mr. Clinton won restoration of some of the cuts for legal immigrants in 1998, and today he asked Congress to restore more.
Mr. Clinton has been even more tenacious on health policy. No longer does he try to guarantee health insurance for all by redesigning the health care system from top to bottom. Rather, he proposes more modest steps to insure a dozen different groups, including workers between jobs, people ages 55 to 64, uninsured parents of children eligible for Medicaid, legal immigrants and low-income women with breast cancer.
In his new budget request, Mr. Clinton offers bigger versions of health care proposals that failed in the last few years, and he asks Congress to spend more money on them, in the hope that the proposals will prove more popular if they are more generous. Mr. Clinton would use anticipated budget surpluses to finance many of his ambitious plans.
Mr. Clinton described his approach in his State of the Union Message last month. "The lesson of our history, and the lesson of the last seven years," he said, "is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground."
In 1997, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his original proposal for universal health insurance coverage would not work. But he said: "Maybe we can do it in another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time until eventually we finish this."
Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Clinton had persuaded Congress to accept major changes in health and domestic policy by pursuing an incremental approach.
"I wouldn't say it's more palatable," Mr. Butler said, "but it's harder to resist. It's directed at very tangible aspects of people's lives. The president can say he's just solving people's problems, not expanding the role of government."
Today, for the third year in a row, Mr. Clinton proposed to let people ages 55 to 64 buy coverage through Medicare. Stung by criticism that the premiums would be too high, Mr. Clinton now proposes tax credits to let people offset 25 percent of the cost. He would, in effect, offer a tax break to encourage people to participate in a government program.
Mr. Clinton also sweetened his proposal to offer prescription drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries.
Congress last year balked at the proposal, under which the government would pay half of a beneficiary's drug expenses, with a maximum federal payment of $2,500 a year. Today Mr. Clinton enlarged his proposal, adding coverage for the costs of beneficiaries with very high drug expenses. He gave no details of how he would design or finance such "catastrophic coverage."
Similarly, Mr. Clinton last year proposed a $1,000 tax credit to assist people caring for relatives with chronic illnesses or disabilities. The idea was well received in Congress, but never became law. Today Mr. Clinton proposed to triple the amount of the credit.
The president also returned to one of his favorite programs, the earned-income tax credit, which offers assistance to poor working families. In 1993, Mr. Clinton proposed an expansion of the credit costing $28 billion over five years; Congress approved $20 billion, providing help to 15 million low-income families.
Today Mr. Clinton proposed a further expansion of the tax credit, which would provide relief to 6.8 million families at a cost of $2 billion a year.
From his earliest days in office, Mr. Clinton has been trying to expand Head Start, the development program for preschoolers, with a goal of serving one million youngsters. When he took office in 1993, Head Start was providing health, education and social services to 713,900 children at a cost of $2.8 billion a year. This year 877,000 children participate, and the program has a budget of $5.3 billion.
In his budget request today, Mr. Clinton sought $6.3 billion, for a total enrollment of 950,000 children.
Mr. Clinton has been equally persistent in trying to immunize children against measles, mumps, polio and other diseases.
In 1993, he and Hillary Rodham Clinton said they wanted the federal government to buy up all childhood vaccine and distribute it at no charge to all children. They settled for a program guaranteeing free vaccine for millions of children who were poor or uninsured. But the program went awry when the administration insisted on storing large quantities of vaccine in a federal warehouse.
In 1994, the White House scrapped plans for the warehouse, scaled back the government's role and sought more money to help drug companies distribute vaccine to state health departments and clinics.
Isabelle Claxton, a spokeswoman for Merck & Company, which makes several pediatric vaccines, said: "The lesson is that the marketplace can work. Once you got past the politics, it became clear that the price of individual vaccines was not the main barrier. The Clinton administration reached out to states and worked with them to do a better job of educating physicians and parents to immunize children on time."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE STRATEGIST;
McCain Aide's Conservatism Runs Deep

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 7

 BODY:
Senator John McCain has recently been accused by Republican opponents of being a shadow liberal, but no one has ever leveled such a charge against his South Carolina political consultant and the architect of his Southern campaign, Richard M. Quinn.
Where Mr. McCain has policy positions from across the political spectrum, Mr. Quinn is one of the proudest and most vocal conservatives in the South, editing one of the region's most right-wing magazines, Southern Partisan Quarterly Review. Where Mr. McCain has alternately criticized and sympathized with arguments for displaying the Confederate battle flag, Mr. Quinn has helped lead the fight to keep the flag flying over the South Carolina Capitol. 
 Mr. Quinn's political consulting firm, Richard Quinn Associates, has worked for such candidates as Ronald Reagan, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Pat Robertson. At the moment, however, the company is best known for its work supporting the display of the flag in the face of an economic boycott by the N.A.A.C.P. Several state legislators say the company has conducted private polls that show the flag is widely popular in Republican areas, which have persuaded many lawmakers to keep it flying.
One of Mr. Quinn's longtime associates at the magazine, Christopher M. Sullivan, is also the co-chairman of the South Carolina Heritage Coalition, which organized a large pro-flag rally on the statehouse steps last month. Mr. Sullivan's coalition recently began running television advertisements urging voters and legislators to stand up to liberals who are trying to remove the flag. Mr. Quinn's son, Rick Quinn, is majority leader of the South Carolina House of Representatives, where he has been in the forefront of the effort to keep the flag flying.
"Richard Quinn is a key person in the pro-flag movement in South Carolina," said Dwight James, executive director of the South Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "He and his son have disseminated a great deal of misinformation to keep that flag flying."
Mr. Quinn, in fact, is such a polarizing figure around South Carolina that he has stayed in the background to avoid obscuring his client with a long-running Southern debate. He said today that he would not discuss his position on the flag or as editor-in-chief of the Southern Partisan, which he has led since 1984. In a statement, he disavowed some of the more inflammatory articles it has published.
"I am not the working day-to-day editor of Southern Partisan," he said. "My title as editor in chief is purely honorary. Frankly, I do not personally read the articles before they are printed, and I certainly disagree with many of the opinions expressed by others on the pages of the magazine."
The McCain campaign also issued a statement, saying that Mr. Quinn was a "highly respected South Carolina campaign consultant" who had worked for a variety of Republicans, including some now supporting Mr. McCain's chief rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
A look at some of the articles in Southern Partisan shows why it has become the nation's leading journal of the so-called neo-confederacy movement, publishing scholarly treatises, political interviews and commentary that glorify the Southern traditions underlying the secession movement.
In issue after issue, writers in Southern Partisan vilify Abraham Lincoln and other Union leaders, and venerate the rebel soldiers who fought to secede from the United States. The quarterly regularly takes the position that the Civil War was fought not over slavery, but over the preservation of a Southern way of life that to this day is worth preserving.
The magazine rarely writes about slavery, but when it does, its positions are usually not those of mainstream historians. A review of a book on the slave trade in a 1998 issue, for example, includes this passage: "Mainstream black leaders perpetuate the myth that vicious white slave traders dragged Africans from their idyllic homeland to serve as chattel for arrogant white Americans. Readers of this magazine know otherwise." The review goes on to say that white slave traders were often less brutal than the African warlords who traded their subjects for livestock and herbs.
The magazine also weighs in on more contemporary topics. One issue last year criticized The Miami Herald for publishing a special section devoted to news about gays. "Who knows, maybe Miami will someday be an exclusively gay city," the article said.
Many of the articles, however, are more high-minded historical reviews in the tradition of the Southern agrarian movement, which glorified the South's slow-paced traditions of farms and small towns.
"It goes back to Jefferson's ideal of the yeoman farmer," said Dr. Blease Graham, an authority on Southern history and politics at the University of South Carolina. "They venerate the idea of a lost way of life, the intrusion of the fast-food chains and industrialization on the sense of place in the South. Of course, the grand old days for Southern aristocrats were grim days for African-American slaves, and there's no way that can be reconciled."
Dr. Graham, who knows Mr. Quinn, says the consultant does not hold racist ideas.
"He is actually a thoughtful intellectual with a square head on his shoulders," said Dr. Graham, dean of the university's College of Criminal Justice. "But he has that states'-rights, pro-Southern point of view that some people find disagreeable."
Mr. Quinn, who often finds himself working for candidates opposed by the state's Republican establishment, has rarely been accused of any kind of personal racism. But several black politicians around the state have said that his association with Mr. McCain could diminish the chances that blacks will support Mr. McCain if they vote in the Republican primary on Feb. 19, which is open to all voters.
"If people realize who McCain is associating with, it could hurt him," said state Representative Todd Rutherford, a Democrat from Columbia. "He's lining himself up with positions that offend people."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Turns Focus to Plans to Ease Upstate Economic Troubles

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y., Feb. 7

 BODY:
With her official declaration for the United States Senate behind her, Hillary Rodham Clinton flew into a region of New York today that is likely to be a prime battleground in the race this fall, turning her attention to what has long been a dominant concern among voters here: the region's long-suffering economy.
With President Clinton back in Washington, the first lady moved to settle into life as just another candidate running for public office. She gave the first of what aides said would be five speeches between today and Friday, this one offering measures to spur economic growth here, including about $550 million worth of tax incentives and grants to encourage Internet development. She granted three one-on-one interviews with reporters, a notable break with her more cloistered first seven months of traveling the state. She visited a part of New York where Democratic candidates for office always campaign. 
 But she was also trailed by a presidential-size press corps and Secret Service brigade that served as a reminder of just how complicated it is going to be for Mrs. Clinton to be just another candidate running for public office. The most routine of political rituals -- the official airport greeting by local politicians -- turned into a shoulder-to-shoulder commotion as local Democratic officeholders competed for space with television crews from Washington and Secret Service agents trying to maintain security as they waited for Mrs. Clinton's Air Force jet to emerge from the low clouds.
Mrs. Clinton walked into the terminal and climbed onto a marble ledge, where she declared her affinity for this part of New York. "I did grow up on the Great Lakes," she said, referring to Chicago. "I have spent time in western New York. I listened in western New York."
In her policy speech, delivered at a job training center here, Mrs. Clinton laid out what will be one of the major themes of her campaign against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, noting the economic decline of upstate New York and advocating -- in sometimes dry fashion -- a package of programs intended to help the nation, in general, and the region in particular. Her aides said her total program would cost $550 million a year.
Among other things, she called for creation of tax-exempt bonds that would be issued by the federal government to finance creation of lines for high-speed Internet access. She also endorsed grants to pay for creation of broad-band networks in urban and poor rural areas, again to provide the high-speed Internet access that she asserted was key to the upstate economic revival.
"If upstate New York State were an independent state, it would consistently rank in the bottom-fifth of job growth," she said.
Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on measures to, in effect, transform the economy here -- from its traditional if now faltering manufacturing base to one geared to the Internet -- came in addition to a more typical prescription for the region's problems. Like other candidates for statewide office, notably Charles E. Schumer, who was elected to the Senate in 1998, Mrs. Clinton said she would push efforts under way in Washington to deregulate utilities as a way to try to reduce electric costs.
And like other candidates running for Senate, Mrs. Clinton complained that New York taxpayers were sending more money to Washington than they were getting back. She said the historical justification for this, that New York was more prosperous than the rest of he nation, was no longer so.
"Today, New York has the largest gap between the rich and the poor of any state in the United States," she said. "Therefore, it is time for our friends in the rest of the country to return the favor, to change the way business is done in Washington, to give New York its fair share."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat Mrs. Clinton is running to replace, has issued an annual report keeping track of that disparity. To date, though, no New York senator has had much luck in changing that formula.
In one of the three interviews she did today, with The Associated Press, Mrs. Clinton said she would all but set a litmus test for how she would vote on judges for federal courts. "I can't imagine that I would vote to confirm" someone who opposes abortion rights, she said.
 
Political Attack for a Song
Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign says it was intended to serve just as an innocuous bit of background music. But a 27-year-old Billy Joel song played before she announced her candidacy for the United States Senate on Sunday inspired an extended attack yesterday from her opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
A Billy Joel greatest hits album played for the audience at the campaign event in Purchase, N.Y., included Mr. Joel's 1973 song "Captain Jack," which tells the tale of a frustrated young man who spends a Saturday night listening to music, smoking marijuana and masturbating. "Captain Jack will get you high tonight and take you to your special island," Mr. Joel sings.
Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said the first lady and her campaign staff did not pick the song, which he agreed should not have been played. He said a sound technician chose the song. But Mr. Giuliani said there was no acceptable excuse for the slip-up.
"Everything was written out, everything was planned, and the whole purpose of it was to reinvent Mrs. Clinton," the mayor said of the opening event of Mrs. Clinton's campaign. "And the message that got out, and they say by mistake -- and sometimes, if you read Freud, that can be the most powerful message -- the message that got out by mistake is 'Let's say yes to drugs.' "
Mr. Wolfson said the mayor should be focusing on the issues raised in Mrs. Clinton's speech, like the need for accessible health care and better education.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON'S BUDGET STRESSES SURPLUS AND HAVING IT ALL

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton today sent Congress a budget built on the idea that the burgeoning surplus will allow the nation to have it all, from increased spending to tax cuts and big reductions in the national debt.
The president's budget, his eighth and last, calls for additional spending on issues that have long been central to his agenda, including health care, education and the environment as well as increases for the military. 
 At the same time, it stresses fiscal responsibility and maps a path to eliminate the portion of the national debt held by the public over the next 13 years. And it tries to define the size of the surplus in a way that builds Mr. Clinton's priorities into the budget mix for the next decade and leaves Republicans relatively little room to pursue sweeping tax cuts.
Republicans today declared the budget a nonstarter, although they agreed there was a chance that some provisions, like adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, could be enacted this year.
There is no argument between the parties that projected surpluses, assuming they materialize, present the nation with tremendous opportunities, including a chance to pay down the debt and ensure Social Security's long-term solvency.
But today's exchanges illustrated the continuing deadlock over how to apportion the surplus. Republicans have generally emphasized tax cuts; Democrats have usually called for maintaining or increasing spending, and each has labeled the other's approach a threat to debt repayment and to Social Security.
Mr. Clinton's blueprint is unlikely to break that impasse, and the debate this year is raging not just on Capitol Hill but on the campaign trail, where there are stark divisions within and between the parties.
The budget calls for spending in 2001 of nearly $1.84 trillion, including an increase of 3.9 percent in spending on the third of the budget that covers basic government operations like the military, national parks, education and law enforcement.
That increase, and proposed growth in this discretionary spending of about 2.5 percent a year for the rest of the decade, would, at least by the White House's accounting, cover the costs of initiatives laid out by Mr. Clinton over the past few months. The proposals range from an expansion of scientific research to new training for pre-school teachers.
"It is a balanced budget with a balanced approach to our national priorities," Mr. Cliton said. "It maintains our fiscal discipline, pays down the debt, extends the life of Social Security and Medicare, and invests in our families and our future."
It is also an election year platform, full of programs that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democratic candidates can use to defend themselves, attack their opponents and illustrate their stands on issues.
The programs include aid for hard-pressed farmers and manufacturers, initiatives to enforce gun laws and to fight wage discrimination against women, additional spending on AIDS and biomedical research, and expansions of efforts to reduce child poverty and make health care more accessible and affordable.
"What you have in this budget is an opportunity for politicians to just go out and tell every single group who has any kind of an interest at all, 'Oh, we're taking care of you,' " said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. "That's not leadership. It's all things for all people."
In addition to bipartisan support for adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, there is general agreement on using the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security, estimated by the administration at $2.2 trillion over the next decade, to reduce the portion of the debt, now $3.6 trillion, held by investors in the form of Treasury bonds.
But Republicans derided the administration's overall proposal as a tax-and-spend manifesto that they would discard as they drafted their own tax and spending bills.
"The president's budget is a paradox," said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
"How can we pay down the debt with a budget that substantially expands the size and scope of the federal government?" Mr. Hastert said. "How can we address the issue of tax fairness, when his budget does not substantially ease the marriage tax penalty? How can the era of big government be over when his budget would create close to $350 billion in new government programs?"
The first battle will be over the size of the surplus.
Surplus projections vary based on assumptions about spending, economic growth and other factors. The Congressional Budget Office laid out three estimates last month of the non-Social Security surplus, ranging from $838 billion to $1.9 trillion.
Mr. Clinton's budget said the surplus outside of Social Security would be $746 billion over 10 years, with most of it being generated after 2005.
In its calculations, the White House assumed that discretionary spending over 10 years would grow at slightly less than the rate of inflation. To assume any less growth in spending over that period would be unrealistic and would risk a nasty fiscal surprise down the road, White House officials said. They noted that even Republican-led Congresses have routinely increased spending at a pace above the inflation rate. "Where we start this year has everything to do with where we end up," said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. "If you start with realistic, honest numbers and make the tough decisions within that framework, we can get to paying off the debt by 2013."
Republicans in Congress have not yet settled on a surplus estimate, but they made clear today that whatever number they did use would assume substantially less spending than Mr. Clinton's budget and would therefore be considerably larger than the administration's surplus projection.
They said the surplus should not be committed to spending increases, that many programs can be trimmed and that the surplus should be calculated to maximize the amount available for tax cuts.
Should Mr. Clinton's surplus figure be adopted, it would severely limit the ability of Republicans to pursue their tax-cutting agenda, and it would make the tax cut being offered by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his run for the Republican presidential nomination look excessive. Mr. Bush's plan is estimated to cost at least $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
Republicans were largely silent today on one of the major changes contained in the Clinton budget: its abandonment of the strict spending limits set by the 1997 bipartisan balanced budget act. The caps would have required deep spending cuts in each of the next two years, and although the two parties have found ways around them, killing them completely would once have been politically treacherous for Republicans and Democrats alike.
With deficits but a memory and surpluses piling up, neither party seems inclined to make an issue of the spending caps, and Congress seems likely to change the legislation this year. Administration officials said efforts to keep spending growth below the inflation rate and use the Social Security surplus for debt reduction, should serve as the standard for fiscal discipline.
Mr. Clinton's budget puts a heavy emphasis on shoring up and expanding Medicare, the system of health insurance for the elderly. It would designate $299 billion out of the 10-year surplus projection of $746 billion to go to extending the system's solvency from 2015 under current projections to 2025.
It would also create a $168 billion program over a decade to help retirees pay for prescription drugs, which have become a burden for many older people. Mr. Clinton also designated another $35 billion over a decade to help beneficiaries who face drug bills stemming from a catastrophic illness.
Under pressure from Republicans, Mr. Clinton called for $350 billion in tax cuts, mostly for low-income and middle-income people. But he would offset a portion of the reductions by closing what officials said were $96 billion of corporate tax loopholes -- a step that Republicans and many industry groups said was unfair.
Mr. Clinton's tax proposals include $45 billion over 10 years to reduce the marriage penalty. Republicans in Congress are pressing for marriage penalty relief this year and are pushing for a much bigger package. The House will take up a marriage penalty bill this week worth $182 billion in tax reductions over 10 years.
Many of the initiatives have Mr. Gore's stamp on them. They include a plan to provide more money to towns and cities that lose manufacturing jobs to foreign competition, the proposal to create catastrophic drug coverage within Medicare and a plan to create a national licensing system for handgun owners.
Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton's proposal "makes my point that surpluses will be spent if we don't have a leader who's willing to cut taxes." Mr. Bush's rival for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has criticized Mr. Bush's tax plan as too big, said he welcomed Mr. Clinton's emphasis on debt reduction and Social Security, but added that he was "concerned about all the new spending programs that he is proposing here."

HEADLINE: Croatia Elects a Moderate To Follow the Tudjman Era

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Tuesday, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A jocular former leader of the old Yugoslavia was elected on Monday as president, succeeding Franjo Tudjman, who died in December.
The winner, Stipe Mesic, 65, last leader of the collective presidency before Yugoslavia disintegrated in 1991, earned the trust of Croats for his easy manner, his apparent disregard for pretension and his critical attitude toward Croatian nationalism, in sharp contrast to Mr. Tudjman. 
 A happy Mr. Mesic told a cheering crowd at his campaign headquarters that he would concentrate on taking Croatia into the European Union and NATO "as quickly as possible."
His opponent, Drazen Budisa, 51, a former dissident, conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed and early results showed Mr. Mesic with a large lead.
"I think the moment has come for me to congratulate Mr. Mesic on his victory and to wish him a lot of success in carrying out the presidential duties," Mr. Budisa said.
With 99 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Mesic had 56.2 percent to Mr. Budisa's 43.8, the State Electoral Commission announced early today. The turnout was 61.5 percent of the 4.2 million voters.
In the first round of the election, on Jan. 24, Mr. Mesic received 41.6 percent of the vote in a nine-party field, and Mr. Budisa had 28.
Both men are pro-Western and relatively liberal, favoring membership in the European Union and NATO, and both are part of the six-party opposition coalition that won parliamentary elections a month ago, defeating Mr. Tudjman's once-dominant Croatian Democratic Union.
American and European officials had said that they would be pleased if either man won, especially after the strained and contentious relationship they had with Mr. Tudjman.
The election both ends and starts an extraordinary period of change here, a period that Washington hopes will be a model for neighboring Serbia, run by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
Beginning with Mr. Tudjman's lingering illness and death last year, the Croatian Democratic Union that he founded and that led the state since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 has been swept out of all the major government institutions by democratic means.
With a serious democratic alternative presented by a largely united six-party opposition coalition, Croats voted in big numbers to turn their backs on their fiercely nationalist past, its tenor and repressions founded in the Yugoslav civil wars.
With Mr. Tudjman's party tainted with charges of corruption and the economy deeply troubled by unemployment and unpaid wages and pensions, the opposition won a large victory in parliamentary elections on Jan. 3.
Prime Minister Ivica Racan took office on Jan. 27 and has already moved to soften nationalist policies, free up the media, support democratic and human rights, and promote economic discipline and sacrifice.
In the first round of presidential voting, even the relatively moderate candidate of the Croatian Democratic Union, Mate Granic, finished in a poor third place, failing to qualify for the runoff.
The party, known by its initials of H.D.Z., is wounded and is likely to split. In an interview last week, Mr. Racan said he feared that the rapid collapse of Mr. Tudjman's party was risky, because that would weaken the opposition that all governments need.
"In a way, the H.D.Z. is falling apart too soon for the democratic life of the country," Mr. Racan said.
He said he wanted his main coalition partner, Mr. Budisa, to win, and described Mr. Mesic's appeal as "populism with a smiling face." But Mr. Racan said that both men were democrats and that he could work well with either.
The real turning point was the opposition's victory in the parliamentary vote. Both Mr. Mesic and Mr. Budisa have promised to work to cut back the powers of the imperial presidency that Mr. Tudjman built for himself and to make Croatia a parliamentary democracy.
Still, both men want the president to retain the position of commander in chief and to have an important, if still vague, role in foreign policy and national security. Part of the campaign debate focused on whether Mr. Budisa or Mr. Mesic were harboring secret ambitions or agendas and which one might work more easily with Mr. Racan.
Mr. Mesic is less nationalist than Mr. Budisa, and he has explicitly warned Bosnian Croats that they have to learn to live in Bosnia and not look to Zagreb for financial and military support. By doing so, Mr. Mesic ensured the opposition of H.D.Z. voters, who are especially strong in Bosnia, where ethnic Croats can vote in elections here. Mr. Mesic and Mr. Racan want to stop that, too.
Mr. Mesic's aides were particularly concerned about the possibility of widespread vote fraud in Bosnia organized by the H.D.Z. and its Bosnian allies. But voting went smoothly there, officials said, especially after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had criticized fraud in the first round and had asked the Croatian state electoral commission to replace its observers.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Bush and McCain Vie on Truth

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:

The airwaves are getting uglier in South Carolina. On Friday, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas introduced a sharply worded 30-second spot that attacks his principal opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for what Mr. Bush says were distorted statements about his tax-cut plan in an earlier advertisement by the McCain campaign.
Yesterday, in response, Mr. McCain began broadcasting a 30-second commercial that attacks Mr. Bush for having attacked Mr. McCain. Its tag line contains the toughest language of any advertisement by any major candidate so far this year: "Do we really want another politician in the White House America can't trust?" 

THE BUSH COMMERCIAL
PRODUCER Maverick Media
ON THE SCREEN Heavy use of graphics. Narrators' words are highlighted in red, white and blue.
VOICEOVER "John McCain's ad about Governor Bush's tax plan isn't true, and McCain knows it. McCain's economic adviser says he'd support Bush's tax plan: Two trillion to protect Social Security, pay down debt, and a real tax cut. McCain's plan? A tax cut smaller than Clinton's -- and not a penny in tax cuts for 30 million Americans. On taxes, McCain echoes Washington Democrats, when we need a conservative leader to challenge them. Governor Bush. Proven. Tested. Ready to lead America."
 
McCAIN RESPONSE COMMERCIAL
PRODUCER Stevens Reed Curcio & Company
ON THE SCREEN Photos of the events described.
VOICEOVER "This is George Bush's ad promising America he'd run a positive campaign. This is George Bush shaking hands with John McCain, promising not to run a negative campaign. This is George Bush's new negative ad attacking John McCain and distorting his position. Do we really want another politician in the White House America can't trust?"
 
ACCURACY What started this video set-to was a McCain advertisement, titled "Every Dime," that ran in New Hampshire and later in South Carolina. In it, Mr. McCain says that "the one big difference between me and the others" is that "I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy."
The Bush and McCain campaigns have offered dueling tax-cut proposals. Mr. Bush's plan is for $483 billion in cuts over five years; Mr. McCain's amounts to less than half that. Mr. McCain has criticized Mr. Bush's plan as not reserving, as he says his does, money to protect Social Security. Mr. Bush's spot, however, never explains what is not truthful about Mr. McCain's original commercial. And his assertion that Mr. McCain's economic adviser, Vin Weber, actually supports Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal has been condemned by Mr. Weber as the act of "a desperate campaign."
Mr. McCain's new commercial cites Mr. Bush's promising to run a positive campaign. This falls into the "eye of the beholder" category. Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain did shake hands and repeatedly vow not to attack each other. Each side is now portraying the other as the deal-breaker.
 
SCORECARD An object lesson in how sunshine gives way to darkness quickly in a presidential campaign. The peevish tone in Mr. Bush's commercial is a decided departure from the glossy, statesmanlike sheen of his previous spots, a reflection of his announced desire to refocus his strategy in the aftermath of his poor New Hampshire showing. A subtly key phrase in Mr. Bush's advertisement is "and McCain knows it." It is a shorthand suggestion that Mr. McCain is not the reform-minded idealist he tries to project.
The bottom line in both spots is the suggestion that "going negative" in a campaign is not simply a tactic, it is a moral flaw. Mr. McCain's reply spot raises the ante, throwing the increasingly frequently used insult of the 2000 campaign -- My opponent is just like President Clinton -- back in Mr. Bush's face. And its concluding thought about untrustworthiness seems to send this race to the realm of personal attack. PETER MARKS

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: PENTAGON SPENDING;
Chief Themes of Military Budget: Modernizing and Troop Welfare

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The $291.1 billion Pentagon budget proposed by the Clinton administration today not only reflects peacetime concerns about improving the lives of those who serve but also looks ahead to the challenges of a national antimissile defense and quick-and-dirty regional combat.
The budget, for the fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1, calls for a 3.7 percent increase in military pay on top of last year's increase, which brought the troops their first raise after inflation since the end of the cold war. 
 New in the budget proposal is an increase in the housing allowances paid to all service members who live off base. The Defense Department would increase those allowances by $3 billion over the next five years, meaning that at the end of that period, personnel living off base would no longer have any out-of-pocket housing expenses. The Pentagon would also push ahead programs to improve on-base housing.
While the budget would add $369 million next year to the Pentagon's medical care program, top officials of the department have yet to agree on a plan providing health care coverage to retirees. Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has failed to persuade Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to approve a new $3-billion-a-year program to cover retirees' health care costs, even though both men consider such coverage an obligation of the military.
"All of the options we've looked at are quite expensive," Mr. Cohen said in presenting the budget today.
The military's Kosovo campaign, which brought $2 billion in emergency costs, revealed shortcomings in the services' war-fighting abilities and helped shape the new budget, with its accent on modern weaponry.
In particular, this budget finds the Army, which had serious difficulties deploying its Apache helicopters to Albania, unveiling dramatic changes for the sake of modernization. To make its forces more mobile, the Army has cut by half the financing for its fledgling Crusader artillery system until officials are convinced that it can be built light enough for quick deployment.
In addition, the Army has scrapped plans to build two new vehicles, the Wolverine and the Grizzley, which among other uses would have cleared minefields and knocked down bridges. Instead, the service will spend $14.5 billion to create new weaponry, particularly a mobile, lightweight armored vehicle that could be used for combat in small-scale conflicts as well as major wars.
The Navy has also reordered its budget, to spend more than $3 billion on development of a new destroyer powered by electric motor, a ship that Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig has said will become a model for the future fleet.
As for the Air Force, it had expected approval of all its plans to build new fighter jets, given the successful air campaign in Kosovo. Instead, Congress last year scaled back production of the F-22 fighter for the current fiscal year, in protest of the plane's escalating costs. Now the Air Force proposes to put the F-22 back on schedule by spending $4 billion on the program next year, with plans to buy as many as 36 planes a year by 2004.
In all, the amount sought to develop various new weapons systems for the military as a whole is $60 billion. The budget also calls for $1.9 billion to be spent on a national antimissile defense system should President Clinton decide to build one, to protect the nation from limited nuclear attack.
The two leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona, have both argued that military spending is too low. But for the current fiscal year, spending rose by $17 billion, a figure that amounted to the end of the so-called peace dividend, which had brought nearly 10 years of shrinking armed forces and military budgets. The budget proposed today is $13.5 billion more than the current year's.
All those figures are in requested budget authority. The administration's estimate of actual Pentagon outlays in the next fiscal year is $279 billion. When committed contract costs for long-term procurement programs are added, however, the figure rises to the $291.1 billion in the budget proposal that Secretary Cohen presented today.

HEADLINE: Pitching Democrats' Cause, Rangel Advances His Own

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
There is a jingle to Representative Charles B. Rangel's step now, a little like the ka-ching of a cash register swallowing up dollar bills.
"They throw it at me," Mr. Rangel said, only half-kidding, about the money he is collecting to win back control of the House for the Democrats. 
 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is in charge of raising money and spending it strategically to win this year's crucial House races, is awash in money. In a remarkable turnaround, the group had $19.8 million as of Dec. 31, more than double the amount of cash in the bank that its Republican counterpart in the House had. And, in a year of staggering war chests, it has socked away more money than any other party committee, Republican or Democrat.
Few Democratic members have helped raise more cash this year than Mr. Rangel, the 15-term congressman from Harlem with the gravelly voice, wry sense of humor and a bygone aversion to campaign fund-raising. And few members stand to benefit as directly from a Democratic victory as Mr. Rangel, who is now the senior member of the New York Congressional delegation and would become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which shapes tax, Social Security and Medicare policy.
In a field cluttered with money-raising schemes, Mr. Rangel, 69, has tapped into a novel fund-raising combination. He has by turns reached out to old money -- from traditional Democratic sources in the business world -- and new money, much of it from a burgeoning group of wealthy African-Americans.
"It's new money," Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic House campaign committee, said about the $2.5 million that Mr. Rangel raised last year. "There is a term called 'hitting a new vein.' And that's what he's been doing."
The House Republican fund-raising arm brought in more money than the Democrats last year -- $51 million to the Democrats' $33.4 million -- but spent all but $8.3 million, leaving the Democrats with a significant advantage as the election year began. Democratic leaders said some of the donations came from donors who traditionally give only to Republicans, perhaps hedging their bets on the possibility that Democrats could regain control of the House in November.
Mr. Rangel's pitch is straightforward, more blunt than suave. And it inevitably focuses on his possible ascendancy to the tax-writing committee's chairmanship.
"What Charlie is selling is one of the most powerful positions in the Congress, if not the government," said Robert Johnson, the chairman of Black Entertainment Television Holdings, who is a contributor.
In his pitches to African-American business leaders, who historically have not focused their giving on House races, Mr. Rangel asks them to picture a House where black lawmakers would hold unprecedented sway: himself at the helm of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and 19 other black members in control of various subcommittees.
Chief executives, who relish a tax cut of any size and usually donate more money to Republicans, are often reeled in when Mr. Rangel asks a hypothetical question: What if? And it has been effective. More Republicans are sending money the Democrats' way.
In just the last few months, Mr. Rangel said he had sat down with a few unnamed, rich corporate heads in luxurious private clubs, simply because they wanted to get to know him better.
"With the black community, he relies on a combination of pride and power," Mr. Johnson said. "And in the white community, he says, 'Don't you want to hedge your bet on who will be chairman?' People are putting safe money in his hands and pride money in his hands."
Mr. Rangel is so popular in his district -- New York's 15th, which includes all of Harlem and some of the Upper West Side -- that he has seldom had to raise money for his own elections and none of the current $19.8 million is for himself. He is also involved in a get-out-the-vote plan hatched by Bill Lynch, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, that proved successful in the 1998 elections. He travels to swing districts where black voters can make a difference and asks them to turn out on Election Day, in much the same way the Christian right does with its supporters.
But his cross-country fund-raising trips have served another purpose: to build a national reputation for a man who is headed into his 30th year in Congress. While Mr. Rangel has been a household name in New York, his name does not always ring a bell elsewhere. He is a liberal and a partisan Democrat, and is rightly perceived that way, but he also is letting people see a third side: that of the pragmatist, with a rapier wit, who can juggle the concerns of the poor with the interests of the rich.
"A lot of people didn't know him in the business community," said Representative Martin Frost, a Texas Democrat and former campaign committee chairman. "They have certain preconceptions about a congressman from Harlem, but when they meet him and talk to him, they are blown away."
Some in the business world, however, are not as keen about Mr. Rangel's becoming the Ways and Means chairman, and they are actively working for Republicans to prevent it. They offer the same pitch to their constituents that Mr. Rangel does to his: Imagine this congressman as chairman.
"It would be an unmitigated disaster," said Brian Reardon, who handles federal public policy for the National Federation of Independent Business. "He doesn't support small business and he never met a tax he didn't like."
Mr. Rangel says nobody ever complains to him. But why would they, he adds. He shrugs it off by pointing to the political friends he has among New York's banking, Wall Street and real estate moguls.
"I think my chairmanship would shatter the vestiges of racism overnight," Mr. Rangel said. "There are people that absolutely become colorblind when they got a problem."
"They have no idea how much I want to preserve the economy and make it grow," Mr. Rangel added. "What good is civil rights during a depression? What good is a decent education if you have no jobs? Why would you fight against drug addiction if you were not providing hope on the other hand?"
Sanford I. Weill, the chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, says Mr. Rangel does not give business concerns short shrift.
"When you have an issue, he's somebody you can talk to," Mr. Weill said. "And if what you're saying makes sense, he's supportive."
Charles Bernard Rangel was born on June 11, 1930, to a Harlem factory seamstress and a father he barely knew. A high school dropout, he eventually joined the Army and fought in the Korean War, where he rescued 40 men from behind enemy lines. He was decorated with the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star.
In 1995, when the Democrats lost control of the House, Mr. Rangel, who was once considered the least ideological black member, proclaimed a new era for himself as an "oratorical bomb-thrower." He was angry at the Democratic leadership and angry at President Clinton. And he bemoaned the turn the nation was taking with welfare.
Mr. Rangel still says he is fiery, but much of that is simply his role as an agent provocateur in the minority. He enjoys needling the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, whom he sometimes compares to Dreyfus, Inspector Clouseau's sputtering, foiled-again superior. He also once likened Mr. Archer to Hitler, something the chairman did not forget.
"I guess you would call it strong humor," said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a conservative Florida Republican on the committee who is friendly with Mr. Rangel. "Some may call it ruthless humor."
Mr. Rangel staunchly defended Mr. Clinton in the impeachment proceedings, saying Republicans were more guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors than the president when they failed to support Mr. Clinton's decision to bomb Iraqi military sites in December 1998.
Mr. Rangel's colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee say Mr. Archer has made his mark in the last few years, helping to keep his party unified in committee and reaching out to more conservative Democrats. Despite his run-ins with Mr. Archer, Mr. Rangel sometimes works closely with other Republicans, including Mr. Shaw.
In a recent speech before the National Federation of Retailers in New York City, Mr. Rangel struck a chord that is seldom heard on Capitol Hill.
"The truth of the matter is, if you're talking about Medicare and you're talking about Social Security and a real large tax bill, the Democrats cannot have this and neither can the Republicans unless we work together," he said. "This is not a spirit of bipartisanship. This is a spirit of common sense."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK;
A Rested Gore Goes After Hard-Hat and High-Hat Votes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
After a two-day respite from the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore stepped up his New York campaign in earnest yesterday, paying homage to the labor unions he is counting on to mobilize for him in the March 7 primary and spending the evening courting arts patrons at Lincoln Center.
On stage at Avery Fisher Hall last night, Mr. Gore narrated Aaron Copland's 1942 classic, "Lincoln Portrait," accompanied by the American Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Leon Botstein. 
 The platform would be the envy of any politician, with the chance to read Lincoln's immortal words, including the Gettysburg Address, with rolling timpani and rising horns.
"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history," Mr. Gore read in an inadvertent reminder of President Clinton's travails that sent a ripple through the audience, "We in this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves."
Mr. Gore spoke for about eight minutes, applauded the conductor and gave a slight bow to the orchestra, drawing a standing ovation.
His performance at the concert, a benefit for seven charities in New York, followed a day of supplications to organized labor and a renewed attack on Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
In recognition of Mr. Bradley's popularity here from his days as a star basketball player and a senator from New Jersey, Mr. Gore took on his proposals, particularly on health care, education and the budget surplus, saying they would be bad for New York.
New York is seen as Mr. Bradley's best hope for a breakthrough after his losses to the vice president in Iowa and New Hampshire, and Mr. Gore made it clear yesterday that he was not going to give Mr. Bradley an inch of breathing room. His line of attack was tailor-made for hard-core Democrats in New York, playing on party loyalty and the economic success of the Clinton administration.
"I want to describe to you one of the big differences between myself and my opponent in the Democratic primary," Mr. Gore told about 1,000 people in Lower Manhattan at the headquarters of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
"I don't believe that you can run for the Democratic nomination by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic Party over the past seven years," he said, "because in fact our policies have been good for this country."
Asked later if he would campaign in New York with President Clinton, Mr. Gore said, "I've got to win this race on my own, and I'm campaigning on my own vision."
Asked if he would campaign with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, Mr. Gore said: "It's a matter of scheduling, not just me, but also her. I hope so. But that's yet to be worked out."
While Mr. Gore was courting New York Democrats, Mr. Bradley appeared in Tampa, Fla., and took aim at the Republican governor, Jeb Bush, who signed an executive order last year ending affirmation action in the state. Mr. Bradley has long been a staunch defender of affirmative action, as has Mr. Gore. But by choosing to attack Mr. Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, he gave notice that he was prepared to take on any elected official or presidential candidate or relative of a presidential candidate in his uphill fight for the nomination.
"I think that he has demonstrated a lack of vision and leadership by repealing affirmative action in the state of Florida," Mr. Bradley said of Jeb Bush at a raucously supportive town hall meeting here.
Mr. Bradley's brief appearance in Florida, whose primary is March 14, was the second in two days focusing on race relations. On Sunday, he visited a large black church in Queens, and on Tuesday he will appear in South Carolina to criticize the Confederate battle flag's presence over the State Capitol.
In his appearance before the labor group, Mr. Gore attacked Mr. Bradley for having retired from the Senate in 1996 instead of fighting against what Mr. Gore called the Gingrich Congress. "When he retired from the Senate during President Clinton's first term, Senator Bradley spoke about what he called a budget stalemate and a process that was, in his words, paralyzed, a continual deadlock," Mr. Gore said. "And so he decided to leave. But he was wrong. We broke that deadlock."
He added: "If Senator Bradley could not foresee the progress that we made when we decided to stay and fight against the Gingrich Republicans, what else does he not see now? How can he be counted on to see what is right for working families today?"
Mr. Gore's remarks seemed to turn the tables on a question Mr. Bradley has been asking about Mr. Gore, whom he has accused of waging a campaign of distortions and falsehoods. If Mr. Gore cannot tell the truth as a candidate, Mr. Bradley has been asking audiences, how can the nation expect him to tell the truth as president? And now Mr. Gore is asking about Mr. Bradley: If he did not fight the good fight a few years ago, how can the nation expect him to fight as president?
Mr. Gore also said that Mr. Bradley's health-care proposal would "eliminate Medicaid for more than three million New Yorkers who depend on it, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, the elderly, in nursing homes," substituting vouchers or subsidies of $150 a month. "See if you can find a health-care plan in New York for $150 a month that pays your prescription drug benefits as Medicaid does, that pays the kind of benefits that Medicaid pays," he said.
Union members account for 30 percent to 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote in New York, much higher than they figured in Iowa and New Hampshire, and they drew most of Mr. Gore's attention yesterday. He began with an appearance via satellite at the United Food and Commercial Workers meeting in Naples, Fla., then met at his hotel with about 65 labor leaders from across New York State.
He later went to a construction site at 63rd Street and West End Avenue, shaking hands with carpenters and masons.

HEADLINE: Internet Company Plans a Queens Center With 450 Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Queens gained a new share of the high-tech job expansion under way in New York City as Psinet, an Internet service provider, announced yesterday that it would open a $250 million sales and service center in Long Island City that would create 450 new jobs.
"We could have put it anywhere, including the desert," said Psinet's founder and chairman, William L. Schrader, who made the announcement alongside Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Borough President Claire Shulman. "But the best place in the world is right here." 
 Psinet, of Herndon, Va., provides corporate customers with high-speed access to the Internet. It is also a "Web hosting center" where clients as diverse as the Franklin Mint and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration can base their large and heavily used Internet sites. Its Web site is www.psinet.com/.
The 300,000-square-foot complex, slated to open by the summer of 2001 at an undisclosed location in Long Island City, will also be the hub for a new trans-Atlantic link providing direct, high-speed connections between New York, London and Paris, company officials said.
The city is offering Psinet the equivalent of $60 million worth of incentives over the next 15 years, including a $1,000-a-year corporate income-tax credit for each new employee and a partial exemption on real-estate taxes on its building, city officials said.
Citywide, employment in so-called new media firms has jumped from about 55,000 in 1997 to more than 100,000 today, with about 3,000 new media firms operating this year, said Michael G. Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
"This is really connecting up Queens and other parts of New York City with Silicon Alley," he said, using the nickname for Manhattan's concentration of Internet-related firms.
Mr. Giuliani took the opportunity to again praise the record job growth in the city last year, a frequent theme in his bid for the United States Senate. The mayor suggested yesterday that the Psinet announcement showed that the city's employment surge was continuing.
"Not only are these a lot of new jobs, they are high-paying jobs, good jobs and the kind of jobs that really spur on the rest of the economy," the mayor said, noting that the 2.7 percent increase in jobs in New York City last year exceeded the national average of 2.3 percent in the rest of the United States. Psinet executives said entry-level technicians would be paid $60,000, while sales executives could receive salaries and commissions up to $333,000, based on the estimate of the market.
Psinet, a NASDAQ-traded firm that employs more than 3,500 people in 26 countries, opened its first New York City Web-hosting site in October on Whitehall Street in Lower Manhattan, intending to offer service to the many Internet-related and financial firms doing business in the city. Some crucial details about the new plant are still being worked out, including a final lease. Psinet executives say they expect that the Internet economy will continue to grow.
"It's fantastic news for your new digital entrepreneurs, who will now have easy access to one of the most advanced Web-hosting facilities in the world," Mr. Schrader said.
Mrs. Shulman joked that she did not exactly understand what Psinet does, but that the benefits it would bring to her constituents were clear. "I understand the kind of salaries these people will earn," she said.

Ralph Lauren and NBC Form A Joint Multimedia Venture
NBC and its Internet affiliates will join Polo Ralph Lauren in a new media company that will promote the designer's products online and on the air. The deal, a coup for Mr. Lauren, will further blur the line between content and commerce at traditional media companies. 
 The first and foremost task of the joint venture will be to develop Polo.com, which is being billed as an upscale lifestyle destination site. Eventually, the company, RL Media, might develop magazines or even TV programming for NBC. Advertising. Page C13.
 
G.M. Promotes a Cadillac Executive
John F. Smith, charged three years ago with fixing the Cadillac division at General Motors, was named general manager of the parent company's service and parts operations. The unit, which sells G.M. and AC-Delco parts and accessories worldwide and markets the Goodwrench service brand name, has 12,000 employees. Mr. Smith, 49, presided over a redesign of the Cadillac line, but most of the new cars will not appear in showrooms for another two years. C12.
 
Yahoo Site Suffers a Service Failure
Yahoo blamed an attack by computer hackers for a service failure on its Web site, in what amounted to a rare interruption to one of the most popular Internet portals. C11.
 
Nasdaq Tops 4,300 for First Time
The Nasdaq composite index cruised to a record, as demand for technology and biotechnology stocks remained strong. But the strength in technology masked another lackluster session for most stocks. The Nasdaq closed at 4,321.77, up 77.63 points, or 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 58.01 points, to 10,905.79.

Austria Fears Fallout From Sanctions
Austrian policy makers fear that the protests and sanctions against the new government could dampen investment in their country and raise capital costs for companies already doing business there. But the consensus seems to be that the downgrading of relations by the European Union, and the recall of ambassadors by Israel and the United States, because of the inclusion of ministers from the anti-immigrant Freedom Party of Jorg Haider, will not have immediate and serious economic consequences.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Giuliani Courts Upstate Voters

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:

This is a new 30-second commercial that the Giuliani campaign began broadcasting throughout upstate New York on Thursday.
 
PRODUCER -- The Victory Group, Inc.
 
ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement opens with vistas of gold and orange fall foliage in New York State, a lone kayaker paddling on the Erie Canal, a farmer driving a tractor through a field. Then there is a succession of images of people at work: a man cleaning the propeller of a small airplane, a welder in protective suit wielding a propane torch, a doctor and nurses walking along a hospital hallway. The scene shifts to a clip of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in an office followed by a brief black and white image of him at an outdoor news conference. There are scenes of workers in New York City, including two men in hard hats at a skyscraper construction site, and finally the commercial returns to upstate images. There are seven versions of the commercial, and each ends with a shot of a geographical landmark in the region the version is aimed at.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Giuliani: "The foundation of our freedom depends on steady, good-paying jobs because jobs keep our neighborhoods strong and our families together. But when jobs aren't there and our children have to move away, it can be devastating. That's why we pulled together and got moving, by creating 360,000 new jobs, convincing major employers not to move and by cutting billions in unfair taxes."
 
ACCURACY -- The commercial conveys what Mr. Giuliani considers to be a hallmark achievement of his tenure: the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs in New York City. Critics of the mayor would argue that he should not be given credit for economic happenstance. The truth is that the Giuliani administration and the City Council deserve credit for fiscal policies, including substantial tax cuts. While Mr. Giuliani has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in tax abatements and other incentives to keep businesses from leaving New York, some of that has been criticized as corporate welfare.
 
SCORECARD -- The advertisement effectively taps into what may be the most important issue to voters in upstate New York, the still sluggish economy that has not improved as much as other areas have. Mr. Giuliani says pointedly, "When jobs aren't there and our families have to move away, it can be devastating." One opinion poll after another has shown that people throughout upstate New York are extremely frustrated because their children must look elsewhere for good jobs. Still, by pointing out how much better New York City has fared than the rest of the state, the commercial risks reigniting the resentment of the city. Also notable is the racial diversity of people portrayed in the commercial, which was lacking in some earlier Giuliani spots. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

HEADLINE: IDEAS INTO ACTION;
Regarding Customers as Business Collaborators

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS; This column about management issues appears every other week. Fred Andrews's e-mail address is frandrew@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
C.K. PRAHALAD believes a Copernican revolution is putting the consumer at the active center of the business universe. That is his vision of the Internet economy, and he isn't by himself.
Why listen to Professor Prahalad? A decade ago, he and a colleague, Gary Hamel, opened up new pathways in business thinking with a relatively simple but powerful idea. In their book "Competing for the Future" (Harvard Business School Press), they said that a business should think of itself not as boxes on an organization chart but as a collection of skills, or competences, that cut across internal boundaries. Break down those boxes, they said. 
 Most critical was that a company truly understand its "core competences" -- the skills and technology unique to it, the strengths that paid the rent and positioned the company to attack new markets. These were "the soul of the company."
That concept found a permanent place in the business vocabulary. Today, it is hard to find an enterprise of any sort that has not put considerable energy into figuring out its core competences, separating what is fundamental from what is not.
Now the Internet economy has forced a rethinking of what to look for and where to look for it, just as the astronomer Copernicus challenged the orthodoxies of 16th-century European science.
Look outward, not inward, Professor Prahalad urges. See yourself as others see you. A vital source of strength, maybe the most vital, lies in the untapped power of your customers to exploit the Internet. The flood of product information to them, the ease with which they can sort through it and the potential they have for uniting with other Internet users all combine to shift the balance of market power decisively toward the consumer, he maintains.
"We are saying that consumers are going to drive the firm," Professor Prahalad, who teaches at the University of Michigan Business School, said by telephone last week. Consumers are already doing that, he said, at Internet companies, which started up without the baggage of traditional ways of doing business.
Of course, businesses have always tried to figure out their customers. But the Internet world allows customers to take initiative, to talk back, assert preferences and flow quickly to the most responsive sellers. The new task for business is discovering how to channel that power. To succeed, Professor Prahalad said, companies will have to figure out how to experience their products as consumers experience them. They will have to understand what the customer encounters at every step, from beginning the search for a product to buying it, using it and finally disposing of it.
The professor explains how this can be done in a Harvard Business Review article, "Co-opting Customer Competence," which was written with a University of Michigan colleague, Venkatram Ramaswamy.
In their view, the product is "no more than an artifact around which customers have experiences." If so, that puts the customer firmly in the driver's seat. The company makes the product, but it cannot dictate the customer's experience.
The Internet makes it possible to reach customers in new ways, however, and management can use this tool to offer an engaging experience. Ideally that experience should offer enough choices to allow a customer to shape his own path. The goal is to draw on customers' talents, shape their expectations and encourage communities to form around the product. A company can absorb the customers' knowledge of the product and their suggestions for making it better. The customers become product developers. These efforts can be mammoth. More than 650,000 Microsoft customers tested a trial version of Windows 2000, for example.
Professors Prahalad and Ramaswamy suggest a four-part blueprint. Encourage an active dialogue (as Amazon has done with its book recommendations and reviews). Mobilize customer communities (much as customers of Cisco Systems commonly solve one another's problems). Manage customer diversity (for example, by gearing a product to various skill levels). As much as possible, personalize the customer's experience (like learning software that adapts itself to a child's ability).
With the right sites, companies can do a lot to hold onto customers. Scholars who track consumers' buying from site to site have generally found that they do not dart about seeking the lowest price. People seem to learn a site and settle in. Indeed, that tendency points up an apparent paradox: Though consumers hold the best cards, smart management, with superior offerings, can draw them into playing those cards its way.
"There are people who believe that consumers have all the power in the new economy," said Eric J. Johnson, a professor of marketing at the Columbia Business School, "that because competition is only a click away, they'll patrol for prices, or even better, have search robots patrol." That does not seem to be happening. In fact, he found that most customers who bought a book in a given month went to only one site.
"The rules change," Professor Johnson said of the Internet economy. "The results are pretty much the same."
Like it or not, consumers already collaborate with Internet companies every time they fill out an Internet form. "A basic premise of Web business is getting the customer to do the work in the form of data entry," said Thomas R. Eisenmann, who teaches e-commerce at the Harvard Business School. An airline customer can write himself an e-ticket on the Web and then check in with a machine at the airport, assuring the device that he packed his own bag.
For Web companies, the customer is already the center of the universe. At innumerable sites, the customers provide the product. At iVillage, Professor Eisenmann said, "They learned pretty quickly that the reason their audience was coming was to read and react to what other folks had to say." At other sites, the product is consumers stating their preferences in goods and services.
Professor Eisenmann agrees that the Web can powerfully amplify consumer experiences. The customers' reviews that affect business are "turbocharged" on the Web, he said. "People are in touch with one another through their computers, on e-mail and so forth, so if they had a good experience or a bad experience or an exciting experience, word is going to travel much faster. You tell more people and you tell them more quickly. It's the same phenomenon, word of mouth, but it's charged up."

HEADLINE: Sudden Explosion of Game Shows Threatens the Old TV Staples;
Costly Sitcoms and Dramas Scramble for Space and Survival

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Quite suddenly, the television landscape has turned positively Darwinian for comedies and dramas.
With the No. 1 show in the nation, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," on the ABC network three nights a week, with CBS planning a five-night-a-week reality show this summer and NBC and Fox rapidly programming game shows, the far more expensive sitcoms and dramas that have served as the staple of network television are struggling to find shelf space and, in some cases, to survive. 
 "It's a disaster: it's going to diminish the level of employment in Hollywood," said Peter Benedek, a partner at the United Talent Agency, which represents numerous television writers and directors. "There are new shows that won't get picked up and writers and directors who won't get hired on all four networks. It's simple arithmetic. The game shows and reality shows will occupy real estate previously rented to fictional entertainment programs."
Top television executives and even some highly successful producers are more optimistic, insisting that the new nonfiction shows are not only extremely lucrative for the networks but are also drawing huge audiences and lifting the ratings (notably on ABC) for comedies and dramas. For instance, "Malcolm in the Middle" on Fox is drawing a large audience.
But executives acknowledge that the face of television is changing and that it is getting harder to keep some sitcoms on the air because of the intense competition.
At ABC, at least three shows were recently canceled: "Oh Grow Up," about roommates in Brooklyn; David E. Kelley's "Snoops," about high-tech private eyes; and "It's Like, You Know," about New Yorkers living in Los Angeles. ABC executives acknowledged that while those shows had slumped in the ratings, their departures were accelerated because of limited time slots at the network.
"It's probably a fair argument to say we didn't have a level of patience with some of these shows that we might have had in years past," said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group. "We had to make some difficult decisions perhaps earlier than we would have in the past."
Mr. Braun is hardly alone among top network executives who acknowledge that television -- perhaps temporarily, perhaps fundamentally -- may be facing significant shifts because of the numerous quiz shows now on the air and shows planned in the next few months involving real people in bizarre and gimmicky situations. At the same time, the continuing popularity of news magazine programs like "Dateline NBC" and "20-20" on ABC have also limited the hours for sitcoms and dramas.
"There's no question," said Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group. "There seems to be less of an appetite for the more traditional genres, hour-scripted dramas and half-hour comedies. It's simple mathematics. It's going to put people out of work."
"There'll always be a need for scripted comedy and scripted drama," he added. "Nobody's turning their back on these genres. The bar is just higher."
Cost is a central issue in television's new dynamic.
Not only is "Millionaire" enormously popular -- it has an average audience of 28.5 million viewers and has single-handedly revived ABC -- but it is also relatively inexpensive. A typical episode of "Millionaire" costs an estimated $750,000 (unless, of course, a contestant wins $1 million). By contrast, an hourlong drama like "The Practice" or "N.Y.P.D. Blue," both on ABC, costs at least $1.2 million per episode.
At NBC, a quiz show like "Twenty-One" costs an estimated $600,000 for each episode. By contrast, successful hourlong dramas like "Providence" cost $1.5 million. And franchises like "Frasier" and "Friends" cost over $3 million an episode.
Of course, the economic downside of the game shows and reality programs is that unlike dramas and sitcoms, they cannot be repeated or sold for syndication.
At CBS a new five-night-a-week hour half-hour reality show, "Big Brother," is to begin this July. The voyeuristic show, based on a hugely successful Dutch import, centers on a group of people thrown together into a house and monitored continuously by cameras. The show costs about $200,000 an episode. By contrast, a half-hour sitcom like NBC's "Will and Grace" or CBS's "King of Queens" costs at least $600,000 an episode. In addition to "Big Brother," CBS has scheduled another summer reality show, "Survivor," which is about 16 people stranded on a jungle island near Borneo.
Les Moonves, president of CBS Television, said both reality shows, if successful, could glide into the fall schedule and reduce the number of comedies and dramas. "If 'Survivor' or 'Big Brother' becomes very successful, we will look to get them into our regular schedule if it's the best economic thing for us to do," Mr. Moonves said. "That could, potentially, take away from traditional shows."
Writers are worried that the flood of game and reality shows are usurping them. Tim O'Donnell, a board member of the Writers Guild and a sitcom writer ("Clueless," "Growing Pains") said that writers who once worried about the numerous news shows were now depressed about the reality shows.
"I used to say that the five scariest words for television writers was, 'And now, here's Stone Phillips,' " he said. "Now it's been replaced by, 'Is that your final answer?' There's no question that game shows are eating up a lot of valuable real estate that used to be occupied by half-hour comedies."
Judd Apatow, a top comedy writer who is executive producer of NBC's "Freaks and Geeks," said a new show of his, "Happy Together," about an oddball, was rejected by NBC, which did not even order a pilot episode. "You would have thought that coming off a critically acclaimed show like 'Freaks and Geeks' that this would have been a no-brainer," he said. "We'd at least get to shoot a pilot. With the quiz shows it just makes you wonder how much time will be available for writers now. Just look at ABC: they're not going to need much next year because of 'Millionaire.' "
Like Mr. Apatow, Ian Biederman, a writer and producer on Fox's "Party of Five," said he was uneasy about the impact of the reality shows. "There's no question that in the short term, job opportG1ies will be diminished," he said. "There's a kind of tongue-in-cheek fatalism about these new shows. In the long run I'm optimistic that the one-hour drama and good sophisticated storytelling won't ever go away."
Bob Broder, one of television's most respected agents, said bluntly: "There will be a downturn in the number of writers employed for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. There will be fewer filmed entertainment series. It is a trend that will also pass."
The actress Mary Tyler Moore, who was also once a formidable producer, told the talk show host Rosie O'Donnell last week: "It scares me, you know, what is going to happen to television production, wherein you have a property that is creative and involves actors. It's going to be all game shows from now on, if we don't watch ourselves very carefully.'
Of course, traditional comedies and dramas are not limited to network television anymore. HBO, TNT, Showtime, Lifetime and other cable networks have already stepped into the breach and are sometimes offering riskier dramas than the networks as well as successful series like "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City." Accordingly, cable networks may benefit from the networks' hunger for the game and reality shows.
Although some writers and agents are plainly nervous about the network obsession with game shows and reality shows, several top producers and writers suggest that the success of shows like "Millionaire" can be viewed as positive for comedies and dramas. The impact of the quiz show has rippled across the network, boosting the ratings of shows that follow it like "Dharma and Greg" and "Sports Night."
"It's fair and appropriate for networks to look for ideas that not only generate huge ratings but also are cost-effective," said Tom Werner, one of television's most successful producers ("The Cosby Show," "Roseanne") with his partners, Marcy Carsey and Caryn Mandebach.
"I'm aware that there's less shelf space for script ideas, whether half-hour or hour. But that's the reality. We have to work within that reality. It's a wake-up call for people like us. It forces us to ask how can we bring the audience in equal numbers to entertainment programming."
Dick Wolf, producer of series like "Law and Order," said that cycles come and go in television and that sitcoms and dramas remain staples, no matter how limited. "Everything is cyclical," he said. "Sixteen years ago comedy was dead, and along came Cosby. Game shows were dead, and now they're No. 1. But the reality is that episodic series television has been a mainstay for 50 years, and will remain so."
"Quality will out," he said. "It's been that way for 50 years."
But other writers, executives and talent agents said they were not so sure about the ultimate impact of the new look in network television. They noted, for example, that network television was distinguished by its traditional hourlong dramas and sitcoms and that each network had its own personality. That distinctiveness could disappear with the advent of game shows and reality programs that were previously more common on syndicated television.
"Will people think about the networks now in a different way?" asked Jon Feltheimer, former president of the Columbia Tristar Television Group. "If you start giving up network time slots to reality shows and game stuff that you see on cable, that you see in syndication, you're starting to erode the very things that have distinguished network television: dramas and comedies. One channel looks like any other."

HEADLINE: Harmful Cuba Embargo

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You are correct in pointing out that the Cuban trade embargo denies American companies access to a potentially lucrative market (editorial, Feb. 2). But more important, it denies access to medicines and medical supplies to the people who need it most, the Cubans. Our work with partner organizations in Cuba confirms that the embargo has worsened the health problems of pregnant women, including inadequate nutrition and low birth weight in their children. 
 Lifting the restrictions on the sale of food and medicine should be the first step toward ending the trade embargo. There is no justification for "incremental changes" where humanitarian needs are concerned.

HEADLINE: Mending Russian Fences

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Repairing Relations With Russia" (Op-Ed, Feb. 5), James A. Baker III says: "Russians today believe we exploited the collapse of the Soviet Union to weaken Russia. To a surprising degree, they blame us for their economic troubles." 
 If it is deemed important to mend fences with Russia, we might consider dedicating a modest memorial to the Russian people, say, near Arlington National Cemetery, in recognition of their bearing the brunt of defeating Hitler's armies and turning the tide in World War II.
