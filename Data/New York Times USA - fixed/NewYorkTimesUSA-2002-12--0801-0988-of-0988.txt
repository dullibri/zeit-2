HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Increase in National Debt Limit 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
The Bush administration asked Congress today to approve another increase in the limit on national debt, saying it will run out of the authority to borrow money by late February.
 The deputy Treasury secretary, Kenneth W. Dam, in a letter to the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, cited the cost of combating terrorism and the economic slowdown for the government's growing indebtedness. 
 The federal government, which enjoyed a budget surplus as recently as two years ago, had a shortfall of $157 billion this year and is expected to have a larger one in 2003. 
Congress raised the government's debt limit in July by $450 million, to a total of $6.4 trillion, but administration officials predicted even then that they would need to raise the limit again by some time next year.
Though today's announcement was no surprise, it highlighted the sharp deterioration in the government's financial condition and provided fresh ammunition for Democratic lawmakers who want to thwart President Bush's plan to push additional tax cuts through Congress early next year.
Mr. Dam said the government's debt had been swollen by needs for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, the costs of fighting terrorism and the economic slowdown.
But he made only oblique reference to the contribution made by the tax cuts that Mr. Bush pushed through last year, referring to the cost of "restoring economic performance."
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, seized on today's request to denounce Mr. Bush's campaign to make permanent last year's tax cuts.
"By raising the debt ceiling to pay for the president's tax cuts and his other spending, the Bush administration is wanting our children and grandchildren to pay our bills," Mr. Conrad said in a statement.
Treasury officials would not say how much they want to increase the debt ceiling, which will be subject to negotiation with Congressional leaders as the deadline approaches.
The negotiations will have to take place at the same time that Mr. Bush will be campaigning for his next package of tax cuts aimed at stimulating the economy. Mr. Bush is expected to outline his package either in or before his State of the Union address in late January. Many people expect him to call for measures costing as much as $300 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: A Career as a Window to the Future 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Since the White House's recent nomination of John W. Snow, the 63-year-old chairman of the railroad company CSX, to replace the ousted Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, analysts and economists have been trying to figure out what his future stewardship will mean for the country.
 But in railroad circles, the question is more parochial: Was he good for CSX, its employees and its shareholders? 
 Certainly there were problems after Mr. Snow was promoted to chief executive of CSX in 1989. During a long rough period in the 1990's, fatal accidents on the company's rails prompted a federal audit and raised concerns over whether CSX was more focused on cost-cutting than on public safety. 
More recently -- after CSX's stock soared through the mid-1990's -- the shares have been pounded along with other railroad stocks. What has particularly riled shareholders is that, as their stake shrank since 1997, Mr. Snow's compensation continued to grow handsomely. Last year he received $10.1 million, 69 percent more than in 1997.
But Mr. Snow's performance has pluses as well. The company's safety record has improved markedly in recent years. And analysts say Mr. Snow's time at the company will be recalled as the era when an unfocused transportation conglomerate was transformed into the Eastern United States' largest rail carrier, with 23,300 miles of track. (Only Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, both operating in the West, have bigger rail networks.) 
In September, CSX lowered its third-quarter earning forecast, but most Wall Street analysts see CSX as poised for growth when the economy rebounds.
Critics recall that Mr. Snow's $8.4 billion bid to acquire Conrail in 1996 devolved into a battle with the better financed Norfolk Southern that drove the price up to $10.2 billion. The two railroads ended up dividing up the spoils, with CSX eventually paying $3.9 billion for 42 percent of Conrail's tracks, burdening it with a huge debt. The company's current debt of $5.8 billion is more than double its $2.4 billion debt in 1989, when Mr. Snow became chief executive.
CSX, through a variety of legal techniques, also managed to avoid paying federal income taxes in three of the four years from 1998 to 2001, when it earned a total of $934 million in profit, according to data in its reports to shareholders first disclosed by Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group whose figures are widely accepted. CSX received $164 million more in refunds than it paid during those years, it told shareholders.
CSX's operating profit margins have grown since 1989, even as its revenue shrank as CSX withdrew from the container-ship, logistics and barge businesses. The company made a profit of $387 million on revenue of $8.1 billion in 2001, and has earned $287 million on revenues of nearly $6.1 billion in the first three quarters of this year.
"The Conrail merger will be John's greatest legacy at CSX," said Jill K. Evans, a transportation analyst at Morgan Securities.
For many people, a big question is how much direct credit, or blame, Mr. Snow deserves for the company's record under his watch. With his nomination as Treasury secretary still pending, Mr. Snow declined to be interviewed for this article. But by many accounts, he has been more a strategist and lobbyist for CSX than an active operations executive.
"I can't say whether he brought benefits to CSX, but he sure was a visionary when it came to deregulation," said Robert E. Gallamore, director of the Transportation Center at Northwestern University and a former strategic planner at Union Pacific.
Many analysts and rail buffs say that Mr. Snow left much of the actual running of CSX to Michael Ward, the president, who was widely expected to succeed Mr. Snow as chief executive next year even before the Treasury nomination was made. "CSX won't miss a beat in the transition," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.
Mr. Snow, who has a law degree and a Ph.D. in economics, started out as a University of Maryland economics professor and then taught law at the University of Virginia. His early advocacy of deregulating transportation industries brought him to the attention of senior railroad executives and in 1977 won him a job as vice president of government affairs with the Chessie System and an invitation to put his theories into practice. When CSX was formed in 1980 from the merger of Chessie and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, Mr. Snow became a senior vice president at CSX and began moving up in the company.
CSX's operations are based in Jacksonville, Fla., but Mr. Snow has worked from Richmond, Va., as chief executive, using the CSX "air force," as company people call it, to ferry himself by jet to Florida and often by helicopter to Washington, 100 miles to the north.
Although railroads have been free to set their own rates since 1980, the federal government still regulates many aspects of the rail industry, including safety. And Washington was familiar turf for Mr. Snow, who had worked as a transportation official in the Ford administration before joining Chessie. 
Both critics and admirers agree that Mr. Snow is polished at courting politicians and would almost certainly be more politically effective as the Treasury secretary than Mr. O'Neill was. Among other prominent posts, he served for two years in the mid-1990's as chairman of the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for chief executives of large corporations, and was active in the Business Council, another influential group.
At CSX, Mr. Snow led an aggressive cost-cutting campaign. That first won him applause from Wall Street, but later opened him to widespread accusations of emphasizing fiscal health over public safety. Critics say track maintenance suffered and contributed to 19 deaths and more than 100 injuries in a spate of derailments, crashes and other accidents involving trains on CSX tracks between 1991 and 1996. 
Five major accidents in 1995 alone prompted an audit by the Federal Railroad Administration that accused the company of intimidating workers who raised safety concerns.
CSX, like the other major freight railroads, carries Amtrak passenger trains on its rails. Under federal law, Amtrak is solely responsible if any of its trains have accidents, even if the fault lies with the freight railroad's tracks, switches and signals. 
Thomas M. Downs, who was president of Amtrak from 1993 to 1998, said that he repeatedly met with Mr. Snow to express his concerns about safety on CSX's line.
"My experience was pretty uniformly unsatisfactory," said Mr. Downs, who said he felt that Norfolk Southern and other railroads had kept their rails safe. "I expected a different level of commitment to safety from his railroad. It was a constant disappointment."
On Feb. 17, 1996, before the federal audit was finished, a Maryland commuter train ran through a poorly maintained CSX signal and crashed into a Chicago-bound Amtrak train killing 12 and injuring 20.
The crash helped galvanize the auditors, whose subsequent report said of CSX, "Employees were not reporting injuries due to fear of reprisals, such as formal hearings or harsh discipline for minor unsafe acts or mistakes." 
The report also said supervisors were spread too thin to do their jobs and that a fifth of tracks had not been properly inspected. The audit noted the role of top management, saying that "only through a true commitment to safety at every level in the organization" would dangerous practices end. 
CSX denies it ever took chances with public safety. "What is important is how CSX responded to that audit,"said Adam Hollingsworth, a CSX spokesman. He said that Mr. Snow adopted "every recommendation" of the audit, including a zero-tolerance policy for intimidating workers who raise safety questions.
"Safety always has been and always will be CSX's top priority," Mr. Hollingsworth said, "and John Snow and the management team of the railroad have been and always will be committed."
Two years ago, CSX added 125 new inspectors and began spending more on maintaining the rails. As a result, CSX now ranks No. 2 in the number of train accidents and reported injuries -- behind only Norfolk Southern, which has ranked as the safest railroad for more than 20 years.
In the view of some employees, the cultural changes that benefited safety also improved working conditions more generally, creating an environment where workers now have a greater say in how things are done.
"Snow's legacy is that he is the only railroad executive who tried to break the militaristic culture of railroad managements," said Frank Wilner, the spokesman for the United Transportation Union, which represents about 8,000 CSX workers.
Whether Mr. Snow's management style was hands-on or arm's-length, his biggest business bet was his decision to make a takeover run at Conrail in 1996. At the time of the Conrail deal, the common wisdom had also held that Norfolk Southern would be able to more quickly and fully absorb its piece of Conrail.
"A lot of us thought Norfolk Southern had more bucks in its back pocket and a better managerial culture," Mr. Gallamore of Northwestern University said. "But in fact CSX did every bit as well."
Shareholders are not necessarily as upbeat. Many are smarting from their losses in the company's stock, particularly in light of Mr. Snow's increasingly rich compensation. 
Last year Amalgamated Bank, which holds about 82,000 CSX shares in its LongView index funds, introduced a shareholder resolution that would limit some of the lucrative severance payments built into CSX's executive employment contracts -- particularly the "poison pill" provisions that called for top executives to be paid handsomely in the event of a change of control at the company.
Melissa Moye, Amalgamated's chief economist in charge of trust and investment services, said that 30 percent of CSX shareholders voted for the resolution. That was not enough to pass the measure, but it was a strong enough showing to indicate investors' displeasure with management, Ms. Moye suggested.
"This is just not a well-governed company, and this stock has not done well," she said.
Many financial analysts choose to take a longer view, saying that CSX and Norfolk Southern, after some early stumbles, stand to benefit nicely from the Conrail acquisition. "Both railroads have turned out to be very good operators," Ms. Evans at Morgan Securities said.
And by one key measure for a freight company, CSX has grown increasingly proficient. In 2000, only about half of CSX's trains departed and arrived on time. Now, more than 90 percent are on schedule -- a record that has enabled CSX to pick up more shipments of perishable goods, like produce.
In the final analysis, that may be the best way to assess whether Mr. Snow's method was any way to run a railroad. As noted by William D. Zollars, chairman of the Yellow Corporation, a big trucking company that often carries goods to and from CSX's rail yards: "They're getting the trains there on time, with everyone's goods on them."

Officials Said to Urge Bush To Cut Taxes on Dividends
White House officials are urging President Bush to propose cutting taxes on corporate dividends for shareholders by about half, according to administration officials and Republicans close to the White House. The proposal, likely to be a crucial part of Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plan, is intended to stimulate the economy and reduce what many economists say is an incentive for companies to avoid paying dividends and to run up debt.
 While many economists think it would do little to bolster the economy quickly, they say the proposal would give a lift to the stock market. The plan would cost the Treasury more than $100 billion over 10 years, and the tax benefits would overwhelmingly flow to the wealthiest taxpayers. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KARZAI'S PROGRESS; 
Afghans Mark Year of Slowly Growing Stability

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
It was a year ago that Hamid Karzai took over the business of governing Afghanistan, a ruin of a country he and his government inherited after the collapse of the Taliban and have tried to guide through its first year relatively free of war in two decades.
 A united Afghanistan with a functioning multiethnic army remains a desire, not a reality. Yet despite violent incidents -- a narrow escape from assassination, the killing of two of his ministers and continued clashes among rival warlords in the provinces -- Mr. Karzai is looking stronger now that under his stewardship the country has found a degree of stability. 
 That was underscored today when a former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, who last year opposed the United Nations plan to make Mr. Karzai president, voiced unreserved support for him and the central government at a ceremony marking their first year in office.
Speaking to an audience of high-level government officials at the ceremony, Mr. Karzai acknowledged some failures of his government, namely security and disarmament, and vowed to tackle those issues more energetically in the next year.
In a sign of progress made, American forces based in Afghanistan have been contemplating moving from combat operations toward development activities, deploying larger teams of civil affairs officers in 8 to 10 provincial centers to give a boost to economic development.
The battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda has been drawing to an end, and the effort to win the peace and help the government establish its control countrywide is the new target, American military officials and diplomats have said.
Rocket and grenade attacks against American forces -- and recently suicide bomber attacks -- have continued and even increased in recent weeks. Yet they remain small in scale, and any concerted organized opposition to the presence of about 9,000 United States troops has failed to materialize.
The economic situation in the country remains precarious, however. Of the population of 20 million, nearly two million are recently returned refugees struggling to find a way to survive their first winter back.
Some 1.3 million people will be relying on food aid this winter, the World Food Program says, and more than half a million displaced people are considered vulnerable and in need of shelter and relief assistance, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
Although several nations pledged more than $4.5 billion in aid this year, not all of that money has arrived. The United States gave about $588 million this year, and expects to contribute a similar amount to the roughly $2 billion pledged by various nations for 2003, the State Department says.
Regional leaders continue to flex enormous power, running their own armies, collecting their own taxes and customs and to some extent running their own foreign policy. Armed clashes have continued, as regional commanders seek to consolidate their local power or defeat rivals.
Mr. Karzai, determined to avoid further bloodshed for his exhausted and traumatized people, has chosen to win over the warlords by persuasion -- a tactic that so far has won at least their verbal support for his government.
The list Mr. Karzai gave today of his government's undeniable achievements and the cheering he received from police and military officers who filled the auditorium spoke for themselves.
Among those achievements is Mr. Karzai's success in binding together a disparate cabinet that includes veterans of the guerrilla war against the Soviets, Western-educated Afghans who returned after 20 years abroad and representatives of ethnic groups that had been fighting one another. 
In a striking gesture of support, his defense minister, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, warned regional commanders in his speech today that they must give up some of their power and bow to the authority of the central government. It was the strongest sign yet of the Marshal Fahim's readiness to move against the powerful warlords, several of whom are his own supporters and source of power. 
Marshal Fahim, probably the most powerful man in Afghanistan thanks to his control of the bulk of the country's heavy weaponry and men under arms, has been slow to dismantle the forces loyal to him and make way for the civilian authorities. 
The president signed a decree this month to create a multiethnic, regionally diverse national army, which envisions disarmament and demobilization of the various armed militias that fought the Taliban.
Trying to separate political and military powers, Mr. Karzai further ordered military commanders to relinquish political positions and regional leaders or governors to give up their military positions.
Marshal Fahim has been involved in creating the plan for the national army, but his commitment to real change remains to be tested. Without his cooperation, Mr. Karzai's decrees are worth little, since his practical power does not stretch much beyond the capital.
But in his comments today, Marshall Fahim called for sacrifices in order to create a strong central government. 
"We should have a powerful central government according to the wishes of our people, and to achieve this aim, we should make some sacrifices," he said. "We should give up some positions. It is very necessary that we come under the command of the central government, so let's put an end to local military power bases."
Mr. Karzai, as often before, promised constitutional reform and preparations in the coming year for Afghanistan's first democratic elections in more than 20 years. "You will have the right to choose whomever you want," he told the audience.
Speaking in the hall where he was inaugurated on Dec. 22 last year, Mr. Karzai noted with typical understatement that there was still fighting between different groups in some areas, "and in this point, we have not been completely successful."
Disarmament started in some provinces in the last month, but it needs to move faster, he said.
"Although the general security situation is good, sometimes theft, robbery and killing occurs," he said. "Sometimes it is carried out by people who are linked to authority figures working in the government."
In his frank look back over the last year, Mr. Karzai remembered particular low moments -- the killing of over 40 civilians in Deh Rawud, in southern Afghanistan on July 1, during a raid by American-led forces hunting for terrorists; the car bomb that killed 30 men and women in central Kabul on Sept. 5 (on the same day, there was an attempt on Mr. Karzai's life in Kandahar); the assassination of his vice president, Haji Abdul Qadir, on July 6; and the killing of two students in demonstrations in Kabul last month, for which he blamed ill-trained policemen.
But he also talked of moments of joy and optimism, when during visits to the provinces he encountered ordinary and poor people who had given him their support.

HEADLINE: White House Aides Push for 50% Cut In Dividend Taxes 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
White House officials are urging President Bush to propose cutting taxes on corporate dividends for shareholders by about half, according to administration officials and Republicans close to the White House.
 The proposal, likely to be a crucial part of the tax-cutting plan Mr. Bush will announce in January, is intended to stimulate the economy and reduce what many economists say is an incentive in the current law for companies to avoid paying dividends and to run up debt. While many economists think it would do little to bolster the economy quickly, they say the proposal would give a boost to the stock market. 
 The 50 percent cut would cost the Treasury more than $100 billion over 10 years, and the tax benefits would overwhelmingly flow to the nation's very wealthiest taxpayers. Mr. Bush is in favor of some kind of reduction in the tax on dividends, a White House official said, but has not settled on an amount.
President Bush's entire tax package is expected to provide as much as $300 billion in reductions over 10 years. It is almost certain to speed up both tax cuts that were supposed to take effect over the next several years and corporate write-offs for investment in new equipment. Officials are also considering measures that benefit middle- or lower-income families, like a more rapid increase in the child-care tax credit.
Administration officials contend that reducing dividend taxes would immediately increase the underlying value of companies and lower their cost of capital. The short-term political appeal is its potential effect on the stock market, because it would instantly make shares of any company that pays dividends more valuable than before.
The long-term benefit of a cut in the dividend tax, the officials say, would be to greatly reduce the market distortions of taxing dividends twice -- once as corporate profits and once as dividend income to shareholders -- while granting tax deductions on debt interest payments. For shareholders, dividends are now taxed as ordinary income at rates of up to 38.6 percent. By comparison, the maximum tax rate on capital gains -- the profit made from the increase in value of shares or other kinds of property -- is 20 percent.
Many economists are skeptical that a cut in dividend taxes would provide much immediate stimulus to the economy, which has been Mr. Bush's most important justification for new tax cuts. It would be at least a year before shareholders see any extra money, and the measure would not leave extra money in corporate coffers.
"One wouldn't think of this as the first or second or even third measure to stimulate consumption or investment," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the issue for years. 
While the tax on dividends has been a focus of White House discussions, there have been many proposals on how such a reduction could be structured. A White House official cautioned this week that Mr. Bush has not yet decided on exactly how much to reduce the tax on corporate dividends, but the official said advisers agreed in principle on the most logical proposal. 
As envisioned, a person would be able to exclude a substantial share of all stock dividends -- probably about half -- from taxation. There would be no upper limit on the dollar value of dividends that would be tax free, which means that most of the relief would flow to the largest investors.
The Urban-Brooking Tax Policy Center, a research center here, recently calculated that, if the government completely eliminated taxes on corporate dividends, 42 percent of the tax benefits would flow to the wealthiest 1 percent of all taxpayers.
Republicans close to the White House said there were several reasons why officials were attracted to the idea of letting taxpayers exclude about half of all dividend income from taxes.
Eliminating all taxes on corporate dividends would drain so much money from the Treasury -- about $300 billion over 10 years, according to some estimates -- that President Bush would have no room for other tax cuts.
Reducing dividend taxes by about half, to about 20 percent for people in the top tax bracket, would not only reduce the drain on revenue to the Treasury but also bring dividend taxes in line with those on capital gains. 
Tax analysts said that would eliminate one imbalance in the current tax system that favors fast-growing companies like Microsoft that pay no dividends but attract investors with the prospect of big increases in their stock prices.
Administration officials have looked at ways to reduce dividend taxes that would primarily benefit small investors, but White House advisers say those would do little to correct distortions in the current system.
One option would be to eliminate taxes on the first $1,000 or $3,000 in dividend income. But White House officials think that approach would do little to reduce the distortions in the system because it would not change incentives for the big investors who actually reap most dividends.
Many outside economists agree. "There is a fundamental tension between the distributional effects of these measures and the incentive effect you are trying to achieve," said James Poterba, a professor of economics and public finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That the tax cuts themselves would flow overwhelmingly to the nation's wealthiest taxpayers is a fact that Democrats are sure to cite as evidence that the administration wants to cut taxes only for the rich.
Democratic lawmakers are pushing for tax measures that would benefit lower- and middle-income households, like a temporary "holiday" from Social Security taxes or a temporary exemption for the first several thousand dollars in taxable income.
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research group backed by labor unions, said the entire complaint about "double taxation" was dubious because corporations make such heavy use of legal tax shelters and loopholes.
Although the top corporate tax rate is 35 percent, the average tax rate is only about 15 percent, Mr. McIntyre has estimated on the basis of analyzing corporate tax data.
"Don't worry about the double tax," Mr. McIntyre said. "Worry about the half tax."
But business groups have themselves often been lukewarm about cutting dividend taxes as well, pushing harder for more direct benefits like faster write-offs on new equipment or reductions in overall corporate tax rates.
This year, business lobbyists say they support a cut in the dividend taxes -- but not at the expense of other measures that would cut business taxes more directly.
If President Bush has his way, the dividend tax cut will be a permanent change to the tax code. The only reason Mr. Bush may settle for less is that the Senate's complex rules on filibustering make it easier to pass a tax measure that has time limits.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Oil Chief Says He Will Make Big Changes 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Venezuela's chief oil official, Ali Rodriguez, said today that he would begin sweeping changes -- including laying off workers and hiring foreign specialists -- in response to the national strike that has battered the state-owned oil company for most of the month. 
 In an interview with American reporters, Mr. Rodriguez, president of the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, acknowledged that the strike, aimed at forcing President Hugo Chavez to resign and call new elections, had brought the company close to collapse. Crude exports have plummeted, he said, from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to fewer than 2 million barrels this month, and refineries, wells and tankers are all but unmanned and inoperable. 
 The crisis here has pushed crude oil prices to more than $30 a barrel.
When asked about the lines of cars that stretch for miles outside most Venezuelan gas stations, Mr. Rodriguez, who was appointed by Mr. Chavez, acknowledged that the country had come close to chaos. He blamed strike leaders and said they would be prosecuted for conspiring to overthrow the government.
Openly beleaguered and outraged, Mr. Rodriguez offered a stark contrast to the demeanor of Mr. Chavez, who routinely plays down the effects of the strike.
Mr. Rodriguez, who once took part in guerrilla movements and later became the president of OPEC, saved his most bitter remarks for the oil executives he said were leading the strike and trying, in his eyes, to use oil to take over the country.
Speaking in his office, Mr. Rodriguez said he had suspended several striking oil executives. He also said the government was preparing to sue some strike leaders for $1.3 billion in damages and, in some cases, pursue criminal prosecutions.
"They have begun to use oil as a political weapon," he said. "In Venezuela, a group of managers, taking advantage of their positions, decided to use Venezuelan oil as a political weapon to impose their will on the state and on society."
However, Mr. Rodriguez contended, the strike organizers failed. He said that the government, which has had the support of the armed forces during the conflict, had begun to regain control of the facilities and that operations would quickly return to normal. 
He pledged that Venezuelans would have fresh gasoline supplies by next week. He also urged Venezuela's international clients to stay patient and said exports would climb to normal levels by next month.
"I would say, in the month of January, we will have completely normalized the flow," he said. "I'm talking about the exports of crude. It will take time to restart the wells and to equip the plants."
Privately, supporters of the strike said they had underestimated Mr. Chavez's ability to keep gas and oil flowing for this long, though at critically low levels. Political experts said the conflict between Mr. Chavez and his opponents had reached a kind of stalemate.
However, opposition leaders pledged to keep up the strike. Most also dismissed Mr. Rodriguez's expectations for the quick recovery of the nation's oil industry as pipe dreams.
"Starting the refineries is simply impossible in one month," said Horacio Medina, president of a leading oil workers' organization. "Supposing that in January the workers -- not some, but all -- returned to work, restarting the industry would take at least four months."
The interview with Mr. Rodriguez today provided the government's most frank assessment of the devastation at Venezuela's oil wells and refineries since the start of the strike, which was called by Mr. Chavez's opponents. Combined with several small victories by the government in recent days, Mr. Rodrguez's comments signaled that Mr. Chavez had gained momentum in the struggle to survive his latest and most dangerous political challenge.
When workers abandoned their posts at the state-owned oil company, they cut off the nation's lifeblood. Oil generates 80 percent of the government's export revenues and most of the money it needs for social programs and other obligations.
Mr. Rodriguez predicted that economic aftershocks of the strike would be felt through the first trimester of next year. He said operations were closed at the refining complex at Paraguana, considered one of the world's largest.
Shortages of gasoline, Mr. Rodriguez said, have forced Venezuela to begin buying imports for the first time since the 1940's. He added that the state-owned oil industry had defaulted on international oil commitments for the first time since the beginning of the last century.
Strike planners, Mr. Rodriguez said, had delivered a crippling blow. "The plan this group had was to paralyze the distribution of gas internally," he said. "These people know the business well, and they understood that if they paralyzed the distribution of gas it would create total chaos. It would generate a situation of anarchy that would show the government was incapable of guaranteeing the stability of the country, and provoke its overthrow."
Meanwhile, he said, the company's remaining workers face a "titanic effort" in trying to lift up a fallen giant. His strategy, he said, is to stabilize fuel supplies for domestic consumption, strengthening the government ability to ride out the strike while weakening an increasingly divided opposition.
He said he would seek the advice of foreign and national experts for a restructuring of the company that would cut costs and increase efficiency as well as make it less vulnerable to political storms. He gave few details on exactly how the company would be restructured but indicated that there would be worker layoffs and that some company-owned related businesses would be sold off. 
Mr. Chavez secured the support of the military and asked it to provide security at oil installations. On Sunday, Venezuela dispatched a ship filled with 500,000 barrels of crude to the United States, and another had begun loading 370,000 barrels headed for Chile. Replacement crews also began to recover and move tankers that had been under the control of striking workers. A few had begun delivering fuel at domestic ports.
Mr. Rodriguez said the company had begun rebuilding its labor force, with nonstriking workers, retirees and other former oil workers called back to service. Fewer than 20 percent of the management ranks had returned to work, Mr. Rodriguez said. But he said the passage of time had begun to shift attitudes among the rank and file. He also predicted that "the majority" of oil workers would be on duty by the second week of January.

How the West Was Measured, One Chain at a Time

BYLINE:  By RICHARD EDER 

 BODY:
MEASURING AMERICA
How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy
By Andro Linklater
Illustrated. 310 pages. Walker & Company. $26.
 "Measuring America" begins at the Point of Beginning, the name designated in 1785 for a stretch of border between Pennsylvania and the uncharted Ohio territory to the west. 
 It was the starting point from which the surveyor Thomas Hutchins struggled to map the territory in mile-square sections. Under more competent but equally struggling successors (who encountered swamps, cliffs, gulches, mosquitoes, hostile Indians and settlers), these squares would eventually extend as a checkerboard across the continent.
For air travelers who decline to lower their shades for the movie, these squares may evoke the Jeffersonian vision -- overtaken even then and long since obliterated -- of a United States of sturdy farmers, each living on a section or part-section of republican independence and yeoman virtues.
Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Hamilton wanted the mapping done by decimal measurement. The flood of settlers and speculators already spilling westward meant that there was no time to work out the new and still disputed system. Measurement would be made by a device already in use for some 150 years: the surveyor's chain, 66 feet long and 80 chains to the mile.
In "Measuring America," Andro Linklater tells us all about the chain: its history, method of use and particular advantages. He has the talent not just to let us know how things work, but to make us want to know. Discussing this and other technologies with an enthusiast's detailed passion, he engages himself in a great deal more.
Scarcely four pages into the book he is tackling the notion that for most of history, up to Tudor England perhaps, it was the use of land and not land itself that was considered a possession. It might be individual, as a hereditary feudal right derived ultimately from the monarch; or collective, as with the right of American Indian tribes -- derived from the spirit-given nature of things -- to wander, plant and hunt. Mr. Linklater points, by contrast, to the magic that Hutchins would introduce into the Western lands, the transformation of the wilderness into property.
"The wand that would make it possible was there in the first sentence of his report. The land would be measured in chains and links. In most circumstances, a chain imprisons; here it released. What it released from the billowing, uncharted land was a single element -- a distance of 22 yards."
Later he will express some reservations about the constraints that followed upon release. There was the rolling treaty-breaking displacement of the Indians; there is to this day an American ethos extreme in its adherence to the private over the public.
Here, though, his point is that the very possibility of property depends on measurement and that commerce as well as science is inconceivable without it. Next to language, measurement is the most fundamental agent of social exchange, he argues.
How much is your bushel? the buyer asks, confident of knowing how much is in the bushel. Mr. Linklater gives engaging examples of the much longer history of measurement unsettled. New York City traders, taking advantage of the rube-grown grain floated in by the new Erie Canal, would use a bigger bushel for buying, a smaller one for selling.
(Today, of course, we get less and less coffee in a same-priced can. Fundamental or not: the measure of all things may define man, but something there is in man that does not love it.)
Mr. Linklater encloses his specifics inside generalities inside universals, as if they were nested Russian dolls. The core is America's parceling out. Apart from the original 13 colonies, the vast expanse of what would become the United States consisted of great tracts acquired by treaty or war (the Louisiana Purchase and California, for example). 
From Jefferson on, the government's policy was to pass along most of this land -- one billion acres -- from national to individual ownership. "In economic terms alone, it has represented the greatest orderly transfer of public resources to the private sector in history," the author tells us.
He writes of the strains between the Jeffersonian vision of the small farm owner and encroachment by the huge speculator, often helped by political connections. Many individual farmers did get land; on the other hand, there was John Cleves Symmes, who persuaded the Continental Congress to sell him a million acres west of the Point of Beginning for $82,000. His backer was John Dayton, soon to be speaker of the new Congress. He received four of Symmes's townships; one of them is now Dayton, Ohio.
Part of the payment was in military warrants, issued in lieu of cash to members of the Continental Army. Their price dropped to 10 cents on the dollar, but they still bought their full value in land. Symmes and others snapped them up.
Mr. Linklater writes in a detail that can become reiterative as he goes from territory to territory. More characteristically, though, his book tends to shoot out in all directions and, seemingly, all of them at once. This confuses, but it also provides a magical mystery tour that leaves the reader both mildly footsore and exhilarated by unexpected connections.
His account of the battle for the metric system, set in France, England and the United States, is a high point. French revolutionaries shared with others a passion for decimals, but carried it further, wanting to decimalize days of the week and months of the year. Americans decimalized currency from the start; miles and pounds popularly resist kilometers and kilos to this day. A Canadian supermarket was observed selling frozen turkeys by the kilo, fresh ones by the pound.
Even in a metric Europe there is local resistance, and the author thinks he knows why. The ell, a former English unit of measure, was, after all, the length of an outstretched arm; the yard the length of a pace back when journeys were walked. "The metric system forced people to separate the measure from the activity altogether and deal with an abstract unit," he writes. "What underlay the popular dislike of the metric system was a very modern anxiety, the sense of alienation from the natural world."
Throughout the book, Mr. Linklater has allowed his humans wonderfully to subvert his measurings.

HEADLINE: At the America's Cup, A Battle of Boat Sheds 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand 

 BODY:
IT wasn't so long ago that America's Cup bases were simply forts disguised as boat sheds. In an event notorious for espionage --scuba-diving spies have inspected rivals' keels -- protecting millions of dollars' worth of yacht design secrets always took precedence over playing host to corporate sponsors, to say nothing of the public. Bases were windowless boxes ornamented with chain link and razor wire.
 But glasnost has arrived, if creepingly, at the America's Cup, thanks mainly to the need for sponsors to support the monster budgets of the current campaigns, some of which have exceeded $100 million. For their millions, corporate donors like BMW, Computer Associates and UBS Warburg expect more than team hats and sweatshirts: they want to be near the action. 
 As a result, a few big-money teams have turned their boatyards -- cranes, sail lofts, sheds, corporate offices and mess halls big enough to feed 140 employees -- into architectural statements with grand rooms for entertaining honchos. 
In the case of Alinghi, the Swiss syndicate, there are even exhibitions and rides designed to draw the public: the first such attractions in America's Cup history. 
"You have to have your fans, and your sponsors feel that they're involved with the team and that you're not perceived as being untouchable," said Joanna Ingley, a spokeswoman for Oracle-BMW. When the cup is over in March, the bases will be torn down to make room for more luxury apartments on Auckland's Viaduct Harbor, a decrepit fishing wharf rebuilt into a shiny new restaurant-ringed marina for the last America's Cup, in 2000. Contracts with the government agency that runs the America's Cup village in Auckland require the teams to leave only parking lots when they depart.
For now though, nine bases line a quarter-mile stretch of Halsey Street, with their backs and docks facing the water. Each base reflects the personality of the syndicate it houses. Almost all are built of corrugated steel, which is to New Zealand what stucco is to Southern California.
The base of the Swedish team Victory Challenge is a model of Nordic practicality. It has a black facade painted with the yellow cross of the Swedish flag, and the interior is a minimalist aggregation of particle-board and metal shelving. Larry Ellison's Oracle-BMW team has a huge crescent-roof barge tied up in front of its base, the kind of glass-and steel-entertainment center you might expect from a Silicon Valley corporation. OneWorld, the Seattle syndicate financed by Craig McCaw, dedicated its campaign to the oceans. Its base is covered in environmentally safe paints and has a large rooftop funnel to collect rainwater for washing boats.
"The philosophy was to create something that was completely functional, economically practical and environmentally sensitive," said Bob Ratliffe, the executive director of OneWorld.
But the most ambitious base is that of Alinghi, the Swiss syndicate, which looms over the harbor like a cloud and looks more Epcot Center than a boatyard. The syndicate, which is financed by the pharmaceuticals mogul Ernesto Bertarelli, rented twice as much space as other teams, and its base has not just a plan but a plot.
In 2000, Mr. Bertarelli hired away two New Zealand heros to sail for his landlocked nation: Russell Coutts, the skipper who won the America's Cup twice, and his tactician, Brad Butterworth.
The defection of the local stars went over in Auckland the way Walter O'Malley's decision to move the Dodgers to Los Angeles went over in Brooklyn. Imagine if O'Malley had had to build a pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair, and you'll get a sense of the predicament Alinghi faced when it came to town. The syndicate held a competition and awarded the base to the architect Ugo Brunoni, best known for the round Ste.-Trinite church in Geneva, and gave him a mandate to take the public inside the base. Michel Hodara, an Alinghi spokesman, said the open base was meant to generate good will with a nation whose citizens would prefer to see the Swiss boat sink.
"If you do something nice for the people, if you show them you can do something for them, their emotions are tempered," he said. "If they come in here and see all these Alinghi people, they'll say, 'I don't like them, but O.K.' "
The result is the ultimate multipurpose dwelling. The building is sided in two layers of translucent corrugated plexiglass with a sheet of light-permeable foil in the middle, which blocks out heat while allowing sunlight in, just as the roofs of United Parcel Service trucks do. As a result, it is possible to work in Alinghi's two boat sheds in natural light. Even the material, Mr. Hodara said, was intended to carry a message to a skeptical public. "It's transparent because we want to be transparent as a team," he said.
Half of the building is for the public. There's an "interactive plaza" with computerized sailing games and a ride that simulates the experience of being a bowman on an America's Cup boat: the yachting equivalent of a mechanical bull, it jerks and bobs, and it heaves visitors onto thick foam mats. Upstairs there's a cafe, sleekly decorated in the team's gunmetal gray and red, with views of Viaduct Harbor and large-screen television sets and computers for watching the races.
The rest of the structure is for the syndicate -- part office building, part urban gym and, of course, part boat shed. Design and business offices are on the second floor, behind locked doors, to keep the public out. The area for the sailors is laid out to accommodate their daily routine seamlessly. The gym opens onto the locker room and showers, which lead to a dehumidified drying room for foul-weather gear. Sailors pass through a door into their mess hall and from there downstairs to their briefing rooms, the sheds and eventually the docks. The layout, Mr. Hodara states, makes the base not just a fancy shed but a "tool for victory."
John D. Barnitt, an Alinghi crewman, said that along with offering the team everything it needed, the souped-up building was another chit in the subtle psychological warfare between teams. Not surprisingly, it has given rise to a new Cup phenomenon: base envy.
"I've never been to this level of facility," Mr. Barnitt said. "Before, the bases were made of porta-cabins stacked one on top of the other. Here the gym is integrated, the boat-building and modification facilities are amazing, and we have the designers in-house. Launching and covering the boats takes half the time."
The old paranoia surrounding the bases has not completely abated. When Larry Ellison's Oracle-BMW team docked its barge at the end of its base, its next-door neighbors, the Italian team Prada, sued, charging the barge was a ploy to peek over the walls and get a glimpse of Prada's secret goings-on. (Prada withdrew the suit when it was reminded that taking the competition to court was against the rules.)
The principle design problem facing the architect of any America's Cup base is how to let the public feel welcome without letting it see anything that actually matters. While guests can see the boats being launched in the morning and hauled out in the afternoon, they are not permitted to enter the sheds, where top-secret modifications to the hull and rigging are conducted throughout the night.
"Certain parts of the base are out of bounds, partly for sensitivity and partly for safety," said Ms. Ingley of Oracle. "We're not going to allow access within the boat sheds."
But for a sport that can seem exclusive, if not hopelessly obscure -- the races take place in the Hauraki Gulf, far out of sight of Auckland -- the corporate hospitality suite of a cup base is as close as many people will ever get to the action. 
As Mr. Hodara of Alinghi put it, "If you want to open the sport of sailing to a greater number of people, you have to give them more than just the game."

HEADLINE: One-Word Shoppers' Lexicon: Price 

BYLINE:  ByCONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Like many shoppers, John and Mary Salkowsky like to float across the retail landscape, alighting in department stores like Macy's, discounters like Wal-Mart and hybrids like Kohl's. They are interested in quality, but the deal maker is the price tag.
 So last week, as the Prescott, Ariz., couple vacationed in Monroe, N.Y., they had their collective eye out for bargains. Inside the local Kohl's, they were considering whether to buy an electric shaver. Did they want it? Did they need it? It all came down to whether the price was right. 
 "There are always sales," Mr. Salkowsky said. "Why pay retail when you can get it on sale?" 
That attitude may have played a big part in a holiday retailing season that saw many stores, particularly department stores, report dismal results. A decade ago, consumers were more loyal to certain stores and certain kinds of stores, attracted by atmosphere, assortment, customer service and price. To buy brand names, one usually had to shop in a department store, and that alone carried cachet. To be a discount shopper meant being lumped with the proletariat.
Today, the notion that a person can be measured by where he or she shops has gone the way of the pneumatic tube, and the once-mysterious ways of merchandising have been reduced, in most places, to a single element: price.
"You could be at a dinner party on Fifth Avenue and millionaires will be talking about what they got at Wal-Mart," said Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD Fashionworld, which tracks retail sales. 
In dozens of recent interviews, shoppers said that their economic status did not determine where they shopped. They just did not want to pay a lot for that muffler. Or that sweater, or that digital camera. 
"People know, with the discounters around, that instead of buying something at Macy's, they can get many of those things at Target or Kohl's," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm in New York and New Canaan, Conn. "Consumers are much better educated now than they ever used to be." 
Certain products, particularly in electronics and housewares, have become commodities that play into the retail strategies of discounters in particular. With shoppers already familiar with a product, say a DVD player, no-frills retailers can "stack them high," as the saying goes, and sell them cheap, with no extra investment in sales help. It has helped trim away the differences between specialty retailers and discounters in many cases, and all but eliminated the reasons many people once shopped at department stores. 
The exodus from swell department stores to bare-bones discounters has accelerated in the last five years. In 1994, people polled by Mr. Johnson's firm spent 41.5 percent of their money in department stores. By this year, through September, that number had fallen to 16 percent. Meanwhile discount stores, which accounted for 41.4 percent of spending in 1994, have risen to 55 percent. Most of that growth has taken place since 1997, Mr. Johnson said.
The stores themselves have also moved closer together. Kohl's appears to be a department store, with wall-to-wall carpet and orderly displays. But it is known for discounts and tries to make shopping easier with grocery carts for people to fill with stuff. There is a single checkout point at the front of the store, like a Kmart. 
Kohl's has grown so rapidly that other retailers, including Sears, Roebuck, are borrowing from its example. Sears is reconfiguring stores to include front checkouts; the chain already has shopping carts. 
Wal-Mart Stores, meanwhile, which built its early success by catering to low- and middle-income shoppers in rural areas, is increasing its big-ticket offerings in hopes of attracting more well-to-do shoppers. For example, 150 Wal-Mart stores are selling $3,000 plasma TV's.
In some cases, people who need things simply go to the store nearest them, without feeling any particular loyalty to it. "You see more name brands in Toys "R" Us," said Mary Beth Lindberg, a mother of two who was loading toys into her car outside the Monroe Wal-Mart the other day. But the Wal-Mart is closer, so she goes there. 
"It's not even a money issue," she added. "It's convenient, and why spend twice the amount?" She said she rarely went to discount stores before she moved to Rockland County from Queens three years ago. 
And while they say they want quality as well as price, many shoppers are willing to bend a little on one in favor of the other. Bill Chapman, an industrial maintenance manager from Crawfordville, Ga., likes Ralph Lauren golf shirts. He shops the sales, and finds them "plenty of times at half price," he said. He will buy colors he wouldn't normally choose, he added, if they are priced at 50 percent off. 
Some department stores are trying to play by the new price rules. Macy's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, was offering deep discounts on sweaters at its Union Square store in San Francisco last weekend. "They send a card in the mail for another 10 to 15 percent off and another coupon, and you can put them all together," said Kevin Cope, one satisfied shopper. "There are $80 sweaters that I walked out with for 18 bucks." 
Not only have changes taken place in where people shop, but also in when they shop. Instead of descending on stores the day after Thanksgiving, more shoppers have taken to waiting until the final weekend before Christmas. Dec. 26 is also a big shopping day. 
Merchants have shifted the shopping schedule with their promotions. "Ten years ago, you would never think about seeing something on sale before Christmas," Mr. Cohen said. "But five years ago, retailers started having a tougher time, and their assortments were sort of homogeneous. They started to promote, and things would go on sale just before the holiday if they weren't doing well."
That was the pre-Christmas sale, for those down-to-the-wire shoppers. And then, about a year ago, the stores crossed into a new frontier. "Now you see promotions even before Thanksgiving," Mr. Cohen said.
Most shopping for Christmas presents still takes place in December. Yet retailers no longer have huge proportions of their yearly sales in December. Some categories, like books, ring up 15 percent of their sales in December, but very few handle more than that, Mr. Johnson said. "Nobody packs 25, 30 percent into a single month, not even in December."
The other big change in shopping, of course, has been the advent of the Internet. 
All kinds of things are available online. Shane Ottosen, an auto mechanic from Dane, Wis., is buying nitrous oxide for his friends this year from a source he had not used until a few months ago: Ebay. The discounts make economic sense, he said, even though he does not know whom he is buying from. (He is not sending his buddies laughing gas; they use the nitrous oxide for drag racing, where it makes the cars go faster.)
Then there is the electronic form of discount shopping. Scott Krasik, a retail analyst in Manhattan for C. L. King Associates, worked through most of his Christmas list online this year, mainly using Walmart.com. Mr. Krasik said he bought 15 or 20 presents for relatives and his girlfriend's family, spending less than $1,000.
The big advantage, he said, was being able to avoid "the aggravation" of shopping in stores. 
"I've been out in the Willowbrook Mall on the Sunday before Christmas, and that's not a pleasant experience," he said, referring to the shopping center in Wayne, N.J. "But it was like I was wandering through a mall on Walmart.com. I had a list of people I was going to buy for, but not a single present I knew I was going to buy." 
After about two and a half hours of Web surfing, he wound up with selections like bird feeders and clock radios. And then he had to go to stores with his girlfriend anyway. 
"We spent 10 hours on her shopping last weekend," Mr. Krasik said, "and she likes that."

HEADLINE: Ivory Coast's Raging Conflict Draws France In 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
As the United States rushes to complete its war preparations against Iraq, France is becoming more deeply enmeshed in a conflict on a much different battlefield: Ivory Coast.
 The complicated dispute in France's former colony -- once the most stable and prosperous country in West Africa -- is France's largest and most precarious military commitment in Africa in almost two decades. 
 Although it has received scant attention in the United States, it has dominated conversation in the corridors of power and news reports in France since rebels tried to overthrow the government three months ago.
France has more than 2,500 troops, including members of the Foreign Legion, in Ivory Coast. The most recent deployment of 300 troops, accompanied by helicopters and light armored vehicles, will be operational by next week. 
Their stated mission is twofold: to serve as a buffer between government and rebel forces along a cease-fire line until a multinational West African force takes over and to protect French and other foreign residents living in the country.
But little by little, the French troops have been drawn into what may become a long war that could spiral into anarchy.
The situation deteriorated on Monday after Ivory Coast's three rebel factions warned French troops that any military attack on rebel positions would be considered a "cause for war." The rebels also began discussing forming a coalition, a move that could significantly increase their power.
Those developments followed a clash last Saturday in which French Foreign Legion troops equipped with light tanks fired on a rebel group. The rebels had opened fire on French soldiers as they approached the strategic town of Duekoue from the northeast after bypassing government troops, according to a French army spokesman.
The French troops initially fired in the air but then responded to the attack. Three four-wheel drive vehicles belonging to the rebels were destroyed, and rebels said the assault had killed six people.
The Ivory Coast conflict has it origins in bitter ethnic and religious divisions that have built steadily since the death nine years ago of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the country's longtime autocratic ruler. 
A succession of presidents from the Christian south have worked assiduously and often unscrupulously in the intervening years to deny power to Alassane D. Ouattara, a popular leader from the more heavily populated and predominantly Muslim northern region. He was barred from the election in September 2000 that brought Laurent Gbagbo, Ivory Coast's current president, to power.
Disaffected northern soldiers rose up against President Gbagbo in a coup last September.
About 400 people were killed in the uprising, which has shattered the reputation the Ivory Coast as a country with a stable government, a vibrant economy and an infrastructure that works. Since then, two other rebel groups have emerged and tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. 
The conflict has been complicated by rumors of the involvement of foreign powers and mercenaries, the discovery of two mass graves believed to hold up to 200 bodies and human rights abuses reported to have been committed by both government forces and rebels.
French troops intervened initially to protect foreign civilians caught in the fighting. But as rebels from different factions began to advance toward the country's largest city, Abidjan, French troops have increasingly been put in the position of keeping them away from the government-controlled part of the country.
The rebels, and even some French newspapers, have accused France of trying to prop up the increasingly unpopular government, and they warn against a deeper involvement.
"The French are not invincible," Guillaume Soro, a leader of the main rebel group, said on Sunday. "They lost in Indochina. We can at least make sure there are families mourning in France as well as in Ivory Coast."
"France has found itself in a trap," said Bernard Conte, a political economist who is an expert on Ivory Coast. "France's intervention started out as humanitarian, and now it is preventing the rebels from advancing. So it is gives the impression that it has taken sides."
A recent editorial in Le Figaro said, "By choosing what side it is on, Paris is taking a huge risk." An editorial in Le Monde said, "In terms of realpolitik, Ivory Coast, where only bad things can happen, holds no interest for anyone, not for France, not moreover for the United States."
The rebels have called the foreign troops an army of "conquest and occupation," a charge that France has denied.
"There is no question of our setting off to reconquer Ivory Coast or engaging in offensive operations," the chief of staff of the French Army, Gen. Henri Bentegeat, said on Sunday during a visit to Abidjan.
Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa grower, was once the jewel in the French colonial crown, and Abidjan was called the Paris of West Africa. Even now, 20,000 French citizens live in the country, and French corporations are involved in public works and utility projects.
President Jacques Chirac is determined that France play the lead in bringing restoring order.
But President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal, the current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, said recently that regional troops could not be sent until the rebels and the government reached a political settlement.
That means that French troops may have to stay. France "can leave 2,500 men in Ivory Coast for some years if need be," General Bentegeat said on Sunday, if that is required to negotiate a political solution.

HEADLINE: Michigan to Drop Minimum Sentence Rules for Drug Crimes 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Dec. 25 

 BODY:
Karen Shook was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1993 for arranging a drug deal for a man who turned out to be an undercover police officer. But Ms. Shook, a former bank teller, could be paroled 10 years early under legislation expected to be signed by the governor in the next week to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes. 
 Michigan is one of several states revising mandatory minimum sentences. Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey and North Carolina are also considering eliminating such rules, said Laura Sager, executive director of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington group. 
 Michigan Department of Corrections officials do not know how many of the state's 49,296 inmates could be eligible for parole under the legislation, which would take effect March 1. But supporters of the legislation said the state's skyrocketing prison population made the law necessary.
Critics of Michigan's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines have pushed for changes for years, but economic difficulties may ultimately have led to their elimination.
The state, facing a $1.5 billion general fund deficit in the coming fiscal year, spends about $1.4 billion a year on its prison population, or an average of $28,000 for each inmate, said Russ Marlan, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections.
This month, as the Legislature struggled with the state budget, it approved eliminating mandatory sentences. The departing governor, John Engler, a Republican, supports the move. 
Laurie Quick, Ms. Shook's sister, said her family did not know about the state's strict sentencing guidelines until Ms. Shook, now 49, was arrested.
"It's been a nightmare," Ms. Quick said. "She has seen murderers and other convicted felons come and leave since she's been there. It's cruel."
Although the Michigan legislation would make some offenders eligible for early parole, a decision about their release is ultimately up to the parole board. Drug offenders have the highest rate of parole, at 72 percent, Mr. Marlan said.
Nearly 62 percent of other nonviolent offenders receive parole when they are first eligible, followed by violent offenders at 40 percent and sex offenders at 15 percent, he said.
The legislation requires judges to follow state guidelines when sentencing criminals to prison. But eliminating mandatory minimums will give them much more discretion.
"The time had come to make the change," said David Morse, the Livingston County prosecutor. "The idea of stiff severe penalties for drug kingpins was a problem because we weren't getting those kingpins. We were getting people who were carrying on behalf of kingpins."
Under current law, Michigan judges are allowed to deviate from the mandatory minimum guidelines only in extraordinary circumstances.
Now, the law requires a sentence of at least 10 years and up to 20 years in prison for a person convicted of possessing 50 to 224 grams of narcotics or cocaine. The legislation would allow the judge to impose any sentence up to 20 years.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Unions and advocacy groups are putting a Madison Avenue finesse on their protest ads.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
A HIGH-GLOSS commercial that was broadcast during shows like "The West Wing" and "60 Minutes" this month bore all the hallmarks of a big company's branding campaign.
 In the spot, which looked like it was shot on film, warmly lit workers and their families stood on a spartan, elegant set to tell about their extraordinary service to New York City after the attacks of Sept. 11. 
 But this was not a typical call to consumerism. The employees, members of the Communications Workers of America, quickly called on their employer, Verizon Communications, to abandon its plans to lay off thousands of workers, charging that Verizon should address bad customer service and overpaid executives before dismissing workers. 
The union is not alone in putting a Madison Avenue polish on protest advertising. From the Evangelical Environmental Network, creators of the "What Would Jesus Drive?" fuel-efficiency campaign, to Survival International, which covered a De Beers billboard of a model with a look-alike plea for indigenous people, many advocacy groups are displaying more marketing acumen than ever, copying mainstream advertising in humor, sex appeal and appealing imagery.
"Advertising today is extremely sophisticated, and most consumers are extremely sophisticated," said Hugh Hough, president and creative director at Green Team Advertising in New York, which specializes in cause-related marketing like its promotion for its client City Harvest at Pret A Manger sandwich shops in New York. "Why not mimic the best of the best, who are spending millions of dollars in research?"
Grass-roots flavor and moral weight can no longer compete with the polished, engaging tone of consumer advertising, said Dan Mathews, vice president for campaigns at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, known as PETA.
"Once upon a time, when hippies ruled the earth, you wanted to avoid looking too slick," Mr. Mathews said. "Nowadays, slick is the only thing that much of the masses understand."
PETA was an early adopter of corporate advertising techniques, shifting the emphasis of its anti-fur campaign a decade ago, for example, from animals writhing in leg-hold traps to models posing in the buff (on the premise that the models would rather go naked than wear fur).
Other groups are increasingly trying to learn from Madison Avenue in various ways, but with mixed results.
When Survival International in London wanted to link diamond exploration by De Beers to the dislocation of native Bushmen in central Africa, it covered a billboard showing the model Iman wearing a De Beers diamond with a near-exact mock-up. But the new billboard replaced Iman with a woman from the Bushmen group and parodied the De Beers slogan, "A diamond is forever," with the line, "The Bushmen aren't forever." The mock ad attracted widespread attention, but also a threat of a lawsuit from De Beers, which denied any connection between diamond mining and the Bushmen's relocation.
And last month's "What Would Jesus Drive?" campaign used its lighthearted play on "What Would Jesus Do," a popular evangelical Christian slogan, to turn a $65,000 budget into a blizzard of media coverage in outlets like Time magazine, NBC Nightly News, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
But the Donor Awareness Council in Denver, part of the Coalition on Donation, misfired last year with an elaborate 30-second commercial to spread the message that organ donation saves lives. The spot shows a tombstone carver at work in his cluttered shop, lamenting in a voiceover that people are not dying in the numbers they used to, forcing him to diversify his business. The camera leans over his shoulder and finds his latest work: a miniature tombstone for a gerbil. 
Young adults liked the humor, but it failed with older viewers, who found the commercial too conceptual, said Marlene Murphy, executive director at the Donor Awareness Council. "It was a very big lesson for us," she said. 
"With a mainstream audience, you have to be pretty clear, especially with advocacy ads," Ms. Murphy added.
The gerbil commercial cost about $25,000 to produce, said Jonathan Schoenberg, creative director at TDA Advertising and Design in Boulder, Colo., which made it. But the agency produced a second commercial for only $900, showing snapshots of people who had benefited from organ transplants. That was a smash.
For its part, the national Coalition on Donation is taking a page from modern corporate marketing playbooks and complementing its longstanding general advertising campaign with efforts aimed at particular ethnic groups, Ms. Murphy said. In January it will begin a campaign focused directly on blacks, after last-year's introduction of a campaign that aimed for Spanish speakers.
Like any conventional ad, the anti-Verizon commercial from the Communications Workers of America had to cut through the on-air clutter somehow. "Sometimes that's having some kind of 'wow factor,' " said Greg Pinelo, partner and creative director at GMMB in Washington, part of the Omnicom Group and the union's agency. But in this case, speaking a little more softly seemed to work just as well, he said.
The agency also wanted to marry a sincere pitch with quality presentation. "I wanted it to stand out for the emotional case we were making, but I didn't want it to feel fly-by-night or cheap," Mr. Pinelo said.
Toward that end, GMMB used high-definition video cameras instead of choosing either low-quality video or expensive 35-millimeter film. Other ad agencies specializing in cause-related advertising are doing the same, pumping up quality and cutting costs, Mr. Pinelo said. "Issue and advocacy advertising is looking better and better every day."
Despite better and cheaper production technology, cost remains a major barrier between advocacy groups and corporate-style campaigns. Survival International has no ad budget, for example.
In that context, glossy ad campaigns might be the last thing that protest groups should be spending their money on, said James Twitchell, professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida in Gainesville. 
"Here's a case where you should be saving your advertising dollars and spending it on public relations," Mr. Twitchell said of advocacy groups. "The clever placement of news is much more efficacious than advertising."
Americans, whether they consume products or ideas, are much more immunized to advertising than to news stories, he argued. "It's perfectly possible to love an ad and for it to not be effective."
The effort from the Communications Workers of America may be a case in point. A Verizon spokesman, John Bonomo, called the union's campaign "lavishly produced" but naive and inaccurate. "We felt that their ads," Mr. Bonomo said, "were missing the issues entirely, the economic, regulatory and technology issues that were and are really having a dramatic effect on the telecommunications industry in general and Verizon in particular." Last week, the company laid off more than 2,700 workers in New York and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Down, Partly In Reaction To Wall St. 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
Asian investors sold stocks today with shares in Tokyo leading most markets lower, partly in response to weak holiday sales in the United States. 
 The decline here, one of a relatively few markets open on Christmas Day, edged down, after a lower close Tuesday on Wall Street. 
 On Taiwan, stocks finished down more than 1 percent. Shares in Thailand were up slightly. 
The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 11.23 points, or 0.13 percent, at 8,501.14. Decliners here included the automakers Honda, Toyota and Nissan. Also lower were some market bellwethers, including Hitachi, Toshiba, Sony and Mitsubishi Electric, all of them among the most heavily traded issues.
Nikkei index stocks have traded near 19-year lows, a pattern interrupted by a meek rebound in recent sessions, including a 1.25 percent advance on Tuesday. 
Most other major Asian markets, including big ones in Hong Kong and South Korea, were closed for Christmas, as were United States and European markets. 
Today's selling in Tokyo came as traders cashed in recent gains on the heels of American losses, spurred in part by an American decline in November of orders to factories for durable goods. 
That was more bad news for investors here. Japan's export-driven economy leans heavily on consumption in the United States, and the economy remains in a decade-long economic slump with little sign of reviving soon. 
Trading was light amid the continued uncertainty about Japan's economy and the effect of a war in Iraq. 
Investors may have also been deterred by the mounting tension between the United States and North Korea. The Communist authorities in Pyongyang are reopening atomic plants and warned on Tuesday that a nuclear crisis is spiraling toward "uncontrollable catastrophe" because of hard-line American policies. 
In Thai trading, shares were mostly flat in early dealings and wound up about half a percent higher. 
"The market is expected to move in a tight range due to the holiday mood," said Phaibool Rachniyom, senior vice president at ABN Amro Asia Securities, "and a lack of positive leads."
Trading was very light, equivalent in value to about $35 million, the least active day in 13 months. 
In currency trading, the dollar sold here late this afternoon at a rate of 120.42 yen, compared with 120.33 yen in New York late Tuesday. 
The yen eased higher despite continued efforts by Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa to talk down the currency's exchange value. A weak yen helps make Japanese exports more competitive in foreign markets and increases the value of overseas revenue when converted back to yen. 
The euro traded here at $1.0324, up from $1.0300 in New York on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: After Zimbabwe's Land Revolution, New Farmers Struggle and Starve 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: KADOMA, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
The ragged farmers shout and whistle as the oxen trudge through the drizzle, dragging a rusty plow through sodden fields. Most passing motorists splash by without a second glance. 
 The withered men look like ordinary peasant farmers. But they have no fertilizer, no irrigation, few seeds and little hope that their crops will flourish in this season of erratic rains. 
 They are the beneficiaries of President Robert Mugabe's agricultural revolution. 
Over the past two years, the government has redistributed nearly all of the country's white-owned farmland to about 300,000 poor black families and 50,000 aspiring black commercial farmers. Of the 4,500 white commercial farmers who once powered the economy by producing tobacco and wheat, about 600 are still trying to farm, mostly on smaller holdings.
Mr. Mugabe, who has led this country since white rule ended in 1980, has hailed the sweeping change as the fulfillment of the black struggle for liberation in Zimbabwe. Many Africans praise him for undoing the legacy of British colonialism, which left a tiny white minority -- less than 1 percent of the population -- with more than half of the country's fertile land.
But the government's chaotic and violent seizure of white-owned farms has come at a price. The economy is collapsing. The land program, coupled with severe drought, has left half the population in need of emergency food. And so far, Mr. Mugabe has failed to transform the agricultural sector into a viable system that can feed the nation and drive the economy.
Vast stretches of previously productive farmland are no longer in use because about half of the aspiring black commercial farmers have failed to take up their allotted farms since August, when most white farmers were told to leave. 
The government, which seized the farms without compensation, still lacks title to most of the land. Many prospective black farmers are reluctant to occupy farms without title deeds because it is nearly impossible to get loans without them. 
Meanwhile, thousands of impoverished, resettled farmers are struggling to survive without seed, fertilizer, irrigation and plowing assistance, basic services that the government has promised. The United Nations says that more than half of the government's tractor fleet -- which was meant to plow fields for the poor -- is out of service because of shortages of spare parts and fuel. 
Officials are so short of seed and fertilizer that many small farmers are sitting idle on plots of land they cannot plant. In Manicaland Province, only about 10 percent of resettled farmers have seed and 17 percent have fertilizer. When seeds are available, the government often provides unsuitable varieties. 
"In most cases, the maize seed supplied is not suitable for the areas in which they have been distributed," the United Nations said in a recent report. Some newly resettled farmers are also going hungry as the country's food shortages worsen. Aid agencies report that farmers in the district of Gwanda have gone without food assistance from the government for three months. Zimbabwe, once one of Africa's most prosperous nations, is now a country of hungry people.
Much of the trouble stems from the haste in which the government tried to distribute land. In a bid to woo disillusioned black voters, officials scrambled to parcel out land to as many people as possible before the presidential election this year. They did so without much planning or coordination.
Government officials say problems are inevitable in any large land redistribution program, particularly at a time of severe drought, and they promise to set things right. They are already warning would-be black commercial farmers that they will lose their land if they do not occupy their farms. 
Officials say they are also stepping up efforts to find inexpensive seed and fertilizer for new farmers. 
"We took it for granted that the supplies would be adequate," Mr. Mugabe said this month in an interview with the state-controlled newspaper, The Herald. "It then proved that we were mistaken," he said. "Seed is short, fertilizer is short and tillage is inadequate. We are working on that."
Officials say the long-term benefits of eliminating racial inequities in the economy outweigh any initial problems, no matter how large. Mr. Mugabe has made it clear that changing course is out of the question. 
"We are at a stage where things are irreversible, and we are happy for it," Mr. Mugabe said in the Herald interview. "For us, the most valuable resource and source of our wealth is our land."
During the colonial era, British settlers stole the country's best land and forced blacks to move to stony, arid communal areas. Mr. Mugabe, who helped lead the struggle against white rule, has repeatedly promised to return the land to blacks over the past two decades. In the beginning, the British government helped finance Mr. Mugabe's land program in an open acknowledgment of colonial misdeeds. After white rule ended in 1980, the British paid for the purchase of land to resettle thousands of black families.
The British ended their support after complaints of corruption and cronyism in the land program began to emerge in the 1990's. In 1998, Western donors agreed yet again on a plan to finance land reform, but that plan collapsed.
In recent years, Western governments have withdrawn all financial aid, aside from food, from Zimbabwe to protest the land seizures and the attacks on the political opposition.
Several white farmers and dozens of black farm workers have been killed by government-backed militants, while thousands of other black farm workers have been evicted and left homeless. The government has also been criticized for giving prime land to prominent officials and political allies.
Officials here continue to insist that blacks will benefit from land reform in the long term, even though they lack adequate financing. Research from Zimbabwe's early experiments with land redistribution shows that resettled people were typically better off several years after they had been given land, even when they had not received any government support. 
"These early problems are inevitable," said Dan Zvobgo, a local official who oversees land reform in the district of Makonde. "It's only a question of time before they are all resolved."
But whether this hasty and poorly coordinated effort will succeed in the long term is hard to judge. Zimbabwe has never attempted such a large land redistribution before. Between 1980 and 1998, about 71,000 families were resettled, officials say. 
This time, the government resettled four times as many households in just two years as officials raced to persuade disillusioned black voters to support Mr. Mugabe and his party in national elections. 
"It's massive by Zimbabwean historical standards and by international standards," said Rogier van den Brink, a land expert at the World Bank who worked in Zimbabwe until recently. 
"A program of this size would need much, much more resources to make it work," Mr. van den Brink said. "To do this type of land reform program in the midst of a macroeconomic crisis is extremely difficult, if not impossible."
But it is happening. Thousands of white farmers have already packed their bags. Some have moved to the cities to wait for the situation to improve. Others have left the country altogether, looking for a new start in South Africa, Mozambique, Britain and Australia. 
"Some people are still waiting for some sort of respite, but a lot of people are leaving now," said Colin Cloete, the president of the Commercial Farmers' Union, which once represented 4,500 white farmers. "Many have decided they never will farm again."
In early December, a group of impoverished black farmers asked the authorities to allow a white farmer to stay on his land because he was providing them with water and helping them to plow their fields. Their request was denied. The white farmer was forced to leave and the black farmers were forced to consider their futures.
Manase Machekano, a 35-year-old resettled farmer, said he was losing hope.
"I wish to plant maize, ground nuts and cotton, but I don't have the seeds," said Mr. Machekano, who was wearing a President Mugabe T-shirt. "The seeds are not coming in time, and soon the season will be over."
Tane Zingwa, an old man with four oxen, also complained that assistance has been slow in coming. He has no fertilizer and few seeds. Soon, he will have no water. Still, he continues to put his faith in the government. 
"What will happen to us?" Mr. Zingwa said. "I don't know. It's up to the government. The government put us here. The government must look after us."

Mr. Zingwa says he is still waiting for government assistance with seed and fertilizer. (Photographs by Joao Silva for The New York Times); (Reuters); (Satellite image by EarthSat) Chart: "THE BIG PICTURE -- Zimbabwe's Land Issues"The crisis over farmland has its roots in the distribution of territory that took place when the area was a British colony, Rhodesia. ZIMBABWE AS A COLONY1890 -- Led by Cecil Rhodes, the British South Africa Company moved into the region, seized land from blacks, and sold most of the fertile land to white settlers. Racial restrictions on land ownership began soon and would persist until the 1970's. AFTER INDEPENDENCE1980 -- After several years of civil war and international diplomacy, elections were held and the former guerrilla leader Robert G. Mugabe became the first leader of Zimbabwe. Plans for redistributing the land began but were only partially successful. 1997-2002Land reform remained an unfulfilled promise as whites still owned much of the best land. Mr. Mugabe announced he would start to seize land without compensation. Tensions intensified as farmers accused Mr. Mugabe of taking the land for cronies and relatives. SUMMER 2002 -- Mr. Mugabe demanded that whites abandon about 4,000 farms, and many farmers were arrested after the deadline passed. NOVEMBER -- Zimbabwe said the land reform process was complete and that Britain should compensate evicted farmers. In Rhodesia, the best farmland was held by whites, who were a tiny minority. 1931 LAND DISTRIBUTIONEUROPEAN AREAS: 51%NATIVE PURCHASE AREAS (Could be purchased by Africans): 8%AREAS RESERVED FOR AFRICANS: 22%OTHER: -- 1964-65LAND DISTRIBUTION (Whites were about 5 percent of the population.)EUROPEAN AREAS: 37%NATIVE PURCHASE AREAS (Could be purchased by Africans): 4%AREAS RESERVED FOR AFRICANS: 42%OTHER: -- RHODESIA 1964 - 65 Map of Rhodesia highlights the locations of the following: European areasNative purchase areasareas reserved for Africans EUROPEAN AREAS, FERTILE ZONESOn the small map at right, moist, fertile soils are dark gray and the driest, leastfertile soils are white.

HEADLINE: City Feels Early Effects Of Plant Closing in 2004 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: GALESBURG, Ill. 

 BODY:
Throughout the 90's, this prairie town of 34,000 felt blessed because it managed to escape the scourge of factory closings that hit Peoria and Decatur and and other heartland communities.
 But when Maytag announced this fall that it was closing the area's largest factory, a refrigerator plant with 1,600 employees, the news hit Galesburg like a bomb. Despite this city's gritty optimism, home prices are slipping, shop owners are complaining about flat Christmas sales, and Maytag workers do not know what to tell their children. 
 "This reflects a lot of what's going on in America, whether it's East Coast, West Coast or Middle West," said Galesburg's mayor, Robert Sheehan. "The economy is changing. People say that's a part of life. When it hits elsewhere, people can just shrug their shoulders and say life goes on. But when it hits your own area, well, then it has a very different meaning. It's going to be tough." 
What has sharpened the pain is that Maytag plans to replace the Galesburg factory, where wages average $15.14 an hour, with a new refrigerator plant in Reynosa, Mexico, with wages around $2 an hour. The company was stung by the fierce anger of workers, Galesburg officials and Illinois lawmakers, who thought concessions they had made since 1994 would be enough to keep the plant here. Maytag explained that its rivals were moving operations to countries with lower wages and that it had to do likewise if it was to continue selling refrigerators at a competitive price.
Suddenly, Galesburg feels it has caught the infection that has hit so much of industrial America: the exodus of factory jobs. With the nation losing two million factory jobs in the past two years, manufacturing employment, now 16.5 million, has sunk to its lowest level in 40 years.
"This used to be a strong factory town," said Robert Eichorn, who opened his jewelry shop on Main Street 47 years ago. "But the factory base is evaporating not only here, but all over the country. They're going to China, Mexico, you name it."
William Beer, president of Maytag's appliance division, said Maytag executives were mindful of the human cost. "We deeply regret that we couldn't identify a cost-effective solution that would allow us to continue long-term production of refrigerators in Galesburg," Mr. Beer said.
The Maytag workers are fuming about the North American Free Trade Agreement, about Maytag's embrace of low-cost labor south of the border and about politicians who trumpet the benefits of free trade.
"This is heartbreaking," said Aaron Kemp, a Maytag worker who attaches door hinges. "This is one of the most unpatriotic, most un-American things I can imagine a company doing. They want Americans to buy their products, but they don't want to put Americans to work making those products."
In many ways, Galesburg epitomizes America. Lincoln debated Douglas here. Carl Sandburg was born in a tiny prairie home alongside the rail yards. As a boy, Ronald Reagan lived at 1260 North Kellogg Street. 
Even though Maytag's layoffs will not begin until next summer and the plant will not be completely shut until 2004, the city's boosters are feeling a pall this Christmas. Galesburg officials fear that once Maytag closes, the city will lose 2,000 other jobs that depend on Maytag -- in distribution, auxiliary industries and retailing.
"Obviously, it's going to be a more somber Christmas than normal," Mr. Kemp said. "For the kids, we'll try to do something normal, but all this puts people under a lot of stress."
Many Maytag employees have little idea what they will do next. 
Take John and Stacy Ester. He has worked at the huge factory for 26 years, she for 8. Her mother worked there for 31 years, a grandmother for 25 and a grandfather for 30. 
"When we went to her family's house for Thanksgiving, there literally wasn't a life in that room that wasn't touched by Maytag's decision," Mr. Ester said.
Ms. Ester said she might return to school to become a medical technician. "I want to look for a career in a medical department somewhere," she said. "That way they can't send my job overseas."
Despite their deep roots here, the Esters are thinking of leaving because there are slim job prospects for John. "I can't believe we might have to move," Ms. Ester said.
Maytag is providing job counseling, and federal money is available to retrain workers who lose their jobs when factories move to other countries. 
Mr. Beer, the appliance division president, said the decision to close the 52-year-old factory was part of Maytag's long-time competitive strategy. 
"Maytag's plans are designed to produce refrigerators more economically and therefore more profitably," he said. "What we did is conduct a study of competitive business strategy, and we don't believe it's possible for the production of side-by-side and top-mount refrigerators in Galesburg to become competitively viable."
Mr. Beer said competitors were already building refrigerators in Mexico. "Labor is certainly lower there, no question about that," he said, adding that most Maytag factories remained in the United States.
The day that Maytag announced the closing here, Wall Street analysts applauded and Maytag's stock jumped 6 percent.
"In today's environment you have to be focused on cost," said Efraim Levy, an appliance industry analyst with Standard & Poor's, "and unfortunately there's a human price."
Maytag has long been respected as a solid, trustworthy company, but that has not stopped workers in Galesburg from attacking it as bitterly as if it were Enron. 
"It's not that Maytag can't still make money in the United States, it's that they can't make enough money," said Dave Bevard, vice president of the machinists' union local representing the Maytag workers. "It's all about corporate greed."
Maytag executives have refused to answer questions about whether the factory is unprofitable, convincing many in Galesburg that the plant is indeed making money. 
Galesburg's anger has been intensified by concessions the state, city and union made to Maytag to persuade it to stay. Beginning in 1994, when Maytag first threatened to leave, the state gave it $7.5 million in grants and loans for training and improvements. Galesburg raised its sales tax by one-quarter percent, raising nearly $3 million to assist Maytag. And in contract negotiations last April, the union accepted concessions that Maytag said it needed to remain competitive, like agreeing to more mandatory overtime and a stricter policy on sick days. 
One local newspaper captured the public's sentiment with the headline, "A City Betrayed." 
"I feel everyone stepped up to the plate," said Doug Dennison, a Maytag worker for 18 years. "The state, the county, the city, the union have all stepped up to the plate. But Maytag has failed to step up to that plate."

HEADLINE: The Korean Crisis 

 BODY:
North Korea's decision to reopen a plutonium reprocessing plant and disable international monitoring equipment at the site is an extremely threatening move that puts the rogue regime on a course to building new nuclear weapons within a matter of a few months. Since pre-emptive military action to disable the plant and other North Korean nuclear installations could not likely be conducted without igniting a catastrophic war on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and its allies must find a peaceful way to persuade Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. Even though Kim Jong Il's autocratic regime has a history of negotiating in bad faith, as shown by its breach of a 1994 agreement, diplomacy still looks more promising than the Bush administration's wishful policy of trying to prevail by simply isolating Pyongyang. 
 While Washington is preoccupied with Iraq, North Korea has abruptly re-emerged as an ominous threat to international security. Given its erratic leadership, its record of exporting missile and other military technologies to American foes and its rekindled nuclear weapons program, North Korea is at least as threatening to global security as Iraq, and probably more so. American intelligence officials suspect that North Korea already has one or two nuclear weapons. North Korea has missiles that can strike Japan and may soon have intercontinental missiles. 
 In an effort to curtail North Korea's weapons programs, the Clinton administration reached a deal with Pyongyang in 1994. In exchange for oil shipments and international assistance in building nuclear power reactors that would not produce material easily upgraded into bomb-making elements, North Korea agreed to forgo its plutonium-based nuclear program. This fall, confronted with hard American intelligence, North Korea admitted it was pursuing an alternative uranium-based program. The Bush administration reimposed economic sanctions in response, and North Korea has now decided to reactivate a reprocessing program that extracts plutonium from spent reactor fuel.
In deciding how to manage the escalating crisis, the Bush administration is understandably wary of rewarding bad behavior and sending a signal to other nations that rich rewards await those who violate nonproliferation agreements. But by itself, engaging in negotiations does not amount to appeasement. Washington could pursue talks without necessarily rushing to lift the economic sanctions, or forswearing the possibility of pursuing sterner measures in the future. 
The alternative policy of refusing to engage North Korea unless and until it abandons its nuclear weapons program only serves Pyongyang's ends and is unlikely to isolate it. That is because the Communist regime is astutely trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. South Korean public opinion strongly favors further engagement. The recent election of Roh Moo Hyun, who campaigned on a platform of reconciliation with the North and more independence from Washington, will only embolden Pyongyang's eagerness to test the solidity of the half-century-old Seoul-Washington alliance. President-elect Roh takes office in late February and it would be a bad idea to hand him a crisis in relations with Washington as his first challenge. 
The Bush administration must engage in multilateral talks to diffuse the crisis. It must continue to press China and Russia to use their leverage with Kim Jong Il to advance certain points. One is that the international community cannot tolerate the existence of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and that Pyongyang cannot expect new security guarantees or economic aid until it shows a willingness to abandon it. Another is that any new deal must have ironclad, on-site monitoring and inspection requirements. Though ultimately detected, North Korea's uranium-based program remained secret for far too long.
Such a stern but diplomatic approach strikes us as more likely to moderate North Korea's conduct and to avert an explosive confrontation. It would also solidify our alliance with South Korea and other regional players. As with Iraq, Washington will have a stronger case to make in favor of alternative action down the road, if needed, if it first engages in diplomacy.

Enron Inquiry Expands To Accounting Basics
Broadening the inquiry into Enron's collapse, federal investigators who have been examining the esoteric details of off-the-books partnership schemes are now looking at such basics as whether the company misled investors about the value of hard assets like pipelines and power plants, according to people involved in the case.
 The new line of inquiry represents a focus on the sort of run-of-the-mill accounting issues that have been raised in numerous corporate fraud cases in the past. Under examination, these people said, is whether Enron carried assets on its books for billions of dollars more than their actual worth. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Downsizing Could Have A Downside 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Even as the economy shows some signs of emerging from the doldrums, several leading companies -- like Goodyear, Humana and Verizon -- are cutting thousands more jobs. 
 They plainly believe that lowering labor rolls now will help them perform better in the long term. But experts on corporate strategy and human resources are not so sure. 
 Some argue that layoffs, combined with a careful revamping, can set the stage for growth. Others, however, contend that companies that avoid cutting jobs reap huge benefits in loyalty and productivity. 
In a quest for the most productive companies in the world, Jason W. Jennings, a consultant and author of a recent book on the subject, settled on 10 businesses that had never made a layoff.
"Not only have they never had a layoff," Mr. Jennings said, "but each of them has a written or well-understood covenant with the workers that the corporate checkbook, or management missteps and misdeeds, are never going to be balanced on the backs of the workers." 
Mr. Jennings, who chose the companies using a combination of elementary financial criteria and on-site research, conceded that he could not prove that a no-layoffs policy led to profits and growth for the group. But he did see something valuable in the strategy of the 10 companies, which included innovators like Nucor Steel, the minimill operator, and Ryanair, the low-cost European airline.
"They know that if they use layoffs," he said, "they're going to end up with a work force that's going to be more concerned about themselves than about increasing productivity."
But the picture is not so simple, according to Peter Cappelli, a Wharton School professor who runs the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania.
"If you look just broadly at whether companies that lay off do better, the answer appears to be no," Professor Cappelli said. But, he added, "the ones that lay off the most are already the ones that are in the most trouble."
In the past, manufacturers responded to cyclical downturns in sales by making temporary layoffs, usually concentrated among blue-collar workers. Often members of unions, the workers were usually rehired for the same jobs when business turned up again.
Many other companies, except those about to collapse, often chose to retain their workers on the theory that layoffs and rehirings were both costly.
Absorbing the expense of wages and benefits allowed the companies to remain ready to take advantage of orders for new business.
But increased competition and investor demands have made companies more aggressive about cutting costs. At the same time, structural changes in the economy -- among them, declines in unionization and the rise of information technology -- have made the labor market more fluid, a trend Professor Cappelli expects to continue. Starting more than a decade ago, with waves of layoffs that also aimed for white-collar workers, many companies began to reconsider the traditional thinking.
The trade-off is a serious matter at the Goldman Sachs Group, whose financial businesses are people intensive. "You want to cut enough excess capacity in down markets to be cost effective, but you don't want to cut so deeply that you can't respond when markets turn up" a Goldman executive said. "Management has certainly been aware of how fine a balance it is."
The company has interspersed at least seven rounds of cuts with several spurts of job growth in the last 15 years. Early this year, the company anticipated trimming about 5 percent of its work force. When business conditions continued to sour, Goldman decided to reduce its numbers by 13 percent, including layoffs and voluntary terminations -- its biggest cuts ever.
Though Mr. Jennings' group of productive companies may not make use of layoffs, those that have done so recently appear to perform no worse than the market. According to news reports, 38 publicly traded companies based in the United States all made more than 1,000 layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2001. From January of this year through last week, their share prices dropped by 22 percent on average -- exactly the same loss suffered by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
In some industries, making job cuts is not a choice. More airlines and telecommunications companies, faced with a steep drop in demand, might have failed if not for hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the last two years. And for many companies outside those hard-hit industries, cutting jobs has always been an important component of strategic change.
The long-troubled Sears, Roebuck & Company -- which has steadily lost ground for years to Wal-Mart and other discounters -- has cut jobs several times. In the late 1980's, it pared down its bureaucracy. In 1993, it cut about 50,000 positions and wound down its catalog sales unit.
"Most of the downsizing has been predominantly due to a shift in business model, rather than directly related to the economy," a spokeswoman for Sears, Peggy A. Palter, said. About a year ago, the company announced thousands more job cuts as it transformed its sales floors.
"Our customer has told us that she's not willing to pay for a higher level of service," Ms. Palter said. "So we've changed our service level in the stores, moving more towards self-service in the smaller ticket items." 
Though a slumping economy may not have caused of all Sears's cuts directly, she added, it still played a role. "Obviously, the economy is one of the factors that changes our customers' perception of what they want from the retailer."
While several experts endorsed downsizing as part of a strategic plan, as Sears has, they differed on the merits of making layoffs simply to cope with temporary slackness in demand. Even with a faster-moving labor market, hiring good people back may not always be easy.
"We don't think that it's a good idea to focus a very high percentage of your organization on leveraging the flexible labor market," said Mark W. Womack, an executive vice president for Celerant Consulting Group. "It's definitely a superior strategy to figure out where your company wants to be in the next couple of years," he said, "and build the right organization, processes and system that align together to take you towards your mission."
Xerox, another long-troubled company that has been repeatedly battered by foreign competitors, has tried to follow that model. The company made 9,000 layoffs in 1998, predicated on a massive revamping, and announced another 2,400 last month in an effort to save money.
"In the past two years, we've been in the process of a pretty major turnaround," a spokeswoman for Xerox, Christa B. Carone, said. "Part of that strategy was looking at ways that we could streamline our business model, which did mean exiting some businesses and eliminating some redundancies. The net result of that is the company did return to profitability, and we've had improving operations over the past couple of years."
Professor Cappelli echoed the principle of Mr. Womack's argument: "If the cuts are part of a restructuring plan where you're doing other stuff as well," he said, "then it's more likely to help." But Professor Cappelli's research on the subject found that companies that reduce their work force for strategic reasons reap fewer benefits than those that lay off workers to deal with excess capacity. The latter type of job cut, he said, "clearly seemed to help."
Mr. Womack advised caution, especially in industries where talented employees are still a scarce commodity, like pharmaceuticals. His firm recently advised a multinational drug manufacturer. "They have to be quite careful about who they let go," Mr. Womack said, "and what's their recruitment plan and what's their retention plan."
In fact, attracting the most skilled workers may be more difficult in economically uncertain times than in booms. In the past decade, Professor Cappelli explained, companies looking for top talent often sought to hire from outside rather than promoting or training their own. Yet these days, a valuable worker may need significant inducements to leave another position.
"If you're offering me a job -- and even if it's a slightly better job than I've got now -- if I think the economy is going to go down, I would absolutely rather stay put," Professor Cappelli said.
That hiring problem may worsen, if demographic forecasts hold true. "We're simply not generating the kind of labor force growth that we have in the past," said Sylvester J. Schieber, director of research at Watson Wyatt, a supplier of professional services. Though the "attract and retain" philosophy may have suffered some blows lately, he predicted that it would return to prominence as higher economic growth led to tighter labor markets.
Xerox is already anticipating that return. While the company cut positions, both in the tight labor market of the late 1990's and in the weaker recent climate, some employees urged management to save more jobs by cutting everyone's pay equally. But Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's chief executive, insisted on maintaining salaries and bonuses for the most productive workers.
"The labor market has changed," Ms. Carone said, "but our strategy for keeping our best people, even during tough times, has not."

HEADLINE: U.N. Expansion Proceeds, Even as Neighbors Object 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration is moving forward with plans to build a 35-story, $350 million office building for the United Nations on a public park near the East River, despite neighborhood opposition.
 The new tower would allow the United Nations to move about 4,500 people out of its headquarters in the crumbling Secretariat building so that the building could be renovated. It would also extend the United Nations campus along First Avenue by one block, to 41st Street. The campus now stretches from 42nd Street to 48th Street. 
 Although the United Nations General Assembly adopted a capital master plan for the project last week, members of the local community board say they are unwilling to go along with it. The city's proposal to replace the parkland used for the office tower with an esplanade along the East River does not adequately offset the loss of a valuable public asset, they said.
"We don't think that's equal to an active park," said Edward Rubin, chairman of the land use committee for Community Board 6. "We won't go easy on this."
The private use of parkland is a particularly volatile issue in densely built Manhattan, where the smallest bit of green space is highly prized. Christian DiPalermo, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, said that Board 6's area, from 14th Street to 59th Street on the East Side, had some of the least amount of land devoted to public parks among the neighborhoods in the city.
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the agency was still working on the plans, which she expected to present to the community board in February.
"The exact plan to mitigate the loss of park space is still being examined," she said. "But possible alternatives include an esplanade along the East River and enhanced utilization of the U.N.'s north lawn."
The proposed 950,000-square-foot office tower for the United Nations would sit on the western half of Robert Moses Playground, a windswept asphalt park on First Avenue, between 41st and 42nd Streets. The park surrounds a 10-story ventilation shaft for the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. A dog run and handball courts at the 1.3-acre playground would go untouched, but an area used for roller hockey would disappear under the new tower.
Mr. Rubin suggested that the city could compensate the community by building a new park of at least equal size on part of the 9.2 acres south of Robert Moses Playground. Developers have proposed creating a vast office and residential complex on that property. The developers, the Fisher real estate family and Sheldon H. Solow, had hoped that the United Nations would be a tenant for that project.
But months ago, the developers told Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff that it made more sense to leave the playground alone and build the new United Nations tower on their property. They have argued that using that property for the tower would also avoid potential security problems related to building over the Queens-Midtown tunnel.
The developers are buying the land from Consolidated Edison, which recently tore down a nearby nine-story office tower at 708 First Avenue.
The city and the United Nations Development Corporation, however, have persisted with plans to build on the park because the United Nations wants to control, rather than lease, the building.
On Dec. 20, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a capital plan, which set a $1.05 billion construction budget for the renovation of the landmark glass and marble Secretariat building. The building, which is 50 years old, is plagued by outmoded ventilation systems, exploding steam valves, falling concrete, asbestos and lead paint.
Under the plan, the United Nations would move in 2004 to the newly built tower for five years, until the renovation of the Secretariat is completed. A tunnel would connect the new tower to the old United Nations campus.
When the headquarters reopens, the United Nations would consolidate its other programs and agencies into the new tower. That would enable the city to sell the buildings at 1, 2 and 3 United Nations Plaza.
The United Nations hopes to obtain a long-term $1 billion loan from the United States for the project. In all likelihood, the United Nations Development Corporation, an agency created by the city and the state, would issue bonds for the separate development of the 35-story tower. But first, the agency would have to go to the State Legislature for permission to build on a public park.

To the Editor:
 "A Barn-Raising for the Internet Age" (Dec. 19), on Mississippi high school students who are building computers for their state's cash-strapped schools, was inspiring. 
 If schools can save money while student assemblers learn valuable skills, why couldn't we do this with some of our nation's two million prisoners? Many would jump at the opportunity to acquire technical training and experience in the new economy and, yes, do social good.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
Losing Contreras, Red Sox May Be Winners

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
In ordinary times, the poor, downtrodden, oppressed people would have no chance against the evil empire, no recourse to counter the import of a foreign addition to the already formidable force the enemy had amassed. 
 But these are not ordinary times. While the Yankees, a k a the Evil Empire, as designated by Boston's chief executive, add expensive players on a weekly basis, other teams are shedding players for economic reasons. 
 One of those players just happens to be available for Boston's taking. Bartolo Colon would fit into its rotation as snugly as Jose Contreras will in the Yankees' rotation. 
In fact, one general manager suggested yesterday that by losing out on Contreras, a Cuban defector, the Red Sox could come out ahead. If they acquire Colon instead, the general manager said, the Red Sox would probably have the best 1-2-3 starters in the game.
Pedro Martinez, Colon and Derek Lowe were three of the major leagues' six 20-game winners last season. Choose any three of the Yankees' multitude of starters -- Mike Mussina, Contreras, David Wells; Mussina, Contreras, Andy Pettitte; Roger Clemens, Mussina, Contreras; Wells, Pettitte, Contreras -- and they might not be as dominant as those three.
However good Contreras may turn out to be, Colon has already established himself as a top-flight, head-of-the-rotation pitcher. He not only won 20 games last season, 10 each with Cleveland and Montreal, but he also tied for the major league lead in complete games (eight) and was sixth in innings (233 1/3).
At 27, four years younger than Contreras, if Contreras's age is to be believed, Colon can be an impact pitcher. And any impact anyone can make in the American League East could determine the outcome of the division race.
The Expos, who acquired Colon from the Indians last season in one of the most stunning trades in years, have talked to several teams about trading him. They probably have to trade two of their highest-paid players to get their payroll to the $40 million area mandated by the team's owner, Major League Baseball.
At the winter meetings in Nashville this month, Omar Minaya, the Expos' general manager, tried to get the Yankees and the Red Sox competing with each other for Colon, but they rejected his proposals.
From the Yankees, Minaya wanted first baseman Nick Johnson, outfielder Juan Rivera and pitcher Orlando Hernandez, and enough cash to pay Hernandez's $5 million or so salary next season. The Yankees countered by offering Johnson alone.
Minaya asked the Red Sox for third baseman Shea Hillenbrand, pitcher Casey Fossum and a minor league prospect, and wanted them to take third baseman Fernando Tatis and his $6.25 million salary. The Red Sox rejected the Tatis idea and offered only Hillenbrand and prospects.
In the immediate aftermath of the Yankees' signing of Contreras on Tuesday for four years and $32 million, some people thought the Expos' leverage in their attempt to trade Colon had been reduced. But the fact that the Yankees got Contreras, whom the Red Sox dearly desired, left the Red Sox minus a pitcher and the Yankees on the plus side.
If the Red Sox want to keep pace with the Yankees, they will not want to pass up the opportunity to acquire Colon. They may not have to take Tatis to get him, but they cannot expect to induce the Expos to surrender Colon to them.
The Red Sox are not the only team interested in Colon. The Florida Marlins have been pressing to get him, and the Chicago White Sox have expressed serious interest.
If, when their talks resume, the Expos continue to ask for Hillenbrand and Fossum, it would behoove the Red Sox to say yes. They have talked about trading Hillenbrand anyway, and Fossum is not an integral part of their rotation.
Boston's desire to at least keep pace with the Yankees, with players, if not expenditures, is fueled by its desire to supplant the Yankees at the top of the A.L. East but also by the bitter relationship between Larry Lucchino, the Boston president, and George Steinbrenner.
"Steinbrenner has aimed all his venom at Lucchino," a baseball official said. "He told his people, 'Lose Contreras and you're done.' "
When Lucchino was contacted after the Yankees won Contreras, he initially offered a brusque "no comment." Then he changed his position.
"No, I'll make a comment," he said. "The evil empire extends its tentacles even into Latin America." Adding another comment, he called the Yankees' acquisition of Contreras ludicrous, echoing the view of officials of just about every other team, not to mention central baseball.
The Red Sox apparently did not offer Contreras as much money as the Yankees. One official said the Red Sox offered four years for $26 million or $27 million. But Gordon Blakeley, the Yankees official who negotiated with Contreras's agent in Nicaragua, Jaime Torres, said that when Torres told Theo Epstein, the Boston general manager, that he had a deal with the Yankees, Epstein "indicated that he could get them more money than that."
A person who was told about the negotiations, however, said that Contreras wanted to sign with the Yankees and took their offer because he did not want to take a chance that they would not stay in it if the Red Sox offered more than $32 million. What he did not know was that the Yankees were most likely prepared to offer whatever it would have taken to make sure the Red Sox did not get him.
Now it's Boston's turn to add a pitcher, name of Colon. The Yankees aren't likely to go after him, too. Or are they?

HEADLINE: Civil Rights Museum Planned for King Home 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec. 25 

 BODY:
The house where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lived in 1955 as he led the Montgomery bus boycott is undergoing a $300,000 renovation to become a living history museum.
 The project, scheduled for completion in 2004, a year before the 50th anniversary of the historic boycott, will be the latest addition to the Montgomery area's growing number of restored civil rights landmarks. 
 "It was the scene of a lot of the hustle and bustle at the height of the civil rights movement," said the Rev. Michael Thurman, the pastor at King's former church, now known as the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church. The house was bombed in 1956, with Coretta Scott King, the Kings' young daughter and a church member inside. No one was injured. 
Thomas McPherson, vice president of a foundation formed a year ago to raise money to restore the house, said the building was used as a parsonage until 1994 and has been empty since then.
Mr. McPherson said the main focus of the museum would be to give visitors a feel for the era when King wrote sermons before he was catapulted into the international spotlight.
"We have the desk and the chair he worked in while he lived there," Mr. McPherson said.
Plans for the 2,000-square-foot house, which has a four-column porch, hardwood floors and a fireplace, include reupholstering much of the original furniture from the Kings' bedroom and living room.
King and his family lived in the house from 1954 to 1960, when his oratorical and leadership skills brought the growing civil rights movement to a head and he left to become a full-time organizer.
The foundation has received a $240,000 community development block grant from the city and $70,000 from church members. The Alabama Historical Commission has contributed $50,000 to the project.
The house is in a neighborhood known as Centennial Hill, which was developed in the late 1870's and was the first substantial black residential neighborhood in Montgomery. Teachers, ministers, doctors and businessmen made their homes in the neighborhood, which is bordered at one end by historically black Alabama State University.
"It was our hope the parsonage would become the catalyst around which other buildings in the community would be restored," Mr. Thurman said.
Jim Carrier, a writer who has researched a travel book on Southern civil rights landmarks to be published next year, said the restoration of the parsonage was the latest site related to the civil rights era to be built or renovated in the Montgomery area.
Others include the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma, the starting point for the Selma-to-Montgomery march that led to the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Rosa Parks Museum, which opened two years ago at the downtown Montgomery site where Ms. Parks was arrested for refusing to give her bus seat to a white man, inspiring the boycott. In addition, a visitor's center is planned at the Civil Rights Memorial at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
"In a number of years, Montgomery actually will have more civil rights sites to see than any place in the South," Mr. Carrier said.
He said the museums were a result of a thirst for knowledge about the civil rights era and a demand for tours of historic sites throughout the South. 
As the 50th anniversary of the bus boycott nears -- along with the completion of civil rights projects -- Mr. Carrier said Montgomery and its landmarks will get more attention. 
"Right now visitors can see what there is to see in about an hour," he said. "But when you open three or four different museums and centers, I think we're going to see people from all over the world."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
How Many Actors Does It Take to Make a Log Talk?

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL

 BODY:
Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's "Pinocchio" that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott; the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day. A recent -- very recent -- decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. 
 That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-syncing. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. 
 In this enchanted setting, "a land where grown-ups can act like children," a magic log falls off a cart and disrupts an entire tiny town. It bounces into Geppetto's home-workshop, and he quickly says, "You can be like the son I never had" as he carves into it his idea of a little boy. I guess Geppetto doesn't get out much, because his idea of a child is a 40-ish man with a receding hairline, pancake makeup and 5 o'clock shadow: the Pinocchio he fashions is Mr. Benigni. (It's particularly galling as Pinocchio makes fun of Geppetto's blond hairpiece, which looks like the thatched roof of a hut.) "You're made out of pine; I'll call you Pinocchio," Geppetto says, struggling to get a word in over Pinocchio's constant bleating.
This movie is also a chunk of pine, but it's still awaiting the magic touch to transmute it into a real live movie. "Pinocchio" opens with the Blue Fairy (played by Nicoletta Braschi, voiced by Glenn Close) coming into a small town, riding a carriage pulled by a train of little white mice: an undulating river of full-moon-colored fur towing her along. It's one of the few splashes of wonderment -- courtesy of the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, and the production designer-magician, Danilo Donati -- in a picture that is mostly a desert of strangeness, a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes "Battleship Earth" and "Showgirls." The heavy sighs of the few other people in the theater, who apparently had been paroled into the custody of the multiplex, were easily heard over the long, dead silences between Pinocchio-Benigni's chattering.
Geppetto encourages Pinocchio to go to school, but he's not interested. When he is visited by a talking insect named Cricket (voice of John Cleese), who must have danced over from the magical land of copyright infringement, Pinocchio blathers, "One job I want: the job of eating, drinking and playing."
Cricket scolds Pinocchio so often with "Serves you right" over his misbehaving that the little creature begins to sound like a rehab counselor. The Blue Fairy keeps an eye on Pinocchio, listening to his promises to be good. He always lets her down, and she keeps coming back; the subtitle should be "When Good Fairies Love Bad Puppets." 
Geppetto is a sucker for Pinocchio's word much longer than he should be, too, though their relationship is more obviously informed by delusion. It's hard to tell what's sadder, Geppetto's belief that Pinocchio is a child puppet or Mr. Benigni's need to play one. When he affectionately smooches Geppetto's face, it's like Jack playing out one of his outre fantasies on "Will and Grace." 
Other scenes of unintentional innuendo can be found. While Pinocchio is pulling one of his many jail stretches for a crime he didn't commit -- he spends more time in manacles that Enron's senior executives -- one of his cellmates, another adult under the illusion that he's a boy, offers a lick of a lollipop that's "the flavor of paradise." How did this movie get past the Motion Picture Association?
Mr. Benigni's decision makes this "Pinocchio" as believable as Diana Ross playing Dorothy in "The Wiz" or Matthew McConaughey portraying a college graduate in "Contact." The movie does follow Collodi's sweeping ebb and flow closely. 
Occasionally the inflation works well. The whale that swallows Pinocchio and Geppetto whole is now a great white shark. And when Pinocchio is swindled into joining a pack of party boys and is turned into a donkey, the scene in which he becomes a circus beast of burden borders on touching. That is, it would if there had been an actress other than Ms. Braschi, with her Mona Lisa inexpressiveness, watching the affair. (With her blue-gelatin hair, she looks like an older version of post-punker Siouxsie, from the Banshees.)
It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new "Pinocchio." Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden.

 BODY:
Each day, fierce-looking young students set up makeshift roadblocks in this desolate corner of Pakistan, ignoring the dust that coats their faces and stings their eyes and dries their throats. Their only desire, it seems, is to please their teachers and, by extension, their God.
 They string ropes across the road and demand that drivers stop and make contributions to their religious schools. Filled with the certitude of youth, they berate the drivers who refuse to stop and acknowledge the righteousness of their cause. 
 The boys are students of the hard-line madrasas, or Islamic religious schools, that fill Pakistan's tribal areas, a 350-by-25-mile strip of impossibly rugged mountain terrain that snakes along the border with Afghanistan. 
In the last several months, the tribal areas have emerged as a growing source of frustration for American forces in Afghanistan and F.B.I. agents in Pakistan. Raids by bureau agents have failed to capture the small number of Arab members of Al Qaeda -- possibly even Osama bin Laden himself -- who are believed to be hiding in the tribal areas. 
American forces in Afghanistan are increasingly frustrated by their inability to pursue gunmen who fire at them and then flee over the porous border into the tribal areas. 
At the same time, religious hard-liners have gained ground here. Islamic candidates vowing to expel American agents from Pakistan swept the tribal areas in recent legislative elections, and local leaders are demanding that all American activity in the area stop. As a result, a year after the Taliban's fall, the tribal areas are emerging as a newly emboldened stronghold of Islamic militancy.
A recent visit to the area confirmed that opposition to the United States is vehement and growing. In an interview, six tribal leaders gathered here by Pakistani officials demanded that the Pakistani Army be solely responsible for security and that American raids end. 
They were adamantly opposed to allowing American forces in Afghanistan to enter Pakistan and warned that F.B.I. agents could face violence if they returned. "We will take steps," said Ghulbat Khan, one of the tribal leaders. "Sometimes a trifling incident can lead to a great quarrel."
The reason for the opposition is simple, according to Pakistani experts. The tribal areas remain isolated and underdeveloped, a place of widespread support for the Taliban and Al Qaeda, fueled in part by false information, and Americans are seen as anti-Muslim invaders. 
Asked why Americans were not welcome, Sangin Khan, an unemployed man, said, "America is killing Muslims all over the world." 
Some experts question whether the raids are worth continuing, considering the resentment they stir up. Pakistani officials said that even though at least 10 joint American-Pakistani raids had been conducted in the tribal areas in the last year, not a single high-level Qaeda or Taliban member had been caught. After initial sweeps last winter netted several hundred fleeing Taliban and Qaeda, only a handful of low-level Afghans and Uzbeks have been arrested or killed in the last six months.
"They haven't caught anyone, and they have caused a lot of anger," said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a leading Pakistani journalist. "I don't think they should be doing it anymore until they have proper intelligence."
Pakistanis said American agents hampered by weak human intelligence sources were offering potential informers cash, in amounts like $400 a month. But, they said, the informers are providing bad information that leads the agents to raid the same religious schools and mosques repeatedly.
"The Americans 15 to 20 times have disgraced our soil and our sacred mosques," Ghulbat Khan complained. "Despite their hectic efforts, they have not produced a single man, not a single one."
Mr. Yusufzai, the journalist, said that if there were Qaeda members hiding in the tribal lands, it was only thanks to the inhabitants. "Without local support," he said, "you cannot hide in the tribal areas."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Working families are often among the first to suffer when a country loses its sense of optimism.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union. His book "Why Economies Grow" was recently published by Basic Books. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE Christmas season should be a time of renewed optimism, but the weak economy and the prospect of war seem to have dampened more than the nation's desire to shop. Its spirit has been subdued as well. Is it possible that the nation is now too conscious of its domestic limits?
 Read the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Mike Wallace's new book, "A New Deal for New York" (Bell & Weiland), for a reminder of what a true optimist can envision. It is a burst of light on a dark national scene. Mr. Wallace (not to be confused with the CBS News correspondent) is a dedicated government man, and there is a bit of fantasy in the book. But he is also a writer with a new vision for a grief-torn city -- of new subway lines and river crossings, new parks and subsidized housing, revitalized manufacturing and diversified communities, and a restored faith in city life itself. 
 Judging by some of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's recent suggestions for the development of lower Manhattan, Mr. Wallace's book may be having an influence.
How does this apply to the nation? We could easily focus on needed initiatives in several areas like education, health care or transportation. But let me emphasize just one area in which this listless national attitude is taking a toll.
A demanding economy has put growing strains on family life. Much has been written about the subject. Fully two-thirds of mothers with small children now work. In 60 percent of families, both mother and father work. In the typical family, the mother and father work a combined 81 hours a week.
Yet in the November elections, neither political party paid serious attention to this issue. At the very least, workers need flexible hours to meet family needs, as well as time off for sickness and to attend to aging parents.
Eileen Appelbaum, an economist at Rutgers University and a longtime student of these issues, found that through the late 1990's there was almost no increase in the proportion of workers who could control the hours they worked. Politicians and pundits told us we were in the throes of unprecedented prosperity. But according to that recently released survey, the proportion of workers who were allowed to determine either the starting or ending time of their work day rose only marginally, from 27.6 percent in 1997 to 28.8 percent in 2001.
Flexibility is also distributed unequally. Some 64 percent of lawyers and judges, for example, have flexible hours. Some 59 percent of scientists and computer technicians do. Even 55 percent of sales representatives do, if we do not count retail clerks. By contrast, only 10 percent of machine operators are entitled to flexible hours. Fewer than 8 percent of teachers are.
Some jobs must start at a specific time. But why don't executives have to be in on time as often as machine operators? The bias against lower-paid and less-influential workers is disturbingly evident, with all the implications that holds. For example, a smaller proportion of African-Americans have flexible hours.
The inattention to family-friendly policies goes well beyond flexible hours. Compared with corporations in other nations, those in the United States are far less generous with women workers who have newborn babies. Professor Appelbaum, who also runs the Center for Designing Work Wisely in Washington, recently visited other countries to see how they handle matters. In Sweden, a worker can request a six-hour day until her child is 8, for example. In Japan, a mother can receive paid maternity leave for a year at 40 percent of her salary. Moreover, companies in some countries make it easier for women to stay on a long-term career track even when they have babies or must work fewer hours.
Arguably, some of these nations are too generous. But the United States is stagnating or even moving in the opposite direction in many areas. Over the 1990's, the proportion of workers with paid holidays in companies with 100 or more employees fell from 99 percent to 89 percent. The proportion of those with paid sick leave fell from 89 percent to 56 percent. 
As for flexible hours, it costs companies little to institute such policies. For some, in fact, such a policy has been a way to attract and keep the best workers. It may also improve productivity. One recent survey found that workers with flexible hours actually put in a few hours more a week than do those without flexible hours.
The role for government is clear. Use mandates and perhaps tax credits to encourage flexible hours. Corporations should be required to establish more substantial paid leave for sickness, maternity and other family needs. Part-time workers require more protection. They should share in corporate benefits and receive wages similar to those with full-time jobs. And the nation should at last be paying for early child care and day care for working parents.
There we go again, some say. The United States and its private sector cannot afford a wider social net. When it comes to some issues, we have convinced ourselves that we are poor. But in a time when gains in private wealth increased at rates not seen since the Robber Baron era of the late 1800's, the nation can afford such changes.
Instead, President Bush will propose and Congress will surely pass still more tax cuts, largely benefiting those who gained the most from the boom of the 1990's. Moreover, the war on terrorism and in Iraq would be costly, and the peace might be even costlier. 
Many in Washington insist that we are doing very well, or even that we could hardly be doing much better. These are, in truth, the nation's new pessimists. Only a few in Washington are talking about critical domestic needs in a changing economy, but they are the real optimists.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ENERGY; 
Growing U.S. Need for Oil From the Mideast Is Forecast

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Dec. 25 

 BODY:
As President Bush seeks to reduce American reliance on oil imported from the Persian Gulf, new government studies predict that in two decades the West will be even more dependent on oil from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern producers.
 Mr. Bush, asked a week ago on the ABC News program "20/20" about the importance of Saudi Arabian oil, said that "we must have an energy policy that diversifies away from dependency" on foreign sources of oil -- including some that "don't like America." 
 Late last month, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration forecast that in 2025 the majority -- 51 percent -- of world oil production would come from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. About two-thirds of OPEC production, in turn, emanates from the Persian Gulf. The Energy Information Administration, or E.I.A., says OPEC now produces 38 percent of the world's oil. 
The information administration projects that Saudi Arabia will need to produce 22 million barrels a day by 2020 to meet increased world demand, far in excess of its current production of about 8 million barrels.
"We're going to rely more and more on the Middle East markets for oil," said Fatih Birol, the chief economist for the Paris-based International Energy Agency, or I.E.A. The group's recent World Energy Outlook, which estimates energy markets through 2030, mirrors the forecast of the American energy agency.
Government and industry oil experts widely agree that it makes sense for the United States to diversify its sources of energy. It is also possible that in the next decade increased oil from the Atlantic Basin and the Caspian Sea could make a short-term dent in American dependency on the Middle East.
"Our dependency on the Persian Gulf could take a slight dip before it goes up," said John Brodman, the deputy assistant secretary of energy for international energy policy. "But the basic geological fact of life is that 70 percent of the proven oil reserves are in the Middle East."
The importance of Saudi Arabia to long-term oil markets is different from its ability to produce extra oil quickly -- an ability sometimes referred to as surge capacity. If oil markets were disrupted by a war in Iraq or strikes in Venezuela, only Saudi Arabia could increase its production within a few months to fill the gap.
The new forecasts highlight a fundamental quandary facing the United States: American dependence on Saudi oil limits the strategic options of the United States even as relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia have been strained since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. 
President Bush's national security strategy, released in September, aimed to "enhance energy security" by having the United States work with allies to "expand the sources and types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, Central Asia and the Caspian region."
The strategy did not mention the Persian Gulf region, which figures so prominently in the latest forecasts.
The ability of countries like Saudi Arabia to increase their production significantly is by no means a certainty. The Energy Information Administration estimates assume that "sufficient capital will be available to expand production capacity."
Furthermore, some oil experts question whether the region's old fields will be up to the task.
"The giant and supergiant oil fields are getting old, and some are clearly dying without being replaced," said Ali Morteza Samsam Bakhtiari, a senior official in the National Iranian Oil Company. In an e-mail message sent from Iran, he questioned whether Saudi Arabia was capable of reaching 22 million barrels a day and said it would take "a miracle for OPEC to ever achieve a production of 50 million barrels per day (or more) as all three major institutions -- I.E.A., E.I.A. and OPEC -- are predicting for 2020."

HEADLINE: G.E. Research Returns to Roots; 
Management Again Gambles On Costly Long-Term Ideas

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: NISKAYUNA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Anil Duggal is 37 years old, but he looks like a mischievous boy as he turns his office lights low. He hits a button and grins gleefully as the flat panel he holds generates a white glow bright enough to light the room.
 The panel is made from thin sheets of specially treated plastic on glass that seems to generate almost as much light from a small jolt of electricity as an incandescent light bulb running on standard current. 
 If Mr. Duggal and his team of researchers at the General Electric Global Research Center in this small town not far from Schenectady can figure out how to dispense with the glass, they could be a short hop away from developing super-thin lighting and energy sources that could be rolled off printing presses like newspapers. And that could usher in an era of cheap, clean-burning lights, batteries, solar cells -- and the beginning of plastic-based electronics. 
These days, Mr. Duggal's laboratory, where he specializes in light and energy, is a regular stop for Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, as well as the heads of G.E.'s businesses. Mr. Duggal reassures them that his project is a question of when, not if, and that he is meeting research milestones. But he does not promise a new product any time soon, and no one pressures him to do so.
"People used to ask for quarterly progress reports, and I had to struggle to get funding renewed," said Mr. Duggal, who joined G.E. in 1992. "Now I feel I have at least two years before I have to show progress."
For G.E., that change is nearly as radical as the science being pursued. John F. Welch Jr., Mr. Immelt's predecessor, spent two decades pushing the Niskayuna lab to churn out profitable products. Now Mr. Immelt is letting it return to the mission that Charles P. Steinmetz, a G.E. engineer who set up the lab, laid forth more than 100 years ago.
"Steinmetz did not want this lab to worry about next quarter's product," said Scott C. Donnelly, senior vice president for research. "He wanted it to work on the next big idea, even as G.E.'s businesses were refining the last one."
The numbers reflect the shift back to those roots. Two years ago the central lab spent $28 million, or only about 10 percent of its $286 million budget, on long-term projects. This year, $91 million of the center's $344 million budget has gone to such research; next year, the center's team expects to direct $104 million -- almost 30 percent of its $349 million budget -- to long-range projects.
Some of the money comes from G.E.'s business units. But it is not used to improve whistles or polish bells.
"When Aircraft Engines wants a turbine blade, or Medical Systems wants a CT scanner that does thinner slices, we say 'Hey guys, you are capable of doing that yourself,' " Mr. Donnelly said. "We use the central lab to study things that require major technological breakthroughs."
The business leaders have bought into that idea. "I come up regularly to make sure that the stuff they are looking at will make a difference in the marketplace," said John G. Rice, president of GE Power Systems. "It just doesn't have to make a difference in three or even five years."
Some projects will be dead ends. On others, G.E. may be beaten to market by one of the start-ups carving niches in biotechnology, nanotechnology and other modern-day sciences.
But G.E. must take the gamble. Its industrial businesses are suffering in the sluggish economy and its insurance units are still reeling from losses associated with last year's terrorist attacks. Competitors like Siemens, Royal Philips Electronics and United Technologies are all stepping up long-term research. And G.E.'s executives know that if they are first to introduce innovative products, they will grab customers not just for equipment, but for the lucrative contracts to service that equipment.
"Jack Welch won the socket wars, the battle to stay ahead with tangible products," said Nicholas P. Heymann, who follows G.E. for Prudential Securities. "Jeff must now use R.& D. to win the value-added wars."
According to Mr. Immelt, G.E. is "incubating" service-heavy businesses in security, water treatment, oil and gas and other areas that cannot be bolted onto existing G.E. units. It is even doing research into hydrogen energy, which some see as a way, first, to turn fossil fuels into clean energy and ultimately as a means to replace petroleum.
"I'd be surprised if, a bunch of years down the road," Mr. Immelt said, "we aren't into businesses that require new names."
In the meantime, Mr. Immelt is trying to recreate Niskayuna's glory days. It was here, in 1913, that William Coolidge invented the X-ray tube, eventually giving birth to the diagnostic imaging industry -- and to GE Medical Systems. Now, his intellectual descendents are using information from the human genome project and similar efforts to develop molecular imaging techniques that could probe each bodily cell -- and spot diseases before any symptoms occur.
Lexan polycarbonate, the first super-strong heat resistant plastic and the precursor to the whole family of so-called engineered thermoplastics, was born here in 1953; it became the underpinning of GE Plastics.
Today, G.E.'s nanotechnology researchers are studying why nature can turn calcium carbonate into lustrous, strong seashells, while human beings can only wrest chalk from the same substance. If they crack that mystery, the result might be heat-resistant ceramic materials that are as light as dinner plates yet as strong as steel. GE Power Systems and GE Aircraft Engines could use the materials to make more durable and efficient generators and turbines, and GE Plastics could probably find a host of outside customers.
In one sense, G.E. is catching up with its competition. Gerard J. Kleisterlee, chief executive of Royal Philips Electronics -- a rival to G.E. in medical equipment -- insists that each of his company's five divisions sponsor research with a three-to-five year time span. "We were giving our business units too much autonomy on how their research money should be spent," he said.
But G.E. has a problem that Philips does not face. When G.E. failed to acquire Honeywell International last year, its portfolio of businesses was left top-heavy with financial services. Even during the best of times the shares of financial services firms trade at lower multiples of earnings than those of advanced industrial companies. G.E. stock, once a Wall Street favorite, is trading at $25.33, about $16 below its level a year ago. 
Clearly, Mr. Immelt faces different challenges than Mr. Welch ever did. Mr. Welch, who rose up through G.E. Plastics, concentrated on paring a bloated management and whipping operations into shape. Research did not escape his baleful glare.
Until Mr. Welch became G.E.'s chief executive in 1981, the central lab had run primarily on corporate dollars and had let researchers follow their instincts. Mr. Welch insisted that the researchers petition G.E.'s business units for funds. He figured -- correctly -- that the units would not pay for projects that just satisfied intellectual curiosity.
"Jack thought the lab operated too much like the old Bell Labs, and they never did much for AT&T," said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School. "Jeff is nudging the pendulum back toward the center."
Mr. Immelt, who rose through GE Medical Systems, one of G.E.'s most technology-dependent units, established himself as a salesman-cum-technophile early on. He was the first G.E. business leader to apply Six Sigma, a quality control method, to product design. He often asked customers for wish lists, and turned them into work orders for researchers. Now he wants all of G.E. to think -- and act -- along those lines.
"Superior technology is the only route to consistent growth without declining margins," he said.
The researchers say a heavy weight has been lifted. Tony Dean, a mechanical engineer who specializes in propulsion, spends most of his time leading experiments in pulsed detonation, a process in which fuel is ignited in hundreds of thousands of tiny explosions every second, instead of in a continuous burn. 
Mr. Dean, who has worked for G.E. for 10 years, is certain the nascent technology is more efficient, and he and his people are tinkering with it on engines. If they get the kinks out, they expect to derive jet engines that use less fuel at all speeds, and "afterburners" that enable older engines to fly at supersonic speeds. 
But the first pulsed detonation engine is unlikely to show up for at least five years. In pre-Immelt days, Mr. Dean said, he could have wrested just enough money from headquarters and from the government to justify spending a day a week on the project. "I'd have had to juggle five projects at once," he said.
Mr. Immelt is also giving researchers better operations. He is spending $81 million to build technology centers in Munich and Shanghai, and is pumping $100 million into updating the 525-acre Niskayuna complex. Generic laboratories are being torn down, replaced with "wet" labs tailored for biotechnology and chemistry.
The 1960's-era auditorium that sat upward of 300 people is being replaced with a wired room that seats about 165 -- but in which attendees can plug in laptops and interact with one another. A lodge that can sleep 35 people is also going up.
The need for a lodge is itself a sign of changing times. Mr. Welch rarely dropped by the lab; Mr. Immelt holds meetings here twice a year. Those who run G.E.'s business units used to visit Niskayuna only when the mood struck; Mr. Immelt insists they come four times a year. 
Even more startling for the once insular G.E., outsiders are welcome. For example, scientists from GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company, often visit, interested in the work on molecular imaging. That research could lead to non-invasive diagnostic tests, which are G.E.'s forte, but also to new drugs, which G.E. does not make but Glaxo does.
"We write secrecy agreements, but it makes sense to have technology-sharing arrangements," said Joseph M. Hogan, chief executive of GE Medical Systems.
Word of G.E.'s new openness is spreading. Rick Snyder, chief executive of Ardesta, a new company specializing in technologies that operate at the size of the human hair and smaller, said he plans to call the G.E. lab soon. "I could see us joint venturing on research now, and development later," he said.
The G.E. businesses are chipping in for research outside their primary areas, too. GE Capital is paying for research into artificial intelligence, which could help it with such tasks as setting prices for service contracts. GE Aircraft Engines is paying for most of the pulsed detonation research, but GE Power Systems is kicking in, too. And nearly every business is supporting nanotechnology -- the study of tiny molecular structures that could lead to such things as ceramics that withstand high heat, magnets that yield sharp X-ray images, and security systems that play color against particle size.
"Shared R.& D. makes total sense," said James N. Kelleher, who follows G.E. for Argus Research. "Companies want to eliminate duplicate efforts in all kinds of back-office operations, so why not in research?"

HEADLINE: Chrysler May Add 3rd Shifts at Most Plants 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Dec. 25 

 BODY:
The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler may add third shifts at most of its assembly plants to meet its goal of selling four million vehicles a year, its chief executive said in an interview.
 The automaker's North American unit sold 2.9 million Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles in 2001. It has said it wants to sell four million a year by 2011. 
 Chrysler is actively considering opening a new assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, but will not meet the sales goal through a series of new plant openings, said Dieter Zetsche, the president and chief executive of Chrysler. 
"In general terms, it is very clear that executing this four million goal is not about adding capacity," Mr. Zetsche told The Detroit Free Press. 
Adding third shifts to most of its existing assembly and components plants will not translate directly into a 33 percent increase in jobs, he said. 
"We intend to improve our productivity to the level of Nissan and Toyota in four or five years," Mr. Zetsche said. He said the higher productivity will let Chrysler build more vehicles per employee, "and at least a portion of the growth we are heading for would compensate for those productivity gains." 
In October, Chrysler announced a third shift at its Warren, Mich., truck assembly plant, creating 1,000 new jobs. 
Chrysler will decide by the end of June whether to build a new Windsor assembly plant and where to build a new engine plant, Mr. Zetsche said. 
Higher exports will account for more than 200,000 units toward the four million goal, he said. Chrysler now sells about 185,000 vehicles annually outside the United States, Canada and Mexico. Mr. Zetsche said he expected to increase that to around 400,000 by adding new models and improving Chrysler's foreign sales networks. 
Chrysler hopes to increase its sales by building new types of vehicles and putting a new emphasis on commercial vehicles, he said.
Chrysler has already chosen two-thirds of the products it needs to reach its four million sales goal, Mr. Zetsche said. He said decisions on the remaining vehicles would come in the next one to two years. 
Most of the sales increase will come from innovative new vehicles like the PT Cruiser and the coming Chrysler Pacifica 6-seat all-wheel-drive crossover, he said. 
"We sure hope he's right," the Canadian Auto Workers Union president, Buzz Hargrove, said of Mr. Zetsche's plan. "We could sure use some good news." 
David L. Littmann, the chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit, said the sales goal was well within Chrysler's reach. 
"My bet is they can do it in less than five to 10 years," Mr. Littmann said. "There's no doubt they'll achieve it, maybe in as little as three or four years."

HEADLINE: EYES ON 2004 VOTE, DEMOCRATS FAULT U.S. TERROR DEFENSE 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Democratic contenders for president are beginning to challenge President Bush's record on terrorism, arguing that Mr. Bush has failed to do enough to prevent another fatal attack on American soil and that the nation is barely safer than it was before Sept. 11, 2001.
 The expressions of concern about the nation's safety by Mr. Bush's prospective challengers, voiced in interviews, speeches and television appearances over the last three weeks, suggest that the focus of the Democratic White House candidates in 2004 will go well beyond the traditional Democratic fare of education, the economy, jobs and health care. 
 While so far the criticisms lack many specifics beyond asking for more money for police agencies or the creation of an additional intelligence force, campaign aides said these early challenges on terrorism signaled what they expected to be a central theme in 2004. They argued that Mr. Bush was potentially vulnerable on the issue that Republicans view as a pillar of the president's political strength. 
"It's time for us, without regard to party, to say what every American knows: Washington is not doing enough to make America safe," Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said in a speech on domestic security in Washington last week.
Mr. Edwards added, "If the administration continues to do too little, it will be too late again."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said the "American people are only slightly safer today here at home than we were on Sept. 11, 2001."
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said in an interview that the administration had squandered a year since the attacks, by failing to make "the preparations necessary to properly deal with an obvious problem of growing terror and the threat at home."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont said Democrats "have a real opportunity here," noting in particular what he described as the administration's bungling response to the rash of anthrax attacks.
Mr. Lieberman said: "With the possible exception of the aviation systems, we have not raised our guard sufficiently. This administration has been slow and inadequate in the response to the terrorist threat here at home."
White House officials described this line of attack as risky and unorthodox, with some suggesting that it would make the candidates appear willing to exploit American fears for political gain.
"Any candidate who suggests that when the enemy attacks, the blame lies with the United States and not with the enemy does so at great peril to their own political future," said the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
Still, it is becoming increasingly clear that the dialogue of the coming presidential race will be unlike any other White House campaign in years, as a direct result of the attacks of Sept. 11.
Several Democrats predicted a fundamental shift in the way presidential candidates would have to present themselves in the 2004 campaign. They said polls showed that the voters would now consider a presidential candidate's ability to protect them from terrorism at home in much the same way voters in a big city might now consider a mayoral candidate's ability to stop crime in their neighborhoods.
"This is clearly going to be one of the cornerstones of the 2004 election -- I don't think there is any question about it," said Steve Jarding, a senior adviser to Mr. Edwards. "Every campaign cycle, you see candidates talk about education, talk about health care. And I guess for better or worse, terrorism is going to be a part of that dialogue from now on."
The contenders have offered a few, though not many, details on what they would do differently. Mr. Edwards, for example, urged creation of a domestic intelligence agency with the specific directive to work against terrorism at home, making up for what he asserted were the now-demonstrated weaknesses of the F.B.I. and C.I.A. 
Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lieberman assailed the administration for holding up $1.5 billion in antiterrorism aid to local police departments and emergency agencies allocated by Congress this year, and Mr. Lieberman said the White House should move aggressively to improve protection of borders, ports and transportation systems, which he described as vulnerable to attack.
None of the Democrats have suggested, for example, further incursions on civil liberties or immigration, in some cases arguing that the administration has gone too far.
In a reflection of these difficult times, aides to the contenders said they were planning their campaigns with the assumption that another terrorist attack could happen at any moment and discreetly trying to assess what that might mean for a continuing contest.
"If something else horrible happens, does the nation instinctively rally around the president?" asked a senior adviser to one contender, who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the subject. "Or do they say: 'It's this guy's job keep my family safe. He's had two years to prepare for it.' "
Along those lines, aides suggested that some statements by the White House and the Democratic candidates were intended in part to position the campaigns in the event of a terrorist attack over the next 24 months.
Mr. Kerry, for example, declared three weeks ago on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that there were "enormous gaps and deficits in the preparedness level of our country," while Mr. Bush and his aides have repeatedly warned that another attack is possible.
Former President Bill Clinton pointed the way to this new Democratic line of criticism in a speech in New York a month ago, in which he said the Democrats needed to directly challenge the Bush administration on terrorism. Mr. Clinton is in regular touch with some of the presidential contenders, particularly Mr. Edwards, though aides to Mr. Edwards said he had decided on his own to make this a central part of his campaign.
Republicans said they were startled by the brazenness of the Democratic attacks, and suggested they would have little effect.
"It's a very tricky play because you're going to try to assign blame," said Russ Schriefer, a Republican consultant. "It's almost like you're trying to make political hay out of a disaster."
Even Democrats said they had to be careful not to be perceived as in effect hoping for a terrorist attack, in much the same way that the administration painted the party as rooting for an economic downturn this past fall.
Dr. Dean warned that his party had to be careful about a backlash in confronting this issue, and said that some of his fellow Democrats had already crossed a line, though he declined to name names.
"It depends on how shrill we are," Dr. Dean said. "Some of the candidates have sounded shrill."
Some Democrats said antiterrorism preparations at home had stalled because Mr. Bush had been distracted by the preparations for a war in Iraq, and took note of concerns cited by intelligence agencies that an attack against Iraq would result in terrorism reprisal attacks in the United States.
"The combined intelligence community says that there is a 75 percent or better chance that there will be terrorist attacks against United States interests, including inside the United States, when a war against Iraq is about to achieve success," said Senator Bob Graham, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who said he was considering a presidential race. 
"When there has been such a lethargic effort made to protect the America people by dismantling those international groups, both here in the homeland and in their headquarters, I think the administration has assumed a very serious potential risk."
While, for the most part, this is a fight between President Bush and the Democrats, there are some differences among the Democratic presidential contenders as well. In offering his criticism of the administration, Mr. Lieberman noted that he had been a sponsor of the act creating the Homeland Security Department in Congress.
But Mr. Edwards belittled the new cabinet department, describing it as "more of a political achievement for the administration than a substantive achievement for America's security."

Visions for Ground Zero, but Maybe Not New York's

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
HOWEVER inadvertently, the cover of "New York City's Vision for Lower Manhattan" tells the story. It is an aerial photo of downtown showing nothing at the World Trade Center site.
 For the moment, that is necessarily New York City's vision for Lower Manhattan: a question mark where the most influential downtown project will rise. The plain truth is that while the trade center site is subject to mayoral influence, it lies outside municipal control. 
 As a result, several official planning efforts are under way at once. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg brought forth his vision for Lower Manhattan on Dec. 12. Six days later, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey unveiled nine architectural concepts for the trade center site, which the authority controls. The authority is also developing its own land-use plan for the site, thus far unseen by the public. (And this is before the planning for a memorial begins in earnest next year.)
City planners charged with reinvigorating downtown must somehow anticipate a development at the trade center site that may create all the new office space that downtown needs for the next decade. Its stores may compete with the city's proposed Fulton Market Square. Its plazas may draw visitors away from the city's proposed Greenwich Square park. It may offer a place for cultural institutions that the city imagines along the East River. And it may cast long shadows over residential towers that the city contemplates.
Trying to reconcile the trade center site with its surroundings is not a new planning challenge.
In fact, it goes back to the origins of the center in the mid-1960's, when the City Planning Department was simultaneously preparing the first comprehensive plan for downtown. Although the trade center had not yet begun to rise, city planners accepted it as a fait accompli, even as, among themselves, they criticized its scale, barrenness and isolation.
"It was very frustrating," recalled Paul Willen, the project director for the 1966 Lower Manhattan plan, which was recently reprinted by the Princeton Architectural Press and the Skyscraper Museum. "We were basically told by City Planning that it was a done deal, that we would just discredit ourselves if we attacked it. All we could do was tie it the best we could to our plan."
This time, officials say, what emerges from the 16-acre trade center site will bear the city's mark.
"It is impossible for those plans to go forward -- simply impossible -- if the city government is not in favor of them," said Alexander Garvin, a linchpin in the process, since he is both a member of the City Planning Commission and the vice president for planning, design and development at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
But with so many agencies and constituents involved, it is possible to imagine visions diverging and to wonder whose will prevail.
Mr. Willen, an architect and urban planner, said the split showed itself clearly to participants in a workshop sponsored by the Regional Plan Association and the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York. "There was a big blank, generally, in all the drawings where the World Trade center was," he said.
The five-day workshop ended Dec. 18, the same day that architectural concepts for the trade center site went on view at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, across West Street from ground zero.
SOME concepts took into account the city's downtown planning framework. Some ignored it. (One was developed by Peterson/Littenberg Architecture and Urban Design, which was also responsible for the design concepts in Mayor Bloomberg's Dec. 12 report.) 
Mr. Garvin declined to identify which plans were congruent with the mayor's vision and which were not, out of concern that to do so might show favoritism while the plans were still being evaluated.
Almost lost in the excited discussion of the trade center site is the fact that the city's "Vision for Lower Manhattan" contains an architectural firecracker of its own: an East River development with a permanent home for Cirque du Soleil, a floating forest and lawn, a beach, a hydroponic garden, a skating rink, an aquarium, a hotel and cultural institutions or maybe residences.
This concept was devised by Diller & Scofidio and David Rockwell of Rockwell Architecture, Planning and Design at the invitation of Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, who had seen the firms' work on a waterfront development for Cirque du Soleil in Hong Kong.
"We wanted to think about what a 21st-century park might be," Mr. Rockwell said. The fanciful megastructure would be built on barges and existing pier structures, showing "how the waterfront of this great island could be used in a way that isn't more landfill," Ricardo Scofidio said.
Though it is highly unlikely that this concept will ever be built, if it engaged public interest through its sheer audacity and imagination, it could serve as a true counterpart to the planning for the trade center site, which now seems so distant across the island.

HEADLINE: ON STAGE AND OFF; 
A Time of Trial For Some Shows

BYLINE:  By Jesse McKinley 

 BODY:
Ah, Christmastime: expensive presents, delicious eggnog, bloated box office receipts. You wish the season would never end.
 But next week, as New Year's Day slips by and tourists slip away, more than a few shows are going to be tested. Surviving the fallow box office months of January and February is always a challenge, but this year has its own hurdles: a bundle of late 2002 openings, a still fragile economy and a public that is increasingly savvy about buying last-minute and discount tickets. 
 Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said that while Broadway had had a "disproportionally great fall," with breakout hits like "Hairspray" and "Movin' Out," there was some wariness as to how long the good ride would last.
"You have the lingering economic softness, which hasn't really affected Broadway that much, but you have to wonder whether our number is coming up," he said.
One challenge is a packed field of new shows angling for audiences, with six Broadway openings in 15 days in December, meaning that some shows probably got less press and ticket-buying attention than expected. Hogging a lot of the limelight was "La Boheme," which sold strong right after opening on Dec. 8, though not as strong as its producers had predicted.
All those late openings may make it difficult for shows to differentiate themselves, Mr. Bernstein said.
"Because so many shows opened in December," he said, "that critical four- to six-week period after opening for marketing and branding your show is going to include January, when it's difficult enough to get people in the seats."
Among the newcomers needing help are shows like "Dance of the Vampires" and "Hollywood Arms," which are banking on television advertising campaigns. "Imaginary Friends" and "Medea" also need to fill more seats. "Def Poetry Jam" has been struggling but carries a low weekly running cost. It, too, is planning an advertising campaign, having hired a new ad agency, Spot Co., last week.
Several longer-running shows look vulnerable, including the little show that could, "Metamorphoses," and "The Graduate," where sales haven't been the same since Kathleen Turner left the cast.
Then there's one imponderable element that Mr. Bernstein especially fears: war. 
"International travel used to account for 12 percent of our sales," Mr. Bernstein said, citing figures from before Sept. 11, 2001. "Now it's 4 percent." That number would probably drop again if hostilities erupted overseas.
But what of all this doom and gloom? Isn't this the time of happiness and cheer and good will toward men? 
Well, yes. There is plenty to celebrate, the league says. The estimated gross for the calender year 2002 is more than $700 million. Through its 29th week, which ended on Dec. 15, the 2002-3 season is on pace to top the total season gross of the record-setting 2000-01 season. 
Attendance is down slightly compared with that season, but tickets are more expensive now.

The Scarlet A
It looks as if the play with the unprintable title -- a new drama by Suzan-Lori Parks based on "The Scarlet Letter" -- has found its Hester, and it isn't Queen Latifah. Officials at the Public Theater, where the play begins in February, said this week that they were close to signing S. Epatha Merkerson, an accomplished stage actress who has found national fame as Lt. Anita Van Buren on the hit television show "Law & Order."
Ms. Merkerson, nominated for a Tony Award in 1990 for her work in August Wilson's "Piano Lesson," would join a cast that already includes Mos Def, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Bobby Canavale. Queen Latifah had been widely rumored to be considering a role in the play.
The play, whose title includes the letter A, is described as the story of Hester, who lives in a violent island dystopia where she is an abortionist. (It is not a comedy.) Michael Greif will direct.

A Temporary Closing
Sunday brings the final performance, for now, of "Harlem Song," the ambitious and acclaimed show about the birth of Harlem that has been playing at the Apollo Theater since August. Created by George C. Wolfe ("Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk") and hailed by many Broadway critics, the show nonetheless had trouble drawing audiences uptown. It very nearly closed in early November before being bailed out by ticketbuyers and an infusion of cash from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.
And while the show will close this weekend, plans are still afoot to try to stage "Harlem Song" year after year, not unlike the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. 
John Schreiber, one of the Harlem show's producers, said that the plan is to return every October for three months.
"I think the first season was almost like a learning season for the audience," he said. "They (a) didn't know what it was and (b) didn't know where it was."
Producers didn't come close to recouping the production's $4 million price tag. But Mr. Schreiber said the producers were encouraged by strong word of mouth and the number of theater parties attending. 
"We found that especially among African-American audiences, 'Harlem Song' became a real family thing to do," he said. "So we believe it should become a perennial."

Along the Way
*"Zanna, Don't!," a new musical that received favorable reviews during a run on Theater Row in October, will transfer to the Houseman Theater on March 4. Described as a musical fairy tale about a beautiful, androgynous teenager, "Zanna!" has a book, music and lyrics by Tim Acito, with additional book and lyrics by Alexander Dinelaris.
*After a bushel of good reviews, "Hank Williams: Lost Highway" has been extended until Feb. 2. The show, which chronicles the rise and fall of the world's most famous cowboy warbler, is at the Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo.

Calling All To Kwanzaa
Whether or not you subscribe to the proverb that "it takes a village to raise a child," children will have an entire village at their disposal tomorrow at the American Museum of Natural History. And this one offers entertainment as well as life lessons. 
 It's the children's village at a festival for Kwanzaa, the African-American holiday (Dec. 26 to Jan. 1) that honors seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. 
 "Drummers will travel throughout the museum toward the Kwanzaa area, calling people to the event," said Teddy Yoshikami, the museum's manager of public programs. "Then there'll be a procession." 
After an opening candlelighting ceremony, the museum will present a variety of performers, including the singer Tulani Kinard, the Total Praise Choir of Emmanuel Baptist Church in Brooklyn, the Young Jazz Masters and the Restoration Dance Theater Junior Company.
From 2 to 4 p.m. the children's village will offer African games, face painting, the performer Ha! Ha! B. Klown,as well as a stilt walker and storytelling. "They're going to read 'Jalani and the Lock,' by Lorenzo Pace," Ms. Yoshikami said. "It all fits into the seven principles of Kwanzaa."
Including African-American foods and an African marketplace, the event promises a multicultural fest of comfort and joy. "Hopefully, by the end," Ms. Yoshikami said, "everyone will be dancing, singing, holding hands and hugging each other."
Kwanzaa Festival, noon to 6 p.m., and Children's Kwanzaa Village, 2 to 4 p.m., at the American Museum of Natural History, 79th Street and Central Park West, second floor, (212) 496-3409. Free with suggested admission: $12; students and 65+, $9; children, $7.

Twinkle, Little Moon
One of the most popular films at the holidays is "It's a Wonderful Life," in which a well-meaning but inept angel earns his wings by rescuing a man from despair. Its emphasis on the joy of doing good can also be found in "The Little Moon Theater," a musical from Tada!, the theater for thespians ages 8 to 18. But here the bumbling supernatural being is Penelope, a fairy godmother who can barely fly, much less make dreams come true.
Based on the children's book of the same title by Irene Haas, "The Little Moon Theater" chronicles Penelope's quest to earn retirement by granting one last wish. But she has unintentional competition from the itinerant Little Moon Theater. Before she can fulfill a wish, its players do, by performing a piece that heals a heart or solves a problem.
With a book by Michael Slade and music and lyrics by Joel Gelpe, the show is like a gift box that, when opened, reveals still another gift inside. In addition to the main story, children are treated to the plays-within-a-play of the Little Moon Theater. When the Little Moon members, for instance, meet a boy who's ostracized because no one likes his pet snake, they put on an amusing jungle skit. This encounter also leads to one of the musical's most hilarious numbers: "A Snake Is Just a Cat Without Legs," which notes all the similarities -- shedding, slinking, a fondness for rodents -- between these seemingly disparate species.
As for Penelope, she learns that the solution to her troubles is right under her nose. Directed by Janine Nina Trevens and performed by a gifted young cast, "The Little Moon Theater" would fulfill anyone's wish for a charming show.
"The Little Moon Theater," through Jan. 20 at the CAP 21 Theater, 15 West 28th Street, second floor, Chelsea, (212) 252-1619. Fridays at 7 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 4 p.m., with additional shows today, Monday, Tuesday and Jan. 20 at noon and 2 p.m. Tickets: $15; 15 and under, $7. Reservations advised. 

A Natural Laboratory
Imagine you were stranded on an island and had to mix your own insect repellent. Or create a makeshift microscope to assess the water.
These made-for-television premises don't come from "Survivor" but from "Rough Science," a PBS show in which five scientists are put on an island and given three days to meet certain challenges. This weekend, the New York Hall of Science is inviting families to get in on the act by using their own ingenuity (and a little help from museum staff) to perform various tasks. To get in the mood, they can watch episodes of "Rough Science," to be screened at 2, 3 and 3:30 p.m. tomorrow and Sunday. 
"They'll get basic materials like plain water to use as a lens for a microscope," said Marcia Rudy, the museum's director of public programs. "For a wind vane, we'll provide a source of wind, and all they'll use is a drinking straw and a card." Another challenge may involve making a battery by starting with a potato or a copper penny. 
Other weekend activities will include dissecting owl pellets (regurgitated dietary leftovers) and vicarious journeys to a rain forest, in which children will make reptile puppets (materials fee, $1 to $2) and chocolate ($3), which derives from the cocoa bean. It's one way to experience the tropics when the only heat is coming from your radiators.
"Rough Science" challenges, 2:45 to 4:30 p.m., and Rain Forest Science Weekend, noon to 4:30 p.m. (chocolate making at 1:30 and 2:30), tomorrow and Sunday at the New York Hall of Science, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005. Admission: $7.50; 62+ and students over 5, $5; ages 2 through 4, $2.50.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
In Some Circles, A Man Is Judged By the Cut of His Wheel

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
"THERE'S no way in the world you could ride around on rims you don't like," said Daymond John, the chief executive of Fubu, the urban clothing company.
 Of course not. Wheels are critical, especially on a car like his Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG, a high-performance version of the flagship Mercedes sedan with a 493-horsepower engine and a $107,000 price tag. It was inching across town in on the way from Mr. John's office in the Empire State Building to a television studio on West 57th Street, with a stop on Eighth Avenue across from Madison Square Garden -- not the kind of trip for showing what wheels can do. 
 Still, Mr. John was explaining his choice for the Mercedes -- chrome-plated wheels with thick spokes that reach out to shiny rims and rivetlike bolts circling the edge. They measure 18 inches in diameter, 3 inches larger than the ones that came with the car. "This is a $10,000, a $20,000 investment here," he said. 
And that's worth some serious consideration, even for someone with as many cars as Mr. John: a 1967 Buick Skylark convertible with 20-inch rims, a 1967 Cadillac and a $300,000 Bentley Arnage. He has another on the way: he ordered a Maybach, the low-slung monster that DaimlerChrysler hopes will appeal to drivers who want something more exclusive than the Mercedes S-Class sedan, the car he uses around Manhattan.
Choosing the right rims is like choosing the right tie or the right cuff links. "Everybody has a particular taste," Mr. John said. "My taste -- I like a real deep lip on the rim."
But not too deep. Not too wide, either -- he does not want his rims to look like mirrors.
Wheels, the things car tires are mounted on, aren't just about locomotion, anymore. When the speedometer is climbing and the wheels are spinning faster and faster, they can be a kind of kinetic artwork, with limitless variations depending on the wheels' design. Just the right wheels, in motion or at rest, are personal signatures for many automobile lovers.
A car's wheels can project the conspicuous excesses of hip-hop or the muscle-car image of a driver who is living out a childhood fantasy. Some spin like pinwheels, even after the car has stopped. Some need to be babied with powder in sensitive places.
"You've got to stand out in life, you know?" said John Kramer, a contractor from Jamesport, N.Y., who put $3,000 into extra-large cast aluminum wheels for his 1995 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck a couple months ago.
He bought the wheels just after a paint job gave the truck fender-to-fender flames. Cruising through a Long Island outlet-mall parking lot the other day, he was photographed twice -- first by a woman with a 35-millimeter camera, then by a couple in their 30's with a video camera. "Their kids were giving me thumbs-up," he said, "and the father said, 'You got a sweet truck.' "
He added, "You see a car with decent set of wheels, you know it's not cheap.The bigger the wheel, the more money you got."
The wheels are bigger than ever -- literally. Mr. John's 18-inch wheels would look small next to a set of 20's, as in 20 inches in diameter, a size that was the largest on the market a couple of years ago.
Now there are 23-inch wheels, which are often called Jordans after the number that the basketball star Michael Jordan wears, and 24-inch wheels for sport-utility vehicles. Can 25- or 26-inch wheels be on the way? 
There are those who call wheels makeup for men -- very expensive makeup, at more than $10,000 for a set like the one on Mr. John's Mercedes.
"People want to customize their cars," the New York Knicks star Latrell Sprewell, who drives a 2003 Range Rover with 22-inch rims to Madison Square Garden, said in an interview. "You don't want to be the same as everybody else. You like to be a little different. Wheels and tires are the first and most visible thing someone can change to personalize a vehicle."
And for many car buyers, nothing right off the dealer's lot will do, no matter how expensive the car. Howard Zwang pointed to an investment banker's Mercedes-Benz SL500 that had just been brought in to his wheel shop on Long Island one morning a couple of weeks ago.
"A $125,000 car, and it's not enough," Mr. Zwang said. "He's got to drop $10,000 more" on 18-inch cast-aluminum wheels with midwidth spokes.
The investment banker could have ordered the $18,000 rims known as Sprewells, after Mr. Sprewell, who owns Sprewell Racing, based in San Gabriel, Calif.
Mr. Sprewell said he was not the inventor of Sprewells, which spin like pinwheels even when the car is stopped at a traffic light -- which can confuse drivers nearby. "A lot of people think it's me," he said.
The wheel business exploded in the 1990's. The Specialty Manufacturers Market Association, a trade group, says that sales of custom rims have climbed to $3 billion a year from $1.2 billion in 1991. Wheel sellers like Mr. Zwang say that business has not soured as the economy has sputtered.
"The demographics of wheels in the 70's and 80's was muscle-car enthusiasts," he explained. Now, he said, the carefully selected wheel is "a pure fashion statement."
Since the 1980's, Mr. Zwang has been selling wheels from Best Tire and Car Audio, an unfashionable-looking garage in Great Neck, the inspiration for the little-disquised setting of the of "The Great Gatsby." He joined a business his father started in 1963. By the 1990's, he was selling wheels as big as the ones on the roadsters that Tom Buchanan drove.
"Nineteen-inch wheels, you'd see the girlfriends shaking their heads," Mr. Zwang said. "I'd go, 'How many pairs of shoes do you have have?' "
Rap music gave the wheel business another boost. Snoop Dogg rapped about Dayton rims when the coveted car was a Detroit dreamboat from the 1960's, a Cadillac or a Chevy Impala (a hooptie, the rap term for an old American car). Twenty-inch Dayton rims -- which look like the wheels on a classic MG roadster, with 100 to 200 thin spokes -- were also what the rap artist Jay-Z was referring to in "Girls, Girls, Girls":
I come scoop you in that coupe
sittin' on deuce-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
Soon, fashion consciousness about wheels had spread from urban buyers to the suburban market, where the buyers were closer to middle age.
"Anything the urban market does, the suburban market does two years later," Mr. Zwang said.
THE width of a wheel is also important. Martin Tallon, 32, of Speonk, N.Y., chose wheels that are 15 inches wide -- as he drives they appear almost as wide as they are tall -- for his 1957 Chevrolet, another Detroit classic often seen on the stock-car circuit. He pampers them by dusting them with baby powder to reduce friction with the tires.
"I like the way the car looks when you look at it from the back and see one-third tire, one-third space between and one-third tire," he said.
He added, "I'm getting super-skinny tires for the front. Skinny little wheels in the front and fat wheels in the back. The traction is supposed to be worse, and the steering worse. It's the look."
Another issue is the profile, or thickness, of the tire -- the space between the wheel and the road. As rims become larger, tires must become thinner to keep the entire package from being too big to fit the car. 
Jim Stavrinos, who owns SpeedworldFX in Riverhead, N.Y., has admired the effect of supersize wheels on supersize S.U.V.'s like Shaquille O'Neal's Lincoln Navigator, which he has seen at car shows.But "the ride is terrible," Mr. Stavrinos said. "When you go to a low-profile tire with a big wheel, there's very little rubber," he said. "But the bigger the wheel they can get on them, the happier people are."
Mr. Stavrinos put 22-inch wheels on his pickup truck, but thought better of it and replaced them with 18-inch ones. "I couldn't take the ride," he said. "You ought to see these guys bouncing up and down. A lot of people are going to have bad backs."
Mr. John, 31, has also begun downsizing. If he did not live in a high-risk environment for wheels -- snow and slush are bad enough, he said, but salt attacks the chrome finish -- he'd stay with the big ones. But in New York, it's too much trouble.
And, he added, "I'm starting to get older now."

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Helping A Camaro Migrate For Winter

BYLINE:  By RICH BEATTIE 

 BODY:
AH, the power. Cruising down I-95 in an almost-new Camaro convertible, I found the task of aligning speedometer with speed limit the quintessential challenge. Other drivers looked on enviously as I whizzed by. With the top down, the wind drowned out my CD, even when it was blasting. I accelerated past other drivers simply because I could. 
 Even the chilly air couldn't persuade me to put the top up, and as I continued south from my starting point in New Jersey, temperatures rose with the corresponding drop in latitude. The landscape changed from industrial to rural to very rural, and after several days of visiting friends along the way and thrilling to the car's hum, I zipped across the Florida border, pleased and surprised to have collected no speeding tickets along the way. 
 Unfortunately, this powerful engine and gorgeous body did not belong to me. National Car Rental held the title, and I was just burning the rubber. Normally, borrowing this kind of speed costs $65 a day for a winter drive out of Newark Airport. But I got it for $25.99 a day with unlimited mileage. How? I was doing National a favor -- at its invitation.
It's not only the geese and the snowbirds that migrate for the winter. Rental cars have to go south, too.
In the below-freezing rental garages of the Northeast and Midwest, extra cars that helped meet last summer's demand in resort towns and big-city tourist spots have become a glut. As the tourists head to warmer spots, much of the market for rental cars goes with them.
The big national companies can always load cars six or eight at a time onto auto transport trucks. Or they can buy new cars and have the manufacturer deliver them to a car-hungry locale. But 15 years ago, they recognized an opportunity for symbiosis. For a low rate -- typically as little as $20 or $25 a day with unlimited mileage -- drivers in the know are more than happy to take cars south and get themselves there at the same time.
"The company gets its cars moved and drivers get an amazing bargain," said Travis Tanner, executive vice president of ANC, which owns both National and Alamo. 
Not all rental-car companies offer these deals, and those that do may not do it every year. Right now, only National and Alamo have the specials, and only until Jan. 31. And there is, of course, a catch. Companies call it the Florida Drive-In program (farther west it is the Arizona Drive-In) because you have to leave your wheels among the palm trees and make your way home on your own. You could return in the spring, when National, Alamo and Avis usually run the program in reverse (the Florida Drive-Out) to get their cars north. But don't count on it. Companies announce these specials only when they have to. Hertz and Dollar, for example, have run the program in past years, but this year found their fleets positioned well enough without it.
For some travelers, though, a one-way drive can be a perfect fit. You may want to see the country or visit friends as you drive south, but dread taking the same long drive in reverse a couple of weeks later. Discount airlines' one-way fares between Florida and northern cities make it economical and easy to get home by air.
Most of the cars moved in the Drive-In won't be exciting models; I was lucky to get the Camaro. But it is worth checking to see whether the car you want can be had. A family, for example, might take the opportunity to get a roomy minivan, currently $19.99 a day with unlimited mileage in National's program.
ANC, according to Ernest Johnson, its vice president for revenue management, aims to relocate a few thousand cars each fall and normally gets most of them there with the Drive-In. Dollar Rent a Car, which also looks to move about 4,000 cars to Florida for the winter, usually gets 700 to 1,000 driven down through the special. But sometimes companies are happy to redistribute even a handful of cars this way.
If it's a win-win for companies and customers, why is this a special hardly anyone has heard of? "Because the rentals are so cheap," said Gary Paxton, chief executive of Dollar, "the return on any advertising investment just isn't there." Getting the word out usually means putting a listing on the Web site and perhaps running an ad in limited publications.
The absence of penalties plus some amazing rates are what make these deals special. So now, when the spring and fall come around, think about putting the top down and hitting the road for next to nothing. It's quite a rush.

HEADLINE: Precious and Workaday, Malleable and Strong 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
AT FIRST, the idea of following a single material through the weird, disjointed world of the Brooklyn Museum of Art for the third installment of this series didn't seem especially promising. The museum dwells in what might be called a state of glacial flux, plagued by financial problems, unending rehabilitations and space constraints that keep huge chunks of its collection in storage for years on end.
 Right now, the museum's complex floor plan is riddled by even more detours and closed galleries than usual: the reconstruction of its grand staircase on Eastern Parkway is under way (to be completed in 2004), and half of its Egyptian galleries are in the final throes of reinstallation (reopening in April). The staircase project also involves burrowing under the museum to install the apparatus that will finally enable Brooklyn to climatize its older galleries, when it has the money. 
 So I set out a bit nervously, which may be why, like a newly hatched duckling, I imprinted on the first thing I saw at the entrance to the museum's African galleries near the lobby. It was a gorgeous 19th-century fibula, or cape clasp, from Morocco made of intricately worked silver and enamel and set with carnelian: it looked as if it could hold down a tent. Metal, I thought excitedly. Why not metal? Eureka. 
Well, duh. Given that the first of these articles followed ceramics through the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the second explored textiles at the American Museum of Natural History, metallurgy was obviously next. It is one of the crucial transformations of earth-given materials that made human progress possible. Civilization's Big Bang Basics, as they could be called, developed at different times, in different orders, all over the world, with different results. The pre-Columbian peoples of South America, for example, never abandoned stone tools, reserving metalwork primarily for luxury and ceremonial items. 
Since ceramics and metallurgy involved fire and an alchemical transformation that must have struck early humans as miraculous, they figured importantly in creation narratives, with metalsmiths in particular often doubling as shamans and priests. The meshing of religion, economic might, social and political status and daily usefulness is especially potent in metals because of their inherent beauty and durability. In its rawest state metal has always had high market value and quickly became the most common form of currency. The durability that made it so eternally useful helped many metal objects survive where ceramics shattered and fabrics rotted. But value also eradicates objects and therefore history: metal things were, and still are, continuously melted down to make other metal things. 
Following metals and metalwork through the Brooklyn Museum teaches one a lot, but hardly everything about the history of the family of malleable, ductile materials, whose best-known members include iron, silver, gold and copper and whose most widely used alloys, especially in early times, are bronze (copper and tin) and brass (copper and zinc).
The Brooklyn metal route largely sidesteps Western painting and sculpture and passes through nearly every open gallery in the museum. Although the points of interest include no overwhelming caches of objects to peruse, masterpieces show up regularly. But part of the allure of the Brooklyn Museum at the moment is its combination of quality and spartanness. You may sometimes feel that you are really prospecting, or on a treasure hunt. 
Metals can play starring, supporting, purely decorative or exceedingly minor roles. Yet because of metals' supreme shape-shifting capacities, a few, diverse objects can tell a material tale that encompasses an array of colors, of shapes and textures (not to mention physical strength and weight), of purposes and meanings and of skills and aesthetic priorities.
With some huge gaps, the path here crosses nearly three dozen centuries and even more cultures, from Chinese bronzes to spun aluminum, from New Kingdom Egypt to Jazz Age New York (after all, no steel, no skyscrapers). And of course the unfolding narrative concerns the sleeping giant that is the Brooklyn Museum and its considerable wonders, both present and potential.

Africa and the Americas
I opted to begin my zigzagging metal hunt near the middle of Brooklyn's recently renovated African galleries beyond the Berber fibula, and not simply because of their proximity to the lobby. 
The objects date from the 16th century to the 20th, and while wood predominates, the metals on hand here are among the most varied anywhere in the museum. They range from the superfine elegance of a cast gold pendant of a coiled snake eating a toad to a sturdy wood Kakongo power figure whose chest bristles with rusty nails and knife blades. It makes sense that the only uses of found metal objects at Brooklyn are in works from Africa, where modern sculpture began. (Looking closely reveals that many of the carved wood figures on view are adorned with iron pendants or wire earrings that combine found and made elements.) 
There is a serene Kota figure from Gabon whose flat elliptical face is quilted with thin strips of brass and copper. The adaptation of foreign goods is visible in a thronelike akonkromfi (praying mantis) chair from Ghana densely decorated with brass upholstery tacks, and the highest level of indigenous sophistication and originality shines through in a cluster of the museum's great Benin bronzes (actually made of copper alloy). One Benin case holds the magisterial "Horn Blower," with his monumental feet, finely detailed garments and implacable stare; another displays a waist pendant showing three elegant women, with a reverse side, visible in a photograph, that bears a rare maker's mark. 
Other standouts include a blunt copper mask made by the Yoruban artist Ali Amonikoji in 1910, which shows the influence of woodcarving and a vitrine holding more than two dozen Ethiopian crosses, large and small, mostly of silver, iron and copper alloy and whose designs represent a confluence of Indian and Christian cultures.
Leaving the African galleries, you'll find yourself in the vast space given over to the art of Oceania and the Americas. It was once packed with big display cases, but its thicket of art has been trimmed back pending a thorough rethinking and eventual rehab. At the moment, the fancifully carved figures, masks and shields of Melanesia, which use no metal, make up a great majority. But a vitrine on the far wall contains a handful of highlights from the museum's Americas collection, including a Panamanian Cocle sun disc, its ferocious god depicted in hammered gold so thin and delicate it resembles folded paper. As you leave toward the right, don't miss the rare Northwest Coast Indian shieldlike plaque called a copper, which was used in Potlatch rites; its kindly bear face is painted in black on the glowing copper.

Asia and the Middle East
Through the door and toward the right, you've arrived back at the touchstone Berber fibula. Behind it is a narrow enclosed staircase that always looks slightly off limits but isn't. One flight up is, for me, the museum's sweet spot: the wonderfully hospitable galleries of Asian and Middle Eastern art, where history moves rapidly through time and space and the objects seem especially available to the eye.
First, ample evidence of one of the world's greatest ages of bronze, which was also the dawn of Chinese dynastic civilization, is provided by some of the oldest and most beautiful pieces of metalwork in the Brooklyn collection. There are more than a dozen Shang and Zhou dynasty ceremonial bronzes from the 15th through the 12th century B.C. Most were used for making symbolic offerings to ancestors. In shades of green ranging from pale celadon to rich turquoise, they start with a perky three-legged Shang dynasty jia (wine vessel), whose smooth surface imitates ceramics. The increasingly ornate surfaces of succeeding bronzes -- a three-legged caldronlike ding (food vessel), for example -- indicate a rapidly developing grasp of the possibilities of casting bronze in clay molds that were incised with intricate spirals and zoomorphic faces. (This ubiquitous animalistic face is not so far removed from the Haida bear downstairs.) The zoomorphic presence might be said to culminate in the jutting head and clenched teeth of the animal-shaped Zhou guang (wine vessel), one of the museum's finest bronzes. 
Fast-forward about 3,000 years, and the next imposing piece of metalwork is a Qing shrine, where the patterning, more naturalistic now, is rendered in blue, red and green enamel on copper with dragon-wrapped piers. The object of devotion is not ancestors but a gilt bejeweled bodhisattva. 
The Japanese gallery provides a mere glimpse of Brooklyn's riches in this area, and metal, while infrequent, takes a variety of forms. An austere second-to-third-century Yayoi bronze bell, nearly three feet tall, shows the influence of Chinese bronzes. Screens and lacquered writing boxes shimmer with sprinkled gold. The museum's great 13th-century Kamakura guardian mask, its every feature aflare, is carved in wood with glaring rock crystal eyes. It seems completed by a bronze crown whose delicate cartwheeling filigree diadem has a a flair all its own and is in fact an Edo period addition.
Around the bend, you're in the Indian and Southeast Asian galleries, where stone alternates with bronze and Buddhas alternate with Hindu gods and saints. The idealized human form reigns throughout -- seated in meditation, standing, dancing, making love. First, a chock-a-block vitrine contains small, intricate bronzes from the Himalayan cultures, including an extravagant Nepalese Shiva-Shakti bristling with so much in the way of headdresses, arms and attributes that it almost seems to be on fire. In the next gallery, a fabulous dancing Krishna represents the 10th-century Chola dynasty of southern India, a high point in the world history of bronze casting and figural sculpture. 
Step into the elevator foyer to see one of the museum's greatest and largest pieces of Asian bronze: the head and torso of a Buddha from 14th-century Thailand. With a head of curls like snail shells, a lustrous deep brown patina, handsome features and large downcast eyes, it is an image of life-affirming beneficence.
But after that, head back to the secret stairway through the Middle Eastern gallery, where ceramics reign. Toward the end, the greatness of metalwork in medieval Iran is signaled with two brass vessels whose punch work achieves an almost lacy fineness, and also with a relatively plebeian three-legged incense burner in the shape of bird that suggests a helicopter. Around the corner, there's a Han dynasty bronze wine vessel in the shape of a goose whose naturalism contrasts strikingly with the earlier Chinese bronzes.

Egyptian Art
Proceed down the stairs and across the lobby and take the elevator to the third floor of the Morris A. and Meyer Schapiro Wing, where quite a bit of the Brooklyn's important Egyptian collection, beginning with the middle of the New Kingdom, is arrayed in newly designed blond-on-blond splendor. Here, where carved stone figures and reliefs predominate, the viewing experience assumes a definite treasure-hunt aspect.
Tucked away in numerous vitrines are all kinds of small bronze figures, numerous pieces of jewelry and decorative objects, and a few relief fragments that attest to the Egyptians' mastery of hollow-casting, gilding and inlay. The gold pieces include an exceedingly small, rare gold scarab depicting a queen with microscopic crispness, and a hefty necklace strand spacer inscribed with hieroglyphs. A small black bronze inlaid with gold of King Osorkon I with an offering bowl in his upraised hand reflects how bronze-casting freed Egyptian sculptors from stone and allowed for more naturalistic gestures.
Small bronze figures become more plentiful as you move into the Third Intermediate, Late and Ptolemaic periods, when the figures were often mass produced for private shrines or to be left on tombs. None of Brooklyn's Egyptian bronzes have the masterpiece status of its stone figures, but they are immensely appealing in their liveliness and oddness.
Among the displays, keep an eye out for three bronzes in particular: a sinuous sculpture of a sharp-eyed cat, a Late Period king in front of a groundhog-like ichneumon, and an unusual casket for a mummified snake, with a human-headed serpent stretched the length of its narrow, elongated form. Giacometti would have been inspired.
One of the museum's best-known Egyptian objects is a large coffin for the royal ibis bird that combines gaudiness and streamlined restraint. Its smooth wood body is brightly gilded in gold, but its sleek neck and head and almost creepily accurate feet are solid silver, and its eternally alert eye is rock crystal edged with gold. The legs are bent, as if this creature were rising from or settling into a nest; its side-by-side feet rest before it like the hands of someone awaiting a juicy bit of gossip, or a game of cards.

Decorative Art
Partly because the third-floor corridor to the north elevator bank is closed and partly for curatorial chronology, return to the ground floor by the nearby elevator, walk to the farther, north elevators and take one to the fourth floor to reach the museum's rambling, somewhat neglected decorative arts galleries. The labels for the large stained glass windows (two by Tiffany) just off the elevator make no mention of the wrought iron that holds them together, but never mind. Silver at least will eventually get its detailed due here.
The rather abrupt transition from Egypt is softened by immediate encounters with articles whose Egyptian motifs reflect the revivalist styles of the 19th century. In the Moorish Room, assembled in 1878 by Belle D. Yarrington Worsham, the persistence of Iranian metalwork is opulently visible in sconces and vases. Metal lurks and gleams in the shadowy vitrine-lined hallway ahead: a cast-iron ornament from Louis Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott Building in Chicago, painted to resemble weathered bronze; the 19th-century American innovation of cast-iron garden furniture; the 20th-century German innovation (Marcel Breuer's, actually) of steel tubular furniture.
But the real deal here is the long gallery at the end, on the right, where American silver, pewter, gold-plated Jewish ritual silver and red-and-gold tolework (cast tin painted to imitate Asian lacquer, with rococo flourishes) hold forth. Too often, visitors use this gallery primarily as the entryway to the museum's popular 19th-century American period rooms, but it is packed with remarkable sights and information. 
Vitrine by vitrine, the displays cover the arrival of electroplating that put silverish flatware on so many American dinner tables, and they observe the cross-fertilization between silver and ceramics. They parse the contrasting styles of Boston and New York tankards, heavy lidded status symbols used for communal ale consumption. They offer an array of the small, fretwork-handled bowls called porringers. (God is in the handles, and the delicate softened lines of the one by the maker known only as S. H.) A pock-surfaced bowl by Gerrit Onckelbag from 1720 has the rustic dignity of a Japanese tea bowl, while an impeccably plain example by Myer Myers is as taut as crystal.
There is a heady sense of competition with European silver design in vitrines that trace the medium's rapidly changing styles up to the early 20th century -- ticking off neo-Classicism, late neo-Classicism, Rococo Revival and Renaissance Revival and culminating in a stretch devoted to Japonisme and Gilded Age eclecticism. The showstoppers include the Tiffany & Company chocolate pot in brown enamel on silver, decorated with lobsters; a Meriden (Conn.) Britannica silver-plate coffeepot, on which the flora and fauna are as thick and accurate as the undergrowth in a fairy painting by Richard Dadd; and a Derby Silver Company flask with a view of the Wild West framed in not-so-bas-relief cacti.
Even the vitrine marked "Installation in Progress" engages, with a tea service whose delicate forms are pinched and dented like George Ohr pots. A quick tour of the period rooms shows silver, pewter and related metalwork in their native habitats, most charmingly in the kitchen of the Cupola House. Emerging on the other side, head for the center stairwell, past a handsomely proportioned 1638 Danish tankard and an unlabeled side chair whose decorative use of upholstery tacks may bring to mind the African chair downstairs.
Take the stairs to the fifth floor, and nip left through the museum's largest recent acquisition -- Judy Chicago's "Dinner Party," where much sparkle is provided by the names embroidered in thick gold thread. Upon emerging, left again.

'American Identities'
Now that the race is almost run, a little mop-up. The galleries of the "American Identities" installation are a lavish display, ranging through 200 years of American object-making with a contextualizing combination of painting, sculpture, folk art and all manner of decorative objects. Metal appears in many guises, but the numbers are down, especially if, like me, you're not too crazy about gilt bronze ornamentation.
The first gallery is devoted to landscape paintings, but 19th-century cast-iron chairs from the museum collection provide seating. In the next, there is an interesting metal moment in the face-off between the Herter Brothers' lavish Sloan House mantel, sconced, candelabra'ed and fire-screened to the hilt in brass and, directly opposite, a tiny slightly rough-edged silver and cloisonne box by Elizabeth Copeland; and there's another one in the third gallery, between Saint-Gaudens's bust of Lincoln and Melvin Edwards's terse implosion of abstract steel in a wall sculpture from 1989.
In the remaining "American Identities" galleries the history of metal proceeds by leaps and bounds with a series of isolated standouts. One is the Peruvian Pizarro commemorative plaque from the 19th century, with its blunt representations of Spanish conquistador and the Inca king. Other are Elie Nadelman's graphite-toned cast-bronze "Dancing Girl," her smooth curving limbs echoing the Chola Krishna in the Southeast Asian Galleries, and George Hunzinger's prophetic armchair, which used steel webbing in the seat and back for the first time. 
In the final gallery, Russel Wright's spun-aluminum beaker and John Vasso's RCA-Victor portable phonograph, its aluminum case as svelte as the Airstream trailer, hint at the new uses of metal in modern design, while David Smith's welded stool sculpture "Hero" speaks for its presence in modern art.
Trying to imagine what the sleeping giant that is the Brooklyn Museum of Art would be like if it were upright and fully alert may be one of those great New York pastimes, like wondering what it would be like if the Second Avenue subway were finished or if the Dodgers had never moved to Los Angeles. It would be great if someone (Bill Gates perhaps?) would plunk $500 million in the museum's lap so that its collections could have the galleries, endowment and (well remunerated) staff they deserve. But I wouldn't want it to get bigger and better by eradicating all of its quirks and foibles. It doesn't hurt to go into label free-fall once in a while, or to see the gleam of an object veiled with a little dust.
These qualities keep a museum as big as Brooklyn's personal and outline the very real challenges of its existence. In addition, the greatness of a city is measured partly in the vitality of its underdogs, and they include benignly neglected treasures, the haunted, imperfect places where you can see things both working and falling apart at the same time and glimpse the eternal dance of ambition and failure that fuels human enterprise.

HEADLINE: A Malaysian Tycoon Loses His Flagship Concern 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
First he lost control of Malaysia's national airline, then one of its biggest cellular operators. Now Tajudin Ramli, the tycoon whose corporate empire has been besieged by the very government that helped him build it, appears to have lost control of his flagship holding company, too.
 Malaysia's bad-debt agency, Pengurusan Danaharta, appointed special administrators earlier this week to take over day-to-day operations at Mr. Tajudin's aviation holding company, Naluri. The move came after the agency scrapped a 510.9 million ringgit ($134 million) deal to sell Mr. Tajudin's 45 percent stake in Naluri to recover some of the roughly 1 billion ringgit he owes Danaharta. 
 "We have to make sure that our rights are protected," said Izhar Hifnei Ismail, an agency spokesman. "What we really want to see is that whatever value there is preserved."
Seizing control of Naluri also gives the agency control of roughly 900 million ringgit ($236 million) left over from the government's much criticized, 1.8 billion ringgit buyout in late 2000 of Mr. Tajudin's stake in the Malaysian Airline System, the flag carrier. Naluri's new administrators will now be able to open Naluri's books, repeating a process that has already produced charges of financial misconduct against Mr. Tajudin at the two other companies he used to run.
The unraveling of Mr. Tajudin's holdings and the surrounding scandal are part of a purge by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of the entrepreneurs he once relied on as nation builders. In their place, he has promoted a group of technocrats, like those who run Danaharta, to overhaul corporate Malaysia.
While it no longer has a business of its own, Naluri owns stakes in four small airlines, including World Airways in the United States. It also owns part of a Malaysian aircraft parts company with Boeing. Executives at Naluri said they were prohibited from commenting by the special administrators. Mr. Tajudin was unavailable, they said.
A former merchant banker, Mr. Tajudin rose to prominence in the late 1980's under Daim Zainuddin, then the finance minister. Mr. Tajudin's company, Technology Resources Industries, bought Naluri, then called Malaysian Helicopter Services, from the struggling Malaysian Airline System in 1991. The same year, Technology Resources bought the country's sole cellular operator, Celcom.
Mr. Tajudin capped the rapid expansion of Malaysian Helicopter in 1994 by turning around and paying 1.79 billion ringgit in cash for the central bank's controlling stake in Malaysian Airline System, financing the purchase with a huge loan backed by his own shareholdings.
Mr. Tajudin's borrowing caught up with him, however, when the Asian financial crisis hit Malaysia in 1997. While Technology Resources and Celcom managed to win restructuring deals with creditors, Mr. Tajudin tried in vain to sell his stake in Malaysian Airline to pay off debts.
In late 2000, the government -- with Mr. Daim doing a reprise as finance minister -- finally bought out Mr. Tajudin, paying Naluri the same price per share it had paid for Malaysian Airline seven years earlier. The bailout, which paid Mr. Tajudin more than twice the prevailing market price, provoked widespread public outrage and was followed by the ouster of Mr. Daim.
Since then, the airline's new managers have asked the police to investigate allegations of irregularities involving a contract with a Naluri cargo venture in Germany.
The new owner of Technology Resources has made similar accusations. Mr. Tajudin lost control of the company last spring when he failed to make payments on roughly 1 billion ringgit in personal loans backed by his stakes in Technology Resources and Naluri. Securities regulators refused to let him use the funds raised by the sale of his Malaysian Airline stake, much of which is still at Naluri. Danaharta, which had bought the loans from local banks, in turn sold his stake in Technology Resources to Telekom Malaysia. 
This summer, Danaharta agreed to sell Mr. Tajudin's stake in Naluri to a little-known company called Valiant Entity. Local newspapers have linked Valiant to Mr. Tajudin, but Danaharta said it had no evidence of a connection. Either way, when Valiant failed to provide Danaharta with a required letter of credit for the purchase by a Dec. 17 deadline, Danaharta called off the sale and appointed special administrators for Naluri from KPMG.
Taking over the management of Naluri is an extraordinary move: the agency usually takes over only deeply indebted companies that it deems beyond restructuring. Naluri has no debts. But Mr. Tajudin remains Naluri's chairman and largest shareholder. In August, Naluri proposed buying back roughly 830 million ringgit in stock from its shareholders.

HEADLINE: Lumps Of Coal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Merry Christmas? No no no.
 Retailers found lumps of coal in their stockings this Christmas; the holiday shopping season was disappointing. So where's the economy heading? 
 Put it this way: It's getting harder to tell a tale with a happy ending.
Here's the story so far: In 2000 the bubble finally burst. As investors and businesses rediscovered the law of gravity, business investment plunged, and the economy slumped. Then the situation stabilized, more or less. Repeated interest rate cuts encouraged families to buy new houses and refinance their mortgages, putting cash in their pockets; yes, the tax cut also made a marginal contribution. Strong housing demand and consumer spending partly offset the lack of business investment. And so the economy began growing again. 
But it has been a jobless, joyless recovery. Payrolls have continued to shrink. The number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months -- an indicator of families facing severe distress -- has risen 55 percent over the past year. And thanks to inaction by Congress and the administration, 800,000 of those long-term unemployed will lose their benefits tomorrow. 
Falling stocks have also taken their toll; many older workers whose 401(k)'s have imploded can no longer afford retirement. Even as overall employment has fallen, the number of working Americans over 55 has increased 8 percent.
This dreary picture will change -- but in which direction? Will it brighten, as businesses finally start spending? Or will it darken even further as worried, heavily indebted consumers pull back?
Most business commentators have been cheerily predicting a recovery in business investment, week after week, for the past year -- brushing aside businessmen who say that they have no plans to invest anytime soon. But it keeps not happening.
On the other hand, a small minority of pessimists -- sometimes including me, depending on what I had for breakfast -- have been insistently predicting a collapse in consumer spending, which also hasn't happened. 
Which will it be? Let me throw some disheartening ingredients into the mix.
First, the Fed has almost run out of room to cut interest rates. It has other tools at its disposal -- but it will be reluctant to try exotic, untested policies unless the economy is clearly facing deflation. So don't expect Uncle Alan to bail us out anytime soon.
Then there are the dogs of war. Oil futures are already above $32 per barrel. Donald Rumsfeld assures us that we can fight two wars at once, but nobody seems to have thought about the state of oil markets if there is simultaneous turmoil in the Persian Gulf and Venezuela. Also, gold prices have been soaring; this doesn't affect the real economy, but it's an indicator of nervousness. 
What about help from Washington? I'll talk about the administration's "stimulus" plans in another column, but one thing that's clear is that the apparent centerpiece -- lower taxes on dividends -- has nothing to do with stimulus. The administration clearly still believes that problems aren't challenges to be met, they're opportunities to push a pre-existing agenda. 
Finally, there's the desperate plight of the states. New estimates by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities show that state governments are facing their worst fiscal crisis since the 1930's. Since Washington shows no interest in helping, states will be forced into desperate expedients. Taxes, mainly taxes that fall most heavily on the poor and the middle class, will go up. Spending on education and, especially, health care will be slashed, with the heaviest toll falling on struggling low-wage workers and their children. (Leave no child behind!) 
Aside from the resulting suffering, the efforts of states to balance their budgets will be a significant drag on the economy, probably several times larger than the boost from the administration's so-called stimulus program.
Are there any possible sources of good news? 
Yes, a few. A walkover victory in Iraq could lead to sharply lower oil prices. Technology marches on, so businesses could finally decide that it's time to replace aging equipment, even though they still have plenty of spare capacity. Inventories are low; someday businesses will restock, and in so doing give the economy a boost. 
Are you enthused? I'm not. I hope I'm wrong, but this doesn't look like a happy new year.

HEADLINE: Settling for Less 

BYLINE:  By Lucian Bebchuk; Lucian Bebchuk is a professor at Harvard Law School and a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
One week ago regulators and the nation's top investment firms announced what they described as a historic settlement. To settle government claims that they misled investors, the country's 10 largest securities firms will pay $1.4 billion and will make certain changes in how they operate. Industry regulators said the settlement represents "the dawn of a new day on Wall Street" and is a "vital step in restoring investor confidence."
 It might be more accurate to regard the settlement, announced by federal, state and industry regulators, as a slap on the wrist. By any standard measure -- its punitive value, its deterrence effect or the extent to which it will bring about structural change on Wall Street -- the settlement is rather modest. 
 One goal of regulatory action is to provide deterrence by imposing costs for past misdeeds. For deterrence to be effective, players must anticipate penalties that would exceed any gains they would make from the misbehavior. While more than $1.4 billion in fines and future payments is hardly trivial, it is not large given what is at stake and the potential gains to the firms from this type of misconduct.
Consider Citigroup, on which much of the recent investigation has focused. Jack Grubman, its star analyst, is alleged to have painted an excessively rosy picture of telecommunications firms in order to help Citigroup get underwriting business. The total cost of the settlement to Citigroup will be $400 million. Is this price steep enough to discourage thoughts of similar misdeeds in the future? Hardly.
According to a complaint filed by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer against five telecom executives who received shares in companies brought public by Citigroup's investment banking unit, the unit has underwritten $190 billion in the telecom sector alone since 1996, pocketing hundreds of millions in underwriting fees. Moreover, according to its 2001 annual report Citigroup made $4 billion from underwriting fees in 2000 and 2001 -- 10 times the cost of its part of the settlement.
Aside from monetary penalties, another way to discourage corporate misconduct is the threat of criminal sanctions for corporate executives. Thus far, however, regulators have not announced any plans to indict any of the individuals involved in the scandals over analysts' research and banks' conflicts of interest.
Perhaps the value of the settlement lies in neither its punitive effect nor its deterrence value but in the structural changes it will bring to Wall Street. The terms of the settlement require the firms to sever direct ties between their research divisions and their investment banking businesses. By preventing analysts from accompanying investment bankers when they make sales calls, for example, and by prohibiting any linking of analysts' compensation to the investment banking business they bring in, the settlement tries to ensure that analysts will render objective investment advice.
But even without such direct links, analysts will still be influenced by how their actions affect their firm's other profit centers, like investment banking. The settlement does not permit the fate of analysts to be directly determined by the investment banking unit. But the success and compensation of analysts will continue to depend on the management and decisions of the firm's top executives, for whom investment banking fees remain an important source of profits.
There is strong empirical evidence that analysts tend to issue more favorable reports about companies with which their firms have an underwriting relationship. There is little reason to expect that the settlement will eliminate this pattern.
Analysts have substantial discretion in choosing which recommendation to issue. We might expect their recommendation to be influenced if, for example, their firm brought public the company they are covering. And we might expect the head of the research department to try to please the firm's executives with a department that makes "buy" recommendations rather than "sell" recommendations for the companies the firm underwrites.
In fairness to the regulators, they had to take into account other considerations in fashioning the settlement. Tougher action on the nation's top investment firms could have dealt a terrible blow to important institutions at a difficult time for the capital markets. It is also true that the reputational costs and public embarrassment caused by the scandals, coupled with the private suits many investors are bringing, will provide some measure of deterrence. And perhaps there are no realistic structural reforms that would work better than the moderate ones adopted.
Still, the settlement is better characterized as "business as usual" than as "the dawn of a new day." We should not exaggerate the extent to which the settlement will restore investor confidence.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Decline as Investors Worry About War and Oil

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors worried about hostilities in Iraq and a steep rise in oil prices sent stocks lower yesterday in light trading. 
 Retailers were punished after Wal-Mart Stores lowered its December sales expectations. 
 An afternoon sell-off came after a morning rally that had been set off by a Labor Department report indicating that new claims for unemployment benefits were dropping. 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 116 points before reversing direction. 
At the end of regular trading, the Dow was down 15.50 points, or 0.18 percent, at 8,432.61. Declines in both Amazon.com and Microsoft helped pull the Nasdaq composite index down 4.58 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,367.89. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 2.81 points, or 0.31 percent, at 889.66. 
Investors turned bearish after the United States military said warplanes from the American-British coalition bombed Iraqi military command and communication sites yesterday in southern Iraq. The attack was in retaliation for the downing of an American surveillance drone on Monday, the military said. 
The rising tension with Iraq, along with the continued strike in Venezuela, sent oil prices soaring. Oil prices for February delivery jumped 52 cents to $32.49, and some analysts predict that the price could soon hit $35. 
Still, analysts cautioned against reading too much into yesterday's trading. 
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said, "When volume is light, it doesn't take much to move the market either way, so I wouldn't read a lot into it." 
Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities attributed yesterday morning's gains to "a lack of sellers" and said trading continued a pattern of a short-term rally followed by a short-term decline.
"I think it is part of the market trying to bottom out in anticipation of a better year in 2003," he said.
Wal-Mart said yesterday that it was cutting its December forecast for stores open at least a year and now expected sales to gain 2 percent to 3 percent.
It had predicted sales at the low end of a 3 percent to 5 percent range. 
Investors apparently anticipated the reduced sales figures and sent Wal-Mart share up 6 cents, to $49.76. But Federated Department Stores fell 24 cents, to $27.66, and Amazon.com dropped $1.58, to $20.30. 
The decline for Amazon.com came despite its announcement that it had finished its "busiest holiday season ever" with more than 56 million items ordered worldwide from Nov. 1 to Dec. 23. Analysts speculated that investors had been rattled by Wal-Mart's report so they did not respond positively to Amazon's news. 
Meanwhile, the drug makers Pfizer and Pharmacia fell sharply after an article in The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the widely used arthritis drug Celebrex, made by Pharmacia, did not protect the stomach from dangerous bleeding ulcers as much as had been thought. Pfizer and Pharmacia both promote the drug. Pfizer dropped $1.36, to $30.02, while Pharmacia was down $2.02, to $40.98. 
Shares in Microsoft fell 43 cents, to $53.39, despite its announcement that shoppers spent a record $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter at its MSN network of Internet services. 
In the bond market yesterday, Treasury prices rose as the stock market fell. The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 100 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.90 percent, from 3.94 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 107 29/32. The note's yield fell to 4.86 percent, from 4.87 percent.

HEADLINE: Film Agency at Center Of Corruption Inquiry 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
With soaring costs steadily driving film production out of Southern California, Los Angeles area politicians and entertainment industry officials created an agency seven years ago to make it easier and cheaper for Hollywood studios to work closer to home.
 But now, the Los Angeles County district attorney is investigating the former president of the agency to determine whether he defrauded the city and county by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses and political donations, some to members of the board that oversees the agency. 
 "We're pursuing this as a case of suspected political corruption and possible embezzlement," Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said today. "This is a public agency that should follow the same rules, regulations and laws relative to all public offices and agencies here, and we're absolutely committed to pursuing the case." 
No charges have been filed against the former president, Cody Cluff, who resigned on Monday. Through his lawyer, he has denied any wrong-doing and offered to assist investigators any way he can. He also has insisted that the agency is private and that he has legitimate explanations for the expenditures.
"We completely understand the district attorney's interest, but we just think he's barking up the wrong tree," said Mark J. Werksman, Mr. Cluff's lawyer. "Nothing Cody has done amounts to any unlawful or illegal activities. He believes he has conducted himself appropriately and lawfully and expects to show the district attorney that he has no grounds for prosecution with this investigation."
Until 1995, the city and county had separate offices that worked with production companies, providing help with street closings, the police and access to neighborhoods and public buildings. Over the years, the redundancy of operations drove up production costs and contributed to studios' moving projects to countries where labor is cheaper and bureaucracies less dense.
In response, officials here consolidated the film offices under one roof as the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, intending to retain more of the $16 billion industry in California by reducing the time needed to obtain permits for shooting. Entertainment has surpassed aerospace as the state's largest industry, now employing nearly 200,000 people in the production of movies, television shows and commercials.
The agency was created with a 45-member board comprising a nearly equal number of industry leaders and elected officials, including the 5 members of the County Board of Supervisors, the mayor and the 15 members of the Los Angeles City Council. Mr. Cluff, who led the city film office at the time, was hired to lead the new agency. 
The formulation of the board to include public officials has now become a major factor in the investigation and whether the case might go to court. Some officials, including City Attorney Rockard J. Delgadillo, contend that the agency was created as a private organization, charging production companies fees that include the costs of gaining permits from the appropriate locality. Yet Mr. Cooley and others insist that the presence of elected officials on the board makes it a public entity. Both sides say that would be for a court to determine as part of any prosecution.
"If it's judged a private agency, that's a tougher case for him," Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Board of County Supervisors, said of Mr. Cooley. "Most people who have looked at it from a legal perspective say it's private. But I share the view that when you have the mayor, the City Council and the Board of Supervisors on the board, it's hard, in a layman's sort of way, to describe it as nonpublic."
In either instance, the board exercised little oversight in monitoring Mr. Cluff's activities and rarely met, leading Mr. Cooley to conclude that the members "did not exercise the fiduciary responsibility you would expect." For that reason, he added, he would not rule out investigating individuals and organizations that benefited from Mr. Cluff's spending, including elected officials.
"Anything's possible at this early stage," Mr. Cooley said. "Let's see where the money takes us."
So far, the case has taken Mr. Cooley's investigators to Mr. Cluff's homes in Covina and San Dimas and his office on Hollywood Boulevard, where 70 boxes of records obtained by search warrants show that he made "a number of suspicious and/or seemingly inappropriate financial transactions."
According to the warrants, Mr. Cluff spent lavishly on political contributions, tickets for concerts and sports events and travel, and lesser amounts on local charities, booster clubs and schools, including those his children attended. One public official, Jackie Goldberg, a City Council member from Hollywood who ran successfully for the State Assembly in 2000, received $15,650 from Mr. Cluff's agency.
Over all, the warrants found evidence that Mr. Cluff was reimbursed more than $500,000 for personal expenses like telephone, cable and television services, expensive dinners and membership in the Grand Havana Room, a cigar club in Beverly Hills. Mr. Cooley's office is also investigating why Mr. Cluff contributed more than $40,000 to the Pittsburgh Film Office, an agency run by a friend of his, and a national association of film development companies that the two of them helped organize.
Keith Comrie, a former city and county official who has been asked by the agency board to oversee an audit and restructuring plans, which are now under way, said nothing had surfaced to indicate Mr. Cluff had done anything illegal. Further, he praised Mr. Cluff for running an agency that has cut the permit-approval process to hours, in some cases, from weeks.
Mr. Werksman said that an agency so involved in the economic stability of the region should be beyond reproach.

HEADLINE: Independent Oil Producers Squeeze Out aHard Living 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: VIVIAN, La. 

 BODY:
Every day but Sunday, starting around 7 a.m., Robert Caldwell ranges the pine woods just outside town, tending to about 110 wells that squeeze a tiny bit of oil from the old, stingy fields of northwestern Louisiana.
 Keeping the family business, Caldwell Oil, afloat is a daily fight. Over the last 22 years it has survived a tornado and a forest fire, and Mr. Caldwell -- everyone around here calls him Fud -- must watch out for rats that regularly eat the wiring in the trucks he parks at the fields. 
 But as much as anything else, he keeps an eye on the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela, because these days, he suspects that events half a world away, more than any force of nature here, could ruin his business. 
"If we take Saddam Hussein out, Saudi Arabia won't give us use of their airfields. So what they're going to do to help is open the spigot so the price of oil won't run way high," Mr. Caldwell, 65, calculated. "The price of oil will fall, just like it did during the first gulf war. The world wants cheap oil. They're not concerned with little independents like us."
Caldwell Oil is fairly typical of the thousands of small independent oil companies in the United States working in fields that the major oil companies abandoned years ago as uneconomical. The mom-and-pop operators, and much larger independent oil companies, eke out enough oil to account for about 20 percent of domestic production, or around one million barrels a day. That rivals the output from Alaska or the normal level of oil imports from Venezuela, according to a trade group, the Independent Petroleum Association of America. 
But pumping oil from wells in these fields, called stripper wells, is expensive. So while all oil companies would be hurt by a drop in prices, small outfits like Caldwell Oil could vanish altogether because their profit margins are so narrow. It costs the little independents about $18 to get one barrel of oil out of the ground; it costs major companies something like $5 at their domestic wells. 
Because of such vulnerability, small operators in oil fields from Pennsylvania to California closely track the decisions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Like Mr. Caldwell, they find their interests converging with those of the most oil-dependent economies in the world on maintaining oil prices around $25 a barrel.
"We need a price close to the same number for different reasons," said Gigi Lazenby, chief executive of the Bretagne General Partnership, an independent oil company in Beattyville, Ky. "I don't want to gouge anybody, but it's a delicate balance," she said. "If the price of oil gets too low, it will kill domestic production, and that becomes a national security issue when we start importing more oil."
Though prices are steeper now, the price of crude oil has in fact averaged around $25 a barrel this year. The last three years of relatively high oil prices, attributable largely to OPEC's management of global supplies, brought slightly more stripper wells on line in 2001, including two that Mr. Caldwell drilled.
But he and other operators did not expand this year. Given the shaky economy, the push toward war and OPEC's own priorities, many small operators worry that the price of oil could suddenly plummet. 
"OPEC says it wants to hold prices at $25, but when they cheat on each other like they are, it just adds to the uncertainty," Mr. Caldwell said, echoing concerns in the energy markets. 
Stripper wells pump no more than 15 barrels of oil a day, and more often around a barrel. Mr. Caldwell's better wells deliver perhaps two barrels a day. Bigger wells operated by major companies like BP or Exxon Mobil gush tens of thousands of barrels a day.
But 80 percent of operating wells in the United States are stripper wells, according to the independents' trade group, a sign of the advanced age and declining volume of American onshore oil reserves.
In the early 1900's, big companies began to plumb the Caddo-Pine Island oil reservoir around Vivian, Mr. Caldwell said. Booms came and, just as surely, busts followed. Over time, the down cycles have carved away at places like Vivian, turning them into quiet mazes of empty buildings. The last major oil company here, Texaco, finally gave up on the area in the last decade, selling and leasing its fields to small oil companies.
"The major oil companies -- we're picking up the crumbs they left behind," Mr. Caldwell said one recent afternoon, with more pride than bitterness, as he drove his red truck through his fields. "The majors are all offshore or overseas."
Some local oil companies have been around for generations. Mr. Caldwell turned to oil after retiring from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1980, inspired by memories of life as a roughneck here when he was a teenager. He is the company's president and one of three employees, along with a son and grandson.
He says that little has changed in the way people pump oil here in the last 40 years. In the stubbled pastures and on some front lawns, horse-head oil pumps nod ceaselessly. The oil from several wells flows through skinny pipes to a nearby stand of tanks. To produce a barrel of oil, the Caldwells pull up about 250 barrels of water. They separate the oil and water, and the oil flows into 8-foot-tall collection tanks, dripping like coffee brewing. 
The air near the wells smells of asphalt. The Caldwells' oil is "heavy," less valuable than the West Texas light crude oil that sets the domestic benchmark price. So when oil is $25 a barrel, Mr. Caldwell says, he may receive about $22 from the local oil broker, whose tanker trucks haul it away. It costs Caldwell Oil about $16 to get a barrel out of the ground. All told, his wells pump 60 to 70 barrels a day.
Regardless of the price of oil, the price of everything else from chemicals to equipment has risen, Mr. Caldwell and others here said.
The Caldwells pay more than $10,000 a month alone for electricity to run their sites. People here also complain mightily that environmental regulations have made it expensive to work. To control expenses, the Caldwells buy equipment secondhand and do nearly everything themselves.
Mr. Caldwell and his son Boe erected the electrical poles by their fields and cleared the red clay roads, stitched here and there with deer and bobcat tracks. They maintain their own wells, cannibalizing broken equipment to keep everything else running.
But the enjoyment is bleeding out of the work, Mr. Caldwell said. In a good year, the company makes about $150,000, which it divides among several owners. In a bad year, it slides into the red, and the company dips into savings it put away for tough times.
"When the price of oil is high, our leases could be worth $1 million," Mr. Caldwell said. "But when it's low, they're worthless. That's why everybody is watching to see if Russia comes on line more, because then our fields could be worthless." (Russian output has grown significantly over the last three years.)
The demands in the field seldom relent; almost daily, a stripper well here needs to be repaired. 
Down a dirt path called Catfish Road, Steve McLaurin, owner and one of two workers at the McLaurin Oil Company, uses a winch on the back of a big truck to pull out the pipes encasing the inside of his 1,000-foot well to fix a leak in one section. A former accountant, Mr. McLaurin is flecked in the oil that drips off the 30-foot-long sections of pipe that he and his helper rapidly set on metal racks extending into the woods. 
The well draws three-quarters of a barrel a day, and Mr. McLaurin's 55 wells produce only 30 barrels. A quarter of that goes to ChevronTexaco, which leases the wells to McLaurin Oil. The returns are so slim for such punishing labor that relatively few young people, like Mr. McLaurin, 36, now enter the independent oil business. 
"You can't find people under 30 to work," he said. "It's too hard, too dirty. Think of the summer, when it's 100 degrees out here."
Even some industry veterans have given up after decades. "The main reason is the fluctuation in the price of oil," said Jim Briggs, who until recently ran the biggest independent oil business in town. Over a 40-year career, he said, "I've seen it go from $2.75 a barrel to $40 and everything in between. But it's been a lot more volatile the last 20 years."
He sold some of his well leases to Mr. Caldwell, who, despite working alongside his son and grandson, says, only half-jokingly, that he may be the last one to stick out the oil business in Vivian.
"When I go, I want to go like Al Chiles," Mr. Caldwell said, referring to a relative who died at 86, the day after he repaired a well. "I'll work until I die and they slide me out on the pipe rack."

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS; 
Number of Bidders for Expos Is Growing

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Major League Baseball needs to sell the Montreal Expos, and three bidders in the Washington-Northern Virginia area are willing to import the majors' small payroll ward to the nation's capital.
 Robert L. Johnson is the new guy (his partner is Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins) but in the week since Johnson agreed to buy the National Basketball Association's new team in Charlotte, N.C., he has become the best known. 
 William L. Collins III has lobbied for eight years to bring a team to Northern Virginia. Frederic V. Malek has been pushing to move a team to Washington for nearly four years. 
But Johnson, the chief executive of Black Entertainment Television, which is based in Washington, gained a substantial public coup when he bought the Charlotte team: he is the first African-American principal owner of a major professional sports franchise.
"Bob Johnson is a real significant guy," Malek, a former aide to the first President Bush and a partner in the Texas Rangers when the second President Bush was the general partner. "He'll be a real competitor if he decides to do this all the way."
Johnson, who hired Lehman Brothers to advise him last week, is offering no indication that his late entry into the Washington fray will lead to a quick exit. But one factor could chase Johnson out -- if baseball, which bought the attendance-deprived Expos for $120 million earlier this year from Jeffrey Loria, sets an overly high sale price.
The logic for charging as much as $200 million for the Expos is twofold: one, to recoup what baseball paid Loria as well as losses incurred last season; and two, to capitalize on the economics the team would benefit from by playing in Washington or Virginia in a new ballpark.
"I have a lot of trouble with baseball charging more than it paid for Montreal," Johnson said in a telephone interview yesterday. "Once you get above that, remember, the owner will have to kick in another $75 million to $100 million for the stadium. If baseball gets too pricey with the team, you might as well buy the Angels, a World Series team, for $225 million or $250 million."
Johnson said that baseball should be happy to have the Expos taken off its hands and that a new owner would have a team with a depleted player corps, losses and marketing costs. However, he has an idea to make money for baseball down the road.
If baseball sold Johnson 51 percent of the Expos for $120 million, it could sell the rest to a willing buyer in several years, when the benefits of being in a better market and a (presumably) filled stadium are apparent. "The league stops the bleeding on the front end, and gets appreciation based on the future value on the back end," Johnson said.
Baseball started the move-the-Expos process last month by appointing a relocation committee. At the owners' meeting next month, the committee is expected to determine how the bidding will proceed. It appears government and community officials from cities interested in buying the Expos will meet with the committee in February, followed by a meeting with potential owners in March.
Besides Washington and Northern Virginia, Portland, Ore., and Charlotte are interested in luring the Expos. The process is expected to conclude by the All-Star Game break in July with the choice of a new owner. The Expos would play in their new home starting in 2004. If the move is to Washington, they would occupy R.F.K. Stadium for a few years.
A study developed by Malek's group, the Washington Baseball Club, and the D. C. Sports and Entertainment Commission, identified five locations for a downtown, 41,000-seat ballpark. With land costs, the price tags for new stadiums range from $342 million to $542 million.
Johnson said he did not expect an auction of the Expos. Rather, after talks with potential owners, baseball would set a price based on a ballpark-financing deal it would make with the city. 
"If baseball sets a price that's too rich, I'll pass," Johnson said.
Johnson's sudden high profile raises two questions, one of them raised by Malek. Can Johnson rebuild the N.B.A.'s Charlotte market so soon after the Hornets left the city for New Orleans and persuade baseball that he has enough time to pursue and own a baseball team? 
"He's going to have a mammoth job in Charlotte," Malek said.
Johnson said the question came up when he was competing with the Steve Belkin-Larry Bird group for the Charlotte franchise. "I was successful in convincing the N.B.A. that I can do both," he said. "When you look at the group we'd put together in D. C., it won't detract from my ability to do the other."
If he takes the Expos to Washington, Johnson said he would be the principal owner, with 25 to 30 percent of the equity, selling the rest to a number of local investors. In Charlotte, he expects to own about 75 percent of the team.
The second question regards the meaning of racial diversity. Four of Malek's partners, all potential investors, are black: the lawyer Vernon Jordan; the Redskins' Darrell Green; Dennis Hightower, a former Walt Disney Company executive; and Franklin Raines, chief executive of Fannie Mae.
"Our four black members don't have the same financial resources of Bob Johnson, but the determining factor is the impact they'd have on our community and the role models they would be," Malek said.
But Johnson said: "What Fred is saying is that he has four minority investors. The story isn't that baseball wants investors. It wants owners."

HEADLINE: Post-Christmas Bargains Fail to Draw Big Crowds 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Rosa Delanuez, a City College student, was toting several shopping bags at Macy's flagship store in Manhattan yesterday because she and her close relatives have a holiday tradition: give a few small gifts on Christmas Day, but do the bulk of the shopping afterward and save the best presents for Jan. 6, the Day of the Three Kings.
 "We always do that in my family," said Ms. Delanuez, 27, of Manhattan, as she examined a glass vase that was marked down from $20 to $7. "We love to get those bargains." 
 The day after Christmas used to be primarily an occasion to return that superfluous tie or exchange that extra-large blue sweater for a medium-size red one. But now many cost-conscious consumers save some of their shopping for the post-Christmas sales.
So yesterday, many people crowded into Macy's said they had come to buy, knowing that there were steeper discounts to be had after Christmas. Signs throughout the store read, "Storewide After-Christmas Sale." 
But although Macy's seemed bustling yesterday, and salespeople waged a Sisyphean battle to keep racks of deeply discounted sweaters looking presentable, one retail expert said that shoppers did not flock to Manhattan stores in the same numbers they did when the economy was stronger.
In the past, said Burt Flickinger III, a retail consultant, "you couldn't get on an escalator or elevator the day after Christmas. On Fifth Avenue, it would take you six or seven minutes to travel a single block." The huge Gap store in Herald Square was busy, but some other stores on 34th Street had few customers and foot traffic was light.
But some malls in the area drew big crowds. At the Queens Mall on Queens Boulevard, there were long lines from the parking garage to the elevator. Domenica Prainito, 39, a financial analyst, left work early to shop for herself. "It's a zoo in this place," she said, as she browsed in Victoria's Secret. "I don't know if it's even worth it."
But there were few cars at the Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead, L.I., and customers said they were disappointed by the prices. Galina Zvenyatskaya, 38, a Russian emigre, said she was shopping for New Year's gifts and had hoped for post-Christmas discounts.
"This year, the prices were pretty much the same," she said. "They weren't lower than before Christmas."
In the city, traffic may have been relatively thin because of the snowstorm on Wednesday. The sidewalks outside Macy's had been cleared, but elsewhere in the neighborhood, pedestrians still had to make their way over patches of snow.
But Mr. Flickinger said the weather was not to blame for the relatively low turnout. He said consumers did not feel motivated to buy yesterday because they had been conditioned to expect further discounts. "They are saying, 'We know there's a better price today, but it's going to be even lower next week.' " he said.
One bargain hunter was Kirk Williams, 26, of Harlem, who was carrying three foot baths that had been priced at $19 only a week ago and were now on sale for $9.95, plus a 15 percent coupon discount. "You can't beat that," said Mr. Williams, an accountant who is planning to give the foot baths to his girlfriend, her sister and her mother. "What doesn't a woman already have?" he said, grinning.
Standing outside the Gap store in Herald Square, Tamika Wilson, 23, of the Bronx said she had spent about $200, or 20 percent, less on Christmas gifts this year than last year because of the discounts. And even though she works as a financial analyst for Conde Nast, she is watching her pennies.
"The economy's not getting any better," she said. "I go to work, and I take it day by day. Why spend money if I can save it? God only knows if I'll have my job next month -- or even next week."

HEADLINE: Amid Debt Downgrading, Lower Borrowing Costs 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Downgradings by credit-rating agencies reached a record this year, if barely, but at the same time, the borrowing costs of corporations have sunk because of low Treasury yields. 
 Interest on long-term investment-grade bonds has fallen to 6.84 percent on average, the lowest level since 1974, according to the chief economist of Moody's Investors Service, John Lonski. 
The average coupon at the beginning of this year was 7.04 percent. 
 J. P. Morgan Chase suffered a one-notch cut by Moody's in its credit rating early in October. But the next month, it sold $1 billion worth of 10-year global notes yielding 5.77 percent, or 0.90 percentage point lower than it paid on the same maturity notes in March. 
The spread, or premium paid over debt issued by the United States Treasury in November, was about 0.40 percentage point higher than in March as investors demanded more compensation for risks after the corporate downgradings.
For many companies, falling Treasury yields have more than offset the impact of the downgradings, which can otherwise push up corporate borrowing costs. Ten-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for many corporate rates, now yield just 3.90 percent, down from 5.03 percent at the beginning of the year. 
Moody's downgraded a record 647 ratings this year, edging past the 645 last year. It upgraded 129 ratings, the fewest since 1991, when it upgraded 120. 
Lower borrowing costs and companies' efforts to cut back debt should help slow the pace of downgraded issues somewhat next year, Mr. Lonski said. 
Telecommunications, technology and the power industry accounted for 241 downgradings, or 37 percent of this year's total, Mr. Lonski said. Excluding those sectors, downgrades would be about 16 percent lower than last year, he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MILITARY; 
At U.S. Nerve Center, Daily Talks on the Worst Fears

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. 

 BODY:
At about 8:45 most mornings, in a conference room at this base at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and a dozen other federal agencies meet to debate how the Pentagon should respond if terrorists strike again in the United States.
 The meeting's host, Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart of the Air Force, a four-star general who is now the nation's top officer responsible for domestic security, mulls over doomsday scenarios for a new wave of attacks by Al Qaeda or some other terrorist group. 
 "By air or ship or truck or suicide bomber," General Eberhart said in a recent interview, listing the threats that he must be ready to confront as the head of the military's new Northern Command. "Medical scenarios: smallpox, you name the disease that we might be involved in in terms of quarantine." 
"What if an airport is attacked, or a seaport?" he continued. "You name the infrastructure. It could be a bridge, it could be an oil refinery, the list goes on and on. We can all envision the terrible things that might happen." 
For up to an hour each day in what is blandly called "the commander's situational awareness meeting," General Eberhart asks representatives of each of the 14 agencies -- a roster that also includes the State Department, the National Security Agency, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration -- for updates from their experts, and advice on what he should do if the worst happens.
"What we're trying to prepare ourselves for is the God-awful possibility that there could be two or three at the same time, and they could be different in nature," General Eberhart said. 
For now, officials say, the daily discussion is speculative: imagining and preparing for whatever terrorists might unleash within American borders. 
But there is every expectation back in Washington and certainly here, in the headquarters of the Northern Command, that if terrorists strike again inside the United States, General Eberhart and his deputies will find themselves directing a large part of the federal government's response. 
In a large-scale terrorist attack, especially if there is any threat of the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that could overwhelm the ability of state and local governments to respond, the Northern Command would probably take charge of the scene, directing the response from a command post bored deep in a mountain a few miles from this installation in Colorado Springs. 
"I guess you could conjure up a situation where it was so bad that no one else had the capability to be in charge," General Eberhart said. "We could be in charge at that point." 
His emergency command center, part of a 4.5-acre bunker complex buried 2,000 feet into Cheyenne Mountain, was built in the 1960's to enable the United States to detect and respond to a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. 
Today, video screens in the command center that once monitored activity in Russian missile silos and the location of Soviet bombers instead display the air-traffic control network for thousands of civilian planes flying over the continental United States. 
A legacy of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the Northern Command began operations in October to coordinate the military's response to threats against the United States and its territorial waters. 
While it has few troops under its direct control, the command now has a staff of about 500 people, both military and civilian, and can draw on tens of thousands of troops in a matter of hours if there is a domestic emergency demanding the Pentagon's response.
The Northern Command coordinated the deployment of Army RC-7 airborne reconnaissance low-surveillance planes to the Washington area during the sniper attacks this fall. It dispatched maritime forces off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where President Bush attended the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in October.
The command is operating on a budget of $81 million this fiscal year, which is expected to grow by about $20 million a year through 2008. 
The staff includes full-time representatives of civilian agencies like the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the State Department, that otherwise rarely answer directly to the Pentagon. 
The F.B.I. representative is a former Air Force officer with a background in countering domestic terrorism; the C.I.A. representative is a former undercover officer who has held assignments for the agency in Asia and Central America; and the State Department adviser is a career Foreign Service officer who was recently posted in Afghanistan. (All agreed to be interviewed on condition they not be named.) 
The close ties that are being established here between the Defense Department and federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have already given pause to civil liberties groups that the military will be given too much authority to intrude in the lives of American civilians as it fights terrorism. 
Among those advising General Eberhart is Col. Jarisse J. Sanborn, the senior legal adviser, who is asked to weigh whether the command's proposed duties might interfere with federal laws that restrict the domestic role of the military. In particular, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 bars troops from direct involvement in domestic law enforcement duties, like arrests and detentions.
"Everything we do has to be looked at," Colonel Sanborn said. 
General Eberhart, a decorated combat pilot, says that he is sensitive to the concerns of civil libertarians and that he would respond to a terrorist attack only at the express direction of the White House and the Pentagon, and at the request of local authorities.
"We also understand Civics 101," he said. "I really don't think, based on those checks and balances, that we're going to get into a situation where the military will be doing things that should be done by other agencies, either in the federal government or by state and local governments."

HEADLINE: A Digit and a World Apart; 
At 565 Park, Living the Dream; at 1565, Still Dreaming

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
There is more than two and a half miles of asphalt and a single digit in the addresses separating 565 Park Avenue from 1565 Park Avenue.
 The first is an elegant co-op apartment building at East 62nd Street that sits opposite the Colony Club, surrounded by canopied neighbors. The second is a brick-faced public housing tower that sits in a quiet corner of the James Weldon Johnson Houses at East 112th Street, surrounded by a spiky iron fence. 
 The former is home to a cross section of the city's wealthiest and most successful residents: art dealers, otolaryngologists and corporate bankruptcy lawyers. The latter houses a sampling of the city's working and nonworking poor: nursing aides, fast-food restaurant employees and those who survive on their welfare checks. 
Where one has a liveried doorman, the other has a broken door buzzer. In the first, the asking price for apartments starts at $1.5 million. In the second, the poorest tenants pay as little as $137 a month.
A longtime resident of 565 Park summed up her building's charms: "When you walk in the lobby, it smells like old money."
The lobby of 1565 Park, on the other hand, just smells old.
"A lot of people say, 'Hmm, you live on Park Avenue?' " said Denise Combs, a resident of 1565. "I say: 'Not on that Park Avenue. This is the low-income Park Avenue.' "
Ms. Combs is 45 and works as a nursing aide. She has lived in 1565 for nearly a decade with her 15-year-old son and her 13-year-old daughter. On an annual salary of roughly $30,000, she has also raised her sister's three children, who have all moved out of the house. She had no choice. Her sister was beaten, raped and thrown off the roof of the nearby Robert F. Wagner Houses 18 years ago.
"I'm just barely making it," she said. "But I do manage."
Ms. Combs enjoys living on her particular stretch of Park Avenue. The tenants in 1565 look out for one another, she said, and the building is fairly clean. There are not too many drug dealers lurking about. She is situated near convenient bus and subway lines that take her to her job in the Bronx.
"I love this building," she said this month as her pit bull, Brandy, licked at her ankles. "It's a unity-type building. We're all good neighbors here."
Three floors up from Ms. Combs lives Asuncion Anglero. Ms. Anglero, 55, is a professional baby sitter who resides there with her son, Mark Rodriguez, 19, and her daughter, Vanessa Rodriguez, 14. Mark is an honors student at the City University of New York who is on his way -- or so his mother hopes -- to medical school. Vanessa attends the Isaac Newton School on East 116th Street, an intermediate school for students interested in math and science.
"We're a very family-oriented building," Ms. Anglero said. "If someone's in need, we're out there for them. There have been incidents where someone was robbed and everyone came out."
She is perfectly aware that her Park Avenue is not the same Park Avenue that causes realtors to salivate and debutantes to dream. "Everyone knows that beyond 96th Street, the neighborhood turns different, higher class," she said.
Yet she often finds herself 50 blocks south, she said, enjoying summertime walks along the fancier portions of the avenue or through Central Park. "If you're a real New Yorker, you know how to mingle," she explained. "You know how to get along with others."
Over the last 20 years in New York State, the average inflation-adjusted income of the poorest 20 percent of households fell $794, or 5.9 percent, to $12,639, according to a study released in April by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute. In the same period, average income among the richest 20 percent of households in New York rose $56,812, or 54.1 percent, to $161,858.
By the end of the 1990's, the study found, the average income for the richest households in the state was nearly 13 times that of the poorest households. Twenty years ago, the difference was only eightfold.
Unlike their counterparts uptown, none of the residents of 565 who talked about life there agreed to let their names appear in print. There were nervous suggestions that the building's co-op board might not approve.
One tenant, however, consented to sit for a 30-minute interview inside his office at a prominent Midtown law firm. This man said he and his wife have lived in 565 for about six years, having moved there from one of Long Island's finer North Shore suburbs.
"I suppose we had a preference to live on Park," said the lawyer, a tall and powerful-looking man who is the son of a retail store owner from Astoria, Queens. "But we never told each other that we had to live on Park."
The lawyer described himself as a family man -- he has two grown sons -- who enjoys exercising (he doesn't run as much as he used to), reading novels (most recently "Reversible Errors," by Scott Turow) and spending time at his country hideaway in a town he refused to identify. He described his building as well maintained, well serviced and well stocked with businessmen, artistic types and a few "well-known people" whom he also refused to name.
"It's a very nice building, but I don't think there's anything extra special about it," he said with a shrug, sitting behind his imposing wooden desk. "It's just a very nice place to live."
The lawyer is an intelligent man, and he is hardly blind to the status that adheres to living on a street like Park Avenue, an address he referred to as "an identifying mark" akin to attending the right university or attaining a prestigious corporate title.
"Does it add to my life in any realistic way?" he asked. "No. But there is a cachet."
He also made a keen observation about city life by saying that any two points in New York City separated by two miles are likely to be vastly different in socioeconomic terms. Two city miles, he said, is perhaps the equivalent of 10 or 15 miles in other places.
"At the country house," he explained, "I have to travel five miles just to get a gallon of milk."
One of his neighbors agreed to answer several questions over the telephone as long as she was not identified by name. This woman explained that she had moved into the building in 1978 with her husband, who manages their investments. "You can put me down for investments as well, I guess," she said.
She loves 565. "I have a lovely view," she said with a sigh. "I overlook the Colony Club. It's a very small building, very intime," she added. "You say good morning to your neighbors, and then good afternoon."
It took little effort for a reporter to gain access to 1565 Park Avenue, built between 1946 and 1948 by the architectural firm of Mayer & Whittlesey, which five years later completed the Rangel Houses in Washington Heights.
The tenants volunteered the information that the elevator was frequently out of service and that the heat did not come on until 10 p.m. on certain nights.
It was somewhat more difficult to enter 565 Park Avenue, completed in 1914 by Robert T. Lyons, who also built the Gramercy Park Hotel. The management company declined an invitation to set up interviews with the tenants, and the doorman reacted skeptically to questions.
In the past, he explained, he had nearly lost his job for speaking to the press.

HEADLINE: Prayer for Help: Unusual Ways A City Coped In 70's Crisis 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Who knew the lengths to which former Mayor Abraham D. Beame went to ward off New York City's financial collapse? Leading a delegation of mayors to Jerusalem in November 1976, Beame stopped at the Western Wall and wrote a prayerful message to push between the stones: "Help!"
 That account and others are captured on a dozen videos that make up an oral history of the city on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970's. They may not make anyone's list of America's funniest videos, but there was a light side to the trauma of insolvency, as the archive makes clear. 
 The on-camera interviews with principal players rehashing their worst moments and occasional triumphs as the city lurched toward fiscal Armageddon were conducted over the last few years by Jack Bigel, a labor consultant and one of the principal players himself, who died in November at 89. Beame died last year at 94. 
At a time when the city once again faces a huge budget gap, the accounts offer a diverting inside look at the way government really works in a crisis and at some of the political antics, gambles, sheer good fortune and camaraderie that saved New York from bankruptcy. 
The videos, part of a vast store of material yet to be digested, were made available to The New York Times by Mr. Bigel's estate through his firm, Program Planners Inc., and Dean Stan Altman of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, to which the materials were donated. 
"It was not force that encouraged one another to dance together," Mr. Bigel recalled on the tape. He paid for the work by the City University's Oral History Project under its city editor, Edward T. Rogowsky. 
In the end, they and others concluded, the city was saved by an extraordinary spirit of collaboration that united bankers, labor leaders and elected officials. Among the heroes, almost all but Beame agreed, was Gov. Hugh L. Carey. 
The origins of the fiscal crisis, Mr. Bigel and others said, went back much further than is often acknowledged, to at least 1940, when, under Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, the city acquired a taste for short-term loans, increasingly borrowing money against expected income and repaying it before the end of the same fiscal year, usually by borrowing more. 
A default on bonds by the state's Urban Development Corporation in February 1975 was an early warning sign. Luckily, recalled Walter Wriston, then chairman of the institution that eventually became Citibank, the nation's leading bankers just happened to be meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., and the New York contingent, by stationing some of its most intimidating members at the doors, managed to sell their colleagues enough New York bonds to avert a state bankruptcy.
Yet when the city's crunch came shortly afterward, many were caught by surprise. 
That moment came in March, recalled Mr. Wriston, when one of his executive economists, Jac Friedgut, warned, "The city is going to run out of cash in five days."
Mr. Wriston was dumbstruck. "That got my attention," he recalled. "I said, 'You got to be kidding.' "
They rushed to question Mayor Beame and Deputy Mayor James A. Cavanagh. Mr. Wriston said he asked Mr. Cavanagh, "How many people work for the city of New York?"
Mr. Cavanagh reached into his pocket, pulled out a piece of paper, looked at it and said, "Three hundred twenty-five thousand."
Mr. Friedgut leaned over Mr. Cavanagh's shoulder and was amazed to see that the paper was blank.
"Right," Mr. Cavanagh acknowledged, by Mr. Wriston's account. "I don't know how many people work here." Some were double dipping, getting two salaries. Others had just been laid off.
Mr. Friedgut also briefed Edward I. Koch, then a United States representative and later Beame's successor as mayor, and others in the New York delegation. Mr. Koch said he found the news "so shocking it was absolutely unbelievable."
The city held on, but the medicine officials offered, like paying workers in scrip or cutting them back to a four-day workweek, was repugnant to the municipal unions. A short week was particularly odious. As Mr. Bigel recalled, Victor Gotbaum, the powerful and tart-tongued president of the largest union of city workers, District Council 37, told Beame that "he would need to get a proctologist to see the disposition of that proposal."
Barry Feinstein, then the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the union was at war. "We are fighting tree to tree, retreating," he told his union compatriots. "But someday we will regroup."
Because the city had been put under the Emergency Financial Control Board, the unions were also negotiating with a new set of masters. At one session, overseers like Herbert Elish and Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker, were confronted by a union group with Harold Melnick, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, whose coat flapped open to reveal a pistol. Mr. Elish was impressed, asking, "Do you folks negotiate this way all the time?"
The unions and financial leaders came from different worlds. "I never knew that banks had chairmen," Mr. Bigel said. "All I knew about a bank was a teller." 
But the unions were not powerless: through their pension funds, they had the ability to keep the city afloat, as a lender of last resort. Personally, Mr. Bigel said, "none of us could make change for a quarter, but we shopped with hundreds of millions of dollars." 
Yet there were strains among the union leaders, too. Mr. Gotbaum and Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers and the city's United Federation of Teachers, barely spoke to one another. But, ordered out to lunch together by Governor Carey, they broke the ice, Mr. Bigel recalled, after he got Mr. Gotbaum to talk about his favorite wines and Mr. Shanker to reveal his recipe for bagels. They ended with an agreement on wage policies. 
But Mr. Shanker still resisted committing his union's kitty to the city's rescue. On Oct. 16, 1975, as city officials prepared bankruptcy papers for court, Governor Carey summoned Richard Ravitch, the builder and chairman of the revamped Urban Development Corporation, and gave him a police car and the order: "Go find Al Shanker and get him to change his mind." 
Mr. Ravitch recalled tracking the union leader down in his apartment and lobbying him all night. By morning, Mr. Shanker was still resistant, but he agreed to meet at Mr. Ravitch's apartment, bringing along Harry Van Arsdale, leader of a large non-municipal labor coalition, and former Mayor Robert F. Wagner. They haggled until 1 p.m., when Mr. Shanker finally agreed to make the loan. 
There was jubilation -- until Mr. Ravitch realized that the banks were nearing their 3 p.m. close, without the deposit of union funds that would back payments to note holders. After frantic calls, he got the federal authorities to keep the banks open until 4 p.m. Bankruptcy was staved off -- at least temporarily.
In Washington, President Gerald R. Ford was making federal aid to New York conditional on an increase in transit fares and the end of rent control and free tuition at the city colleges -- what became known as the "Ford to New York: Drop Dead" speech. Beame went down to Washington to counter the president's message and came home to find sympathetic Americans mailing him money -- a $5 bill here, a $10 bill there.
Lewis Rudin, the real estate developer who had founded the Association for a Better New York to rally support for the city after he found tenants fleeing his commercial buildings, went to Congress to testify for federal aid. He wore a red Big Apple sticker on his lapel. 
A court reporter told him: "You better take it off here. They don't like you New Yorkers down here." Mr. Rudin removed the sticker and hid it inside his jacket. Later, he recalled, he felt so ashamed of what he had done that he made a gold Big Apple pin and wore it everywhere.
In November 1975, still threatened by default, the city won relief in a state-approved moratorium on debt, allowing it to suspend until June 1978 payment on short-term notes due through May 1976.
It was a year later when Mayor Beame, tearfully forced to institute tuition at the long-free city colleges that had given him his own precious education, got a welcome respite when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel asked him to lead a delegation of mayors to Jerusalem. A day after Beame left his plea of "Help!" at the Western Wall, he got an answer. It wasn't what he had hoped for. 
Back home, the state's highest court had thrown out the moratorium on debt repayment, demolishing the city's immediate bulwark against bankruptcy. Beame rushed back, canceling lunch with former Prime Minister Golda Meir and an audience at Vatican City with Pope Paul VI. 
The city managed to stay afloat, but Washington, in the view of many New York leaders, continued to torture the city with politically suicidal demands. Mr. Gotbaum complained that Treasury Secretary William E. Simon barely believed in government at all -- and then only for police and fire protection, "and he's not sure about fire."
After Beame lost his bid for reelection in November 1977, management of the crisis passed to Mr. Koch, who said he "could not even balance" his own checkbook.
Union leaders pledged their partnership. Mr. Koch differed. "No, we are not partners," he said. "I won the election, not you. We will work together when it's advantageous; other times we'll be adversaries."
He didn't have to wait long. Union leaders came looking for an $800 million raise. The mayor laughed: there was no money. If the unions could find a spare $800 million in the budget, he said, they could have it. With that, Mr. Bigel, who knew from a well-placed comptroller, Martin Ives, that tax collections were running ahead of expectations, showed the mayor the $800 million. The workers got the raises. And Mayor Koch bawled out his financial advisers for hiding the money from him. They told him that they were afraid that if he knew it was there, he would only spend it.
By 1980 the crisis was largely over. The city had survived. But there was still the specter of a transit strike. Mr. Ravitch, then chairman of the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had developed a good rapport with John E. Lawe, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, who was under pressure from a militant faction. They struck a deal and then figured out how to choreograph it. 
Mr. Ravitch would meet with the union executive committee and make his supposedly last and best offer. Mr. Lawe would reject it and throw Mr. Ravitch out of the room. Then Mr. Lawe would urge that they come up with an outrageous counteroffer that Mr. Ravitch would have to refuse. But privately, Mr. Ravitch had agreed to accept it. He would be called back into the room, hang his head in pretend defeat and reluctantly accept. 
The ploy fell apart, however, after Mr. Lawe made his show of throwing Mr. Ravitch out and urging a counteroffer. His men hooted him down. Mr. Ravitch was never invited back in -- and the 11-day transit strike began.
One of the proudest and least-known accomplishments of the fiscal crisis, Mr. Bigel and Mr. Wriston said, was a secretive alliance of labor and capital that became known as the Municipal Union Financial Leaders Group, or MUFLG, pronounced "muffle." They were unlikely partners, Mr. Wriston acknowledged, but he said, "If Sadat can talk to Begin, I can talk to Bigel."

HEADLINE: Poland to Buy Lockheed Jets, Rival Reports 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
The Lockheed Martin Corporation appeared today to have won a $3.5 billion contract to build 48 advanced fighter planes for the Polish Air Force, the largest arms deal ever in Eastern Europe.
 While an official announcement is expected to be made on Friday in Warsaw, one of the rival bidders, Dassault Aviation of France, said today that Lockheed had won. 
 The award will solidify Lockheed Martin's foothold in Eastern Europe as those nations step up efforts to modernize their weapons systems. Poland is the third of the newest members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after Hungary and the Czech Republic, to choose a contractor for new fighter aircraft. Both the Czech and Hungarian contracts went to European suppliers. 
The Lockheed bid was supported by a package of loans, backed by the United States government, that total $3.8 billion.
The Bush administration threw the full weight of its support behind the Lockheed offering, taking advantage of revived strong relations with Warsaw since the collapse of Communism in Poland in 1989.
Charles Edelstenne, Dassault's chief executive, told a French radio station today that political considerations had swayed the decision. "The political element was the dominant element," he said, adding that the Poles had made "an American choice."
It is the second time this year that Dassault has been outflanked by American competitors. In April, Dassault lost a bid to build 40 fighter planes worth $4.4 billion for the South Korean Air Force. The winner of that bid was the Boeing company, with its F-15K, an advanced version of the F-15. Dassault contested the outcome of that bidding war before a South Korean court, asserting that Boeing had not abided by the terms of the tender. The court rejected the claim.
Responding to Mr. Edelstenne's comments, George Standridge, the Lockheed executive who directed the company's sales effort for the Polish contract, told Reuters, "It's wonderful that he declared it, but I didn't know it was his decision."
Poland joined NATO in 1999 and has been trying to bring its armed forces up to the alliance's weapons requirements.
Last week, Poland awarded Patria of Finland a $1 billion contract to build 690 armored vehicles. Now it will soon be able to begin replacing its aging fleet of Soviet-built MIG-21 and MIG-29 jets.
Lockheed offered its F-16 Fighting Falcon for the contract in competition with Dassault, which offered its Mirage 2000-5 jet fighter, and with a combination of Saab of Sweden and BAE Systems of Britain, which proposed the Gripen, the least expensive of the three fighter aircraft.
Early in the bidding, Poland appeared to be leaning toward the Gripen, mainly because of a generous package of investments pledged by Saab and BAE (formerly known as British Aerospace), to offset the cost of the project for Poland's struggling economy. 
But Lockheed, with the assistance of Washington, assembled a package of at least 80 industrial projects it valued at roughly $8 billion, intended largely to assist Poland's battered military industry.
Eight air forces in the Atlantic alliance already fly the F-16, which is powered by engines from United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney division, and the plane's ability to mesh with those aircraft appeared to count in its favor.
Polish officials, who are set to announce the decision on Friday, would not comment on the reports. A final agreement could be signed as early as next month.
The contract would raise Lockheed's standing among those Eastern European states that need to make their weapons systems compatible with those used by the Western alliance, analysts said.
Shares of Lockheed edged up 6 cents, to $56.90, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: GROWTH IN SALES FOR HOLIDAY PERIOD IS LOWEST IN YEARS 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
After examining sales figures from the last frenzied hours before Christmas, experts yesterday declared this year's holiday season the worst in many years.
 Michael P. Niemira, a retail analyst in New York for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said the growth in United States retail sales for the months of November and December, at 1.5 percent, was the lowest it had been since at least 1970, when the bank began keeping track. A spokesman for the National Retail Federation, one of the industry's more upbeat forecasters, said its original estimate of 4 percent growth for December would probably shrink to 3.5 percent. 
 Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's biggest retailer, announced yesterday that it was lowering its estimates of December sales growth in stores open at least a year. The company said its sales would increase by just 2 percent to 3 percent this month instead of the 3 percent to 5 percent it had forecast earlier. Last year, Wal-Mart posted December sales growth of 8.1 percent. 
The idea that even Wal-Mart, the biggest success story in retailing in recent years, was struggling was taken as a sign of wider problems. "This confirms our previous thoughts that holiday sales could be the worst in a decade," Deborah Weinswig, a retail analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, wrote in a note to investors after the Wal-Mart announcement.
On Tuesday, Federated Department Stores said its sales in the third week of December fell below expectations, and it warned that sales for November and December would be less than anticipated. The company, which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's, had predicted a drop of 2.5 percent, compared with the same period last year. Best Buy, a large electronics retailer, said weak sales would cut into profits. 
Worry about the economy and about an impending war with Iraq and new terrorist attacks kept many shoppers from buying, even with deep discounts on many items. Indeed, inventories actually crept up this month, said Scott Krugman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation. "We might be seeing unplanned markdowns" as retailers try to entice people to shop, he said. 
At the same time, lower prices meant that in many cases the same gifts could be bought for less money this year. That was good news for shoppers if not for retailers and manufacturers.
Over the next week, many shoppers are expected to visit stores to cash in gift certificates and gift cards and to exchange presents. In the process, they will buy other things as well. Mr. Krugman says those shoppers can produce 10 percent of all holiday sales. 
Some stores were offering markdowns of as much as 75 percent yesterday. And some reported plenty of traffic. At Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, Ronald L. Frasch, the chief executive, said the store was filled with people exhibiting "a very strong, strong interest in buying things for themselves." He added that the store had met its expectations for the season but would not reveal numbers until next month. 
At Wal-Mart, a pair of good late-December days were not enough to reverse the generally sluggish holiday shopping. "We had two days, Saturday the 21st and Monday the 23rd, with over a billion dollars," said a Wal-Mart spokesman, Tom Williams, "but the increase was too late and too little for us to reach our sales plan." 
Shoppers have been holding out for bargains all month even as retailers have tried to attract them with discounts, sales and "bouncebacks," which offer discounts on future purchases. With few arresting new products on the market, and many people feeling that they already own enough suits, shoes, toys and electronic gadgets, shoppers have been thronging stores to look, but not necessarily to buy. And those who do have jobs have expressed concern that they may lose them, or have their hours cut.
"Spending is more subdued because for three years, economists have been telling people that the situation would get better," said Burt Flickinger III, a partner in Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. "And instead, it got worse."
Among the items that performed below expectations at Wal-Mart in the four days that began Dec. 21 were boys' and men's apparel and small appliances, Mr. Williams said. Among the big sellers as Christmas approached were electronics -- including items like DVD players -- and holiday decorations.
"That tells you that people were really buying close to the event," Mr. Williams said, referring to the decorations. 
Post-Christmas sales began yesterday, but no one expects them to counter the dismal trend. Many stores said they would have no specific sales figures until next month, when they release their December sales figures. 
Target Stores, a unit of the Target Corporation, said earlier this month that its December sales would fall short of expectations. FAO Inc., which owns the FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy chains, said Tuesday that it would close 70 of its toy stores by March in an attempt to return to profitability. At Kmart, where hopes were high for strong holiday sales, a spokeswoman said she could not provide sales figures, but she did say that several toys, including Bratz dolls and Spider-Man walkie-talkies, had done well. The fragrance department, led by Joe Boxer perfumes for men and women, also showed strength, she added. 
At Sears, a spokeswoman said the holiday season showed a typical pattern: strong the day after Thanksgiving, then a lull for two weeks, then what she called a crescendo. The spokeswoman, Jan Drummond, said strong sellers included DVD-VCR players and a combination microwave-toaster. Child-size tool benches, sold under the My First Craftsman label, also did well, and when the weather cooled, so did scarves, hats and gloves. 
This was the first holiday season in which Lands' End clothing was for sale in about 180 of Sears's 870 stores, following Sears's acquisition of Lands' End last May. Ms. Drummond said the Lands' End line "was popular and did well" and added that it would not be on sale in the coming week, although many other items were marked down by as much as 75 percent. 
At J. C. Penney, a spokesman said that the store was anticipating sales growth of 1 percent to 3 percent and that the final days before Christmas "certainly didn't do anything to change that expectation." Sales of jewelry, children's clothing and small appliances were all strong, said the spokesman, Tim Lyons, although catalog sales are expected to fall by 20 percent from last year. 
At Nordstrom, store traffic was described as brisk by a spokeswoman, and big sellers included Juicy Couture velour outfits, washable suede jackets and pots of body glitter. At Best Buy, the electronics chain, a spokeswoman said stores were busy and top sellers included laptop computers and DVD players. "DVD players have pretty much become affordable for everybody," said the spokeswoman, Donna Beadle.
Even the good news seemed hardly good enough. "A 3.5 percent increase is modest at best," Mr. Krugman said. "It does not represent a strong increase."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Evidence Confirms Reports of Mass Rapes by Burmese 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
The United States has obtained corroborating evidence that mass rapes of hundreds of girls and women have been carried out by the Burmese army in central Shan Province, where the military government has tried for years to suppress an ethnic rebellion, the State Department said today.
 A department spokesman said the United States government had expressed "deep concern" about the rapes and other abuses to Myanmar, formerly Burma, and urged the government there to punish anyone guilty of "such heinous crimes." 
 Washington has also called for the United Nations to carry out a more extensive investigation of the rape charges, which were first made by human rights groups. 
The Burmese government has denied the allegations.
Washington has cooperated with other countries to impose economic and political sanctions against the military junta of Myanmar. The junta took power in 1988 and nullified the results of a parliamentary election in 1990 that was won overwhelmingly by the National League for Democracy, the political party led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
Earlier this year, several nongovernment organizations published reports alleging human rights violations by the military in its effort to crush ethnic uprisings.
Reports prepared by the Shan Human Rights Foundation and the Shan Women's Action Network said army troops had raped at least 625 girls and women as a "weapon of war" against civilians. Many victims of government repression have fled to Thailand for safety.
In November, James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said rape was not the only abuse against civilians. "We are deeply troubled by extrajudicial killings, forced relocations and forced labor that have intensified the refugee flow into Thailand this year and created a large population of internally displaced people," he said.
In general, Mr. Kelly said, the release earlier this year of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the principal Burmese opposition leader, from house arrest had not led to an easing of political repression, as many human rights groups hoped, although her political organization was allowed to open some offices around the country.
In August the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor conducted its own investigation of the rape charges, locating several women who gave dramatic, detailed accounts from northern Thailand, where they had fled. Some said they had been gang raped by soldiers, with some attacks dating back five years. A 13-year-old girl said she had been raped in June.
"All the victims under 15 appeared severely traumatized by their experiences, were disturbed mentally and spoke in whispers, if at all," according to a State Department report released on Dec. 17 and described today in The Washington Post. "The older women sobbed violently as they recalled horrific incidents of their own rapes as well as brutal rapes, torture and execution of family members."
The report said that although the testimony was "necessarily anecdotal," the stories were consistent with each other and therefore credible. 
The State Department's report said the United Nations envoy for human rights in Myanmar raised the possibility of a separate investigation when he visited the country.
The State Department said Washington was urging Myanmar to cooperate with outside investigators and to carry out its own inquiry.

HEADLINE: Venezuela and War Concerns Send Crude Prices Higher 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices pushed higher yesterday as Venezuelan oil workers pledged to continue a strike until they forced President Hugo Chavez from power. 
 The prospect of prolonged disruption to supplies from Venezuela and fears of war in Iraq early next year outweighed the impact of a modest rise in stored oil supplies in the United States last week. 
 New York crude oil futures rose to $32.60 a barrel, the highest since January 2001, before settling at $32.49, up 52 cents, or 1.63 percent. Oil prices hit $32.73, the highest since December 2000, in after-hours electronic trading. Oil markets in London were closed yesterday for Boxing Day. 
Oil prices have risen more than $12, or 60 percent this year, and more than $5 in December alone, strengthening fears that higher energy costs could stunt fragile economic growth. 
In addition to higher oil prices, the Energy Department said yesterday that the average price homeowners paid for heating oil jumped 4 cents a gallon over the last week. The national price for heating oil increased 3 percent in the last week, to $1.363 a gallon, the biggest weekly jump so far this heating season.
The department reported yesterday that heating oil inventories totaled 51.7 million barrels, down 600,000 barrels from the previous week and down 10.9 million barrels from a year ago.
Oil prices have soared as Venezuela's strike slices into the country's oil supplies, which account for about 14 percent of United States oil imports. 
Many managers and executives in the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, as well as field and refinery laborers, tanker captains, pilots and dock crews have joined the strike. 
"We will return to work when we achieve our objectives, specifically the departure of Hugo Chavez and a call for elections," said a resolution approved yesterday by employees. 
The loss of Venezuelan oil threatens to cut into American supplies as home heating demand picks up. On Wednesday, a snowstorm battered the Northeast, the world's biggest heating-oil market. 
Price gains have been underpinned by a military buildup by the United States and Britain in the Middle East. 
Traders are worried that the Venezuelan strike could coincide with a loss of Iraq's supplies if the United States attacks Iraq. 
That would remove exports of some 4.5 million barrels a day from the world market, 76 million barrels a day, and stretch to the limit the spare capacity of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

HEADLINE: Brazil Sends Gasoline to Venezuela at the Request of Chavez 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
In a show of support for Venezuela's embattled president, Hugo Chavez, the Brazilian government has sent an emergency shipment of 520,000 barrels of gasoline to help relieve shortages caused by a nationwide general strike now in its fourth week, government officials here said today.
 Venezuela is the world's fifth largest oil producer and a major exporter to the United States. But executives and an estimated 30,000 workers of the Venezuelan state oil company have adhered to the strike, causing oil production to plunge and leading to growing shortages at gasoline stations. 
 A spokeswoman for the Brazilian state oil company, Petrobras, confirmed that the shipment, made at Mr. Chavez's request, was on its way to Venezuela. She said it was expected to arrive on Friday or Saturday.
Commercial and political ties between the two countries have strengthened considerably since Mr. Chavez took office in February 1999, proclaiming his intent to lead a peaceful social revolution. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil approved the gasoline shipment, and there are indications that his successor-elect, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the left-wing Workers Party, was also involved in the decision.
Mr. da Silva takes office on Wednesday and has a longstanding personal and ideological affinity with Mr. Chavez, who is also reported to have asked Brazil to supply crews to operate Venezuelan oil tankers. 
"He thinks like I do," Mr. da Silva said earlier this year, adding that while the Venezuelan leader can be "excessively impetuous" at times, he is "a killer ball-handler" who deserves praise for his daring.
Mr. Chavez in turn has said "Lula is a great man" whose rise to power he has wished for "day and night." After Mr. da Silva won a landslide victory here in October, Mr. Chavez said he hoped Brazil would join Venezuela and Cuba in establishing an "axis of good" in the hemisphere.
Earlier this month, Mr. da Silva sent one of his chief foreign policy advisers, Marco Aurelio Garcia, to Caracas to assess the crisis. In interviews with Brazilian newspapers after his return, Mr. Garcia said the new Brazilian government wanted to "contribute to Venezuelan stability" and accused Mr. Chavez's opponents of seeking to provoke "a situation of uncontrollable violence" that would cripple the world economy.
"Imagine the No. 5 oil producer with a civil war and Iraq with a war that is not at all civil," Mr. Garcia said in the Rio daily O Globo on Tuesday. "That would bring disastrous consequences."
But the Brazilian action has been condemned by strike organizers, who range from labor and business groups to opposition parties, as unacceptable interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs. They maintain that Brazil is violating a neutrality policy that Latin American nations have developed and is illegally trying to break the strike.
"Brazil needs to understand that a political crisis exists in Venezuela and that it must be resolved by Venezuelans," Antonio Ledezma, a former mayor of Caracas, said in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper. One of the strike leaders, Timoteo Zambrano, said in a television interview, "This is a hostile attitude toward democratic society."
The move has also drawn some comment here, particularly in view of Mr. da Silva's origins as a labor union leader who was jailed for leading walkouts. "To see the Workers Party playing the role of strike-buster is like that MasterCard commercial, priceless," Ancelmo Gois wrote today in O Globo.

HEADLINE: Kenyan Is Poised Today to End Founding Party's Rule 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
The man who expects to become president of Kenya and end the political domination of the country by the party that has ruled it since independence concluded his campaign for Friday's elections today by returning to the village where he grew up in a mud hut helping his father herd the family's cows.
 It was a 100-mile journey and a world apart from the grand home that Mwai Kibaki, the 71-year-old leader of Kenya's united opposition, now occupies in the exclusive Muthaiga neighborhood of Nairobi, the capital. 
 Setting out today on something of a royal procession to his struggling native village of Othaya, near Mount Kenya, Mr. Kibaki exuded confidence about capturing the presidency now that Daniel arap Moi is stepping down after 24 years in power.
"We believe we shall win," said Mr. Kibaki, who failed to do so in 1992 and 1997. 
Mr. Kibaki then climbed into a Mercedes-Benz for his first serious campaigning since a car accident on Dec. 3 left him with a broken arm, sprained ankle and cracked vertebrae and forced him to undertake what electioneering he could manage from a wheelchair.
President Moi's decision to abide by the Kenyan Constitution and step aside in this election is seen across Africa as a hopeful sign that a continent too well known for its long-reigning, authoritarian rulers and for the corruption that often flourishes among their retinues can turn toward democracy.
Accordingly, Mr. Kibaki, who himself spent long years in Kenya's governing elite and once served Mr. Moi as vice president, has been emphasizing his decision to break with Mr. Moi a decade ago. He claims credit for helping to begin an opposition movement that is now expected to wrest power from the party, founded by Jomo Kenyatta, that has governed the country since Kenya's independence from Britain in 1963. 
Opinion polls and pundits give Mr. Kibaki a healthy lead over his main rival, Uhuru Kenyatta, the candidate of the Kenyan African National Union, which has governed first under Mr. Kenyatta's father and, since 1978, under Mr. Moi.
A poll released last month by the International Republican Institute, which receives financing from the United States government, gave Mr. Kibaki 68 percent of the vote compared to 21 percent for Mr. Kenyatta.
That lead is widely thought to have narrowed considerably since then, as backers of both campaigns have used money -- and some violence, though less than in Kenya's two previous campaigns -- to try to sway voters. 
What is most feared is that the governing party will attempt to rig the election if it finds its back to the wall. Mr. Kibaki has not joined in making such accusations, but one of his main supporters, the veteran opposition politician Raila Odinga, has threatened to storm Mr. Moi's presidential mansion if the opposition movement, the National Rainbow Coalition, is denied what appears to be a certain victory.
Foreign and Kenyan analysts ascribe Mr. Kibaki's chances of success this time in large part to the rare unity of Kenya's myriad opposition parties.
Both Mr. Kibaki, an economist by training, and Mr. Kenyatta have sold themselves as agents for change at this critical juncture for the 30 million Kenyans, about half of whom survive on less than a dollar a day.
Mr. Kenyatta, who is 42 and a relative political novice, calls himself "a fresh start." Mr. Kibaki's campaign commercials get right at the central issue of corruption and promise "a clean slate."
The candidates agree that Kenya's economy is on its knees, that corruption has reached from the highest offices in the land to police officers on the beat and that crime is so out of control that it has scared away many tourists.
Both men also belong to the Kikuyu, Kenya's main tribe. But unlike Mr. Kibaki, who is a Ugandan- and London-educated economist, Mr. Kenyatta is an American-educated businessman who has not spent his entire career in politics. He speaks of the importance of bringing Kenya into a high-tech world.
"It is my generation that controls the economies of the world and has embraced new advances in new technology," Mr. Kenyatta told supporters at a campaign rally on Christmas Day. He dismissed Mr. Kibaki, who helped found the Kenyan African National Union, known as KANU, before it led Kenya to independence, and other opposition leaders of being part of "a generation of yesterday."
But Mr. Kenyatta had an impediment in this campaign in the form of Mr. Moi. No matter how hard Mr. Kenyatta tried to proclaim himself his own man, voters could not forget that the departing president handpicked him as his candidate and spoke openly of being around to assist him once he was elected president.
As Mr. Kibaki's campaign picked up steam, Mr. Moi hit the countryside to support his protege, who in turn tried to keep a distance from his patron.
"I offer you a completely new approach," Mr. Kenyatta said during a last round of campaigning this week. He accused Mr. Kibaki and other opposition leaders of offering "continuity with Moi's and KANU's ways."
Mr. Kibaki, who now rails against the abuses of the governing party, wrote the party's constitution, demanding that the colonial governor release Jomo Kenyatta from detention.
Like most members of the Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's largest, Mr. Kibaki took the oath of the Mau Mau, the Kikuyu secret society that fought for independence, vowing to do everything he could to end the colonial rule of Kenya, said his stepbrother, Samuel Githinji Kibaki.
"We never thought he'd be vice president, let alone president," the stepbrother said.
Education proved to be Mr. Kibaki's ticket out of rural poverty. He did so well at Makerere University in Uganda that he won a scholarship to the London School of Economics. After earning an honors degree in London, Mr. Kibaki taught at Makerere for a year and then became one of the young intellectuals helping to set up an independent Kenya.
Mr. Kibaki rose in the elder Mr. Kenyatta's administration, becoming his finance minister. He stayed on when Mr. Moi took over, rising to vice president.
President Moi, who has been through scores of ministers and top aides in his time in office, eventually fired him as his No. 2, but Mr. Kibaki stayed on as health minister, speaking out about the dangers of AIDS in the late 1980's when the disease was beginning to ravage Africa.
In 1991, when Mr. Moi acceded to foreign pressure and opened up Kenya to opposition parties, Mr. Kibaki formed the Democratic Party of Kenya. Over the last decade, he has emerged as the opposition leader with the widest nationwide support.
"Kibaki was in the government when Kenya was still on its feet," said one of his supporters, John M. Maina, who heads a trade association. "We had jobs. The roads were smooth. Now everybody is suffering."
Some of the men now in Mr. Kibaki's coalition were condemning him just months ago as someone who was part of the ugly past of Kenya.
"The economic mess we have in the country today is because of his days of finance minister," Mr. Odinga, now one of Mr. Kibaki's strong backers, said of Mr. Kibaki in February, also labeling him "a coward and hypocrite" who should "stop dreaming about ever ruling Kenya."
Mr. Odinga, who left the ruling party to join the Rainbow Coalition and put his own presidential ambitions on hold, attributes those remarks to the emotions of the campaign trail, and now calls Mr. Kibaki the best man for the difficult job of trying to give a country once ranked among Africa's brightest hopes a fresh start.

HEADLINE: As Patents on Popular Drugs End, Costs for Generics Show a Surge 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Prices of generic drugs are rising almost twice as rapidly as prices of brand-name drugs, even as many insurers and the Bush administration are pressing Americans to switch in the name of saving money.
 The trend is expected to continue over the next few years as a number of enormously popular brand-name drugs lose their patent protection and drug makers introduce generic versions at high initial prices. 
 Prices of generic drugs are rising faster for several reasons. First, a large number of patents on popular brand-name drugs expired this year, allowing makers of generics to enter the market. Makers of generic drugs typically charge higher prices when the first generic versions of expensive medicines reach pharmacy shelves. 
In addition, the generic-drug industry is consolidating, leaving fewer companies to compete on the prices of older generic drugs. And wholesalers, drug plan managers and pharmacies have all found they can make higher profits on generic drugs than on brand-name medicines and still offer prices that are typically well below those of brand-name drugs.
The trend concerns those who saw in generic drugs a way to hold down medical costs for Americans without depriving them of necessary treatments. 
"Generic drugs provide a considerable economic benefit to consumers," said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a national consumers' organization. But he added, "The benefit often turns out to be considerably less than it could be."
The rapid price increases come on the heels of a proposal by President Bush to help generic drugs reach the market faster, a plan that is vehemently opposed by makers of brand-name drugs. The proposal would limit a brand-name drug maker to one automatic patent extension on any drug while it disputes the patent rights.
Generic drugs, chemical replicas of brand-name medicines, almost always cost less than the patented drugs they mimic, and until last year their prices were rising more slowly than prices of brand-name drugs. But last year, generic prices rose nearly twice as fast as prices on all brand-name drugs. And in the first 10 months of this year, the pattern has continued.
The average price of a generic prescription drug rose 15 percent, to $14.70 from $12.79, from the corresponding period last year, according to IMS Health, a pharmaceutical information company. Prices of all brand-name drugs, including those with no generic competition, rose 8.8 percent, on average, to $77.02 from $70.79, IMS said. The average prices represent total spending on generic drugs divided by the number of prescriptions written.
The price of one new generic drug, which replicates the ulcer drug Prilosec, one of the best-selling drugs ever, is so close to the price of the brand-name medicine that at least one large insurer is not even trying to switch patients to the generic.
At the same time, manufacturers have raised the prices of some older generic drugs as much as 1,000 percent recently, albeit from low starting points. 
Late last month, Watson Pharmaceuticals, a large manufacturer of generic drugs, raised the price of the tranquilizer meprobamate 725 percent. The drug is a generic version of Miltown, which lost patent protection more than 20 years ago. The cost rose to 99 cents each from 12 cents. 
Watson says its product is still a bargain. "Meprobamate still costs only 25 percent of the brand price" of Miltown, said Patty Eisenhauer, a Watson spokeswoman.
Geneva Pharmaceuticals has raised the price of promethazine, the generic version of the antihistamine Phenergan, more than 900 percent, to $309 for a thousand pills, or 31 cents a dose. Earlier this year, the price was $30 per thousand pills, or 3 cents a dose, according to John Rector, senior vice president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, a trade group for independent pharmacies. The new price is 55 percent of the wholesale price of Phenergan.
Sandra MacTavish, a spokeswoman for Geneva, which is owned by the Swiss drug maker Novartis, said it had raised prices on a number of drugs "to offset the losses we were incurring on these products."
Teva Pharmaceuticals, based in Israel, recently raised the United States wholesale price of cephalosporin, the equivalent of the antibiotic Keflex, to 24 cents a pill from 10 cents.
George S. Barrett, president of Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., said cephalosporin at 24 cents was still a bargain compared with $1.73 for Keflex.
Virtually all the companies along the distribution chain, from wholesalers to managed care drug distributors and pharmacies, are profiting handsomely before generic medicines reach patients. 
"Consumers get only a fraction of the benefit," said Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners, a drug investment consulting firm.
Spending on generic drugs is much smaller, in dollars, than spending on brand-name drugs. Consumers spent $19.4 billion on generic drugs from Jan. 1 to Nov. 1 this year, compared with $98.6 billion on brand-name drugs. But almost half of all prescriptions filled this year were for generics, and health policy experts say that share will grow to two-thirds over the next two years, even as generic prices rise rapidly. 
When a brand-name drug first loses its patent, a single generic manufacturer typically obtains exclusive rights to sell the equivalent medicine, usually for six months, and the price of both drugs stays relatively high. Selling a generic during those first months is like "printing money," said David Balto, a Washington health care lawyer who is a former Federal Trade Commission official.
A generic version of Prilosec, the popular ulcer drug made by AstraZeneca, reached stores late last week. Industry executives say that sales of that drug, called omeprazole, could reach $800 million to $1 billion next year. 
The initial price of a one-day dose of omeprazole is $2.88 to $2.95, a discount from the $3.86 price of a Prilosec pill but a much smaller difference than is typical for generics. At the current price, some insurers have been reluctant to encourage members to switch to omeprazole by charging the $5 to $10 co-payment typical for generic drugs. 
David Olson, a spokesman for Health Net, a big California-based health insurer, said that its members were typically charged $30 or $40 for a month's supply of Prilosec, and that for most Health Net members the same co-payment would apply to omeprazole for now.
Generic prices typically drop after a generic drug maker loses an exclusive franchise and many companies jump into the market. In February, after the antidepressant Prozac, made by Eli Lilly, was opened to competition, the price of the generic, fluoxetine, dropped to as low as 10 cents a pill for quantity buyers like Kaiser Permanente and to 25 cents at retail pharmacies, compared with $2.50 for Prozac.
Over time, however, as low prices put pressure on profits, some manufacturers typically drop out. Then a generic drug's price starts to rise. 
Like the brand-name drug companies, the generic manufacturers often raise prices as high as the market will bear. Watson, which makes 140 generic drugs, raises prices "based on market dynamics," Ms. Eisenhauer, the spokeswoman said. When prices drop sharply, "our options are either to exit the market or raise prices to make it worth our while." 
In fact, Wall Street analysts said large manufacturers of generic drugs make a profit before taxes of more than 20 cents on every dollar of sales when they obtain exclusive rights to a newly available drug. That surpasses the profits of many of the big brand-name companies.
Mylan Laboratories, one of the most profitable generic companies, recently said its pretax profit was more than 30 cents for every dollar of sales. The profit margins of generic companies often dip below 20 cents per dollar of sales, however, when they lose exclusive rights to make a generic medicine. 
Companies with weak profits are disappearing as the generic industry consolidates. The five largest makers of generic drugs -- Teva, Geneva, Watson, Mylan and Ivax -- now account for more than 50 percent of generic drug sales.
"The companies are bigger and there are fewer of them," said David F. Saks, who runs the Saks Medscience Fund at Ladenburg Thalmann. "They don't play the same kind of game they did 10 years ago when there were more small firms desperate to gain market share."
The companies that distribute generic drugs also find them more lucrative than brand-name drugs. Lawrence Marsh, a health care securities analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the three largest wholesalers often mark up generic drugs 10 percent to 15 percent, compared with a typical 5 percent markup on brand-name drugs. Maintaining an inventory of generics also ties up less of the wholesalers' working capital.
R. David Yost, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, one of the top three wholesalers, told analysts recently that his company was "making more gross profit dollars" from generic drugs than from brand-name drugs. Officials of McKesson and Cardinal Health, the other two top wholesalers, have made similar comments. 
The pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that manage drug benefits for large companies, are also "singing off their generic hymn books," Mr. Marsh said. 
Dr. Glen Stettin, a vice president at Medco Health Solutions, and Barrett Toan, chief executive of Express Scripts, said in separate interviews that their profit margins were higher for lower-priced generics than for brand-name drugs. And David D. Halbert, chief executive of AdvancePCS, the other big pharmacy benefit manager, told investors at a Merrill Lynch conference a few weeks ago that generic drugs were "the most significant contributor" to the latest increases in Advance's operating profits per prescription.
The pharmacy benefit managers can pocket sizable markups on orders for generic drugs at their mail service pharmacies, said B. Kemp Dolliver, an analyst at SG Cowen Securities. On expensive brands, insurance companies and employer groups demand that they pass along the manufacturers' discounts.
Pharmacists also say they rely on higher markups on generics because they are allowed so little profit on brand-name drugs under managed care. "The markup for pharmacies is better, and consumers get a more affordable product, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as bioequivalent to the brand-name drugs," said Mr. Rector of the pharmacists' association. 
Mr. Marsh, the Lehman Brothers analyst, said, "There are opportunities for lots of participants along the distribution channel to make a healthy margin off of generics" and still keep the price "well below branded drugs."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Dec. 27 about rising prices of generic drugs, and a related chart, misattributed calculations of increases for generic and brand-name drugs. While they were based on sales data from IMS Health, a health care information company, they were computed by The Times. The article also misstated the name for the generic equivalent of the antibiotic Keflex. It is cephalexin; cephalosporin is the broader class of antibiotic.

HEADLINE: Congress's First Duty 

 BODY:
With a new Congress drawing near, Democrats and Republicans are busily designing competing economic stimulus packages. The Republicans are sure to offer tax cuts, the Democrats -- among other things -- fiscal relief for the states. There is one measure, however, that would provide not only an immediate boost to the economy but immediate relief to those most in need: a carefully crafted extension of the federal unemployment insurance program. The Senate approved such an extension before it adjourned in November. The House, unconscionably, refused to go along. It was among the greatest failures of the 107th Congress. 
 One consequence is that jobless benefits for an estimated 780,000 Americans will abruptly stop tomorrow, even though most recipients have not yet exhausted their benefits. President Bush, who failed to show any leadership on this matter in November, has belatedly asked Congress to extend the program for these workers and to make the benefits retroactive to Dec. 28. 
 That's not enough. The way unemployment insurance typically works is that states provide laid-off workers with 26 weeks of benefits, followed by 13 weeks of federal aid. Under Mr. Bush's scheme, federal benefits would be extended only for those who were already receiving them on Dec. 28. The extension would not cover the jobless workers who will exhaust their regular state-funded benefits after Dec. 28 -- an estimated 95,000 every week -- but will receive no federal help unless the program is reauthorized. By the end of March, 1.2 million workers could fall into this category.
The Senate saw this problem coming, and under the bipartisan leadership of Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, passed a bill that would not only have covered people already enrolled in the federal program but provided 13 weeks of assistance for those losing their state benefits in the new year. The House, for largely trivial reasons, refused to go along.
Bill Frist, the new Senate majority leader, says he is looking for ways to put a kinder, gentler face on the Republican Party. Passing the Clinton-Nickles bill would be a good way to begin. The House should then follow suit. One of the House's complaints last year was that, at $5 billion, the bill was too expensive. That's ridiculous, considering the cost of the tax cuts that House Republicans have in mind.
The unemployment rate last month stood at 6 percent, the highest since mid-1994.The country could use a $5 billion shot in the arm right about now. So could a lot of increasingly desperate people.

HEADLINE: Good Polls and Lots of Cash, But Still No Rest for Schumer 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
He may be laboring in the long shadow of Hillary Rodham Clinton's national celebrity. He may be a first-term senator who suddenly finds himself and his party out of power here.
 Even so, Senator Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn finds himself in quite an encouraging political position. He is now the most popular elected Democrat in New York, according to polls and political strategists in both parties. 
 That has not satisfied Mr. Schumer, whose affinity for publicity is well known even in the nation's capital. There may be nearly 700 days left until New Yorkers have to pull a lever for him or his opponent, but already Mr. Schumer is running as if he were in trouble. People close to him say he is moving aggressively to prepare for any potential challenges, particularly from two titans of Republican politics, Rudolph W. Giuliani and George E. Pataki. 
In the last year alone, Mr. Schumer has visited every one of the state's 62 counties, as he did in his first three years in office. His advisers say he plans to do the same next year -- and the year after that. He has also stepped up his fund-raising pace, hoping to add $8 million to the $12 million he has raked in over the last four years.
Mr. Schumer has also continued a practice he established years ago when he was just another congressman from Brooklyn who wanted to make a name for himself: assembling New York's press corps just about every Sunday, often to talk about small-bore issues that might get him headlines on what is traditionally a slow news day: restoring telephone service on a block in Harlem; urging the National Football League to bring the Super Bowl to New York; exhorting New Yorkers to donate blood.
In a measure of how no issue is too small for him, he recently headed out to Long Island to address what some of his colleagues here might regard as a matter of dubious interest for a member of the United States Senate: goose droppings in a popular town park.
"Canadian geese have overrun our parks," Mr. Schumer declared as he spoke to local residents -- not to mention a pack of reporters his office invited -- before marching out into the park with a dog that is specially trained to herd geese.
"Chuck Schumer is the James Brown of politics -- no one works harder," said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York. "He's doing what he's done since he was a freshman in the New York Assembly -- smart use of media, aggressive constituent service and running as though the devil were at his back."
Mr. Schumer has not lost sight of the big picture, seeking to carve out a role in shaping foreign and national policy. He has been a leading voice on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accusing President Bush of trying to pack the courts with conservative ideologues. A longtime supporter of Israel, he has also questioned whether the Saudi government had links to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The 52-year-old senator, who walks around his office in his socks and whose wife finally persuaded him this year to replace his 1992 Ford Taurus with a newer one (it is a 2000 model), can shift from euphoria to brooding in an instant. He can also be playful and self-deprecating, or he can be as "Machiavellian as they come," as one associate put it. His brash Brooklyn swagger stands out in the decorous Senate.
Mr. Schumer's efforts to raise his profile are reaping big political benefits -- for the moment, anyway. Two thirds into his first term, he has become a more popular figure in his home state. He consistently edges out other elected New York Democrats in opinion polls, including Mrs. Clinton, Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, and H. Carl McCall, the former state comptroller. A Quinnipiac University poll in September reported Mr. Schumer's job-approval rating at a respectable 58 percent, down from his high of 69 percent soon after Sept. 11.
In a recent interview, Mr. Schumer said he would keep the same pace, whether he had a challenger or not. "God blessed me with a lot of energy, and I've found a job that uses every atom of it," he said, noting that New Yorkers would tolerate no less than hard work from a senator.
Industrious he may be, but Mr. Schumer is not without his critics. Some Democrats refer to him as a party of one, complaining that he frequently seeks to upstage his colleagues on hot issues. He and Mrs. Clinton, for example, have had frequent turf battles since she was sworn in two years ago, people close to them say.
"They've had a lot of angry exchanges," said one Democratic operative whose boss works closely with both senators. "He's called her office and said, 'Butt out. This is my turf.' "
A few months ago, the simmering tensions between the two erupted during the Democratic primary for New York governor between Mr. McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the housing secretary under President Bill Clinton who later dropped out of the primary. 
Mr. Schumer took the unusual step of wading into the vigorously contested race, endorsing Mr. McCall, the first black candidate with a viable shot at the governorship. The endorsement created a quandary for Mrs. Clinton, a newcomer to New York politics who was already under pressure from black leaders to back Mr. McCall. To make matters worse, Mrs. Clinton had asked Mr. Schumer to warn her before he went public with any endorsement so that she could be ready to respond, people close to both politicians say. One of her advisers said that Mr. Schumer did not do that. The Schumer camp says that he tried to phone her the night before the endorsement but could not reach her; instead, he left a message for her and informed a member of her staff of his plans. He eventually reached Mrs. Clinton the next day, people close to him say. 
Whatever the turn of events, Mrs. Clinton did not conceal her frustration at a New York Democratic fund-raising dinner on the night of his endorsement that both senators attended. People at the event said it was obvious she gave Mr. Schumer the cold shoulder, barely speaking to him.
Mr. Schumer's endorsement also upstaged his fellow New York Democrats, who had billed the dinner as an opportunity to celebrate party unity. "The whole party was upset," said one Democratic operative. 
Mr. Schumer's advisers said they were perplexed by that reaction. "We're baffled that anyone would have a problem with endorsing Carl McCall," one of them said.
If some New York Democrats are disappointed in him, the feeling is apparently mutual. Mr. Schumer has refused to employ his immense political clout to help bring order to the party, much to the chagrin of some Democrats who say the party is in disarray and in need of a strong leader.
Mr. Schumer has kept the party at arm's length, preferring to focus on his job rather than party politics. People close to him say that he also wants to avoid getting drawn into the factionalism and ethnic and racial tensions that have hurt the party in recent years.
In doing so, Mr. Schumer has become a sort of one-man show. "He's going to run as Chuck Schumer, not as a Democratic candidate," said Maurice Carroll, director of Quinnipiac University's polling institute. "He's a political soloist."
His supporters say that Mr. Schumer's independence should not be mistaken for neglect. "I don't pay much heed to those who say Schumer is not helping the party," said Philip J. Friedman, a longtime Democratic consultant in New York. "He is likely to lead the ticket with a huge plurality over his Republican opponent, and if that isn't helping those further down the line, I don't know what is."
Mr. Schumer's reluctance to get involved in party politics stands in stark contrast to the way his Republican predecessor, Alfonse M. D'Amato, did business. Mr. D'Amato, the author of "Power, Pasta and Politics," relished the role of power broker before Mr. Schumer defeated him in 1998. In fact, Mr. D'Amato engineered the Republican Party's comeback from political oblivion in 1994, bringing the state's Republican leadership together behind a little-known candidate for governor, George E. Pataki, who was then a state senator from Peekskill.
As the end of his first term draws closer, people say Mr. Schumer has managed to blend qualities of his two notable predecessors, Mr. D'Amato and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who was viewed as one of the Senate's genuine intellectuals.
Like Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Schumer routinely trumpets his success in bringing home federal aid -- including his role in securing $20 billion after the attack on the trade center -- and displays a penchant for making himself the center of attention.
But like Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer enjoys operating on an intellectual plane, envisioning governmental solutions to entrenched social problems. He has proposed an ambitious plan to lift upstate New York out of its persistent economic slump, and he is pushing Congress to rewrite patent laws to make prescription drugs more affordable.
In the end, Mr. Schumer says, he hopes to follow in the tradition of his political idol, former Senator Jacob K. Javits, a loner and Republican moderate who nevertheless achieved prominence on Capitol Hill and back home in New York. "Someone once said that if you put Javits in a centrifuge, you'd get Moynihan and D'Amato," Mr. Schumer said.

PERSON: Herb Ritts 

HEADLINE: Herb Ritts, Photographer Of Celebrities, Is Dead at 50 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Herb Ritts, the photographer whose glorifying images of the well known helped to further mythologize celebrity in the 1980's and 90's, died yesterday in a Los Angeles hospital. He was 50 and lived in Los Angeles.
 The cause was complications from pneumonia, his friend Stephen Huvane, a Hollywood publicist, said. 
 A photographer whose subjects ranged from Madonna and Cindy Crawford to the Dalai Lama and Kofi Annan, Mr. Ritts, like George Platt Lynes, relied on clean, graphic compositions that often portrayed models and celebrities in the visual language of classical Greek sculpture. 
"He shot exquisite, iconic photographs," said Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, a magazine to which Mr. Ritts contributed dozens of cover images.
Born in Los Angeles in 1952, Mr. Ritts grew up in a prosperous family that owned a furniture business. After graduating from Bard College in upstate New York with a degree in economics in 1975, he returned to Los Angeles to work for his family's company but was sidetracked when he started taking adult-education classes in photography. 
One day in the late 1970's, while waiting for a tire to be changed, he took pictures of a young actor friend he was driving around with. The actor was Richard Gere, and the pictures, ultimately published in various national magazines, served as the catalyst for Mr. Ritts's career as a portraitist.
Mr. Gere remained one of his closest friends. 
"His purpose was always to make you look good," Mr. Gere said yesterday. "He had an extremely elegant aesthetic. Some photographers are working so hard to be elegant that they pummel you with it, but to Herb it came effortlessly.
"Some photographers embalm their subjects, but he enlivened them." 
Unlike many other contemporary commercial photographers, Mr. Ritts imposed little of his own sense of artistry onto his pictures. 
"The pictures didn't go beyond what the subject would want," said Etheleen Staley, a partner at the Staley Wise gallery in New York, which sold Mr. Ritts's work.
"This is not to say that the pictures were always straightforward, because they often had a great deal of wit to them," Ms. Staley added.
One of Mr. Ritts's most memorable in this vein was a Vanity Fair cover that featured Ms. Crawford pretending to shave the face of the singer K. D. Lang, who was in drag.
Mr. Ritts's work extended beyond celebrity portraiture to fashion photography, artful nudes and the direction of television commercials and music videos. He captured the 1980's era of the supermodel with Amazonian images of Ms. Crawford, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell.
Mr. Ritts's fashion work was distinguished most of all for its worship of the body. The clothes, or the setting, seemed almost peripheral. For that reason he was a favorite of designers, like Gianni Versace, whose clothes paid homage to the human form.
Mr. Ritts had a passionate interest in magazines, especially the ones he worked for regularly, like Vogue, where he was a contributor for more than 15 years. 
"He would call a lot," Vogue's editor, Anna Wintour, said. "He would call when an issue came out and want to go over it even if he hadn't contributed to it, or he'd call to see how his covers sold."
Mr. Ritts had recently shot a series of portraits for Vogue, including ones of Mr. Annan, the United Nations secretary general, and Marion Jones, the track star, all of which will appear in the magazine's February issue.
Mr. Ritts is survived by his partner, Erik Hyman of Los Angeles; his mother, Shirley Ritts; a sister, Christy Thrasher; and a brother, Rory, all of Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Set a Record In November 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes rose a surprising 5.7 percent in November, a government report said today, as the lowest mortgage rates in more than three decades encouraged buyers.
 "We may see housing activity stay strong for quite a while," said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the big buyer of mortgages. "Our forecast is for a small dip in home sales next year, but I would emphasize the word small." 
 Single-family home sales jumped to a record 1.069 million annual rate in November, the Commerce Department said. It was the fourth consecutive month that the rate was above one million, which is also a record. The demand was led by homes priced below $150,000, partly because of a 41 percent surge in the Midwest and a slump in the more expensive Northeast. The median price dropped to $167,300, from $178,900 in October, the biggest decline since July, as sales of homes that cost more than $300,000 slipped.
With the average 30-year fixed mortgage at 5.93 percent, demand is likely to remain strong for houses and the furnishings and appliances needed to fill them. Consumers will buy an estimated 969,000 new homes this year, exceeding last year's record by 61,000, the National Association of Home Builders said. 
"This is really good news for the economy," said James F. Smith, director of the Kenan Institute's Center for Business Forecasting at the University of North Carolina, who is also the chief economist of the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors. "I don't know anybody who buys a house and doesn't buy lots of other things to go in the house."
November's annual rate was up from a revised pace of 1.011 million homes in October and beat the previous record of 1.053 million in September. Economists had expected the rate to fall to one million. New homes account for 15 percent of all sales, with previously owned homes accounting for the rest.
The inventory of new homes for sale declined to a 3.8-month supply in November from 4 months, the Commerce Department report said. The supply was the lowest since last December.
The number of new homes for sale fell to 337,000 last month, from 339,000 in October. The median number of months that new homes have been for sale declined to 3.9 in November from 4 months.
Next year, new home sales may total 938,000, which would be the second-best year on record, according to forecasts by the builders' group.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 5.94 percent in mid-November, at that time the lowest in three decades, according to Freddie Mac, which also buys mortgages. Even lower rates this week may help keep demand strong. The rate dropped to 5.93 percent for the week that ends today, the lowest since 1965, Freddie Mac said.

HEADLINE: Russia, Citing Changing Needs, Ends Its Tie With Peace Corps 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Russia said today that it would not continue the agreement under which American Peace Corps volunteers work in this country.
 In recent months, Russia has increasingly criticized American Peace Corps volunteers there, accused them of spying and refused to renew their visas. 
 The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aleksandr V. Yakovenko, made the announcement today, citing the changing economic and social tasks facing Russia. 
He expressed thanks for Peace Corps efforts in Russia and said talks were being held with the United States "in forms of partnership more in line with today's needs." 
The State Department confirmed that Russia was withdrawing from the Peace Corps agreement. More than 700 Peace Corps volunteers have served in Russia since 1992.
Earlier this year, Russia denied visa renewals to 30 volunteers, cutting their number in half. Most of them were teaching English in provincial schools. Ten volunteers were denied visa extensions last year.
Nikolai P. Patrushev, director of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B., said earlier this month that among those denied visas were "persons who were engaged in gathering information about the sociopolitical and economic situation in Russian regions, about employees of organs of power and administration and about elections." 
He singled out the director of the Peace Corps unit in the Russian Far East, who he said had violated a closed zone on the Russian-Chinese border. He also said a volunteer in Samara had been trying to establish close ties with local authorities and the directors of major defense enterprises in the region.
Vladimir P. Lukin, former Russian ambassador to the United States and now a deputy speaker of Parliament, criticized the Peace Corps in comments to the Interfax news agency, saying volunteers often have inadequate knowledge of the places where they work.
But he also criticized the Russian government for ending the program abruptly.
"If we are allies and partners, let us behave accordingly," he said.

HEADLINE: On Target and Off in 2002; 
. . . and In With the Underrated

BYLINE:  Emily Eakin and Felicia R. Lee compiled the responses. 

 BODY:
In its inaugural appearance in 1997, Arts & Ideas asked a handful of academics to offer their suggestions for the most overrated idea. One respondent then proposed holding a contest for the most underrated idea, a suggestion that was promptly followed -- as the editors considered the notion neither overrated nor underrated but just right.
 At that time, the nominations in both categories were rather cosmic in scope. 
 Eternal life and repression fell in the overrated column as, curiously enough, did modernism and postmodernism. 
Hope, pacifism and kindness were all listed as underrated. 
This time around, the editors narrowed the range somewhat and asked scholars and writers to propose the most overrated and the most underrated ideas of the past year. 
The answers ranged from a baseball stadium in Manhattan to "axis of evil." (Guess which of them is overrated and which underrated.) 
Emily Eakin and Felicia R. Lee compiled the responses.

Christianity
The most underrated force in global affairs is Christianity. It is by far the world's largest religion, and it will continue to hold this position into the foreseeable future; but few of us notice how the character of that faith is being transformed. Over the past century, Christian numbers have been booming in the global south, in Africa, Asia and Latin America. For example, since 1900, the number of African Christians has grown spectacularly from around 10 million to over 360 million. Just within my baby-boomer lifetime, "Western Christianity" has become ever less significant as the faith's center of gravity has shifted. 
And as Christianity has been, so to speak, going south, the religion has been adapting very rapidly to the cultures in which it operates. We see an upsurge of charismatic and supernatural-oriented forms of belief and practice. The emergence of southern Christianity constitutes a religious and cultural revolution quite comparable to the Reformation of the 16th century, though on a far vaster scale.
Philip Jenkins, professor of history and religious studies, Pennsylvania State University

Affluent Attitude
Somehow we crossed a rubicon this year when you began to hear teenage girls talking about getting spa treatments. Not too long ago, spas were for helmet-haired ladies who lunch, who went for getaway vacations to escape from all that charity ball stress. But now spas are for everybody, and a 16-year-old Abercrombie & Fitch girl who makes $7 an hour at the Cinnabon feels perfectly comfortable walking into a Japanese-minimalist spa and getting the full seaweed slather.
The market researchers at Yankelovich call this the Affluent Attitude. People with middle-class incomes now have the attitudes and expectations that were once reserved for the rich. If they buy a toaster, it had better be a Michael Graves designer toaster; if they go to the mall looking for a sweater, it had better be a Hilfiger or a Calvin Klein. And the sales staff had better be properly obsequious.
This isn't a triumph of higher incomes; it's a triumph of self-esteem. My favorite polling result of the 2000 election was a Time magazine survey that revealed that 19 percent of Americans believe that they have incomes in the top 1 percent, and a further 20 percent believe they will someday. A large majority of us regard ourselves as pretty far above average.
This may be why American consumers kept spending this year at an incredible pace, even as the economy slipped into the doldrums. In the flattering mirror of our imaginations, we see ourselves as high status, affluent people. So of course we are going to keep purchasing the finer things in life. And the beauty of it is that many of us will never have to face reality. We are born in the land of self-esteem, we travel the highways of exaggerated self-importance and we die in an atmosphere of smug self-satisfaction, happy with our lives and our things, leaving our descendants fond memories and large credit card bills. 
David Brooks, a senior editor of The Weekly Standard, and the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There"

Propaganda
It is difficult not to notice that Americans are on the receiving end of anger and resentment from around the world, not all of which is rational. We should use rational argument when we can, but we ignore at our peril that we are also a lightning rod for dark currents of hatred that flow through the psyche. The idea of propaganda is in bad repute because it is associated with crude cold-war caricatures. And clearly, advertising will be a disastrous approach to a Muslim fundamentalist culture that focuses its hatred on a culture of advertising. Like a psychoanalyst's handling of negative transference, we need to develop at the cultural level sophisticated ways of handling irrational hatred.
Jonathan Lear, Committee on Social Thought, University of Chicago

Moral Vocabulary
Evil is a dangerous word, if you fling it about irresponsibly. But it is an important word to keep in our moral vocabulary, because it sharpens our moral reactions and stiffens our moral resolve. The idea of ruthless malice, the love of death and destruction for its sake, constitutes a real category of human agency, and this is what the word evil is designed to connote. 
It is a strong word for an extreme phenomenon. The English language can sometimes seem weak in its resources for the description of extreme wrongdoing, so we find ourselves reaching for alien words: pogrom, holocaust, ethnic cleansing, fascist, sadist, gulag, intifada. The word tragedy is often made to per form duties beyond its scope, with its suggestion of inevitability. (Atrocity is better, implying that someone committed an evil act.) The word terrorism is actually far too weak for what it denotes: not merely creating terror, but doing so by the calculated murder and maiming of innocents because they are innocents. So let's keep the old-fashioned word evil, and let's use it with all the seriousness and caution it requires.
Colin McGinn, professor of philosophy, Rutgers University

Amoral Pragmatism
People often esteem moralizers and denounce amoral pragmatists, as if people had a pipeline to moral truth and only had to decide whether to use it. Psychologists have recently shown that our moral intuitions are subject to illusions, like other evolutionary adaptations such as color vision. For example, people ascribe virtue to charismatic and attractive individuals, and condemn practices that viscerally disgust them, like homosexuality or miscegenation. And since moralizing resists persuasion, is rewarded by community esteem and justifies the punishment of sinners, it can lead to as much harm as good.
Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of "The Blank Slate"

Organic Machines
The line separating organisms from machines is being erased. While machines have long been attached to and implanted in human bodies, increasingly sophisticated electronic, telematic and digital technologies have made more radical changes possible. By integrating biological material and digital programs, scientists are creating new forms of life that can reproduce, learn and evolve. These hybrid organisms will live within other biological systems and develop into independent organic machines. This development marks a new stage in evolution whose possibilities we cannot yet imagine.
Mark C. Taylor, professor of religion and philosophy at Williams College

Manhattan Stadium
The most underrated idea is a baseball park in Manhattan.
Nora Ephron, author of "Imaginary Friends" on Broadway

Intervention
First attempted in Kosovo (by NATO) and East Timor (by the United Nations), it's the idea that certain gross and systemic violations of human rights require international action overriding national sovereignty. 
On the right, humanitarian intervention is dismissed as squishy, one-world, liberal naivete. The left regards it as a misnomer for a neoimperialism that obliterates indigenous cultural practices and imposes the will of the world's great powers.
But when governments are engaged in nearly genocidal mass murder, as at Srebrenica in 1995, advocates like Michael Ignatieff argue that international intervention is the world's only means of stopping the slaughter. 
In Kosovo some of the most scrupulous supporters of humanitarian intervention were writers like Ian Williams, Richard Falk and Bogdan Denitch. 
But apart from a handful of such thinkers, the idea is misunderstood, misappropriated and most certainly underrated.
Michael Berube, professor of literature, Pennsylvania State University

Generation Gap
There is currently a massive generation gap among African-Americans that Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and other old guard civil rights leaders, posing as film critics, failed to grasp when they criticized the film "Barbershop" for some remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.
Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California and author of "The New H.N.I.C.: The Death of Civil Rights and the Reign of Hip-Hop"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Blue Chips at Two-Month Low on International Concerns

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, sending the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average to a two-month low, as North Korea's decision to expel United Nations nuclear inspectors spurred concerns about a possible United States conflict on two fronts.
 North Korea said it was expelling the inspectors monitoring a reactor that could turn out plutonium for atomic bombs, prompting new United States demands for the communist state to scrap its renewed pursuit of a nuclear arsenal. 
 "We have enough to deal with, with terrorism and Iraq; North Korea brings us one step further from global stability," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Company. "It's one reason why people don't want to venture into stocks." 
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 128.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to 8,303.78, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sagged 14.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to 875.40. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 19.58 points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,348.31. 
Stocks fell across the board, with only one -- AT&T -- rising among the 30 shares in the Dow Jones industrial average. The market gauge closed lower for the fourth consecutive session. Yesterday marked the third losing session in a row for the Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 index. 
For the week, the Dow fell 2.4 percent and the S.& P. dropped 1.35 percent. The Nasdaq ended the week off 0.34 percent. 
So far this month, the Dow is down 6 percent, its worst performance in December since 1931, according to MarketHistory.com. 
The news from North Korea, which spurred fears of arms proliferation and the possibility of a showdown with the United States, came on top of nagging worries about a potential United States military action against Iraq. 
"The macro situation with Iraq and North Korea is just overwhelming any rational thought. It's hard to make predictions when you have these gigantic fears out there," Mr. Boockvar said. 
Short-dated Treasury yields touched record lows as rising global tensions drove investors to the safety of government debt. The yield on the two-year note fell to 1.6 percent. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 5/32, to 100 9/32.
The 10-year Treasury note climbed 24/32, to a price of 101 18/32. The note's yield declined to 3.81 percent from 3.90 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond soared 19/32, to 109 6/32. The bond's yield fell to 4.78 percent from 4.86 percent on Thursday.
Another issue weighing on markets was the rising cost of oil, raising fears that high fuel costs could crimp the nation's economic recovery. 
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose yesterday, with a late surge pushing prices to new two-year highs. February crude settled 23 cents higher at $32.72 a barrel, trading in a range from $32.05 to $32.76.
Lingering worries about the retailing sector hurt Amazon.com for a second consecutive day. Investors were worried that the holiday shopping season could rank as the weakest in 30 years for major retailers. Amazon's shares sank $1.44, or 7.1 percent, to $18.86. 
AT&T shares rose 13 cents, to $27.75. The company plans to raise some long-distance rates next year and to increase monthly fees. 
One bright spot was Lockheed Martin, which won a $3.5 billion deal to sell jets to Poland. Shares of Lockheed rose 80 cents, to $57.70.

HEADLINE: Making Us Pay, Equally 

BYLINE:  By Robert M. Morgenthau; Robert M. Morgenthau is the Manhattan district attorney.

 BODY:
It's time to get serious about enforcing the tax laws.
 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said in 1927, "Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society." Seventy-five years later, there is more reason than ever to take Justice Holmes's observation about civic responsibility to heart. More than half the states and most major cities, including New York, face declining revenues and substantial budget deficits and are struggling to provide essential services, including increased security against terrorist threats. In this environment, all of us need to bear our fair share of the costs. 
 Regrettably, an increasing number of Americans do not see it this way. According to the results of a poll published this year, one in four Americans believes it is O.K. to cheat on your taxes, nearly double the number who condoned cheating in a similar poll in 1999. These polls reflect the public's eroding confidence in the fairness of United States tax systems. In a democracy, where compliance with tax laws is largely voluntary, this is an alarming trend.
It should be particularly disturbing to New Yorkers. To help close a projected $6 billion budget gap next year, the city has raised property taxes 18 percent; earlier this year the city tax on cigarettes was raised to $1.50 per pack. And there is a real prospect of additional taxes.
These tax increases will increase revenues in the short run; they will also increase the incentives to avoid and evade. According to tax officials, the city lost $30 million a year due to evasion of tax stamp laws and unreported cigarette sales before the tax increase. Other city and state taxes will be ducked in other ways. And because taxes can be raised only on those who pay them, the financial burden will be borne by honest taxpayers while others cheat or leave town.
That's why we need to do a better job with tax enforcement. Government at every level must start now to take steps to ensure that tax enforcement agencies are beefed up to fight evasion and fraud, which have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. There is a perception that it is mainly drug dealers, terrorists and mobsters who take advantage of offshore tax havens. That is wrong. Recently my office convicted a prominent Canadian lawyer and a British solicitor, who was also a magistrate, of running a scheme to provide offshore shell corporations for the use of a wide range of clients in New York, Canada and Russia. The annual losses from evasion in the tax havens is estimated to be about $70 billion.
Meanwhile, throughout New York City, hundreds of restaurants, shops and street peddlers offer food, jewelry, electronic equipment and other merchandise at bargain prices and do a nearly all-cash business. The owners of these businesses report little income and pay minimal or no taxes. According to the Internal Revenue Service, $160 billion is lost each year to the underground economy.
Tough and effective tax enforcement requires a substantial investment of time and resources, but it more than pays for itself. After the indictment of Tyco's former chief executive for sales tax fraud on art purchases in June, my office began receiving numerous calls from lawyers representing other wealthy art buyers who had failed to pay sales and use taxes. Thus far, more than $1 million in back taxes on art purchases has been returned to the city and state in this ongoing investigation. In fact, the state's total returns from back sales taxes in the third quarter of this year (July through September) were $21 million, versus only $7 million for the same period last year.
Public officials -- both those who oppose new taxes and those who believe new taxes are necessary in hard budgetary times -- should favor a fair deal for all taxpayers. To make that a reality, tax departments, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies must step up their efforts against significant cases of fraud and evasion; these offices must, in turn, be afforded adequate resources to do the job. 
If we are vigilant and resourceful, we can make the same gains against tax fraud that we have made against homicides and other street crime in the past decade. We might even help keep tax rates from rising out of sight.

HEADLINE: A Mildly Merry Christmas 

 BODY:
The holiday season is the make-or-break moment for the retail segment of the American economy. This particular season has brought little cheer. In keeping with the generally anemic recovery of the economy as a whole, holiday sales figures have so far registered the smallest year-to-year increase in three decades. 
 We say "so far" because one of the most notable trends in retail has been the gradual erosion of the once-firm boundary between the shopping season leading up to Christmas and the period of post-holiday sales. As they did last year to encourage shoppers in a slowing economy, stores again began discounting merchandise well before Christmas. More pre-Christmas discounting may help account for the anemic numbers. 
 Conversely, there may be more actual gift buying after Christmas. That's because the hottest items in many stores were those credit-card-like gift cards, and plenty of retailers are hoping to see stronger than usual sales this week and next, as the recipients of those cards show up and possibly spend more than what's on their plastic.
Other retailers, Wal-Mart among them, are not waiting to lower their previous estimates for the season. Wal-Mart, the country's largest retailer, now expects its per-store sales in December to rise only 2 to 3 percent. In addition to consumers' considerable jitters, more fanciful explanations for what is shaping up to be a sluggish Christmas at the cash register range from a late Thanksgiving to a lack of must-buy novelties.
Holiday shopping is a proxy for consumer sentiment, which is why some restraint might have been expected even if Thanksgiving had come in July. Consumer spending has single-handedly held up the economy since business investment cratered in 2000. But Americans cannot be expected to continue increasing their discretionary spending beyond reasonable levels. Personal debt is too high for that, and stock market losses too great. 
Still, the reported figures are no reason to despair. Sales did increase, however modestly. The housing market, as reflected in yesterday's strong new home sales report for November, remains resilient, and more and more homeowners are taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages. Combine that with decent personal income figures, and there is reason to believe that consumer spending can hold up, if not expand as robustly as it has in recent years, while waiting for business investment to recover.
The main obstacle to this rosy scenario, of course, is that external shocks -- the "heightened geopolitical risks" cited by the Federal Reserve when it last cut interest rates, in November -- could prevent the economic cycle from running its course. As if concern about a possible war with Iraq weren't enough, Americans must now ponder the implications of a rogue North Korea trying to develop its own stockpile of nuclear weapons. The uncertain global outlook and tensions in Venezuela have contributed to a rise in oil prices. 
The danger is that businesses and consumers might drastically alter their behavior in anticipation of a war. That could mean a deferral in renewed capital investments and hirings on the part of businesses and, conceivably, a substantial cutback in consumer spending. Fortunately, that has not yet happened, and in the coming debate in Washington over ways to stimulate the economy, policy makers should be careful not to exaggerate the sluggishness of holiday sales in order to advance their favored tax cuts.

Strugglingin Debt, Sacrificing Pride

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan 

 BODY:
At the cramped offices of the Icho-no-kai credit counseling center here, about a dozen struggling workers, housewives and other hard-luck cases are engaged in what has become an increasingly common ritual: they are declaring bankruptcy.
 Once almost inconceivable in a nation that places such a high value on savings, personal bankruptcies have risen to record numbers among the Japanese in response to a punishing economic squeeze caused by five consecutive years of falling wages and rising unemployment. 
 As their financial woes have worsened, many have turned first to legal lenders but then often to loan sharks who charge rapidly compounding interest rates. To try to escape this trap, about 220,000 people are expected to seek protection from creditors this year, up more than a third from 2001.
"Out of pride, most Japanese don't want to declare bankruptcy," said Dean Perry, who follows the consumer finance industry for ING Baring Securities. "But stigma or no stigma, they will do what they need to do to get by." 
Declaring bankruptcy in Japan is still relatively uncommon, and Americans are four times as likely as Japanese to seek bankruptcy protection. But as long as the stagnation of the Japanese economy continues, personal bankruptcies seem as if they will continue growing sharply. According to some estimates, as many as two million Japanese are effectively bankrupt, but have not or cannot file the paperwork required.
Even that does not convey the full extent of the financial stress in Japan. For despite encouragement from a government that is committed to making it cheaper and easier to file for bankruptcy, every year thousands of people in distress commit suicide, police statistics show, rather than face their debt collectors, friends and families in shame.
For those who do file, bankruptcy can restore some financial breathing room. But for those still in debt to illegal loan sharks, it does not always end the harassment. And few escape personal trauma of some sort.
That is what happened to Kazuhiko Tashiro and Shinichi Doi, two owners of small businesses who live in the Osaka region. Osaka, a city of more than two million, is the center of Japan's battered industrial heartland, which is filled with factories and businesses like theirs suffering from the general downturn and the shift in production to China and other low-wage countries. At 7.2 percent, unemployment in the city is nearly twice that in the Tokyo region.
Both men declared bankruptcy this year after more than a decade of accumulating debts and struggling to keep up with snowballing payments. Like many debtors, they used their personal savings to keep their companies going before turning to loan sharks in hope of staving off the collapse of their businesses.
"People get desperate," said Yoshiaki Tanaka, the secretary general of Icho-no-kai, which has experienced a sixfold increase in visitors in the last two years. "A drowning man will grasp at straws."
The two men's fall from grace parallels the growth in one of Japan's most profitable industries, the business of lending money to those with little or no collateral. While Americans have lived with easy credit for decades, most Japanese pay off their credit card bills each month. Increasingly, though, the lure of quick cash has turned the nation's loan companies into financial lifelines, particularly for those who do not understand the risks involved.
In this weak economy, low-wage workers and marginal business owners are being forced to dip deeply into their savings to pay their bills. The closing of a factory or a round of induced early retirements can push families to the brink. Finding new work at similar pay is difficult because most workers devote their entire career to one job, leaving them unprepared to find another. To make the payroll at a family business, many Japanese seek short-term, high-interest loans to tide them over and avoid the embarrassment of having to ask friends or relatives for money.
In his 27 years as a credit counselor, Mr. Tanaka has repeatedly seen the dark side of this trend. Consumer finance companies lend money at rates up to 29.2 percent -- a ceiling set by the government -- and borrowing 500,000 yen ($4,151) is as easy as going to an automated teller machine.
Most borrowers repay their loans, but for those who cannot, the consequences can be frightful. Interest accumulates so quickly that debtors take out new loans to keep up with the previous payments due. When legitimate loan companies cut debtors off, loan sharks called yamikin can dole out fresh loans at rates of up to 10 percent a day.
The police try to enforce the anti-usury laws. In the first half of 2002, 118 loan sharks who lent to more than 42,000 people were arrested. Estimates of the illegal loan market vary, but analysts say it easily exceeds 3 percent of the legal market in consumer loans, or about $3 billion.
Despite the outrageous rates, there is no shortage of takers for these loans -- a sign of how thin the line is between making ends meet and spiraling downward. It also illustrates the fuzzy border between the regulated loan companies, which cater to salaried workers, and the web of marginal operators who often have links to organized crime gangs. These illegal operators often employ brutal harassment techniques that make ordinary lives impossible.
Mr. Doi, 52, thought he knew all these risks. His troubles began just as the stock market and the real estate bubble of the late 1980's were about to burst. Mr. Doi's small trucking company started to sour, so he borrowed about $12,000 from his bank to keep up with his auto loans.
Most Japanese, Mr. Doi included, thought that the economy would rebound, as it had done throughout the postwar period. But income from his business fluctuated, so the bank cut him off. He took out consumer loans to tide him over.
Mr. Doi was an ideal client for the loan companies: someone who needed cash but always came up with just enough to stave off default. He usually borrowed just under $400 at a time, but other times he took out larger loans with lower rates. "If you meet your interest payments," he said, "the companies will lend you even more money. I knew it was dangerous, but I couldn't help but borrow more."
The fastest-growing segment of the $100 billion consumer finance industry is built around loans of more than a million yen, or about $8,300. To lure new customers, companies like Promise and Acom encourage Japanese with long repayment histories to consolidate their loans. Pushing people to borrow more in a recession comes with risks, though. Defaults are rising along with the jobless rate.
Mr. Doi met his obligations because his wife took a job at a food-processing plant for about $800 a month. Last year, though, the debts had grown so large that Mr. Doi found his way to Icho-no-kai. His move was probably encouraged by a regulatory change late in 2000 that allowed bankruptcy lawyers to advertise.
Mr. Doi's wife was appalled and threatened to divorce him. They stayed together for the sake of their two children. He went through with the bankruptcy proceedings, though he needed another loan to cover the $2,900 in legal fees. On Sept. 23, a month after he filed the paperwork, Mr. Doi was formally freed from more than $65,000 in obligations.
In a trench coat, wool scarf and shined loafers and with a new job at a building maintenance company, he no longer looks like a harried scavenger on the underbelly of the economy. Though his wife is still working, he is trying to repair their relationship. "I've caused her so much trouble," he said. "In the future, I'm going to attach more importance to our lives."
Unlike Mr. Doi, Mr. Tashiro, 48, still fits the sad-sack image of a besieged debtor. His eyes puffy and his hair unkempt, he looks worn out from a decade-long ordeal with creditors and the strong-arm men they employed to chase down their money. In 1989, he and a friend started a company to dispatch security guards. It did well for a few years. But they discovered that a worker had embezzled the equivalent of $12,000. They settled the issue informally and the man returned to work. When he stole again, they fired him.
To keep the company afloat, Mr. Tashiro borrowed $2,400. Unfortunately, a former assistant turned out to be a gangster and returned to extort money. Mr. Tashiro and his friend shut down the company, hoping that he would go away. Instead, the man visited Mr. Tashiro's home and threatened him. At wits' end, he borrowed about $4,000 against his life insurance policy and paid off the gangster. He then went to the police, who pursued a criminal case.
Mr. Tashiro's problems did not go away, though. Feeling obligated as a boss, he used his entire nest egg of $16,000 to pay his employees "sorry money" when he shut the company. As a company owner, he had no jobless benefits, so he worked as a security guard for $1,000 a month. His wife worked, too, but Mr. Tashiro said nothing about his loans or his brush with gangsters.
There was never enough money, and in 1996 Mr. Tashiro again went to the regulated loan companies. "This was the beginning of the real troubles," he said in a heavy Osaka dialect. One loan led to another and soon he owed about $36,000 to 16 companies. Desperate, he turned to the loan sharks, hoping to get enough money to pay off his original creditors.
He also considered killing himself. Some Japanese believe that suicide is an honorable way to repent for failing to meet obligations. Suicides have risen 47 percent in the last decade, though obviously not all are related to financial woes. Deaths directly attributed to the adverse economy have risen to more than 6,800 a year in that time from about 1,600, according to the National Police Agency, accounting for about half of the overall increase in suicides. The vast majority of these cases involve men 40 and older.
Mr. Tashiro held out long enough to find a debtors' group in nearby Amagasaki called Brighter Tomorrow, where he learned how to file for bankruptcy himself, a significant savings. Last month, a weight was lifted when the courts cleared his debts. He now wants to remarry his wife, whom he divorced so she would not be named in the bankruptcy proceedings. He also counsels other debtors.
A government panel is now deliberating over more ways to make it easier to declare bankruptcy, including speeding up the court process, easing some of the criteria and allowing people to refile for bankruptcy in less time. The government hopes that by helping ordinary workers to start over with fewer debts, they can spend more and help lift the economy.
Critics argue that this will create a moral hazard, with people borrowing excessively because they know they can escape their debts more easily. But this ignores an essential point: most Japanese still feel a sense of obligation to repay their debts. Few would abuse the system, most experts say.

HEADLINE: 103 Janitors For the Police Are Laid Off In First Cuts 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN 

 BODY:
The Police Department laid off 103 janitorial workers yesterday, the first employees to lose their jobs in a department that must trim its spending by nearly 6 percent next year as the city faces a fiscal crisis unlike any since the 1970's. 
 The workers received letters signed by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly yesterday informing them that their jobs were being eliminated. 
 "Regretfully, I must inform you that your services cannot be retained after close of business January 10, 2003," stated one such letter, addressed to Ruth Acosta, a janitorial worker for the department. 
The layoffs are just the beginning of what promises to be a grim belt-tightening period in the Police Department. Facing a $6.4 billion deficit, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ordered the department's $3 billion budget cut by 5.7 percent, and asked Mr. Kelly to trim about 1,900 officers from the force. Civilian layoffs were inevitable, and the janitorial workers dismissed yesterday were the first to go. 
"Every city agency, based on the budget plans for the year, is making reductions," said Detective Walter Burnes, a department spokesman. "This layoff is part of our reduction process."
The workers are custodial assistants who clean police facilities across the city, he said. 
The workers who were laid off face a tough job market, especially for those with limited skills. One custodian, Tasha Spruill, 30, left her previous job to join the Police Department's civilian staff, hoping it would provide more security. She was hired as a per diem employee, paid an hourly wage of $11.04 plus benefits rather than a salary, and is not afforded the same job protections as other employees, she said. 
"I have no idea what I will do now," she said. "My next and best move is to move out of state. There are no jobs out here. None."
Rudy Orozco, a spokesman for District Council 37, the union that represents many city workers, said that jobs had been found at other agencies for 27 of the employees. He also said that the rest, most of them per diem workers like Ms. Spruill, would be placed on a waiting list for future openings. 
Detective Burnes said those laid off yesterday were given information on applying for unemployment benefits, extending their health insurance and finding new jobs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Feeling Bite Of Costlier Oil 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
With crude oil prices at their highest levels in two years and showing no sign of abating soon, consumers and businesses are starting to feel the pinch as the prices of gasoline, heating oil, and diesel and jet fuel begin to rise.
 Industry analysts and economists warn that because of high oil prices, Americans in the coming weeks and perhaps months are likely to be paying more for nearly everything, from fuel to roofing materials to plastics. And the longer prices remain high, the greater the threat they pose to the still-tepid economic recovery, analysts and economists say. 
 "This would add another weight to the recovery, but not derail it," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "But it is bad in the sense that we will be struggling to maintain growth." 
The price of crude oil has risen by almost $7, or 27 percent, since early November. In New York, crude oil for February delivery rose 23 cents yesterday, to $32.72 a barrel, the highest since November 2000. 
Analysts point out that there is a lag of several weeks between an increase in crude oil prices and a commensurate rise in the prices of petroleum products. Just this week, however, the average retail prices of diesel fuel and gasoline rose by 4 cents, or about 3 percent, according to data collected by the Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department.
"When crude goes up, it's just a matter of time before it hits you at the pump," said Mary Rose Brown, a spokeswoman for Valero Energy, a large independent refining company based in San Antonio. "Our retail guys are saying that an increase of 5 to 10 cents is a reasonable expectation."
That might prove a conservative estimate, some traders and analysts said. The forces that are pushing up prices seem, to oil traders, to be worsening. A general strike in Venezuela against the government of President Hugo Chavez has halted nearly all oil production and reduced exports to a trickle. 
Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States, accounting for 14 percent of crude oil imports. Although government officials in Venezuela have vowed to restore production soon, oil traders on the global markets are skeptical, said Rick Smid, an energy futures broker at Fimat, a subsidiary of Societe Generale. 
The Venezuelan shortfalls have buffeted the market as worries rise again about a possible war between the United States and Iraq and its effect on oil supplies from the Persian Gulf. 
For high oil prices to have a great effect on the economy, they have to be sustained for more than a month at $30 a barrel or more, said David Costello, an energy analyst at the Energy Information Administration. That prospect seems increasingly likely, especially as both sides in the Venezuelan dispute retrench.
It takes a month or two for higher crude oil prices to work their way through the refining and retail systems and to be felt by consumers, Mr. Costello said. That explains why price increases on the retail level are only being seen now, he and other analysts said. Conversely, if the Venezuelan conflict were resolved now, it would still take several weeks for retail prices to fall, they noted.
Industries heavily reliant on oil are already feeling the bite, Mr. Zandi and others said. The makers of textiles, paper, chemicals and plastics will be stuck with higher oil bills. "It will affect airlines and trucking significantly," Mr. Zandi said. "The airlines are already hard pressed, and this is one more thing to push them under water."
In the last month, the price of jet fuel at New York Harbor has risen nearly 15 percent, to 87.23 cents a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The region that relies most heavily on heating oil, the Northeast, may also face sharply higher prices, Mr. Zandi and others said. Heating oil prices are 18 percent higher than they were a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.
"New York City will be hit very hard," Mr. Zandi predicted, "much more than a place like Dallas or Southern California."
The effects of higher oil prices may ripple through industries that, at first glance, seem remote from oil. Consider roofing. The best asphalt for roofing comes from "heavy" crude oil produced in Venezuela. With those supplies gone, "people are scrambling already to find supplies," Ms. Brown of Valero said. "The cost of roofing will go up."
If the conflict in Venezuela were resolved and striking workers from the state oil company returned to their jobs, that would certainly bring more crude oil into the market and gradually deflate high prices. But few people believe such an outcome is likely anytime soon.
Instead, industry experts look to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a member. Other members said at a meeting earlier this month that the group would make up for shortfalls of Venezuelan exports if the strike continued. 
OPEC members like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are among the few countries that have the spare production capacity to replace the Venezuelan oil. But it remains uncertain what steps OPEC has taken so far. Moreover, it takes about 40 days for oil to be shipped from the Persian Gulf to the United States, which may mean that oil supplies in the Western Hemisphere may only be replenished later in January.
"The key thing now is how quickly and on what scale the other OPEC producers step up their production," said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, "and that will determine in a week or 10 days where oil prices will be.
"You could have replacement supplies in late January from the Persian Gulf. But all of that assumes that nothing happens anywhere else."

HEADLINE: New York, Citing Security, Rejects Mexican ID Cards 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
Dozens of local and state governments now recognize an embossed Mexican consular document as a valid form of identification for Mexicans who are here legally or illegally. 
 But New York City and New York State, with one of the fastest-growing Mexican populations in the nation, are not about to join them. 
 Citing security concerns, Police Department officials said they had rejected requests from the consulate to accept the new "matricula consular," or consular ID card, as proof of identity for Mexican immigrants. 
The State Department of Motor Vehicles also has refused to recognize the consular card, issued since March by Mexico's 43 consulates in the United States, to its list of approved identity documents for obtaining a driver's license. 
Their reluctance -- and similar resistance in New Jersey, Connecticut and other Northeastern states -- stands out against a trend elsewhere in the country. Thirteen states now accept the Mexican consular ID for purposes of applying for a driver's license, and hundreds of police departments recognize it as proof of identity. 
"I'm surprised that a state and city that are otherwise immigrant-friendly, or at least supposed to be, would not accept it," said Juan A. Figueroa, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a Hispanic advocacy group. "These are by and large the people who make up the economic infrastructure of the city."
Many of the nation's illegal immigrants do not have any valid form of identification, like a driver's license. If they have a passport, they often fear showing it to the authorities. Even foreigners living here legally rarely carry their passports with them, fearing they could be lost or stolen.
The lack of an identity card is not fatal in New York City; a library card can be obtained with a valid utility bill, and children can be enrolled in public school without their parents showing a photo ID. But it can have dire consequences in some cases.
In New York City, as in many cities, the police will not release a person who is arrested on minor charges, and cannot provide an acceptable form of identification, before a court appearance. 
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, possession of a valid photo ID card has also become a prerequisite to enter many office buildings, board an airplane, buy a ticket for a long-distance train ride or wire money. The level of anxiety among Mexicans is reflected in the popularity of the consular IDs. The New York consulate said it expected to issue nearly 20,000 of them by the end of the year, compared with 7,800 last year. 
The Mexican consul general here, Salvador Beltran del Rio Madrid, said he had campaigned privately, and with limited success, for recognition of the matricula consular, making his case to government officials and the police. But immigrant groups in New York have not lobbied for its acceptance and it has not been publicly debated.
In other cities, the validity of the Mexican ID card has prompted heated debates over whether recognition would amount to legitimization of illegal immigrants. New York politicians, however, rarely raise issues relating to the legal or illegal status of immigrants. 
Instead, the conversations in city and state offices over the Mexican ID have focused on the heightened concerns over security and identity fraud since the terrorist attacks.
Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera of the Bronx said he had met several times with officials of the Motor Vehicles Department in an attempt to have the consular card accepted as a form of identification to obtain a driver's license. He has not succeeded.
"They said that the New York state driver's license is seen as such a valuable ID around the nation, because of the point system and everything else, that it's treasured around the nation as an excellent ID," said Mr. Rivera. "So they question whether by having this collateral issue, it would weaken the value of the state driver's license."
New York State uses a system that assigns points to different types of identification documents and first-time applicants for a driver's license must show six points of identification as well as proof of their birth dates and Social Security numbers.
A valid United States passport, for instance, is worth four points. A naturalization certificate is worth three points, as are green cards and foreign passports with valid student or business visas. A major credit card counts for one point. Only certain documents -- a passport for example -- are accepted as proof of an applicant's birth date. 
Mr. Rivera said he had suggested that the state send specialists to Mexico to study the security protections that the Mexicans contend are built in to the consular cards. If the state wants additional safeguards, he said, they could require them of Mexico as they have done in the past in the case of Canadian citizens seeking licenses.
Although intelligence officers from the New York Police Department have interviewed officials at the Mexican consulate here, they have not recommended that the department accept the consular ID. A law enforcement officer said the department's opposition was based on security concerns, but he declined to be more specific.
Mexican officials maintain that their consular ID card, based on corroborating government documents from Mexico and designed to thwart counterfeiting, is secure. It shows a current photograph, date of birth and the address of the holder.
A number of banks, on the other hand, have come to see Mexican laborers as potentially profitable customers who spend millions of dollars each year in fees to transfer money back home. At least 60 United States financial institutions, according to the Mexican government, now accept the consular ID as one of generally two identity documents required to open a bank account. 
Among those banks are Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and FleetBoston. "We view it as a very legitimate form of identification," said James W. Schepker, a spokesman for FleetBoston in Hartford.

HEADLINE: Air Travel Up Slightly, But Revenue Still Lags 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Like the vanished vapor trail of a jet, the flush days of holiday air travel have disappeared.
 For the last year, people working in the air travel industry had hoped -- and analysts had predicted -- that this holiday season would lift the industry. But while more people are flying this year than at the same time last year, when the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks kept many at home, the numbers do not nearly approach those during the holiday season in 2000, considered a boom year for the industry. 
 What's more, the revenue pulled in by the industry each month since August has fallen below 1995 levels, a trend that will continue through the end of the year, industry economists say.
Nowhere are the industry's deepening concerns more apparent than in major airports, like Ronald Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport here. At these airports and others nationwide, concourses have remained ghostlike in their emptiness over the last couple of months, at least compared with the 2000 holiday season. Shopkeepers have shaken their heads at the dearth of money in their cash registers. Passengers have marveled at some half-deserted plane cabins. 
From Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, passengers on seven of the eight largest carriers in the United States flew 58 billion miles, a 10.7 percent increase from the number in the period last year, but down 12.8 percent from 2000, according to the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group. That pattern is not expected to change much when the passenger volume for the rest of December is calculated in. 
And the airlines, with too many planes in the sky, are also having a tougher time making money on those passengers who are flying. The average revenue for each available seat mile, a standard industry measure, was 11.8 cents in November, down 1.7 percent from the figure in the month a year earlier. Many Wall Street analysts had expected an increase of nearly 2 percent.
Compounding the problem for airports are two airlines in bankruptcy court -- United Airlines and US Airways -- and a deadline on Tuesday to have cumbersome baggage screening machines in place.
The message is clear: Whatever turnaround people might have hoped for this season never materialized. Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase, wrote in a recent investor's note: "Put more bluntly, industry trends deteriorated in November, having held largely stable (though weak) over the past several months. Frankly we're surprised by the magnitude of deterioration."
At the two airports in the Washington area, the number of passengers is down tremendously from 2000. Last month, 1.1 million passengers went through Reagan National and 1.3 million through Dulles -- down 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively, from 2000. "It doesn't feel like the holidays at all; right after Christmas, you expect this place to be packed, but it's pretty empty," said Robert Wills, a 17-year-old basketball player who was waiting with his teammates at Reagan National, as he often does, for a flight to a high school tournament.
Moreover, Reagan National is a de facto hub for US Airways and Dulles serves as one for United, raising extra concerns for executives here, as well as for operators of other airports that serve those airlines.
"When somebody's filed for bankruptcy, it gets your attention," said James A. Wilding, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs Reagan National and Dulles. "But while we obviously wish they weren't in this circumstance, and you sleep with one eye open while they're in this circumstance, I like our assets as they restructure."
Mr. Wilding thinks the landing rights and gates at his airports are important enough to US Airways and United that they will keep up their lease payments and levels of service. Ninety percent of passengers at Reagan National and 70 percent at Dulles start or end their journeys at those airports. Airlines that shift their operations away from those airports risk losing their share of that revenue.
Even in bankruptcy, US Airways is fighting for six slots that were vacated recently at Reagan National by Midway Airlines and Spirit Airlines, Mr. Wilding said.
As for the leases of United and US Airways, "there's not going to be a renegotiation" he said, adding, "We expect United and US Airways to assume the leases and be about their business."
United and US Airways have the upper hand right now in contract renegotiations with their unions, vendors and aircraft lessors, primarily because of the soft market in air travel, but they do not have nearly as much leverage over large airports to renegotiate lease terms. That is because they need the landing rights, gates and other facilities to maintain their route networks.
If the airlines were to leave certain popular airports -- like Reagan National, used by many US Airways business travelers, or San Francisco, United's gateway for trans-Pacific flights -- then rival airlines would almost certainly snap up their places.
"We are very concerned about United and the airlines' situation," said Michael McCarron, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport, which depends on United for 27 percent of its annual revenue. "But worst-case scenario, should United go away, it doesn't mean San Francisco will lose business. We will attract tourists no matter what. And other air carriers have already expressed an interest in taking United's place, should it come to that."
US Airways has already cut capacity in some markets, and United has said it intends to stay close to its current level of service for now, though industry experts say United will eventually have to scale back its flights or planes.
The Chapter 11 filings by the two airlines do bring certain pitfalls for airports. United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and US Airways owe the Washington Airports Authority one month's rent each -- $2.7 million and about $500,000, respectively. The airlines skipped those payments as they were filing for bankruptcy protection, and the authority is now the 19th largest of United's unsecured creditors. Various government and airport authorities in Indiana are owed $162 million by United, one of the airline's largest unsecured debts.
Mr. Wilding also said there could be a marginal decrease in United's use of Dulles for connecting flights between Europe and the United States because United's flagship hub in Chicago is close enough to take up that role.
More than the bankruptcies, Mr. Wilding has been worried about the mad scramble this holiday season to meet deadlines set by Congress for new security measures. Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress ordered that the new Transportation Security Administration put in place machines to screen all checked baggage at 429 airports by the end of this year. Although government officials have said "a reasonable handful" of airports will have to use stopgap measures, Mr. Wilding said Reagan National and Dulles had all the machines in place, even if they were not all being used yet.
But like many airport executives, Mr. Wilding has disapproved of the way the large machines, which are the size of minivans, have been installed in his airports. At Reagan National, they sit in the lobby area, taking up valuable space, he said, while at Dulles they mostly sit in rooms out of sight of passengers. He said he would rather have had the time and the money to install the machines as part of the baggage conveyor belt systems, something that Logan International Airport in Boston did at a cost of $146 million.
"I'm very anxious for that to happen," Mr. Wilding said. "If you go down there and look at it right now, it's kind of a fright. It's not something we want to live with in the long term."
Some concessionaires have had their own complaints about security measures, especially when lines back up at the screening areas and passengers anxiously flock there rather than stopping at shops and restaurants.
"As soon as people walk in here, they look at the security gate; they're trying to decide, 'Should I leave right now, or should I get something to eat?' " said Alex Lee, manager of Matsutake Sushi at Reagan National. There were a couple days in early December when the security line by his restaurant stretched back about 100 feet, he added, discouraging customers from stopping in.
The waits at the four security checkpoints at Reagan National usually last less than 15 minutes, Mr. Wilding said, although there are sometimes exceptions. Brian Doyle, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, said waits at airports across the country had averaged less than 10 minutes during the holiday season.
But tighter security rules are just one of many concerns on the minds of concessionaires. Like others in the industry, they know that their problems are much larger, tied to the seemingly endless slump in air travel and the absence of a huge upswing in the last couple of months. And many concessionaires, from San Francisco to Chicago to the ones here, remain worried that things could get worse before they get better, especially if United and US Airways do not make it through bankruptcy.
"If we lose two big companies, there will be less passengers, less business," said Mr. Lee, who has stopped accepting food vouchers issued by those two airlines. "That won't happen right now, but maybe sometime in the future."

 BODY:
Companies Add a Fee Here And a Surcharge There
Companies are adding new surcharges to all kinds of services and products as they try to compensate for a sputtering economy and price-conscious customers.
 In some cases, the new surcharges are paid only by customers who actually use specific services. The fees are intended to make prices fairer, because only the users must pay extra and companies can avoid raising prices across the board. In other cases, new fees apply to all customers, as a way of passing along extra costs of doing business. Page A1. 

Dow Down 17% So Far This Year
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to 8,303.78, its fourth consecutive decline. The Dow was down 2.4 percent for the week and is 17.1 percent lower since the beginning of the year. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sagged 14.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 875.40, while the Nasdaq composite index closed down 19.58 points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,348.31. C4.

Unemployment Benefits Are Ending
More than 750,000 Americans will exhaust their federal unemployment benefits because of a partisan standoff in Congress. Laid-off workers typically are provided with 26 weeks of unemployment benefits from their states. The federal government has routinely extended unemployment benefits during harsh economic times. But a 13-week extension authorized by Congress earlier this year expires today and the House and Senate tried but failed to reach an accord before adjourning. A1.

Poland Confirms Jet Purchase
The Polish government confirmed that Lockheed Martin had been chosen to modernize Warsaw's air force with a $3.5 billion order for 48 combat jets. The deal is Lockheed's first major order in Eastern Europe and came after a major lobbying effort by the Bush administration. Defense Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski, above, dismissed criticism that Poland had succumbed to American pressure, saying that the best package of planes and reciprocal investments in Polish industry had won.

Home Sales Rose 5.7% Last Month
Sales of new homes rose 5.7 percent in November as the lowest mortgage rates in more than three decades encouraged buyers. Single-family home sales jumped to a record 1.069 million annual rate in November. The demand was led by homes priced below $150,000, partly because of a 41 percent surge in the Midwest and a slump in the Northeast. C2.

Money Flowed Into Stock Funds
Domestic stock funds took in a net $6.5 billion in November, reversing a five-month trend in which withdrawals exceeded new deposits, a fund industry trade group said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
NORTH KOREA SAYS IT PLANS TO EXPEL NUCLEAR MONITORS

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
North Korea announced today that it would expel all international nuclear inspectors and restart a nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory that outside experts fear could supply the isolated nation with weapons-grade plutonium.
 Top officials in the Bush administration, which is pressing the Russians, Chinese, Japanese and South Koreans to persuade North Korea to abandon its confrontational stance, conferred today while the administration reiterated that Pyongyang must reverse course. 
 "The North Koreans would like nothing better than a dust-up with the United States," a senior Bush administration official said. "That's the game they've played for years. We're not going to get into that." 
Instead, Bush administration security advisers, emphasizing that the United States is not considering military action, decided today to back an effort by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency to lay North Korea's actions before the Security Council by declaring it in violation of international nonproliferation agreements. Page A11. 
In what is rapidly building into a test of international will against North Korean defiance, the atomic energy agency, which is based in Vienna, said its three inspectors were "staying put." It demanded that North Korea restore cameras and seals on four facilities that were shut down under a 1994 agreement designed to prevent North Korea from acquiring a nuclear bomb.
"Together with the loss of cameras and seals, the departure of inspectors would practically bring to an end our ability to monitor D.P.R.K.'s nuclear program or assess its nature," said Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, using the initials for North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
North Korea appeared increasingly isolated in diplomatic terms. South Korea's incoming president, who won election just last week on a platform of greater engagement with North Korea, issued the strongest demand to date for the North to back down and play by international rules.
If the reprocessing laboratory were reopened, it would take North Korea about six months to start producing weapons-grade plutonium from 8,000 spent fuel rods that are stored in cans in pools of water, said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University.
"If they kick out the inspectors the world has absolutely no eyes -- no cameras, no inspections," said Dr. Cha, an associate professor of government. "The real red line is if they start doing something with that reprocessing plant. If they start tampering with those cans, everyone knows the time line is six months."
But North Korea, through statements by its state-controlled news media and in a letter to the United Nations agency, showed every intention of kicking out the inspectors.
In the letter, Ri Je Son, director general of North Korea's Atomic Energy Department, cited as justifications for the move the suspension this month of an American-brokered deal to build two nuclear reactors in North Korea and the Bush administration's "designation of the D.P.R.K as the 'axis of evil' " and the target for the "nuclear pre-emptive strike."
President Bush has publicly stated that the United States will not attack North Korea. However, he did tell The Washington Post that he loathed Kim Jong Il, the leader of the secretive North Korean state.
According to the atomic energy agency, one of the very few international bodies with any direct access to North Korea, technicians have moved a total of 2,000 new fuel rods into a building that houses a five-megawatt experimental reactor.
North Korea has said that by the end of February it will restart the reactor, which produces plutonium as a byproduct. This week, North Korea also promised to restart construction on two larger reactors, which are also of the plutonium-producing type.
In the letter, the North Korean nuclear chief said the reprocessing plant would be operated "as a preparatory step to secure safe storage of large quantity of spent-fuel rods that would come out once these power plants are in operation."
"It is for this sake that we will soon be prepared for the operation of the radiochemical laboratory," he wrote, referring to the processing plant.
Roh Moo Hyun, who takes office as president of South Korea in late February, said today that the North's moves were undermining popular support for engagement with North Korea. "If the worries of South Koreans over North Korea's moves escalate, this government and the new government will be hamstrung and North-South exchanges will suffer a negative impact," he added.
"North Korea's moves defy the international community's wishes for an end to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and run counter to the hopes of our nation for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
"North Korea must withdraw the nuclear measures it has taken and restore facilities and equipment to their original state," he said.
Two days after South Korean voters elected Mr. Roh on Dec. 19, North Korean technicians started to break the seals and hood the cameras at the nuclear facility. With these moves and the planned expulsion of the United Nations inspectors, North Korea is widely considered to be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a treaty it has signed, along with 185 other nations.
"North Korea is emboldened by the election in South Korea and they think they can get away with this kind of stuff because they have South Korean support," said Chuck Downs, author of "Over the Line: North Korea's Negotiating Strategy." "Their objective is to deal with U.S. as an adversary, and rope in South Korea as a friend and ally."
South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, held an emergency security council meeting tonight. North Korea fears drove Seoul's main stock market index down 2.2 percent, to close at a six-week low.
Over the last half century, Mr. Downs said, North Korea has pursued a strategy of artificially ratcheting up crises in order to obtain benefits in return for easing tensions. However, he doubted whether this tactic would work this time because China and Russia are no longer firm allies, and the United States is leading an international coalition to isolate North Korea.
The stance of China and Russia, both veto-bearing permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, will become crucial if -- as appears likely -- North Korea's violations of the nuclear accords are taken before the Council for possible action, including economic sanctions.
In Beijing today, the English-language China Daily attacked a statement this week by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld that the United States was capable of fighting two wars at once.
"This is a hawkish and dangerous warning," the newspaper said, taking a harsher line than the Chinese Foreign Ministry's appeal for dialogue. "It will poison the warming relations between the two sides on the Korean Peninsula."
Chinese troops helped to create North Korea in the early 1950's and today China supplies almost 40 percent of North Korea's food needs and almost all of its oil.
From Russia, the atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, blamed the breakdown on the failure of signatories of the 1994 accord with North Korea to build the two promised nuclear power plants. He said in Moscow: "No construction work has been carried out in Korea for the past 10 years. As a result, Korea has been left without energy."
The Kremlin, however, was silent on the North Korean controversy.
North Korea has often claimed that the five-megawatt reactor was built with indigenous technology. But a Western diplomat who visited the reactor twice in the late 1990's said in an interview here today, "When I was in the control room of the reactor, all the labels, all the signs, were in Korean and Russian."

A11) Chart: "Plutonium From Spent Nuclear Fuel"The U.S. government and International Atomic Energy Agency fear that North Korea will separate weapons-grade plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Here is how the process would work: 1 -- Spent fuel rods, which are stored underwater to protect against their high radioactivity, contain uranium, plutonium and other radioactive elements. 2 -- Fuel rods are sent to a reprocessing plant, where they are stripped of their casing, chopped into small pieces and dissolved in hot nitric acid. 3 -- An organic solvent separates uranium and plutonium from other radioactive waste. 4 -- The structure of the plutonium is changed so it can be separated from uranium. 5 -- After more refinement, the uranium and plutonium could be used in reactors or to make weapons. 6 -- The I.A.E.A. estimates that about 17.6 pounds of plutonium are needed to make a weapon; others say it would require as little as 2.2 pounds.

HEADLINE: Congress Battles on Benefits, As the Unemployed Worry 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN with EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: HARVEY, Ill., Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Standing in the cold outside the local unemployment office, 44-year-old Margaret Riley waited for her ride this morning, having just applied for benefits at the crowded Illinois Department of Employment Security in this south suburb of Chicago.
 Aware that for more than 750,000 Americans federal unemployment benefits run out on Saturday, Ms. Riley considered herself one of the lucky ones. She shook her head at the difficulty many have finding work in a still-slumping economy and the realities of life for the unemployed, some of whom were about to have their only source of income -- an unemployment check -- run out. 
 "It ain't funny because a lot of people depend on it," said Ms. Riley, a certified nursing assistant who applied for benefits because her hours at work were sharply reduced. "It's really bad. That's messed up. How are you supposed to pay your bills and stuff?" 
About 750,000 Americans will exhaust their benefits, at least temporarily, on Saturday because of a partisan standoff in Congress over the size and scope of an extension.
Laid-off workers typically are provided with 26 weeks of unemployment benefits from the state and the federal government has routinely extended unemployment benefits in harsh economic times.
But an extension authorized by Congress earlier this year expires on Dec. 28 and the House and Senate failed to reach an agreement over continuing benefits before adjourning in late November.
President Bush declared in a radio address this month that extending unemployment benefits should be the "first priority" when Congress convenes on Jan. 7, making some resolution more likely. But he did not detail a plan, and White House officials said today that he had yet to make up his mind. 
Democratic lawmakers have been hammering the administration on the issue for months, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, criticized Congressional Republicans and Mr. Bush today. 
"Regrettably, the House Republican leadership turned their backs on these families and refused to act, and the administration chose not to intervene before Congress adjourned," Mr. Daschle said. "This inaction by Republicans was unconscionable then, and it is even more so now." 
Miles away from Washington, in the standing-room-only unemployment office in Harvey, questions and concerns over the fate of hundreds of thousands of laid-off Americans swirled on an icy winter day.
In Illinois alone, about 42,000 unemployed workers will lose benefits on Saturday, said Bern Colleran, a spokesman for the state's Department of Employment Security.
Alisa Foster, a postal worker who applied for unemployment in Harvey, said: "It's going to be kind of hard for families that actually need the extension. I mean, what are they going to do? Are they going to re-institute welfare?"
Ms. Foster said, "I think the Bush administration should do something to push" a little harder to get an extension of benefits through Congress.
The House, which is controlled by Republicans, had wanted a five-week extension that would be limited to three Northwestern states with high unemployment rates: Alaska, Oregon and Washington. The Senate package, drawn up when Democrats were in control, was more expensive and would have provided for a 12-week extension with no limit on the number of states. 
Both plans died when the House adjourned after refusing to take up the Senate bill. Since then, Republicans have enlarged their proposal to include more states, but Democrats still want to cover the entire nation.
Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has proposed a bill to extend benefits, warned today that Congressional feuding could leave in a lurch many workers who should qualify for benefits. "If this gets protracted, there is a very real danger that some people will fall between the cracks," Mr. English said in a telephone interview.
In Harvey, some of the unemployed, like William Woods, 49, who applied for educational benefits, were not convinced that was not happening already. 
"It puts a lot of people that I was talking with earlier under the gun," Mr. Woods said, noting that the conversation this morning among laid-off workers, waiting to be seen inside the unemployment office, was filled with anxiety. "They don't know what they're going to do right now." 
"It couldn't have come at a worse time," said Mr. Woods, who was laid off in October from his $40,000-a-year job at a candy factory after 25 years. "The economy is slow." 
For the nation, the unemployment rate in November was 6 percent, equaling its highest rate since mid-1994, and representing about 8.5 million people. In Illinois, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent, representing 416,200 people. 
Still, for some, the issue of extending benefits is not so clear-cut.
"There's a lot of mixed emotions," said Marion Marganski, 47, a maintenance mechanic who has been unemployed for two years and who has exhausted his benefits.
If you extend all these benefits, Mr. Marganski wanted to know, who is going to pay for it? 
"You can't depend on the government all the time," he said, though later admitting that he had received benefits under a federal extension.
Like Ms. Riley, Vincent Canzone, 27, considers himself one of the fortunate. 
A laid-off construction worker, Mr. Canzone said he needed unemployment benefits only to tide him over until his next job, which begins in about a week, though some of his friends are not so lucky.
"It's hard right now," Mr. Canzone said. "Most of my friends went to college and they all got laid off from these big firms and they lost a lot of money. It's bad for some people. A lot of people need this income."

HEADLINE: Stricken Chickens Shake Up California Poultry Industry 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
For the first time in the recent efforts to locate and destroy chickens infected with Exotic Newcastle Disease in Southern California, contaminated birds have been found at a commercial poultry farm.
 The discovery led state officials this week to destroy more than 100,000 chickens used for egg production, sending a shiver through the state's $3 billion poultry industry. 
 "This was one commercial flock infected," said Larry Hawkins, a spokesman for the United States Agriculture Department in Sacramento. "Is that huge? Is that a killer for California poultry? No, but this is a very serious discovery. It adds a new dimension to the problem. If we don't get a handle on this, we may find ourselves with many flocks infected, and that would certainly not be good news." 
Exotic Newcastle Disease, which does not affect humans, has bedeviled California poultry on occasion for decades. The last serious outbreak was in the 1970's, when a statewide outbreak threatened the industry across the country and led to the destruction of almost 12 million chickens, at a cost of more than $50 million.
Most of California's commercial poultry operations are in the central part of the state. The recent outbreaks have been confined to the south in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, where state officials in November initiated a quarantine against the export of any birds or of any eggs that had not been washed, sanitized and packed in new material.
Until recently, all contaminated birds had been privately owned chickens kept in backyards.
But last Saturday, after noticing that his birds were dying at an unusual rate, the operator of a modest-size poultry farm at the eastern edge of Los Angeles County notified state officials, who confirmed the disease, and the birds and their eggs were destroyed. State officials did not identify the farmer.
Bill Mattos, executive director of the California Poultry Federation, a trade group, said the discovery of diseased birds in Southern California, where chickens are raised mainly for their eggs, "has put up red flags" throughout the industry, raising fears that the disease might spread into the central part of the state, where the bulk of California poultry farms are. 
"Southern California is still a long way from the major meat-production of chicken and turkeys," Mr. Mattos said. "It does not create a big problem until it gets farther north. Then we're talking about millions and millions of eggs, and that could definitely become an economic problem."
Still, the quarantine has forced dozens of other poultry farms in Southern California to halt shipments outside the area in a freeze that could remain in effect for months.

HEADLINE: Fees Hidden in Plain Sight, Companies Add to Bottom Line 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
AT&T Wireless recently began charging for calls that go unanswered for more than 30 seconds. At many New York theaters, including the Shubert Organization's 17, ticket buyers pay a "theater restoration fee" or a "facilities fee."
 Some hotels now charge a "connectivity fee" of about $4 a night for access to the phone, high-speed Internet, faxes and such, whether or not those services are actually used. They also charge $1 or more for in-room safes, whether or not the safes are used. 
 Companies are adding new surcharges to all kinds of services and products as they try to compensate for a sputtering economy and price-conscious customers.
"When we charge customers a fee, it is because we have a cost that we must recover," said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T Wireless. "Our charges are all out in the open. They are fully disclosed. That's the only way to play the game."
In some cases, the new surcharges are paid only by customers who actually use specific services. They are intended to make prices fairer, because only the users must pay extra and companies can avoid raising prices across the board. For example, some Domino's and Pizza Hut franchises have been adding delivery surcharges of about 50 cents to a dollar. 
In other cases, new fees apply to all customers, as a way of passing along an extra cost of doing business. Phone companies like AT&T, Sprint and Verizon added a "universal connectivity charge" this summer to finance their contribution to a federal program for people with low incomes or in rural areas. 
But sometimes the fees simply create another source of revenue.
Theatergoers, who once had to complain only about the service charges added to tickets bought by phone or online, now face fees of $1.25 or $1.50 from many Broadway theaters.
Jonas Blank, a law student from Alexandria, Va., said he recently bought tickets for "Rent" at the Nederlander Theater and was surprised by the fee. "I'm not so sure it's such a bad thing," he said. "At the same time, I wonder why they don't just include that in the price. It seems a little bit like false advertising."
At hotels, some guests complain that the latest surcharges are for amenities they don't even use. They also say those fees have not translated into better service.
Last year, the Courtyard by Marriott at La Guardia Airport and the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel and Suites at Lehigh Valley Airport in Allentown, Pa., each added a "connectivity fee" of about $4 a night for access to services like phones, high-speed Internet and faxes. Meyer Jabara Hotels, which owns and operates 24 hotels, also adopted the connectivity fees.
Julie Hackett, a sales manager in San Francisco, said that during each of three stays at a Days Inn in Baltimore she was charged $1 a night for the safe in her room. "I never used the safe at that particular hotel," she said. "If I was not the type to scrutinize the itemizations of all my bills, it would have likely gone unnoticed." 
Some hotels are also charging "administrative" fees for room service, on top of existing room-service charges and fixed gratuities. At the Century Plaza Hotel and Spa in Los Angeles, guests who order room service pay a $3 delivery charge, 15 percent gratuity and a 5 percent administrative fee, which would turn a $10 snack into a $15 order. 
In some cases, businesses struggling to become profitable are adding charges for customers they say cost them more. 
One example is the airline industry. This year, paper plane tickets have typically cost $20 more than paperless electronic tickets, and in October, two months after it filed for bankruptcy, US Airways began charging travelers $100 to fly on standby. 
Since summer, the largest carriers have been enforcing long-dormant fees of $40 to $80 for checked suitcases beyond the two usually permitted, and charging for bags that weigh more than 70 pounds or exceed 62 linear inches. The fees accrue: a third bag that is simultaneously overweight and oversized might cost an extra $80, on average.
One company has gone so far as to make a game out of encouraging its employees to collect fees whenever possible. At Alaska Airlines, employees spent July and August competing for the greatest percentage increase in collecting fees for excess baggage or oversized luggage. The problem was that too many employees were waiving the fees for harried passengers. The carrier said that was not fair, that passengers were complaining about inconsistent prices. 
To fix that, the company contest promised $1,000 to the winning team and individual prizes to five customer-service agents. Alaska Airlines said at the time that it wanted to raise fee collections by 25 percent, to $25 million in 2002 from $19.5 million in 2001. 
Other companies are passing on the cost of processing and mailing statements and even bills. MetroPCS, which offers wireless service in a handful of cities, and Primus, the telecommunications provider, each started charging customers $2 a month this year for mailed bills. Ameritrade and TD Waterhouse last year began charging $2 for mailed trade confirmations. In April 2001, NetBank, an Internet bank that has no branches, began charging $3 for paper statements. These companies say that they need to cut billing costs to remain competitive and that their customers often prefer the paperless route after trying it. 
In many cases, the latest fees signal a move toward less human interaction with customers and, many consumers complain, inferior service. Intuit, for one, is charging $14.95 for phone time with customer service representatives who handle its Turbotax software; the company says its Web site can answer all reasonable questions. Intuit could not be reached for comment. Other companies have said that a small fraction of consumers accounts for the bulk of service calls, and so those consumers should pay for those calls.
Justified or not, the newest fees can be received badly. As a result, some companies have recently withdrawn their surcharges. In October, Sprint PCS dropped its $3 charge for each call to a customer service representative.
"We listen to our customers," said Dan Wilinsky, a spokesman for Sprint PCS. "They didn't like it. They didn't want to pay it, and we waived it."
Earlier this month, American Airlines, United Airlines and Continental Airlines each said that it had canceled an impending fee to fly on standby; Delta reduced its proposed surcharge this week to $25 from $100. And this month Bank One eliminated fees to see tellers at some branches.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Poland to Buy Fighter Jets From the U.S.

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
The Polish government confirmed today that Lockheed Martin had been chosen to modernize Warsaw's air force with a $3.5 billion order for 48 combat jets.
 Lockheed's F-16 Fighting Falcon won over the Mirage 2000-5 jet fighter from Dassault Aviation of France and the Gripen, built by Saab of Sweden and BAE Systems of Britain. Saab is controlled by Investor. The deal is Lockheed's first major order in Eastern Europe and came after a major lobbying effort by the Bush administration. 
 Defense Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski dismissed criticism that Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had succumbed to American pressure, saying that the best package of planes and reciprocal investments in Polish industry had won the day.
"Poland based its decision on merit, not politics," he said at a news conference today. "This deal guarantees our ability to participate in NATO operations and increases our security."
The F-16's will be delivered between 2006 and 2008, enabling Poland to scrap its obsolete Soviet-era planes, some of which have been in service since the 1960's. Military experts rate the F-16 and Mirage roughly equal as fighting machines, with the cheaper Gripen third.
Lockheed said it won on technical and financial grounds.
As part of the deal, Poland gains a $3.8 billion low-interest loan from the United States government. It will repay only due interest from 2003 to 2010, and then interest and principal from 2011 to 2015. The Polish defense ministry said the contract's total costs, including debt servicing, should not exceed $4.7 billion.
In addition, Lockheed, with its partners, pledged to pump as much as $9.8 billion into Poland's defense and civilian industries over 10 years or so.
Contracts for the planes are to be completed by the end of March.
The F-16 flies in nine NATO air forces and has a track record dating back to the 1970's, but Lockheed says the model it offered Poland is the most modern flying in Europe today.
The plane, powered by F-100-229 engines from the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies, is fitted with Northrop Grumman radar and electronic warfare systems.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED; 
Big Thinkster

BYLINE:  By Charles McGrath; Charles McGrath is the editor of The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
In midcentury America, sociologists for a while rivaled even psychiatrists in their seeming ability to explain everything about everything. The most influential sociologist of the era was David Riesman, whose 1950 book "The Lonely Crowd" ventured to break all of civilization down into three basic character types: "tradition-directed," "inner-directed" or "other-directed." Tradition-directeds rigorously follow ancient rules and customs; inner-directeds are self-motivated and goal-oriented; and other-directeds, the people Riesman saw all around him, are slavish conformists who want only to be loved and accepted. They were those craven 50's types we still hear so much about.
 Originally intended for the college classroom, "The Lonely Crowd" unaccountably landed on the best-seller lists and stayed there for months and months as thousands of Americans anxiously examined themselves and their neighbors for directional indications. The book went on to sell more than 1.4 million copies, making it the most successful sociologist's book ever, and it still turns up on lists of the century's most influential books -- even though today it might have trouble finding a publisher. 
 "The Lonely Crowd" is not a slog, exactly -- Riesman is a reasonably fluent writer, especially by academic standards. But in spite of some occasional hip formulations ("peer-grouper," "inside dopester"), neither is it user-friendly. It's written in outline fashion, with lengthy chapter heads and roman-numeraled subsections, and it goes in for professorial signposting: This is what I'm about to say, and there, I've just said what I said I'd say, so let's review. The juicy stuff -- like the claim that other-directeds have adventurous sex lives, because sex is where they look for reassurance that they are not just social automatons is embedded in the text without warning or fanfare.
"The Lonely Crowd" was also burdened with a far-fetched theory about population growth, which Riesman later backed away from. And the evidence for the essential character types themselves mostly consists of a few interviews (virtually un-footnoted) and lots of references to books and movies. In short, there's nothing very rigorous about "The Lonely Crowd," but the book feels scientific all the same; its very structure imparts a suggestion of seriousness and gravitas.
This was the style back then. The 50's and 60's were the great age of the Big Notion: the pseudoscientific book that explained us to ourselves and told us where we were headed, which in most cases was nowhere good. The avatar of them all, of course, was Freud's "Civilization and Its Discontents," which argued, among other things, that we were all suffering from a kind of collective neurosis, and picking up the theme, in addition to "The Lonely Crowd," were William H. Whyte's "Organization Man," which made many of the same points as Riesman; Herbert Marcuse's "One-Dimensional Man," which gave a Marxist twist to the argument and said that we were prisoners of the economy; and Norman O. Brown's "Life Against Death," which said that the solution to all this one-dimensionality was more eros. (In certain 60's grad-school circles, "Life Against Death" was a very important book to get your date to read.) 
You can see flickerings of the genre in more recent works like Allan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind" or David Brooks's "Bobos in Paradise," which is partly an ironic gloss on Riesman, but Charles A. Reich's "Greening of America," which came out in 1970 and said that we were all becoming hippies, pretty much ended the vogue for Big Notions. After Reich, no one wanted to risk looking so foolish. Sociology, meanwhile, like the rest of the social sciences, has become more and more quantitative. Harvard recently canceled the lecture series that was held in Riesman's memory.
"The Lonely Crowd" is in part a monument to a bygone moment -- the time when eggheads ruled the earth, or at least seemed to have all the answers. What makes it poignant -- and what no doubt accounts for its unlikely success -- is that Riesman was actually on to something. To call it a theory or an analysis is probably too grand, but informing the book is an intuition that life in the mid-50's was different somehow from life in decades past, and that, for all their outward success, many Americans were leading lives of inner emptiness and desperation. Riesman's title is a publisher's invention -- the actual phrase appears nowhere in the book -- but it touched a nerve, the same nerve touched by Sloan Wilson's novel "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit," say, or by Cheever's short stories about lonely commuters and anxious suburbanites, or for that matter by Douglas Sirk's movies, now back in vogue. The odd thing was that back then it took a sociologist to tell people what they were feeling. Nowadays someone on TV would do it for us.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-29-02: THE ETHICIST; 
Stealth Progressive

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
Now and then, an exasperated reader denounces The Ethicist as nothing more than Ann Landers -- a fancy-pants Ann Landers, a pretentious Ann Landers. Just Ann Landers.
 I wish. 
Few writers become as popular as Eppie Lederer, and few popular writers are as innovative. In 1955, when she took over the Ask Ann Landers column, agony aunts, as such writers were known, practiced a kind of faux-Victorian gentility. The job and its discontents are disturbingly portrayed in Nathanael West's 1933 short novel, "Miss Lonelyhearts." The queries from advice-seekers are mawkish and sentimental, "stamped from the dough of suffering with a heart-shaped cookie knife." The replies from Miss Lonelyhearts are melodramatic and false: "Life, for most of us, seems a terrible struggle of pain and heartbreak, without hope or joy. Oh, my dear readers, it only seems so." Overwhelmed by the work, Miss Lonelyhearts languishes in speakeasies, gets into brawls, has tawdry affairs. He -- for Miss Lonelyhearts is a young man -- even beats up a woman who had written to his column and is eventually shot by her husband. 
I don't believe that Lederer ever beat up anyone who sought her advice; instead, she transformed the genre. Her column was cheerful and direct; its prose colloquial; its tone straight from the shoulder; its advice that of an amiable neighbor, a trusted friend. In the biopic, at least the 1950's version, she would be played by the wise and wisecracking Eve Arden.
I admired Lederer's jaunty self-assurance, but I understand Miss Lonelyhearts's crisis. To write an advice column requires you to declare yourself unambiguously on matters about which honorable people may differ -- and they do, vociferously. The captious mail flows freely. Lederer seemed to handle such criticism gracefully, but it took me some getting used to. Being called a jerk, even by strangers, even when you know you are right, is not pleasant. It is particularly nettlesome when a reader attacks not my argument but my character. Such letters tend to begin, "Dear Sir, I am appalled" -- no you're not; you are, at most, annoyed -- and to end, "you should be ashamed." It hurts my feelings. I had to toughen up. No wonder Miss Lonelyhearts fell apart. But how did Eppie stay so affable?
Historians of the future will read her columns not as advice but as anthropology, a compendium of the conventional wisdom of mid-century America: Tip the pizza guy. Quit smoking. Pay your taxes. "It is unfair to denigrate all teenagers because of a few rotten apples." "A business degree is no substitute for common sense." "In my opinion, the majority of folks are honest." "A sense of humor can salvage almost any situation."
But if the sort of advice she provided can be criticized as commonplace, as conventional wisdom, nonetheless she must have been the most liberal voice in many of the 1,200 papers that carried her column, a proponent of ideas that would have seemed radical had they appeared on the editorial page. She was a staunch supporter of gun control, a defender of reproductive rights, a foe of the Vietnam War. By presenting her views in the form of an innocuous advice column, not as politics but as common sense, she operated as a sort of stealth progressive.
This is not an easy thing to do. Shortly after my own column began, it was denounced in several right-wing periodicals, in one case under the headline "'The Ethicist' Better Termed 'The Marxist."' I may have suggested, in passing, that "corporations donate to charity to buff their images" or "clean air -- why not?" Apparently ideology-detecting radar has become more acute since Ann Landers began or perhaps, with the country veering so far to the right, qualifications for Marxism have been lowered substantially, like some sort of ideological grade inflation.
Lederer's primary concern was not policy but practicality. "This is my mission -- to help those who ask for it." Her antecedents are not only "Miss Lonelyhearts" but also "A Bintel Brief" ("a bundle of letters"), the advice column that began in The Jewish Daily Forward in 1906 to help Eastern European immigrants cope with American life. How do I find a job? Should there be hostility between Polish Jews and Russian Jews? Can intermarriage work?
Ann Landers was a modern Bintel Brief, explaining America to Americans, assisting its readers with the exigencies of living. And in later years, the aid Lederer propounded with disconcerting frequency was this: "I urge you to seek professional help at once." This was not a euphemism for "You're nuts!" (although some of her petitioners no doubt were), but evidence of a shift, not just in her column but in the country, to the professionalizing of comfort. Traditionally, advice givers, whether columnist or clergyman or grandmother, were valued for their personal opinions, the distillation of their experience and insight. What Lederer increasingly offered was not the guidance of a sagacious amateur but a referral to a trained professional.
"We direct thousands of people to physicians, lawyers, psychiatrists," she wrote. "We have a complete file of service agencies for every city in which this column appears. We send readers to Legal Aid, the Family Service Association, homes for unwed mothers, mental health clinics, Alcoholics Anonymous, the Y.M.C.A. -- the list is a long one."
There is something dispiriting about this shift from the cozy comforts of homespun philosophy to the impersonal efficacy of social services. But perhaps in an age of bureaucracy, of being put on hold for hours, of being shunted from one unresponsive office to another, Ann Landers was just what we needed. Her readers certainly thought so. Their continued devotion demonstrates how unambiguously she achieved her goal: to be useful. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 16, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article about Ann Landers in the "Lives They Lived" issue on Dec. 29 misstated the year of her birth. A reader's e-mail message on Feb. 16 pointed out that it was 1918, not 1919; this correction was delayed for fact checking.

Keeping Up With the Urgency Of Faith

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
RELIGION blew into civil society this year with the force of a shattered taboo. We now know how little we know about Islam, let alone other faiths in the modern world. Pressures for openness drove the Roman Catholic Church to a historic turning point in its relationship to the laity. And the great secular cathedral of New York City also opened itself to change.
 I visited three important ecclesiastical buildings in 2002, in each case before its completion. Seeing them as construction sites amplified their power as symbols of religion's changing value in the uncertain post-Cold War world. Richard Meier's JUBILEE CHURCH in Rome was particularly striking. The design's three free-standing walls, unencumbered by enclosure, created the effect of a regatta on land. Spinnakers billowing on the campagna. Grace. 
 The charismatic Capuchin monk Padre Pio was canonized this year, a few weeks after I visited San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy, the saint's native town on the Adriatic coast. The town's anticipation intensified the Gothic drama enacted by the construction team at Renzo Piano's CHURCH OF THANKSGIVING. With a capacity of 8,000 worshipers, the church is larger than most cathedrals. The asymmetrical design embodies the concept of pilgrimage. Even within the auditorium, which is configured in the shape of a nautilus, the visitor has a strong sense of ritual procession. The roof is supported by long-span stone arches arranged in a spiral, as if curving inward toward the enigma sometimes called the soul.
With financial pressures stemming from the litigation of sex abuse cases, the Roman Catholic diocese of Los Angeles played down the completion of Rafael Moneo's CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY OF THE ANGELS. What a world. And it must be said that Moneo's design inadvertently reinforced the impression of an embattled church. At a time when many have been trying to turn the church inside out, Moneo reversed the process. In effect, his design turns the traditional Gothic cathedral outside in.
The enormous nave resembles a parvis, the open area outside a European cathedral's main facade. The flying buttresses have become void spaces. Slots in the stone wall enclosing the nave thrust upward on the diagonal to create openings in the ambulatory. A magnificent interior.
While it is not, strictly speaking, an ecclesiastical building, Frank Gehry's design for the CENTER FOR HUMAN DIGNITY in Jerusalem is conceived to help mediate the differences between faiths that give rise to conflict. The domed structure, 90 feet tall, can be entered at any point along the perimeter, through titanium-clad fins.
If you care to see the dome as an exhaust ventilator, be Gehry's guest. The debate could heat up in there. A project of the Simon Wiesenthal Institute, the museum includes an assembly hall, meeting rooms, a library and a Museum of Tolerance.
Richard Florida's "RISE OF THE CREATIVE CLASS" (Basic Books) is an important book for those who feel passionately about the future of the urban center. In fact, Florida virtually defines us. A native New Yorker who now teaches at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Florida is a sociologist. He offers no blueprint for architects and planners, and some of his thinking in these areas is fuzzy. Nonetheless, he has outlined the identity of the contemporary city's core population. Just by daring to use the word class, he's changed the framework for discussing social and economic inequality.
For a fuller look, pair Florida's book with Andrew Merrifield's "METROMARXISM: A MARXIST TALE OF THE CITY" (Routledge). People who equate Marxism with drabness have not been keeping up with their shopping (Prada) or their reading. Merrifield, a British writer who now lives in New York, is accessible, optimistic and even fun. The urban center, Merrifield argues, is the site of economic extremes and for that reason the most promising field for social change. A primer for the postindustrial "children of Marx and Coca-Cola."
"NEW HOTELS FOR GLOBAL NOMADS," a show at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan, missed a golden opportunity to survey the habitats of the creative class in cities around the globe. There was a smattering of boutique hotels, but the message of mobility was hopelessly obscured by sections devoted to Las Vegas casinos, grand hotel resorts from the past and a series of pointless installations by artists.
FREDERICK SCHWARTZ wasn't the first architect to propose burying West Street, the eight-lane roadway that divides Battery Park City from the rest of lower Manhattan, and covering it with a platform promenade. He may not even have been the first to figure out that you could transfer all of the development rights from ground zero to the new acreage the platform would produce.
But he was the plan's loudest, most persistent, most obnoxious advocate. Eventually, people paid attention. Though the platform plan may not materialize (Battery Park City residents oppose it), the idea made people realize that ground zero's official planners were incapable of thinking outside the box in more ways than one.
At a TOWN HALL MEETING held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on July 20, the public seized control of a process that had been carefully scripted to manipulate its acceptance of a banal neo-traditional plan for ground zero. Forced back to the drawing boards, officials of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation initiated a 10-week INNOVATIVE DESIGN STUDY FOR THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE, with projects by some of the world's leading contemporary architects.
The results of the study were presented on Dec. 18 in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center at Battery Park City. The exhibition will remain on view until Feb. 2.

The Idea Was Not to Have a New One

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
THE worst of times was followed by the most formulaic of times. 2002 was a year with lots of new lows and very few highs, a year of synthetic hits and ersatz stars, a year in which individual voices and independent visions were overshadowed by assembly-line products -- remakes, rereleases and regurgitations, along with lots of sequels and spinoffs.
 None of these depressing developments is new, of course, but after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with an economy teetering on recession, and studios, networks, record companies and publishers all feeling increasingly risk-averse, the search for the Next Sure Thing dominated the cultural landscape as never before. 
 This was a year in which the most talked-about showdown on television was between a Victoria's Secret special on CBS and ABC's finale of "The Bachelor" -- between a 60-minute commercial for underwear and a two-hour catfight between two pandering women vying for the hand of a rose-bearing stud.
It was a year that witnessed the 20th installment of the James Bond franchise, the 10th "Star Trek" movie, the eighth "Halloween" sequel, the fourth Jack Ryan/Tom Clancy film, the fourth movie featuring Hannibal the Cannibal, the third Austin Powers picture, the second of a projected seven Harry Potter movies, and the 1,234,567th Cinderella story starring the starlet du jour. 
Greeting-card sentimentality and snarky, knee-jerk irony proliferated with abandon this year, and so did cheap gimmicks: "Sopranos" stars and other celebrities baring all on Broadway; an interactive $1 million treasure hunt on ABC's pretentious mystery "Push, Nevada"; and nationwide tryouts for the shame of being rejected by Simon Cowell on "American Idol."
In the past, hard times and historical uncertainties have often galvanized the artistic imagination -- think of the literature produced during the 1970's and 80's in Latin America, Eastern Europe and South Africa. In the case of millennial America, it's too soon to tell what the long-term effects will be, but thus far, the cultural fallout from Sept. 11 has ranged from the negligible to the tacky.
Certainly, the "New Normal" didn't make for kinder, gentler, higher-minded art, as so many predicted. A new fascination with mortality surfaced -- in novels like "The Lovely Bones" and movies like "Solaris" -- but it tended to manifest itself most visibly in a grisly interest in forensics and autopsies ("C.S.I.," "C.S.I. Miami" and "Crossing Jordan"). Sales of violent video games like "Grand Theft Auto" boomed, and sexual exhibitionism turned back the clock on women: prostitutes and their johns vamped before hidden video cameras on HBO's "Cathouse"; Rolling Stone made a habit of putting half-naked cheesecake shots of young singers and actresses on its covers; and even the new Barbie donned navel-baring Britneyesque togs.
If people were worried about terrorism, a possible war with Iraq and the specter of smallpox attacks, they weren't showing it. In front of television cameras, they wolfed down water-buffalo penises, underwent extreme cosmetic surgery and cried over being rejected by suitors they barely knew. Even Al Gore climbed into a hot tub on "Saturday Night Live" with an actor impersonating Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and played at being commander in chief on the set of "The West Wing."
The harsh dose of reality Americans experienced in the last year didn't kill off phony Darwinian competitions like "Fear Factor" and "Survivor," but instead spawned another wave of reality shows, from train-wreck exercises in voyeurism like "The Anna Nicole Show" to such demeaning exercises in sexual commerce as "Looking for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska."
Reality shows, like the fast-food franchising of movie characters and television shows, are just another symptom of Hollywood's current deficit of ideas: its ham-handed efforts to fill an ever deepening vacuum of ideas with cheap, lowest-common-denominator spectacles and low-risk, easy-to-merchandise sequels.
The creative hole in television was underscored this year by the demise of "Ally McBeal," "The X-Files," "Spin City" and "Dharma and Greg," and the utter hollowness of new ventures like David E. Kelley's "Girls Club." Many old standbys, including "E.R.," "Frasier," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue," jumped the shark in 2002, and even "The Sopranos" appeared to be running out of gas.
Things weren't much better in the film business. Entertainment Weekly reported in August that "the stock price of nearly every studio's parent company is approaching rock bottom." Star vehicles like Madonna's "Swept Away" and Eddie Murphy's "Adventures of Pluto Nash" crashed and burned. And many of the year's most highly anticipated auteur efforts proved disappointing as well: Steven Soderbergh's "Full Frontal" devolved into an exercise in Dogma-tic pretension; Sam Mendes's "Road to Perdition" tried to mix film noir with family soap opera and ended up feeling both portentous and sentimental; Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" played like an extremely violent, extremely lugubrious segment of "Masterpiece Theater"; and Spike Jonze's wildly overpraised "Adaptation" amounted to a solipsistic reworking of Sam Shepard's play "True West."
A year ago, half of the Top 10 grossing films were sequels, and in 2002, the recycling mania accelerated. In addition to a host of franchise pictures (James Bond, Harry Potter, "Star Wars," "The Lord of Rings," and so on and so on), there was an outpouring of pictures made from old television shows ("Scooby-Doo," "Jackass," "I Spy"), Broadway shows ("Chicago"), novels ("Possession," "White Oleander") and old movies ("Rollerball," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town") -- in many cases with little thought being given to how such properties might be adapted in a cinematically interesting way, with the notable exception of "Chicago."
Even movies that were not obvious remakes often turned out to be rip-offs of earlier hits or stylized reproductions: Jennifer Lopez's "Maid in Manhattan" is a mechanical pastiche of "Working Girl" and "Pretty Woman"; "Far From Heaven" is a studied and pointless replica of Douglas Sirk's 1950's melodramas; and the Naomi Watts thriller "The Ring" was based on a Japanese cult film.
On Broadway, where producers increasingly prize broad-based audience appeal over the idiosyncratic voices of individual writers and composers, recycling also continued, with more and more shows based on old movies and pop songs. Two of this year's most talked-about shows took slyly subversive, innovative films, sheared away the edges and produced cheesy, by-the-numbers works. The Broadway version of "The Graduate" created buzz solely on the promise of seeing Kathleen Turner shed her clothes; and the Broadway version of "Hairspray" turned John Waters's messy Dadaist comedy into a slick, candy-colored exercise in feel-good nostalgia.
With producers looking for another "Producers," more translations are in the works, including musical adaptations of "Batman," "Legally Blonde" and "Moonstruck." MGM alone is said to have some 20 projects in development for the stage.
It also became clear this year that cloning wasn't limited to shows and movies, that many of today's celebrities are in fact third-generation copies of earlier performers. Kelly Clarkson, the thoroughly generic, thoroughly manufactured star of the summer's hit reality show "American Idol," is a blurry copy of Mariah Carey, who is a blurry copy of Whitney Houston, who is a blurry copy of Aretha Franklin, who was the genuine thing. Pierce Brosnan, the current 007, is a watered down version of Roger Moore, who was a watered down, defanged version of the one and only Sean Connery. Justin Timberlake is a bad imitation of the vintage Michael Jackson, and Faith Hill and Shania Twain have both traded in their country roots to become pseudo-Celine Dions. The Strokes are Blondie and Velvet Underground wanna-bes, and with his new album, "18," the ubiquitous Moby officially became a parody of himself.
Given all these epigones, it's no surprise that many of the best received performances in 2002 came from baby-boomer artists: the Stones embarked on a triumphant tour; reconstituted versions of the Who and the Doors are back on tour, and James Taylor, Rod Stewart, Santana, Phil Collins, Elton John and Elvis all had Top 40 hits. Stephen Sondheim also enjoyed a glorious renaissance this year with a spirited revival of "Into the Woods" on Broadway, and a critically acclaimed repertory production of six of his shows at Washington's Kennedy Center.
So why do so many newer acts and projects feel so synthetic? The thinking behind movie franchises, certainly, is that it's easier to sell and merchandise a brand-name product -- familiarity, the reasoning goes, makes for bigger opening weekends, and a longer shelf life with spinoffs, video games, soundtracks and other corporate tie-ins. And in the music industry, the growing use of digital processing (using software like Pro Tools, which makes it possible to correct pitch and adjust timing) has made for more synthetic-sounding recordings, while changing the criterion by which singers are judged. As Billboard magazine noted: "Major-label executives readily admit that signing an act now is as much about star presence as it is about the artist's actual ability to consistently sing the notes."
As 2002 slouches to a close, however, all was not lost. Amid the cultural wreckage, there were potent albums from the alternative country band Wilco and the Detroit garage band the White Stripes, and novels by Ian McEwan, Jeffrey Eugenides, Richard Flanagan, Bruce Wagner and Alice Sebold that were as emotionally powerful as they were ambitious. Several new television shows like "24" and "Boomtown" tried, however unevenly, to push narrative conventions in new directions; and Larry David's HBO show "Curb Your Enthusiasm" gave us a hilarious look at the absurdities of modern life, as seen through the eyes of an endlessly put-upon curmudgeon.
Teen pop -- the apotheosis of shallow, overprocessed, image-driven music -- is clearly on the way out, giving way to more R & B, hip-hop and old-fashioned rock; Britney Spears has already been replaced as girl of the moment by the punkette Avril Lavigne. The Osbournes retained their wacky charm, in spite of an absurd amount of overexposure, and Eminem managed to go softer and more mainstream with his movie, "8 Mile," without losing his street cred.
Movies by Pedro Almodovar ("Talk to Her"), Zacharias Kunuk ("The Fast Runner") and Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien") reminded us that original, new work is still being done -- at least by foreign directors. Performances by Tobey Maguire in "Spider-Man" and Reese Witherspoon in "Sweet Home Alabama" reminded us that talented actors can shine in fatuous projects. And after years of mannered appearances, Jack Nicholson reminded us of his skills as an actor in "About Schmidt." The phenomenal popularity of the $5 million independent movie "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" demonstrated that expensive doesn't necessarily mean big box office, just as the pallid response to much-publicized pictures like "The Four Feathers," "The Truth About Charlie" and "Death to Smoochy" sent a message to Hollywood that the Next Sure Thing doesn't necessarily reside in high concepts or big names, that audiences still appreciate the unexpected.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE: THE YEAR IN REVIEW -- THE CRITICS/10 MOMENTS; 
Richter, And Cloth, Were Abundant

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
 Here are not the 10 best, but 10 noteworthy items, in loose order:

1. 'GERHARD RICHTER: 40 YEARS OF PAINTING' -- The Gerhard Richter retrospective, an unexpected smash even for the Museum of Modern Art, proved that serious painting is alive and well and that masses of people still want to look at it. The work annoyed and baffled just enough viewers to stir debate.

2. 'TAPESTRY IN THE RENAISSANCE: ART AND MAGNIFICENCE' -- Stupefyingly beautiful, this was the year's sleeper, hands down. The Metropolitan Museum displayed a vast array of one-of-a-kind textiles by Raphael, Bronzino and other superstars: tours-de-force of color, illusion, wealth and power that rival anything in paint or marble.

3. 'DOCUMENTA 11' -- Not because the gigantic contemporary-art survey in Kassel, Germany, organized by Okwui Enwezor, was a pleasure (it wasn't). But the work -- earnest, politically inclined, morally puritanical -- epitomized the new festival mode: call it establishment-certified antiestablishment art. The catalog, full of gibberish about "transculturality" and the "supposed purity and autonomy of the art object," underscored the emphasis on social and economic evangelism, which pleased the already converted and bored many others.

4. 'EVA HESSE' -- A retrospective organized at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art of an artist whose hastened career, haunted by big ideas, reminds us that art, when produced at ecstatic pitch, can seem the most joyous and important thing in the universe.

5. 'BARNETT NEWMAN' Handsomely installed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the show made an eloquent argument for Newman's radical and almost ludicrously ambitious achievement, dispelling knee-jerk impulses to reject it or him.

6. 'THOMAS EAKINS' This exemplary retrospective, organized by Philadelphia and then presented at the Met, reminded us that it is still impossible to see America, or at least to look back on the country in the 19th century, without some refraction through Eakins's art.

7. 'THE PAINTINGS OF JOAN MITCHELL' Lush, opulent fields of colors, seemingly all paradisiacal, containing shades of melancholy that revealed themselves to you after your eyes adjusted to their light. Abstract art does not get more ravishing than the best of the works in this exhibition, which was at the Whitney Museum.

8. 'THE QUILTS OF GEE'S BEND' An ebullient exhibition (organized by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and now at the Whitney), in the unlikely guise of a show of hand-stitched quilts from a remote, historically black community along the Alabama River. Imagine Matisse and Klee arising not from rarefied Europe, but from the caramel soil of the rural South.

9. 'WINOGRAND 1964' The photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed America in an old Ford Fairlane, creating a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of the country after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. A poor skeptic, Winogrand, whose show was at the International Center of Photography, clearly saw the fragility and the preciousness of what bound people together, and his pictures, though dark-humored, were full of heart.

10. IN MEMORIAM Larry Rivers, the irreverent, high-spirited, multifaceted, proto-Pop painter and self-mocking bad boy, died in August at 78. Roberto Matta, the last major Surrealist, who died in November in his early 90's, leaving behind automatic drawings and gelatinous landscapes filled with eerie organic shapes, influenced Pollock, Arshile Gorky and many others. J. Carter Brown died in June, at 67. A patrician populist, as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington he did as much as anyone to reshape American art museums during the second half of the 20th century. And John Brealey, the Met Museum paintings conservator, who cleaned Velazquez's "Meninas," died in December. He did much for the museum, his profession and art.

Changes Where It Matters Most: At the Top

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
All the studies that have examined the challenges facing performing-arts institutions in recent years confirm what intuition would suggest: artistic leadership is everything. Only a strong artistic director can hone an institutional vision, present a dynamic persona to the public and energize audiences. The challenges are especially severe as those institutions cope with the cataclysmic aftermath of Sept. 11 and the ailing economy. 
 Among classical music institutions, the major symphony orchestras have, with notable exceptions, been the biggest drags on innovation. So the most significant story of 2002 was the arrival of new music directors at several major orchestras. 
 The most contentious change took place at the New York Philharmonic with the coming of Lorin Maazel. The board surely knew what it was getting when it appointed this prickly 72-year-old maestro: a top-down, old-school conductor, undeniably accomplished, technically incomparable yet prone to willful, micromanaged performances. It's amazing that Mr. Maazel has put his stamp on the Philharmonic so quickly. The orchestra is playing with sleek technical command, burnished sound and awesome control, but at a cost to spontaneity and imagination.
So far, Mr. Maazel has proved a curt, aloof public figure. In the face of calls for innovation and freshness, he and his board act as if only they understood the weighty responsibility of carrying on the Philharmonic's heritage. That the musicians, by and large, pushed for his appointment seems inexplicable. But it's still early, and perhaps their judgment will prove right.
It's hard not to compare the changeover in New York with that at the Berlin Philharmonic, which this year welcomed Simon Rattle, 47, as its new director. Talk about a heritage: the Berlin Philharmonic's is as venerated as they come. Yet the players, especially the many younger ones recruited in recent years, seem excited and empowered by their new conductor and his vision of taking a fresh approach to the standard repertory, embracing neglected 20th-century works and making the orchestra a haven for living composers.
To assess the change James Levine will bring to the Boston Symphony, we'll have to wait a bit, for his tenure does not begin until 2004. Things had long gone stale under Seiji Ozawa, and the orchestra showed great resolve in recruiting Mr. Levine. They wanted him; he wanted them. But with no intention of leaving the Metropolitan Opera and with two years remaining on his Munich Philharmonic contract, Mr. Levine was not free. So the orchestra boldly decided to punt for two seasons, bring in strong guest conductors and appoint Mr. Levine music director designate. Even in this provisional role, he is shaking things up. Though Mr. Ozawa was a famously clueless programmer, Mr. Levine, from all reports, already has enough ideas to fill five or six seasons.
In another important change, Franz Welser-Most took over the mighty Cleveland Orchestra from the towering Christoph von Dohnanyi. Mr. Welser-Most, a 42-year-old Austrian, is a bit of an unknown. Highly skilled and deeply principled, he is an unassuming figure. Yet in his own modest way he has staked a course and reached out to the Cleveland community. Time will tell.
But with budget crises and competition for audiences, there is not much time for the new music directors to deliver. How they fare will probably be the story of 2003.

A Rental Project Brings Elderly Strangers Together

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
THE idea of the elderly sharing an apartment with someone they have never met is not new. It is especially popular in the South and in cities, where older people with limited incomes are looking to share costs and companionship, say real estate professionals who specialize in working with the elderly. 
 But on Long Island, they say, in spite of a need for affordable housing for those 55 and over, the concept has not taken off, with the exception of some assisted-living facilities. 
 While builders remain skeptical about whether shared housing works, citing concerns about compatibility, at least one group is introducing it in central Nassau: a new 33-unit affordable rental building for people 55 and over in the town of North Hempstead, called Apex Senior Citizen Housing, will contain five units to be shared by two unrelated tenants.
"Sharing an apartment is not just for the economic aspect, but it allows seniors to be independent longer, by replacing loneliness with physical and emotional support," said Howard B. Kimmel, the founder and president of the nonprofit Anna and Philip Kimmel Foundation, which is building the $7.5 million project. 
The issue of compatibility will be handled by an on-site superintendent and regular visits by religious and social service groups, he said.
"The concept of shared living is not a new idea, but it is new for the rental community and Long Island," said Fern Karhu, manager of Prudential Long Island Realty's Syosset office. Ms. Karhu and Bart Cafarella, a senior regional manager for Prudential, are hosts of a radio program, "Seniors on the Move," which focuses on living options on Long Island for people over 55. The program is heard on Mondays at 7 p.m. on WLIE-AM (540).
"About 60 percent of the increasing number of seniors we see are alone," Ms. Karhu said. "They don't have the equity to buy affordable housing and they go to rentals. They would benefit from shared housing, but that will always be a very limited market. People want to remain independent." She noted, too, that every new development, especially rentals, provoked fears about property values. 
According to the United States census, the number of people living on Long Island rose to 2.3 million people from 1.7 million between 1990 and 2000. Of the 2000 population, 42 percent were over 55, a 25 percent increase since 1990.
There are 182 legal rental buildings in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, according to a recent study by the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group based in Hauppauge. Most of the renters spend up to 50 percent of their total income for rent, which is beyond the 35 percent recommended by the federal government, said Jim Morgo, the president. "The median rental on Long Island is now $1,200 for a one-bedroom apartment," he said. 
"The concept of shared living is a good one, and Apex is the kind of thing we need," he said, noting that while there were some small groups with home-share programs, there were not many. 
While two low-income rental projects for those 55 and over are currently being built by the Garden City-based Benjamin Development Company, there are no shared units, said Russell Mohr, director of sales and leasing. "We aren't familiar enough with the concept to consider it now," he said.
In Suffolk, Benjamin is converting the 170,000-square-foot, seven-floor administration building of the former Central Islip Psychiatric Center into 153 affordable rental units. Financing for the $26 million project, called Court Plaza, is through the state, with $15 million through the town's Industrial Development Agency and a $6 million tax credit equity.
Applicants must have an income below 60 percent of the area's median, which is $66,400 for a family of two and $83,000 for a family of four. Rents, which include heat, range from $900 for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,050 for two bedrooms. All units can be adapted for the handicapped and Benjamin expects tenants to take occupancy in April.
Farther east, Benjamin is building Medford Landing, four buildings with a total of 112 affordable rental units. Rents range from $815 for a one-bedroom unit to $1,095 for two. 
The New York City-based Sterling Glen Communities, which has built five rental apartment buildings for older people on Long Island, has not included any shared units, said Michael Daly, the president.
"We don't find a desire for shared units in independent living on Long Island except maybe with sisters or a relative," he said. "We could do it if the market tells us."
BUT, he said, Sterling Glen's parent company, Forest City Enterprises, a publicly traded real estate company based in Cleveland, has built 60 shared-living units for people 55 and over in a 320-unit complex in Florida. The shared units have two bedrooms on either side of a common living room and kitchen. "It's an economy-driven issue and there people share," Mr. Daly said. "But it comes with unusual rules to prevent conflicts, such as not permitting televisions in the common area."
"One of the challenges is to get people to know each other and to like each other," he said. "It's like going to college for the first year." 
Apex is the first building being constructed by the Kimmel Foundation, which was formed in 1995 to build housing for those with low income and special needs, according to Mr. Kimmel, who was the administrator of the State Division of Housing Community Renewal for 40 years. The foundation is named after his parents. Those eligible to live at Apex must have an income below 49 percent of the area's median. 
There are 27 600-square-foot, one-bedroom units ranging in rent from $565 to $710 a month, not including utilities. 
In addition, the four-story building has five 950-square-foot two-bedroom units that would be shared by two unrelated people paying $410 each. These units have two bedrooms, each with a bathroom and a door that locks. There is a common area, including a dining room, living room and kitchen with two refrigerators. A sixth, two-bedroom, unit will be occupied by the building superintendent. All units are adaptable for the handicapped. 
The Family and Children's Association, a social service agency, and the Rev. John Mulryan, the foundation's executive director and the rector at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Great Neck. are selecting the tenants, and screening and matching those for the shared units. They will have offices on the premises to be available to solve problems. 
Financing for the project has come from state and federal funds, including $1.1 million through the state Housing Trust Fund and $5 million in low-income housing tax credits dispensed through Key Bank and Verizon. Occupancy is expected by February. 
Apex is being built in New Cassel, a one-mile-square community of 13,000 people within the town of North Hempstead. It is in an area off Union Avenue that has been designated by the town for urban renewal.
Across Union Avenue is the incorporated village of Westbury, where "there was initial skepticism over the project," Mr. Kimmel said. After two years of meetings with the community, "it was finally accepted as a good thing," he said.
Mannie Sweat, president of the Central Westbury Civic Association, which represents 200 homeowners, said: "At first there were concerns about the need for the place, our property values, how it would be built, and the selection and safety of the tenants. Now we congratulate Mr. Kimmel and the foundation to have the foresight to see the needs of the seniors." 
The association, Mr. Kimmel said. "held us to high standards" and several architectural aspects were changed to satisfy it. These included placing a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence around the property for security, according to the building's designer, Lloyd Goldfarb, a Great Neck architect. 
The town has given $450,000 toward the project, and will probably give $50,000 more, from its annual allotment of $1.5 million in federal money for urban renewal, said Neville Mullings, executive director of the Community Development Agency. 
"We have supported the foundation because it is a significant contribution to the renewal project and for senior housing, which is desperately needed," he said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Bridgewater, N.J.; 
Where the Downtown Is a Shopping Mall

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
IN an understated way, Mayor James T. Dowden calls the Bridgewater Commons Mall "our downtown with a roof over it." But there is little common about the upscale 900,000-square-foot mall, anchored by Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor and Macy's. It dominates the retail industry in Somerset County, N.J., and has given the 32.7-square-mile township an enviable tax base, traffic that snarls its roads during rush hours and major shopping days -- and an identity.
 "Back in the 1960's, before the mall was planned, we were fighting the United States Postal Service for our own ZIP code," the mayor said. "The mall has given us exposure." 
 Framed by the intersections of Interstate 287 and Routes 22, 202 and 206, the mall, completed in 1988 after 20 years of debate and legal wrangling that reached the New Jersey Supreme Court, is the centerpiece of a 140-acre tract that realtors call the Golden Triangle. It is surrounded by a 347-room Marriott Hotel and more than 300 office buildings that are occupied by many leading high technology and pharmaceutical companies. Among the companies in its Class A office space are Johnson & Johnson, AT&T and Aventis, a pharmaceutical giant that rents a dozen large buildings and has its headquarters in the township. 
"Our highways are our blessing," said Ranald C. Brown, a broker at Golden Key Realty on Washington Valley Road. 
Indeed, the development of Bridgewater from an agricultural backwater into a commercial powerhouse parallels the construction of its highway system. In 1960, its population stood at 15,789. A decade later, the population had virtually doubled to 30,325, after the construction of the 67.5-mile-long Interstate 287, a four- to eight-lane beltway that starts at the Outerbridge Crossing and loops through central, western and northern New Jersey, connecting up with the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and many other large highways. It eventually links with the New York State Thruway. By 1990, after the completion of Interstate 78, which slices across the northwestern corner of Bridgewater and links Newark with Harrisburg, Pa., the population had swelled to 37,455. 
"In half an hour, I can be in Newark Airport or New York City; we are 20 minutes from New Hope, 40 minutes from the beach and less than an hour from skiing," said Onofrio R. Cirianni, a self-employed securities broker who had his four-bedroom colonial built on a half-acre lot and moved in from neighboring Raritan Borough a year ago. "Yes, the mall and the office buildings also bring us traffic. But they keep our taxes reasonable when communities without these ratables are getting crushed."
Mr. Cirianni says he tries to time his appointments to take advantage of the highways while avoiding rush-hour backups. "Traffic is a matter of timing," he said. "Besides, you can't have the convenience of the mall, the people you need in order to do business and no traffic." 
The tax rate in Bridgewater is $1.83 per $100 of assessed valuation, the fourth lowest of the 21 municipalities in Somerset County. According to the township's tax assessor, Anthony Dirado, commercial property shoulders one-fourth of the tax burden, giving relief to home owners. The largest taxpayer is the mall, valued at more that $217 million, which pays $4 million annually.
Despite the mall's high profile, retail space occupies only 2 percent of the township's 32.7 square miles, with houses taking up close to 60 percent. The single family housing stock ranges from small bungalows in the Bradley Gardens and Finderne neighborhoods in the southwest, up to sprawling new 5,000-square-foot colonials on lots of an acre or more off Chimney Rock Road on the ridge of the Watchung Mountains.
Prices for single-family homes start about $175,000 for bungalows needing work, according to Mr. Brown. Mountaintop houses with 30-mile views into Hunterdon County to the south can go for upward of $1.4 million. In mid-December, 136 housing units were on the market, ranging from $106,000 for a one-bedroom condominium in the Morgan Lane complex in the southeastern corner of the township up to $1,059,990 for an 11-room brick colonial with a three-car garage on Presidents Drive in the northwestern section. 
The lowest priced single-family home on the market was a three-bedroom 1950's ranch listed at $214,000 on Pine Street in Bradley Gardens. In the same area, developers have been buying up small, run-down houses, knocking them down and building four-bedroom colonials that sell for about $400,000.
Although the housing market has slowed since its peak in July, Mr. Brown said, houses sell in an average of 24 days, fetching more than 98 percent of their asking prices.
The most prevalent houses are 1960's colonials, splits and ranches on lots of three-quarters of an acre to one acre on streets like Papen or Buxton Roads in the Washington Valley Estates section in the northern part of the township, just east of I-287. According to Mr. Brown, three-bedroom Washington Valley homes start about $400,000 and rise with the improvements made by homeowners.
THE township also has more than a dozen condominium apartment and town house complexes, mainly in the southwestern section of town. Most were built since 1985 to comply with the New Jersey Supreme Court's Mount Laurel decision of 1975, obligating all municipalities to provide their fair share of affordable housing. For each "Mount Laurel unit" built, developers were allowed to construct four market-rate units. Since Bridgewater's allotment was set at 1,468 affordable housing units, the Mount Laurel decision led to the construction of 7,340 new homes, mainly condominium apartments and town houses and high-density single-family housing. 
Condominiums range in price from about $105,000 for some small one-bedroom apartments in the Morgan Lane complex, up to about $425,000 for some luxury three-bedroom units in the Loft Farms complex on the Watchung Mountains, off Chimney Rock Road near Route 78. 
Among the newer residents, Mr. Cirianni said that he and his wife, Rita, were drawn by the 8,550 Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District, which the township shares with the 6,000-resident borough to its south. They both grew up in Raritan and graduated from the Bridgewater-Raritan Regional High School. "We have four children, ages 2 through 9," Mr. Cirianni said. "We had a great experience and still have friends and family in Raritan. But we wanted a larger piece of property than we could get in Raritan. So we looked in Bridgewater."
The Bridgewater-Raritan district has six K-3 primary schools, two intermediate schools for Grades 4 and 5, a middle school for Grades 6 to 8 and the 1,994-student Bridgewater-Raritan Regional High School. All are in Bridgewater itself except for a single primary school. Average class sizes throughout the district range from 19.2 to 23.2, compared with a state average of 20.8.
The high school occupies a 120-acre campus and has its own closed circuit television studio that is linked to the local cable system, allowing high school programs to be broadcast into homes.
In 1998, the high school was named a New Jersey Star School, the highest distinction awarded by the state Department of Education. Two years later, it was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education.
On the SAT reasoning test, Bridgewater-Raritan students consistently surpass the state average. On last year's tests, the students had a combined verbal and mathematics score of 1,093, more than 80 points above the state average. Last year's graduates included eight National Merit Scholarship finalists and eight semifinalists.
Of the 477-student graduating class, 69 percent went on to four-year colleges and 20 percent are attending two-year colleges. The high school offers 26 Advanced Placement courses in the sciences, computers, economics, English, history, foreign languages, politics, mathematics, music, statistics and psychology.
ACCORDING to the interim superintendent of schools, Frank J. Severage, enrollment is growing by 300 to 400 students annually, mainly because of construction of town houses and high density single-family homes. In March, the district will propose a referendum on the construction of another elementary school in Bridgewater, which would cost local taxpayers up to $24 million. 
"We are seeing many more young families," Mr. Severage said. "Our graduating classes are in the 400-student range and our lower grades have 700 students, so we have to prepare for the increase."
About one-quarter of the township, 5,200 acres, is public and open space, according to Mayor Dowden. This includes five Somerset County parks, with the 600-acre Washington Valley Park off Millers Lane the largest. The most widely used county parks are the 332-acre Duke Island, which has bike trails, two softball fields, several fishing spots and picnic grounds, and the 170-acre North Branch Park, where the County Parks Department is headquartered and where the annual county and 4-H fairs are held.
The county also operates the 18-hole 6,443-yard Green Knoll Golf Course off Garretson Road, near the mall. Greens fees for Somerset County residents are $14 on weekdays and $16 on weekends. Nonresident golfers pay twice those amounts. Besides the public course, Bridgewater has the private Raritan Valley Country Club, an 18-hole course off Route 22, near Bridgewater Commons.

They are part of the 20-acre Middle Brook Encampment, a park at the site of General George Washington's army camp during the summer of 1777 and the winter of 1778-79. The encampment, which is on the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places, was the spot where the Stars and Stripes first flew over United States troops in the year 1777 after being officially adopted by the Continental Congress. Washington valued the position because it controlled a strategic cut in the mountains, allowing him to obstruct the movement of British troops between New York and Philadelphia. The 13-star colonial flag is flown at the site, and each July 4, the Declaration of Independence is read there. Map of New Jersey highlights Bridgewater.

HEADLINE: A Big Eye to the Sky, Still Blindfolded 

BYLINE:  By ALLAN RICHTER 

DATELINE: STONY BROOK 

 BODY:
SUNY STONY BROOK'S six-ton, 10-foot telescope can survey galaxies far, far away, but it has traveled more miles cross-country in search of a permanent home than it has scanned in the heavens above Long Island.
 Deane Peterson, an astronomy professor at Stony Brook, has overseen the telescope's travels and witnessed the negotiations aimed at putting the device to use. The equipment had a home in Arizona but for more than a decade has been gathering dust in a basement on the Stony Brook campus. 
 "We're sort of used up at this point," Dr. Peterson said recently. "It's hard to count the number of direct initiatives we've taken and failed. We just don't know what to do with it next. You should probably talk to somebody who's a little more enthusiastic. I pretty much used up my energy on this project." 
The university bought the telescope from an English supplier for around $100,000 shortly after building its Earth and Space Science center in 1967. The school's capital spending plan called for kicking in another $150,000 or so to build an observatory on a piece of property it owned nearby in Old Field. But the project met stiff opposition from residents of the exclusive village.
"That was a period of time when there had been drug raids on campus by the Suffolk police," said Dr. Peterson, who joined SUNY Stony Brook in 1970. "Old Field residents were very upset by the possibility of being overrun by shaggy-haired, reefer-smoking undergraduates."
After Old Field put the kibosh on the project, the university hooked up with Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution to house the 24-inch telescope, measured by the diameter of its reflecting mirror, at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, south of Tucson, Ariz. SUNY Stony Brook, Harvard and the Smithsonian split the cost of erecting a building for the telescope, next to one that housed an existing 60-inch telescope. 
The Stony Brook telescope was in use at the Whipple Observatory for nearly 20 years. "It was there until about 1990," Dr. Peterson said. "Then Harvard and the Smithsonian decided they needed the site for a larger telescope, and that made sense to us, so we packed the thing up and brought it back east." 
Two university students drove the disassembled telescope to Poughkeepsie, where the university thought it had a new partner in Vassar College. But the deal fell through, and today the telescope sits in pieces on wooden pallets in a storeroom in the Earth and Space Science Building on the Stony Brook campus.
It is difficult to tell that the telescope is not a preoccupation for Dr. Peterson. A cork bulletin board with snapshots of the telescope's Arizona disassembly is tucked away behind a file cabinet near his fourth-floor office, but the professor pulls it out as if it were a daily lesson plan.
Dr. Peterson said he took the snapshots and kept notes to help in the reassembly process. "It took us about five hours to figure out how to take off one of the parts," he recounted. "As long as I'm alive it will go back together pretty simply."
A few years ago, the stars seemed to align for a reassembly when the university and the Town of Brookhaven discovered that they had a confluence of interests.
"I thought it would be nice if the town built a little observatory at one of our sites," said Chris Gamboni, an amateur astronomer and administrative assistant with the town's Office of Economic Development. "We would tell all our students and teachers that this was available. The town board fell in love with the idea."
But the town had budgeted for an observatory to house a smaller telescope. Installing the university's equipment would have meant spending about $200,000 for an observatory, more than twice the cost of the original plan. The deal unraveled last year.
Dr. Peterson had largely avoided erecting the telescope at the university. An existing observatory atop the Earth and Space Science Building holds a 14-inch telescope but is too small for the 24-incher. But with no alternatives, Dr. Peterson began warming to the idea of housing the telescope on campus.
Then this fall the university opened its new football stadium, flooding the area Dr. Peterson had in mind with evening light, the bane of people who peer at the heavens.
But the professor may not be down for the count. This month the Town of Riverhead adopted a "dark skies" resolution requiring shielded lighting on new residential and business developments. Ed Densieski, the town board member who sponsored the resolution, suggested that the Stony Brook telescope could have a home at the former Grumman property in Calverton and began playing matchmaker between Dr. Peterson and developers who are building a park on part of the site.
"I hadn't thought of that," the professor said, raising an eyebrow as if discovering some new nebula. "The old Grumman property -- well, there you go."

HEADLINE: State Has Become More Generous, but Still Lags the Nation 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY B. COHEN 

 BODY:
PHILIP H. LODEWICK said he is blessed in life -- his wife is his best friend, he is healthy, he has had a wealth of opportunity, and now he has the opportunity to share his wealth.
 "I don't consider any of it mine," said Mr. Lodewick, an independent businessman of 25 years, a philanthropist of roughly 12 years, chairman of the Board of Advisors for the University of Connecticut's Business School, and both a university graduate and donor. "More and more, people are understanding that bad financial planning is dying with more than $1,000." 
 When it comes to charitable giving, Connecticut has the uncomfortable task of living up to its reputation as the richest state in the nation. 
In the minds of many, bounty should equal charity, so in a state so bountiful, there should be more people like Philip Lodewick and charity should match. But it hasn't, although the state is improving.
Using the Internal Revenue Service's figures from the 2000 tax year, the most recent figures available, the Connecticut Council for Philanthropy found that the state ranked 17th in the nation in the amount of average contributions, at $3,740. And even though the state ranks first in per capita income, and has been No. 1 for years, 2000 was the first time since the council began compiling numbers in 1996 that the state managed to beat the national average for contributions, which in 2000 was $3,627.
Still, ranking 17th is a lot better than where the state was in 1995, when it ranked in the bottom third, in 36th place at $2,156. Back then, it also ranked 45th in average contributions for all taxpayers with an income greater than $200,000 who itemized their deductions, but jumped to 24th in 2000. But residents making between $100,000 to $200,000 came in at 49th in 2000, a ranking that hasn't changed since 1995.
"The first time we saw the numbers we were surprised we weren't in a better position compared to other states in the country," said Nancy P. Roberts, the council's president. "That contrast was important in getting attention to the issue" of the disparity between what residents earn and what they give. But I don't think people have been made aware that, hey, guys, we're doing better," she said. "More people are giving, and they're giving more."
Experts said they were confounded by the state's record on giving, many saying it is a question without an answer. But they pointed out that none of the New England states did well in the rankings and the explanation may be as simple as Yankee frugality. Among its New England neighbors, Connecticut shines, ranking first. Maine comes in last in New England and second to last in the nation in average contributions. New Hampshire ranks 46th, despite having the sixth highest per capita income among states.
"New England is never near the top," Ms. Roberts said.
The experts also point out that the states that rank the highest in average contribution are ones that tend to give to religions.
"If you look at the ones that are in the top five, they are states like Utah with groups that give very heavily to religious institutions in the Bible Belt and the middle of the country," Ms. Roberts said.
Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Tennessee are in the top five, but then there is the quandary of Washington. It finished second to Connecticut in the wealth ranking, having the second-highest per capita income in the nation. But unlike Connecticut, it ranks high in average contribution, also coming in second.
Elizabeth Miller, director of New Ventures at Washington Grantmakers, said that Washington also beats northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs on average annual contributions.
"I think there's a correlation between giving and volunteering, and in this region, almost everyone volunteers," she said. "Another reason may be that here, giving is sort of the thing to do. I think people feel they need to give back in a region with so much wealth and a tremendous amount of need."
Paul G. Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research Institute and professor in the Department of Sociology at Boston College, has been studying charitable giving trends for years and said the best explanation of Connecticut's ranking may have nothing to do with generosity.
He said linking giving to income without taking into account comparative figures such as cost of living, the cost of private education and taxes presents an incomplete and unhelpful picture geared toward shaming donors into giving.
"Hidden in a lot of this is, 'How come you're so damn rich and how come you're not giving more?' " he said. "I'm somewhat skeptical about the use of invidious comparisons to generate philanthropy."
That raises other caveats. Ms. Roberts said the numbers used in the rankings only include figures from returns where the taxpayer itemized deductions. So those who maxed-out their contributions or don't itemize are not included. Neither are numbers from family foundations.
That said, the numbers do serve the purpose of painting a relative picture over time, said George Bahamonde, president of the United Way of the Capitol Area in Hartford.
"Whether they're imperfect isn't the issue," Mr. Bahamonde said. "It's that they're consistent. It's the same measurement used five years ago, so you've got a relative measurement you can employ."
The numbers are also two years old. Figures for the 2001 tax year won't be available until next summer and for 2002 the summer after that. Charitable organizations said the weak stock market will have an affect on those figures.
"The economy has had a large impact on our fund-raising," said Brian Otis, director of development for the University of Connecticut School of Business. It's his job to focus on donors considering gifts larger than $500,000, gifts that have been harder to obtain.
"Donors who've made pledges of support with stock have had to give more shares, and that's caused individuals to re-evaluate their pledge schedules," Mr. Otis said.
Ms. Roberts is seeing the same trend. "There is a whole lot more benefit in giving when you have a highly appreciated stock, which a lot of people don't have right now," she said. "We're actually seeing people reneging on their pledges."
Joyce Perrett is the Salvation Army's community relations and development director for southern New England, and she has also found that major donors are giving less in stock gifts than they traditionally do at the end of the year. That makes life harder for the group's local volunteer units, some of which in Connecticut are getting just one-third of what they normally receive from their national organization.
The rest, Ms. Perrett said, must be made up in the holiday kettle drives.
"Places down south, for instance, don't have the same problems with kettles as we do," Ms. Perrett said, noting that it's easier to stand by a kettle in 50-degree weather than in sub-zero degree weather.
Michael R. Bangser is the executive director of the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, a community foundation that seeks donations for its endowment and which, in turn, awards annual grants within the community. His perspective allows him to see how economic downturns trickle down to the nonprofit sector, he said.
Take, for example, a typical nonprofit with four pots of money for revenue: individuals, foundations and corporations, government grants and contracts, and user fees and earned income.
"Every one of these pots has been hit at the same time," Mr. Bangser said, adding that compounding the problem is that demand for nonprofit services rises when economic times are bad.
It is important to note that individuals give the overwhelming majority -- more than 75 percent -- of gifts in the United States, Mr. Bangser added. "So it's really about individual giving and when you have a bad stock market and a difficult economy, the individual giving also tends to suffer," he said.
Nevertheless, in the experience of Mr. Bahamonde of the United Way, "people this year have continued to give at the same level or higher than they did in the past, even though probably the majority of the firms in the area have freezes in terms of pay increases."
Fred V. Carstensen, a professor of economics at UConn and director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, said charitable organizations in the state were becoming more aggressive about raising money, which he said is one reason the state's average contribution has risen.
"If people are never asked, or are not asked in a sophisticated way, they're not terribly likely to give," he said. "And I don't think we've been asked a whole lot in Connecticut historically.
"I think the numbers reflect the evolution of our philanthropic institutions," he said. "They're beginning to catch up with the rest of the country."

HEADLINE: A Way With Words, and Numbers, Too 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE underneath the folders as thick as phone books and the bulging binders there is a desk where Marc Ryan occasionally sits to crunch numbers. But not this day. On a recent Friday morning, the governor's budget chief was given the task of convincing the unions representing state employees to accept $100 million in contract concessions, a job so finesse-filled that even the normally adroit John G. Rowland stepped away from it.
 But Mr. Ryan shies away from little. Indeed, from his earliest academic career where he was one of a few sixth graders to study Russian to his years in a conservative Washington policy group and a stint writing newspaper editorials, if it's an uphill battle, sign him on. 
 Marc Scott Ryan is 38 and the secretary of the State of Connecticut Office of Policy and Management. O.P.M. is the governor's staff agency and is responsible for all aspects of policy, planning, budgeting and management of state government. Mr. Ryan is specifically in charge of the state's $13.5 billion budget (and its $500 million deficit.) He manages 180 employees. He is probably most recognizable as the person with enough documents tucked under his arm at press conferences to fill a foot-locker. His secretary cum den mother, Linda Buccino, brings him B.L.T.'s from the deli across from his office on Capitol Avenue in Hartford. She describes him as a year-round "workaholic" who spends two weeks in February at the office, literally.
"He sleeps here," she said with a maternal mixture of pride and concern. "He's a night owl."
Forthright is a good adjective to describe Mr. Ryan. Indeed, it is a trait he takes pride in. He is a former editorial writer for the Republican-American, the Waterbury newspaper where his conservative views caught the attention of that city's favorite son, John Rowland. He is self-described "lifelong student of the press," who reads some six newspapers a day. Access to Mr. Ryan is rarely a problem; he is free with his cell-phone number and returns calls, even at 10 at night.
William J. Cibes, the chancellor of the Connecticut State University System, who served as budget chief under Governor Lowell P. Weicker, described such access as a critical part of the job of budget chief.
"Marc is a master of the big picture as well as the details," Mr. Cibes said. "For many citizens, there is not much difference between a million and a billion except the first letter of each world. Marc is able to master -- and not just from the financial side -- an explanation of the budget."
But does preparing the state's budget take a full year?
"Pretty much," Mr. Ryan said with a sigh. "The budget has become all consuming now, particularly with the kind of problems we're having."
These problems include the aforementioned deficit and the fact that the state's $600 million rainy day fund, once considered invulnerable, was drained dry as the stock market plummeted in both 2000 and 2001. In retrospect, Mr. Ryan said the state should have put more into the fund than what the General Assembly required -- 5 percent of the total budget.
Connecticut is one of 45 states in the nation facing a deficit. Its $500 million shortfall is pocket change when compared to California's projected $25 billion. 
Yet Mr. Ryan forecasts doom, saying "This is the worst state fiscal crisis since right after World War II." And to the consternation of some Democrats, he has adamantly refused to exceed the state's spending cap except for one-time payouts.
Mr. Ryan is a native of Albany where his father, a Democratic ward leader, was a county budget chief and school administrator and his mother was a teacher. Mr. Ryan, an ardent Republican, admitted having voted for a Democrat before his conversion but it was Mario Cuomo, a relic of the party, and it was by absentee ballot.
His conversion took place at Georgetown University in the foreign-service school, where he fell under the spell of an unlikely pair: the Rev. Joseph Zrinyi, a Jesuit economics professor, and Ronald Reagan.
"I sort of fell in love with Ronald Reagan and that conservative revolution," he said. Mr. Ryan worked on the Reagan campaign, took courses in Poland as communism was leaching out of Eastern Europe (he speaks Polish and Russian) and worked on the Nicaraguan election of 1990.
Mr. Ryan worked from 1986 to 1990 for a few media and foreign policy think tanks, including Media Watch, a conservative think tank run by a nephew of William F. Buckley. It was in Washington that he honed his economic philosophy and politics.
"I believe in government programs if they're a good investment," he said.
It is a philosophy that pervades his budget, several people said. Senate Majority Leader George C. Jepsen, who was involved with Mr. Ryan through state budgets, described him as "a tough and shrewd negotiator" whose philosophy of anti government spending is unwavering.
"He's very, very bright and knows the budget top to bottom," said Mr. Jepsen, who will become the state Democratic Party Chairman when he steps down from the State Legislature on Jan. 8. "He's also very right wing -- an ideological crusader."
For the past eight years, Mr. Ryan has written a 100-page introduction to the governor's budget that is published each February, when it is presented to the Legislature. For this he squirrels up in his office and spends a seven to 10 days writing. 
Mr. Ryan, who is also a member of the board overseeing Waterbury's fiscal crisis, has worked in the Rowland administration from the beginning first as deputy press director. His talent for numbers and diplomacy skills soon surfaced and he joined the Office of Policy and Management almost eight years ago, rising through the ranks to budget chief.
"He's a sponge," Gov. Rowland said recently. "He can absorb complicated information like no one I've ever seen. The guy is extraordinarily talented. No one can question his capabilities."
Mr. Ryan is equally loyal to the Governor. "This guy has done more for me than you could ever imagine," he said. "He really made my career. I would never leave him in a crunch. It's just not the right thing to do."
About a year ago, Mr. Ryan moved his family from Waterbury to Haddam. He met his wife, the former Donna Breslin, at a Halloween party in his Washington days. (She was dressed as a bumblebee and he was the only guest not in costume.) They have three elementary school-aged children and their new house, he admits with a sheepish grin, was a bit of a financial stretch.
Mr. Ryan goes to his children's swim meets and devotes his weekend to family life (when not in negotiations). He is also a committed traveler, who takes a solo trip to Poland each year to "do some democracy building and free market building," and burnish his interest in the politics of the region. He also collects wine and model elephants of all varieties, "from the dollar store to the very, very expensive," including elephants pictured on ancient Greek and Roman coins.
He has had job offers from health care, entertainment and defense industries. He has assured his staff that he had no plans to leave. Yet he admits his future might be far from Connecticut, possibly developing free markets in Eastern Europe. With the state facing layoffs and a deficit expected to triple in 2003, is he in any hurry to go?
"No," he said, "I really think you make your mark as a budget director not in good times but in bad ones."

HEADLINE: Full Lives, Captured In Memory And Words 

BYLINE:  By Dick Ahles 

 BODY:
IN times past, tombstones often told the story of a life. 
This example comes from the book "Churchyard Literature," published in 1877:
 "Samuel Bishop, town clerk of New Haven, 54 years; its representative at 54 sessions of the general assembly, judge of the county and probate courts; died mayor of the city, and collector of the port, 7 August, 1803, aged 80." 
 And from a Litchfield cemetery come these words:
"Here lies the body of Mrs. Mary, wife of Deacon John Buel, Esq. She died Nov. 4, 1768, aged 90 -- having had 13 Children, 101 Grand-Children, 247 Great-Grand-Children, and 49 Great-Great-Grand-Children; total 410. 
Three Hundred and Thirty-six survived her."
But fashions change in death, as in life, and the inscriptions on gravestones today are much less likely to venture beyond the basics: name, date of birth, date of death. 
Yet for each life, the stories remain to be told, the memories recounted. At the end of each year, the Connecticut section tries to do just that, publishing a collection of obituaries about people who made a difference in the state. These vignettes, of those who died in the year 2002, were written by Dick Ahles.

A Familiar Voice
Bob Steele was on the radio for 66 years. He was hired by station WTIC in Hartford in 1936, shortly after coming to the city from California to announce motorcycle races at Bulkeley Stadium.
When the racing season ended, he applied for a job at the radio station, went through a rigorous audition and was hired for $35 a week.
Mr. Steele retired from daily broadcasting 55 years later, but continued to do his morning show on the first Saturday of each month in the spring, summer and fall. He broadcast his final program on Nov 2. 
Mr. Steele's morning show, which had a 48-year run on WTIC, was unlike any other. It was a leisurely paced, tightly formatted program with every segment and even the most minor features broadcast precisely at the same moment every day.
"When people listened to Bob, with the same things happening at the same time every morning, they got a sense that their morning was under control," said Arnold Dean, an associate of Mr. Steele for 37 years.
For many years, Mr. Steele had higher ratings than any other local broadcast in the United States. His plaque in the Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago says he broadcast to half a million people every day.
Mr. Steele sprinkled the show with corny jokes, the pronunciation of a word for the day, birthdays of listeners 80 and older, temperatures from other places, little stories of little significance he called "tiddlywinks" and music mostly from the 1920's to the big band era of the 1930's and 1940's. Listeners might hear Sir Harry Lauder singing "Roamin' in the Gloamin" from time to time and a march on Saturdays, but they would never hear rock 'n' roll.
On Fridays, Mr. Steele would announce his weight, in pounds and ounces and hardly a week went by without him reminding listeners of the proper way to prepare scrambled eggs. (You had to add a teaspoon of cottage cheese.)
He was known for predicting the outcome of sporting events, usually incorrectly. In the 1960's, when Mr. Steele dropped his evening sportscast, WTIC announced that he would continue to make sports predictions "as a public service."
As the host of the most listened to morning radio show in southern New England, Mr. Steele was the person families turned to during snowstorms to hear if the schools were being closed.
Mr. Steele died in his Wethersfield home on Dec. 6. He was 91. 
For several days after his death, WTIC received calls from hundreds of listeners who wanted to reminisce. One caller, after waiting on hold for an hour, said, "I was afraid I'd have to shave again."
That was Bob Steele's kind of joke.

A Major Contributor
For Samuel Birnbaum, the honorary degree he received from the University of Connecticut at age 84 was especially meaningful because his formal education had ended when he was 7 years old.
Sy Birnbaum left school in 1916 to help out in his father's little clothing store in New Britain.
He and his sister Ida took over the store when their father died in 1932 and did extremely well, so well that the Birnbaum family became major benefactors of New Britain General Hospital and the University of Connecticut's Health Center.
Mr. Birnbaum was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1993 in appreciation for his family's million-dollar contribution to advance treatment and research in the health center's psychiatry department.
He was also generous to New Britain General Hospital, establishing several scholarships at its school of nursing. In 1987, the hospital's emergency room was dedicated to him.
Mr. Birnbaum also supported the Central Connecticut Association for Retarded Children, New Britain Memorial Hospital, Resurrection House and the Jewish Association for Community Living in Hartford.
In 1991, Town and Country magazine included Mr. Birnbaum in its annual listing of major contributors to art, science, scholarship and the humanities.
Mr. Birnbaum died March 21. He was 93.

Striving to Educate
When Alvin Wood graduated from Howard University in the 1930's, he tried to get a job as a teacher in Hartford, but Fred D. Wish, the superintendent of schools, told him Hartford was not ready for a black school teacher and he went to work as a janitor at Aetna.
Three decades later, Alvin Wood became the principal of the Fred D. Wish Elementary School. He never commented on the incongruity of that appointment until his retirement party in 1978.
Hartford was finally ready to hire Mr. Wood as a teacher in 1954 and nine years later Mr. Wood became principal of the Clark Elementary School. In 1964, he moved to the Wish School, remaining there until he retired.
His contributions to public education were not limited to Hartford. Mr. Wood was a member of the board of trustees of the State University System for many years and its vice chairman for a decade.
Mr. Wood was born in Hartford and grew up in Bloomfield. Years later he became the town's first black councilman.
Mr. Wood died Jan. 11. He was 92.

Spy, Translator, Teacher
Before she was 21, Irene Szeliga had run afoul of two totalitarian regimes.
The granddaughter of an adviser to Czar Nicholas II, she was born in Kiev, Russia, to an officer in the czar's army and a Polish mother.
The family fled from the communists soon after Irene's birth and settled in Poznan, Poland, where she was studying to become a banker when the Nazis invaded the country in 1939.
A camp for prisoners was established in Poznan, and Irene and other young Polish women secretly made visits there to gather information from British prisoners for the Polish underground and British intelligence.
At one point, according to her son, George Szeliga of New Britain, she smuggled a camera into the camp so that prisoners could photograph construction sites where they were forced to work.
Her activities were disclosed to the Nazis by an underground member who had been captured and tortured and she and a sister were sent to a concentration camp in Germany. Her sister died in the camp and a brother was captured and shot.
After the Russians pushed the Germans out of Poland, Ms. Szeliga became a translator for the Russian army, and after the war, she used her ability to speak Polish, Russian, French and English to write subtitles for foreign movies.
Among the films she worked on was Gary Cooper's classic western "High Noon," translating the lyric, "Do not forsake me, oh my darling, on this, our wedding day" into Polish. She also wrote short stories, a play and a novel, all dealing with her wartime experiences.
She married briefly and gave birth to a son before they left Poland in 1962 for Connecticut where she had relatives. 
Shetaught Russian at Wesleyan University from 1965 to 1973 and at Trinity College from 1975 to 1979. She also taught at the University of Hartford and at Indiana University.
Ms. Szeliga died March 10. She was 84.

Promoter of Medicare
You could call Stewart Hamilton Medicare's first doctor.
Dr. Hamilton was president and executive director of Hartford Hospital from 1954 to 1976 and president of the American Hospital Association in the 1960's when Medicare was being debated in Congress.
His testimony was credited with helping the legislation's passage and he was present in the Oval Office when the Medicare bill was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. It was no coincidence that the nation's first Medicare reimbursement check was issued to Hartford Hospital in 1966.
The son of a physician who headed Detroit's Harper Hospital, Dr. Hamilton was educated at Williams College and the Harvard and Wayne State University Schools of Medicine. While at Harvard, he met and married his wife of more than 65 years, Amy Washburn, the daughter of a physician.
After two years as a general practitioner on Cape Cod, Dr. Hamilton turned to hospital administration and became assistant director of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
In 1942, Lt. Col. Hamilton was appointed head of the Mass General hospital unit that would be stationed first in Casablanca and then in Rome during World War II. After the war, he ran Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts before coming to Hartford. 
In 1961, a fire that started in one of Hartford Hospital's trash chutes killed 16 people. Reforms put in place by Dr. Hamilton as a result of the fire, including the elimination of trash chutes, became a model for the nation's hospitals. 
Although he retired from Hartford Hospital in 1976, Dr. Hamilton remained active in medicine for another decade, first as interim director of the John Dempsey Hospital and the University of Connecticut Health Center and later, as a member of its faculty.
Dr. Hamilton died July 29. He was 91.

A Priest, in War and Peace
Msgr. John Wodarski liked to tell about a visit that Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, made to the monsignor's large Polish American congregation at Holy Cross Church in New Britain in 1969.
One of the friends that the Polish cardinal made during that visit was Monsignor Wodarski's elderly mother whom he kissed on the cheek. Years later, Monsignor Wodarski was in the Vatican with a large group of clergy and lay people for an audience with the Pope. As John Paul entered the room, he spotted the monsignor in the sea of black clad pilgrims and called out, "How's your mother?"
John Wodarski was a priest for 71 years, a monsignor for 45 and pastor of Holy Cross for more than 30 years. He trained for the priesthood at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, St. Mary College in Michigan and the University of Fribourg in Switzerland where he was ordained in 1931. 
After serving as an assistant pastor in Bristol, Willimantic and Putnam, Father Wodarski joined the army in 1944 and become a chaplain with the 20th Armored Division. He was awarded the Bronze Star after combat in and around Munich, Germany and helped to liberate the Dachau concentration camp in April 1945. Among the camp's 33,000 inmates, Father Wodarski found 700 Polish priests whom he organized to provide physical and spiritual aid to thousands of Polish slave laborers in the region. 
After the war, Father Wodarski was director of youth for the Hartford Archdiocese and for many yeras, he ran the Archdiocesan Office of Radio and Television. He became pastor of Holy Cross in 1961 and held that post until his retirement in 1989.
Monsignor Wodarski died Oct. 12, the day before Holy Cross Church would observe the 75th anniversary of its founding. He was 97.

Charitable Through Golf
When only about 50 people showed up for the Greater Hartford Jaycees' Turtle Derby in 1951, the Jaycees conceded they had to find a better way to raise money for charity.
Thinking golf might be more profitable than tortoises, one Jaycee, Ed May Jr., invited the United States Open champion Ben Hogan to play an exhibition round in Hartford.
After Mr. Hogan declined, Mr. May and two associates decided to organize a tournament. The Professional Golfers Association liked the idea, offering Labor Day weekend in 1952 if the Jaycees could come up with a good golf course and a purse of $15,000.
The Wethersfield Country Club offered its course and Mr. May was named the tournament's co-chairman and given the responsibility of raising the purse. With his co-chairman, Harry Keefe Jr., he persuaded the city's insurance companies to provide seed money. The Insurance City Open was a success from the start.
Four years later, Mr. May was elected to Congress from Connecticut's First District, thanks to President Eisenhower's second-term landslide victory. But Mr. May was defeated two years later by Mim Daddario, a fellow Wesleyan alumnus. No Republican has represented the Hartford area district since then.
Mr. May, an insurance executive, was a founder of the company of May, Potter and Murphy Inc., which later merged with the insurance brokerage company Alexander & Alexander. Mr. May was the chairman when he retired in 1984.
Ed May was in the gallery when the golf tournament was played for the 50th time in the summer of 2001. Now known as the Greater Hartford Open, the purse has grown to $4 million in 2002.
Mr. May died Feb. 20. He was 77.

Presidential Presence
At a time when it was said a woman's place was in the home, Percy Maxim Lee had a place on prestigious national boards and commissions as the appointee of three presidents of the United States. 
She was also president of the Connecticut and United States League of Women Voters and a member of several key state commissions,
Ms. Lee was the daughter and granddaughter of inventors. Her grandfather, Sir Hiram S. Maxim, was the inventor of the machine gun that bears his name and her father, Hiram Percy Maxim, invented the Maxim gun silencer and the first electric car manufactured by the Pope-Hartford Automobile Company. Her father was also a ham-radio pioneer and founder of the American Radio Relay League.
Ms. Lee joined the League of Women Voters as a young wife and mother living in Farmington. She was the wife of the late John G. Lee, who would become director of research of United Aircraft, the corporation that became United Technologies, and a founder of the University of Hartford.
During World War II, about the time Ms. Lee became involved with the League, the Lees provided a home for the children of two Oxford University professors and a family of three that had escaped from Nazi Germany.
After being elected president of the Farmington League of Women Voters, Mrs. Lee became president of the Connecticut League in 1941 and the United States League in 1950, serving four terms until 1958.
In 1954, President Eisenhower named Ms. Lee liason between the public and the government's Foreign Operations Administration. President Kennedy appointed her to the Consumer Advisory Council in 1962 and President Johnson named her chairman of the Council and also appointed her to the Public Land Law Review Commission.
Governor John Dempsey appointed Ms. Lee to the Connecticut Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and the Clean Water Task Force. Gov.Ella Grasso chose her for the Judicial Review Council and she also served as president of the Farmington River Watershed Association and was a founder of the Farmington Land Trust.
Ms. Lee was also a founder of the Junior School, now the Renbrook School in West Hartford, a trustee of the Putney School in Vermont and a longtime vice chairman of the trustees of Connecticut College in New London. 
Ms. Lee died Nov. 9. She was 96.

A Manchester Dynasty
Jacob Cheney was "the last of the dynasty that built Manchester," according to a former mayor, Nathan Agostinelli.
The dynasty was founded in the 1830's by the eight Cheney brothers, who built a silk mill hat grew into the largest silk manufacturing company in the United States.
Jacob was the last Cheney to work in the family business, which left Manchester in the 1950's, part of the southern exodus of mills from eastern Connecticut.
At its peak, the Cheney Brothers Silk Mills employed 5,000 workers, many of whom lived in Cheneyville, the company's model community in South Manchester, which had a school, churches, country club, library, community hall, theater, firehouse and Victorian homes employees could rent.
Jake Cheney remained in Manchester after the company's dissolution and became a fixture on Main Street. In 1998, Mayor Agostinelli made Mr. Cheney an honorary marshal for the town's 175th birthday parade.
"He got all dressed up and he was so proud," Mr. Agostinelli said. "I think it was the highlight of his life."
Mr. Cheney was also known for his pencil sketches of the people who worked on Main Street, merchants, waitresses and others who treasured the pictures he made and presented to them.
Mr. Cheney died April 3. He was 92.

A Man About Town
They thought so highly of Frank Smith in Winsted, that the town once held a parade in his honor.
Mr. Smith was born in Winsted and lived there all his life. During that time, he was a fire chief, a selectman, president of the Winsted Historical Society and a head coach in the Midget Football League.
He was also a member of the zoning board of appeals, the water and sewer commission and the housing authority. When he was not doing something for Winsted, he operated his own construction company.
"His whole life was the community," said John Arcelaschi, a former mayor. "He was a no-nonsense man who said what he had to say."
Last year, the town dedicated its annual firefighter's parade to Mr. Smith and the housing authority named its literacy room in the Beardsley and Memorial Library for him.
Mr. Smith died Feb. 14. He was 67. 

Early Spotlight
Diane Nappier had her picture in the paper when she was only a day old. She merited the news coverage because on June 16, 1951 she and sisters Denise and Donna became the first triplets born in Hartford's Mount Sinai Hospital.
Diane would become an amateur tennis champion and a physical education teacher and coach at Suffield High School. Denise would be elected and re-elected Connecticut state treasurer and Donna would become deputy director of the Hartford Housing Authority.
Diane Nappier was first diagnosed with symptoms of leukemia seven years ago, but the disease went into remission after she received a bone marrow transplant from Denise and she was well enough to run in her first marathon 18 months later.
"My goal was not to walk," Ms. Nappier told friends. In October 1996, she finished the Greater Hartford Marathon in 4 hours 35 minutes 19 seconds.
Ms. Nappier regained her health after the transplant but a few years ago, she was told she had acute leukemia and received a second bone marrow transplant, this time from Donna. In July, Ms. Nappier was able to join family and friends in Hartford's Elizabeth Park to hear Denise Nappier announce her candidacy for re-election as state treasurer.
Ms. Nappier died Sept. 6. She was 51.

A Planner and a Prodigy
Henry Nozko Sr. was known to most Connecticut people for the television commercials he did with his son, Henry Jr., that appeared every Sunday on "60 Minutes" on behalf of Acmat, their building construction company.
The Nozkos's corporation, based in New Britain, has constructed building interiors throughout the United States, and the father and son reminded viewers every week that their interiors provided customers "more for less and on time."
One of Acmat's best-known projects was the interior of the John Hancock Building in Boston. The company also converted West Hartford's former Hall High School into the present Town Hall.
Mr. Nozko was first known as a piano prodigy, performing with the Boston Pops at age 9. During the 1930's, as a teenager, Mr. Nozko played with some of the country's major dance bands but he stopped when he married at 18.
In 1950, he founded the Acoustical Materials Company in a garage in Hartford's North End. The company grew into Acmat, whose elegant interiors produced gross revenues of $40 million by the 1980's. In the mid-1980's, the company faced bankruptcy after the cancellation of its liability insurance for removing asbestos.
Undaunted, Mr. Nozko sued the insurer and formed his own insurance company, Coastal Insurance Company. Acmat survived and thrived.
Mr. Nozko died Jan. 13. He was 82.

From Acting to Priesthood
The Rev. Robert McQueeney was a husband and a father before he became a Roman Catholic priest 20 years ago. He was also a decorated combat veteran of World War II, a stage, movie and television actor and a golf pro.
Father McQueeney was ordained at age 63 after studying for the priesthood at Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, one of only three seminaries in the United States that offers older men an opportunity to become priests.
Father McQueeney, a Bridgeport native, was a student at Columbia University when Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. He enlisted in the Army and served in the Pacific as an officer in an Engineer battalion.
After the war, he studied acting at the American Theater Wing and appeared on Broadway and in national tours of Helen Hayes's production of "Macbeth," in "Dial M for Murder" with Maurice Evans and in "Rain" with June Havoc.
In the early 1950's, he began a long career as a television actor, performing in such pioneering dramatic series as "Studio One" and popular programs like "Bonanza," "77 Sunset Strip," "Gunsmoke," "Perry Mason," "Wagon Train," "Marcus Welby" and many other shows. He also acted in soap operas and in several movies.
Acting was not always a lucrative profession, according to Father McQueeney's daughter, Kathleen Reynolds of Calabasas, Calif. "But he was a terrific golfer and for many years, he worked as a teaching pro between acting jobs," Ms. Reynolds said.
Father McQueeney decided to become a priest after the death of his wife, returning to Connecticut to study at Holy Apostles.
Father McQueeney died April 24. He was 83.

Tuskegee Mission
As the pilot of a P-51 Mustang fighter in World War II, Bertram Wilson shot down four Nazi fighters and received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters and the Bronze Star.
But despite his courage and skill as a fighter pilot and the lieutenant's bars he wore, there were enlisted men who refused to salute Mr. Wilson, a black officer in a segregated Army Air Corps.
He flew with one of World War II's most illustrious fighting units, the 332nd Fighter Group, better known as the "Tuskegee Airmen" for the town in Alabama where they were trained before being sent to North Africa.
Initially, the Tuskegee airmen had to deal with commanders who doubted their ability. They were given the chance to escort bombers on raids over enemy territory only after other escort squadrons had lost several bombers. The Tuskegee group, commanded by Col. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., did not lose a single bomber to enemy fighters. 
Mr. Wilson left the Army at the end of World War II but re-enlisted in the Air Force during the Korean War and served until his retirement in 1968. During his final years in the Air Force, Mr. Wilson, by then a lieutenant colonel, flew combat missions in Phantom jets over North Vietnam.
After his military service ended, Mr. Wilson was director of personnel at the University of Connecticut until he retired in 1979. After that, he served for nearly a decade as affirmative action officer for the State Department of Education.
In an interview two years ago, Mr. Wilson recalled the racism he experienced while serving his country in World War II.
"You were very much aware of the fact that in the States, you couldn't go into a bar and have a drink," he said. "You couldn't go into the officers' club, yet you still had your bars and wings like anybody else. We were very much aware of that, but what was the alternative? Your country is still your country."
Mr. Wilson died July 9 when he drowned in his pool at his home in Ashford. He was 80.
On Aug. 6, he was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.

Political Timing
John Gerardo liked to say that he became the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Connecticut in 1966 because he just happened to be in the building -- Hartford's Bushnell Memorial Hall -- when party leaders were looking for a running mate for E. Clayton Gengras.
The Gengras-Gerardo ticket lost to the incumbent governor, John Dempsey, and Mr. Gerardo returned to his home town of Torrington and the law practice he had established there after serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
Mr. Gerardo had first become involved in Republican party politics as a young man in Torrington and in the early 1950's, Gov. John Lodge, a Republican, made him a city court judge. 
In 1957, he was named clerk of the State House of Representatives and later became clerk of the Senate. His considerable knowledge of House and Senate rules also made Mr. Gerardo the unofficial parliamentarian of the General Assembly. He became the person both parties respected and relied upon to settle squabbles over rules and procedures.
In 1965, he was named clerk of the history-making Constitutional Convention that rewrote the state's 1818 Constitution and reapportioned the House and Senate. It was Mr. Gerardo's effective service to the Republican party and the state as the clerk of both Houses and the Constitutional Convention that led to his nomination as lieutenant governor, not his happening to be in the right hall at the right time.
Mr. Gerardo died Feb. 7. He was 80.

Big-League Credentials
Francis (Spec) Shea was just out of the Army and playing a little semipro baseball in Waterbury when the New York Yankees came to town for an exhibition game against his team in 1946.
The 25-year-old pitcher from nearby Naugatuck made a good first impression by shutting out the Yankees for eight innings. That feat earned him a Yankee contract.
After just a year in the minors, playing in the Pacific Coast League for Casey Stengel, Mr. Shea was called up to the Yankees where he more than lived up to the promise he had shown in that Waterbury exhibition game.
In his first year, Mr. Shea won 14 games and lost 5. He had a 3.07 earned run average, was the winning pitcher for the American League in the 1947 All-Star Game and helped the Yankees win the American League pennant for the first time since 1943.
During that season, Mr. Shea, known as Spec all his life because of his freckles, was given a second nickname, the Naugatuck Nugget, by the Yankees' legendary radio announcer, Mel Allen. 
The Yankees played the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1947 World Series. The team's manager, Bucky Harris, picked Mr. Shea to start the first game at Yankee Stadium and he beat a Dodgers team that included two future Hall of Famers, Jackie Robinson and PeeWee Reese. The score was 5 to 3.
Two days after his 27th birthday, Mr. Shea faced the Dodgers again in Game 5 at Ebbets Field. He won, 2-1, and drove in a run.
Mr. Shea volunteered to start the seventh and final game after only two days' rest but he was taken out in the second inning of a game the Yankees eventually won to take the Series.
In that era, only one rookie of the year award was given for both leagues and Jackie Robinson was the winner. But if they had an award for each league, as they do now, the Naugatuck Nugget would have received the American League award. He was second only to Mr. Robinson in the voting.
Mr. Shea would play seven more seasons, three with the Yankees and four as a Washington Senator, but a chronic neck injury prevented him from pitching as well as he did in 1947. He retired in 1955 at age 34 with a 56-46 career record and a career 3.80 e.r.a. Mr. Shea returned home after his career ended and became Naugatuck's director of parks and recreation. In 1983, he coached Robert Redford in the movie, "The Natural." He retired in 1989.
Mr. Shea died July 19. He was 81.

Spreading Good Cheer
Walter Suchodolski devoted his professional life to education and the Christmas season to being Santa Claus. For more than 30 years, Mr. Suchodolski was a teacher, coach, principal and administrator in the Stratford, Rocky Hill and Hartford public schools. 
After his retirement in 1977, Mr. Suchodolski, the possessor of an impressive and authentic white beard, became a department store Santa Claus. His site was the big downtown Hartford store, G. Fox & Company. There, the educator turned Santa could not resist imparting a lesson or two.
In an interview with The Wethersfield Post in 1988, Mr. Suchodolski explained how he would discuss things like finger painting with the younger children but "with the older ones, I comment on how tall they've grown since the last time. I ask how they are doing in school and we discuss fractions, addition and subtraction."
Mr. Suchodolski was Santa until G. Fox ended its 145-year run on Main Street and closed in 1992. Thereafter, he only donned his red suit for family parties and for the annual Christmas party for Hartford children at Cigna in Bloomfield. He did, however, continue to drive a car bearing a license plate that read "SANTA."
An honor graduate of New Britain State Teachers College, now Central Connecticut State University, Mr. Suchodolski was a star athlete in football, basketball and baseball. In 1996, he was inducted into the university's Sports Hall of Fame.
Mr. Suchodolski began teaching in Stratford, then moved to Rocky Hill where he spent 25 years as a teacher, coach and principal. In 1969, he became a special education supervisor in the Hartford schools.
Mr. Suchodolski was also a high school football referee for nearly 50 years, serving as time keeper when old age prevented him from taking a more active role in officiating. 
Mr. Suchodolski died April 13. He was 85.

'Go-to Guy' for Navy
When the first Seawolf submarines were being built at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, cracks developed in the welding of the special high-strength steel so the company and the Navy turned to Warren Mayott and, as expected, Mr. Mayott quickly solved the problem.
Mr. Mayott, Electric Boat's director of technical services, was considered one of the premier welding engineers and metallurgists in the country.
The company president, Michael W. Toner, said that during Mr. Mayott's more than 40 years at the shipyard, "the Navy wanted to hear what Warren had to say before they went forward with any recommendation. He became, over the years, the real 'go-to guy' for materials and metals joining."
Mr. Mayott was credited with developing the ultra-sonic testing of welds, which could be done while a ship was under construction. This procedure replaced the use of X-rays, a major improvement since construction to be halted because of Xrays radiation.
When the Trident and Los Angeles classes of submarines were being built, Mr. Mayott came up with a new, controlled welding program that reduced rejection rates for welded materials from 17 to 1 percent. 
"When Warren said, 'This is the answer,' " said John F. Shipway, the Electric Boat's vice president for full submarine support, "without exception, that was the path we always took. The fact that we have used the strongest steel in the world in our submarines in a cost-effective fashion is because of what Warren did for our Navy and our nation." 
Mr. Mayott, who had cancer, died Jan. 5. He was 62. 

Following a Cause
Carol Kimball was an environmentalist and naturalist, a writer and a fund-raiser for a variety of causes.
As a fund-raiser, Ms. Kimball held development positions at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Opera, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Connecticut Chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
As an environmentalist, she was a contributing author to the recently published "Tidelands of the Connecticut River: A Guide to Its Hidden Coves and Tributaries" and a frequent contributor on environmental issues to local newspapers.
She served as a docent at Connecticut College and was a director of the Lyme Land Conservation Trust.
Ms. Kimball also had a major role in merging her alma mater, Abbot Academy, with Phillips Academy Andover, a boys' prep school, in the 1970's. In 1974, she became the first woman on the Andover board of trustees.
Ms. Kimball died June 2. She was 67.

Perpetual Candidate
Louis Marietta ran for a lot of political offices but never won an election. That never mattered to him; it was the opportunity to campaign that he valued.
As a native and lifetime resident of New Britain, Mr. Marietta occasionally ran for mayor of the city, but he also once ran for mayor of Bristol as well.
As a candidate, Mr. Marietta was known for his use of a bullhorn to proclaim his often colorful and sometimes extraordinary positions. He once advocated televised executions and the use of an "electric sofa" to execute more than one criminal at a time.
Sometimes given less attention by the news media than he considered his due, Mr. Marietta engaged in a long feud with local television stations that declined to invite him to take part in debates when he ran for Congress on several occasions.
In his 1988 race against Congresswoman Nancy Johnson, Mr. Marietta threatened in a radio interview to hold the Congresswoman's staff hostage until he was included in a television debate between the major party candidates.
He later apologized and, as a way of making amends, said if Ms. Johnson ever needed blood, "I'd be the first to give it to her."
Mr. Marietta's last race was in 2000 against State Senator Thomas Bozek of New Britain, who has defeated Mr. Marietta in more elections than either of them could remember. Mr. Marietta rarely attracted more than a few hundred voters, getting, for example, 239 votes to Mr. Bozek's 12,143 in one contest in the 1990's.
Mr. Bozek had no hard feelings.
"He always had the best interests of the city at heart and was one of New Britain's institutions and an interesting character," Mr. Bozek said. "Maybe he didn't always make people happy, but he knew the issues and always had an opinion."
When not running for office, Mr. Marietta worked for many years as a laborer in the New Britain Water Department. A lifelong bachelor, his great love was politics, said Rose Kozuch of Kensington, a half-sister.
Mr. Marietta died May 18 of injuries he sustained in an auto accident in February. He was 81.

A Presence on the Court
Beatrice Healey Whaples was the captain of the University of Connecticut's women's basketball team in 1928, the year she received her degree in home economics and many decades before UConn women's basketball became a state passion.
Ms. Whaples lived much of her life near the UConn campus in Storrs, but she was also something of a world traveler, accompanying her husband, Randolph, to Sri Lanka, Cyprus and Uganda where he served with the United States Agency for International Development. 
Ms. Whaples died April 3. She was 96.

Filling the Air Waves
Tom Eaton began his career in news as a newspaper typesetter while in college. After college, Mr. Eaton joined Transradio Press, an early radio news service, and became news director of WTIC, Connecticut's only 50,000-watt radio station, in 1941 at age 24.
When WTIC was granted a television license for Channel 3 in 1957, Mr. Eaton was appointed news director of WTIC-TV as well. He ran both the radio and television news departments until the early 1970's.
Mr. Eaton was both a news manager and broadcaster, serving as the stations' principal political reporter and moderator of many radio and television interview programs.
He anchored live radio and television coverage of state political conventions, elections and state of the state addresses by every governor from Raymond Baldwin in the 1940's to Ella Grasso in the 1970's.
After his retirement, he was a broadcast consultant and put new television stations on the air in Virginia and Florida.
Mr. Eaton played a prominent role in broadcast journalism nationally, and in 1946 he was one of the founders of the industry's professional society, the Radio News Directors Association, now the Radio and Television News Directors Association.
Mr. Eaton died Oct. 16. He was 86.

Assisting the War Effort
Early in World War II, there was concern that some German fighter planes were faster than their American counterparts. That changed when Robert Murphy of the Wiremold Company in West Hartford came up with a carburetor adjustment that gave most American fighters an edge in speed, according to information in Wiremold's corporate archives.
Wiremold was founded by Mr. Murphy's father, D. Hayes Murphy, in 1900 and sold by the Murphy family a century later. Mr. Murphy and his brother John worked together at Wiremold for more than 60 years.
According to the Murphy family, Robert was the inside man and problem solver who ran the factory, while John was the outside man, handling sales and the office staff. 
Robert Murphy held 11 patents. He saw to it that Wiremold was among the first companies to adapt computers to business use, starting with the huge I.B.M. computers of the 1950's. He was also especially concerned about worker safety and developed procedures to cut accidents in metal stamping and other dangerous activities.
Under the Murphy brothers, Wiremold became one of the first businesses to adopt a profit-sharing plan and Mr. Murphy was said to have been proud of the company's productive relationship with the union that represented its factory workers.
Mr. Murphy died July 26. He was 87.

A Show of College Spirit
Hugh Campbell was the kind of alumnus that colleges cherish.
Mr. Campbell, a Hartford native, received all of his education in the city, graduating from Hartford Public High School, Trinity College and the Hartford College of Law.
He went to work for Phoenix Mutual in Hartford after law school and spent 40 years there, rising to vice president and head of the legal department before retiring in 1973.
After that, Mr. Campbell joined the Hartford law firm of Murtha, Cullina, Richter and Pinney. He was a leader in the insurance industry's bar, serving as chairman of the legal section of the American Life Convention and president of the Association of Life Insurance Counsel.
Mr. Campbell also found time for his alma mater, Trinity, where he was a member of Alpha Chi Rho and president for many years of the academic fraternity Phi Beta Kappa. He was a Trinity trustee for two terms and the national president of the Trinity College Alumni Association.
In 1957, the college awarded him its alumni medal and in 1976, he received its highest alumni honor, the Eigenbrodt Trophy.
Mr. Campbell also contributed to the greater Hartford community. He was a trustee of the Wadsworth Atheneum and a two-term president of its board. During his years as a trustee and president, the museum added 15 galleries, a conservator's studio, a library and offices for a curator and other administrators.
At the Hartford Public Library, he helped to build the Hartford Collection, which included books, monographs, old city records, pictures and other materials about the city. As a member of the Wethersfield board of finance in the 1950's, he was part of a group of community leaders who replaced Wethersfield's selectmen-town meeting form of government with a town manager.
Mr. Campbell died April 2. He was 91.

World of Fashion and Art
Lynne Lofting Mutrux first worked as a fashion magazine photographer and then as a designer of women's clothing for one of the nation's leading design houses. She later became an art educator and the author of children's books.
Ms. Mutrux was the daughter of Hugh Lofting, who wrote children's books about the Dr. Dolittle who could talk to the animals.
After studying art in Vienna, Ms. Mutrux worked as a photographer for Glamour magazine before joining the famous dress designer Lilly Dache. During her association with Ms. Dache, Ms. Mutrux designed dresses for the actresses Helen Hayes and Rosalind Russell.
In 1959, Ms. Mutrux began a third career as a teacher of art history at the Miss Thomas School for Girls in Rowayton and also served as the school's assistant headmistress. She taught art history at Fairfield University in the 1970's and contributed her extensive collection of art and architecture slides, known as the Mutrux Visual Resource Collection, to Fairfield. While teaching, she also wrote short stories and books for children. 
Ms. Mutrux died Aug. 4. She was 88.

Creating a Living Center
Frank Vilardi Jr. was a computer programmer who became a social worker after contracting AIDS.
Mr. Vilardi, who learned that he had AIDS 14 years ago, was the co-founder of the Living Center for those with AIDS in the Hartford area.
At the Living Center, AIDS patients could receive everything from food to the latest information on advances in the treatment of the disease.
"He wanted to help people," said Virginia Kriedel, a friend. "Even when he had AIDS and was fighting the battle, he still wanted to help people."
Paul Botticello, executive director of AIDS Project Hartford, called Mr. Vilardi "the heart and soul for the HIV-AIDS work done since the 1980's."
Mr. Vilardi died Jan. 25. He was 58.

A Way With News
When 20-year-old Melva Swartz was hired by The Hartford Courant after graduating from Colby Junior College in 1931, the few women employed there as reporters were assigned to the society section.
But the managing editor, John Reitmeyer, thought Ms. Swartz could do more so he assigned her to write obituaries, a job previously assigned to men.
She quickly moved on to other city desk duties and covered some of Hartford's big trials in the 1930's.
During the 1938 flood that left most of Hartford without electric power for days, she and her colleagues worked in the city room by candlelight so that The Courant could maintain its more than a century-old record of never having missed a day of publication.
In 1941, Miss Swartz married a Courant sportswriter, Bill Lee, and left journalism to devote her time to being Mrs. Lee and the mother of their four children.
She died Feb. 26. She was 90.

'Mr. Foundation'
Last August, an S.U.V. crashed head-on into the oldest home in Hartford, the 220-year-old Butler-McCook House. The vehicle came to a stop in the south parlor, causing severe damage to the recently restored building and its furnishings.
A few weeks later, Bill Hosley, the executive director of the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, which owns the house, received a call from John M. K. Davis.
"I can see you need help," Mr. Davis told Mr. Hosley, who added that he pledged one-quarter of the funds raised to date for the McCook House restoration.
There were many similar stories about Mr. Davis, whose long association with one of the city's leading philanthropies, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, caused him to be known as "Mr. Foundation."
Mr. Davis was a member of one of Hartford's founding families. He was descended from Thomas Lord, who came to Hartford in 1636 with the settlement's founder, Thomas Hooker. He was also descended from the Rev. Peter Bulkeley, the founder of Concord, Ma.; Theophilus Eaton, the first governor of the New Haven Colony; and Morgan Bulkeley, a governor and United States Senator.
Mr. Davis, a graduate of the Kent School and Yale, was associated with Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company, which later became Connecticut Printers Inc. for 43 years. He served as its president from 1952 to 1973, but was best known in the community for his civic and charitable activities.
He was a Hartford alderman in the 1930's, president of the Connecticut Historical Society and Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce and a director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Connecticut Historical Society and the Old State House Association.
James English, a former president of Trinity College and a longtime associate of Mr. Davis at the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, said Mr. Davis was "a very courteous, old-school kind of man, but on the other hand, he had a lively social conscience."
Mr. Davis died Nov. 28. He was 94.

Keeping an Eye on the River View

BYLINE:  By NED SULLIVAN; Ned Sullivan is president of Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit land preservation and environmental advocacy group.

 BODY:
GREAT things are happening along Westchester County's waterfront. Projects in communities from Yonkers to Sleepy Hollow and Peekskill are connecting people to the river and with recreational, residential and commercial projects that will invigorate local economies while improving the quality of life of residents.
 Westchester County has been a seedbed of environmental activism for almost 40 years -- since the day when a group of citizens gathered in a home in Irvington and vowed to fight a proposal to build a power plant on Storm King Mountain in the Hudson Highlands. A court eventually ruled that the citizens had legal standing to oppose the project in the famed "Scenic Hudson Decision," considered a defining moment in the modern environmental movement. 
 That concept of citizens' involvement in the decisions that affect their communities is alive and well throughout the Hudson Valley. In Yonkers citizens rose up in the 1980's to stop construction of six 38-story luxury condominium towers that would have blocked public access to the river and views of the Palisades for city residents. Now a new mixed-use project is under construction. Soon children and families will be able to stroll along a public esplanade, dine in restaurants and learn about the Hudson River at the Beczak Environmental Education Center, while low- and mid-rise town houses will be available for sale and rental.
In Irvington a contaminated industrial lumberyard has been converted to a public park and senior center adjacent to a commercial complex. This brownfield reclamation resulted from a joint effort of the village, county, state and the Scenic Hudson environmental group.
In Sleepy Hollow, General Motors and its development partner, Roseland Properties, have collaborated with the mayor and regional environmental and cultural organizations to design a progressive residential and commercial development. The project will protect river views and access while revitalizing this crucial 100-acre waterfront parcel. More than 40 public meetings have occurred in the last few years to gather public input on a development plan expected to set aside 25 to 33 acres of green space.
As the public awaits crucial details on the density of development and projected traffic impacts on Route 9, Roseland and GM have indicated they will remain open to citizen input throughout the permitting process.
An exception to this string of successful public-private collaborations is a project proposed for Ossining by Capelli Enterprises Inc. This massive nine-story monolithic structure would stretch 150 yards along the waterfront. Citizens decisively expressed their view of the initiative, voting out the entire slate of town board members who had pushed the project through the local approval process.
The New York State Department of State has the opportunity to stand up for local control and sound waterfront planning by rejecting modifications of the village's local waterfront redevelopment plan that are needed for the project to go forward. Gov. George E. Pataki and the Hudson Valley Greenway Council have been champions of thoughtful waterfront revitalization along our American Heritage River. The state should send the entire project back to the drawing board.

HEADLINE: Beyond Boughs of Holly: Some Approaches to Decorating Large Foyers 

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
AT this time of year, there is one particularly obvious answer to the question of how to decorate a two-story entry foyer: boughs of holly. But experienced hands at decorating such spaces say it is worth thinking twice.
 "Go with faux," advised Nancy Gallagher-Mancini, owner of Precious Petals Too, a florist shop in Fairfield, N.J. "That way you avoid one very large, very prickly cleanup job." 
 She recommends decorating a towering foyer with "something large and showy, yet simple." In large hotel foyers, or very tall entry foyers in clients' homes, she said, she usually tries to make the staircase the focal point, using artificial holly, pine or cedar garlands to add panache, or fake magnolia, "if the client can afford it.'
"Today, we are concentrating on the natural look, and working fresh fruit, such as apples or pears, into the garlands -- or else, artificial or beaded fruit," said Ms. Gallagher-Mancini. "A fresh garland smells nice, but, oh, the mess!"
She added another factor in favor of fake: "With the economy the way it is," she said, "this may be a good time to invest in something that looks natural, but you can use it year after year.'
Trish DiMugno of Kensington, Conn., who sells furniture for a living but is a decorator by avocation, keeps wrought-iron giraffes in her 24-foot-tall entry foyer, whatever the season.
"I absolutely love animals," Mrs. DiMugno said. "I got them at Pier 1, and they are my statement when someone walks in the door.'
Mrs. DiMugno created a "contemporary primitive" look for the foyer of the three-year-old home she and her husband, Jeffrey, designed together, and she decorated with earth tones.
"Holiday red and green are not my favorites," she said, "and none of our grandchildren are coming, so we didn't get out all the usual stuff. We hung a wreath, which looks wonderful with my furniture."
The Tarallos of Paramus, N.J., on the other hand, are deeply committed to ornamenting their foyer for holidays. "It's the whole motive of the house," Jeanette Tarallo said. 
"When they were building this development five years ago, we had to speak to the owner of the land, because he was particular about the design. We told him we needed a three-foot-deep ledge, with hardwood flooring on top, and electrical outlets, across the front wall of the foyer. "He asked us, 'What do you want that for?' "
"The holidays," Mrs. Tarallo said she replied.
Ample electrical outlets are critical to high-power decorating, the Tarallos said, and Ms. Gallagher-Mancini, the florist, agrees. "It's not safe to connect more than three strings of lights," she said she instructs foyer owners. "And you don't want to be stringing extension cords in your grand foyer.'
There is also the matter of achieving the required height. 
William Tarallo has ladders of various heights to permit him to perform various feats in the foyer. The 15-footer is for chandelier cleaning. The 8-foot ladder is for getting Mr. Tarallo on the ledge, where he can walk around and arrange Christmas decorations -- or Easter, or Halloween.
Between seasons, of course, ample storage space is critical.
"I'm a closet freak," Mrs. Tarallo said, "We had extra-large closets built in, and we have a basement bigger than Santa's workshop."

HEADLINE: Verizon Layoffs Leave 246 Worried 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
THEY are mostly men, mostly in their late 20's and early 30's. Some are new husbands, some are new fathers and others just got engaged. Their Christmas gift from their employer, Verizon: a pink slip.
 Verizon is firing 3,500 employees in New England, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania this month, said John Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, because of softening business and increasing competition. In New York State, more than 2,300 were laid off before Christmas, and in Westchester and Putnam Counties, 246 -- mainly technicians with the least seniority -- were asked to leave on Dec. 19. They reported to work in the morning, and instead of being dispatched to the field, were fired. 
 "It was surreal, like a dream," said Brian Beigert, a cable splicer who was laid off. "It's the American nightmare."
Mr. Beigert worked for Verizon for six years in the northwestern corner of Westchester. A father of two, Elizabeth, 23 months, and Jacob, 5 months, he had bought a Cape in Dutchess County and asked his wife, Heather, to stay home with the children. That plan is now in question. 
Mr. Beigert is most worried about the numbers: $1,200 a month for the mortgage, $356 for the car, $150 for car insurance, $200 for heating oil, $75 for electricity. And food, gasoline, water, garbage pickup. 
"It was the most unnerving thing that has happened to me," said Mr. Beigert, who made $63,000 a year in salary and $20,000 in overtime. He called his wife from the parking lot when he learned the news, and she wept on the phone, he said.
Mr. Beigert has put aside about $8,000 in savings. He figures he will be able to get $400 a week in unemployment benefits for the next six months. But what if he doesn't find a new job by then?
"And, Lord, a week before Chrismas?" Mrs. Beigert said. 
Mr. Bonomo said that the company has wanted to shed workers since September, but procrastination by the union representing New York's Verizon workers, the Communication Workers of America, delayed the layoff until December.
"A lot of the overtures we made to the union were not met with a fair response," Mr. Bonomo said.
The company has fired employees with the least seniority, complying with union rules. 
Verizon made a profit of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, excluding proceeds from the sales of some of its properties, the same as the third quarter last year. Fueling the anger of the laid-off and their families is the recent revelation of Verizon executives' compensation packages. A radio campaign by the union this month said that the company's chief executive, Ivan G. Seidenberg, made $56 million over four years from salary and cashed-in stock options.
Verizon would not confirm the figure, but the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show it to be correct.
Although talks of layoffs have been in the air for months, the actual pink slips still shocked many.
Robert G. Brubacher, a repairs technician, had planned to propose to his girlfriend of three years on Christmas, but that was scratched because he can no longer afford a diamond ring. Ron A. Fernandes, a newlywed, just bought a $250,000 house with a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. Now he wonders if he will have to move.
"I don't understand," said Mr. Fernandes, a cable specialty technician who worked in Ossining and Peekskill for five years. "There was so much work out there. They forced us to work overtime. I wouldn't have thought they'd be laying off people."
For Dan Woodason Sr., a third-generation worker for Verizon and its predecessors, Bell Atlantic and Nynex, who was not laid off, the ultimate insult came soon after his son was fired. Mr. Woodason's son, Dan Jr., a former repairs technician for Verizon, was let go on a Thursday. The father was assigned repair work that Saturday.
"They are forcing me, forcing me, to work," said Mr. Woodason, a special circuits technician, "to do a job that my son used to do and would be very happy doing. If I don't want to work on a Saturday, I am fired."
Mr. Bonomo said the layoffs were necessary to keep the company strong, but the process has also shaken many low-level managers, who dispatched the technicians every day and had to deliver the grim news those who were fired.
"I see these men every day for 12 hours a day, sometimes six or even seven days a week," said a Westchester dispatcher who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I see them more than I see my own family. You go to their weddings. They come to your wedding. I really felt sick in my stomach for having to do it. I hope I don't ever have to do it again."
Meanwhile, Mr. Beigert is trying to get back on his feet. Soon, the bills for the Christmas gifts will arrive, for Barbie dolls, toy cars and clothes. He chafes at idling at home and said he would take any job, even custodial work, to keep the house going. 
But he knows it will be hard to find a job that can match the one with Verizon. Already, he said, he missed the pay, the camaraderie and the satisfaction of working with his hands. Since Verizon controls telephone cables in the Northeast, he may have to move to find a comparable job.
"But I have my roots here," said Mr. Beigert, who grew up in Peekskill. "This is where I come from. I am a New Yorker, and I will do whatever I can to stay."

HEADLINE: REDEVELOPMENT; 
Renewal Comes, Renters Go

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH 

 BODY:
FRANCESCA MARONE had just returned home from Christmas shopping a few weeks ago when she opened a letter from her landlord and learned that she was being evicted. Ms. Marone, who has lived in an oceanfront apartment building on the Long Branch boardwalk for more than 10 years, put her purchases right back into their shopping bags.
 "All the Christmas stuff I bought I had to return," she said. "I have to watch my money now." 
 Ms. Marone and about 100 other tenants at the Seaview Towers have 18 months to find new places to live. The two six-story buildings on Ocean Avenue are slated for demolition, and the tenants attribute their displacement to a wave of development that has swept the shore town the last few years. 
"I can see improving the town," Ms. Marone said. "But to the point where you are driving people out, I just can't understand it."
Tenants at Seaview are among the latest middle- and low-income renters who are being pushed out of once-sagging Jersey Shore towns by new development and soaring property values.
"What is happening in Long Branch is happening in other towns as well," said Arnold Cohen, policy coordinator for the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, a group that advocates affordable housing.
"We want to have plans for redevelopment," he said, "but we do not want to forget about the people who have been living in these towns, or the people who need to have a place to live in the future."
Like other chronically depressed towns along the shore, Long Branch had its heyday decades ago.
Before the turn of the 20th century, it was considered a top beach resort, rivaling Newport for the affections of the vacationing rich. But as highways and airways connected cities with more favorable destinations, many of the crowded shore towns began to empty. In Long Branch, summer beach cottages sagged into year-round apartments. After a fire in 1987, the once-celebrated city pier stood as a burned-out hulk for nearly a decade. 
A few years ago, an aggressive state redevelopment push, a hot economy and an activist city government began to turn things around. The city established five redevelopment zones in the crumbling downtown area and negotiated for streamlined approval with state regulators. The boardwalk was cleaned up and refurbished, new businesses began to sprout along Broadway and the promenade, and three major housing and retail developments were lured into the oceanfront neighborhood.
Most of the big developments are still in the early stages, but city officials say they expect to see new buildings rising next spring, providing 700 condominiums and rentals.
"This is a massive renewal," said Robert W. Burchell, co-director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "They have done an amazing job. They have totally transformed the area."
Seaview Towers, two brick buildings constructed in 1955, stand just south of the oceanfront redevelopment zone. The buildings, well-maintained and popular with retired and working-class tenants, directly overlook the ocean and are just minutes from the Long Branch train station.
Kristen Moylen of Cronheim Management Services, which manages the towers, said the area's economic rebound was not the only factor behind the decision by the owner, Seaview Towers L.L.C., to demolish the apartment houses.
Although the towers are in good condition, she said, they would need expensive refitting to meet the demands of the current rental market. Neither building has air-conditioning, she said, and each is served by only one elevator.
Ms. Moylen said the owner had not announced plans for the site.
Mayor Adam Schneider, who has led the redevelopment in his 12 years in office, said he had heard about the planned demolition from a city employee who lived in the Seaview Towers. He said it was the type of economic activity that the city expected to ripple out from the redevelopment zones.
"I would be surprised if they do not come in with something much more upscale than what is there right now," he said.
Mr. Schneider said that some dislocation was inevitable in any redevelopment and that the city had tried to find new housing for people who have had to move. So far, he said, Long Branch has helped 300 people from the redevelopment zone find other places in town to live. 
"As Long Branch becomes a more desirable place to live and property values go up, rents are going up," he said. "We are going to have to figure out what we can do to help people who want to stay in Long Branch stay here."
The mayor said the redevelopment would not succeed if longtime residents thought there was no place for them in Long Branch. He said that helping the Seaview tenants find new housing could be difficult, but said it would be a priority for the city.
State planners have encouraged the development of urban areas, like Long Branch or New Brunswick, as ways to stop suburban sprawl. They say they are trying to do so without displacing people. 
"It is the classic dilemma of urban revitalization," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "Areas that have fallen on hard times become the source of affordable housing."
Mr. Hughes said that as renewal projects succeed, they inevitably encourage private investment and higher prices. Blaming landlords for renovating their buildings in order to raise rents would be counterproductive, he added.
"What has to happen is a realization that there are going to be people who are hurt in a revitalization and provide means of mitigating the problems that could arise," he said.
"One possible solution is generating affordable housing or having some portion of the new development set aside for affordable housing."
State planners say that is already in the works for the shore towns.
From 1998 to 2001, the state financed 16,500 units of affordable housing around the state. Governor McGreevey said last fall that he would finance 20,000 more units of low- and middle-income housing over the next four years, at a cost of $2.5 billion.
E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the Department of Community Affairs, said the state wanted to encourage development of areas like Long Branch without driving out the people who now live there.
"With redevelopment we can also provide affordable housing," he said.
Mr. Cohen, of the Housing and Community Development Network, noted the state's increase in spending on affordable housing but said it would still not meet the demand. 
"It is not one landlord's responsibility to do this," he said. "We live in a capitalist society. But that is why we have government, to provide for the common good. And not to have Long Branch become another town that everyone is priced out of."
That is the worry of many of the Seaview tenants.
Roberta Jacoubs, a retired office manager, doubts that she will find another apartment in town. The rent on the two-bedroom apartment that she has occupied for 12 years is less than $1,000 a month, and she said nearby apartment complexes charged well over $2,000.
"I would like to stay in Long Branch, but what option do we have?" she said. "We have to move, we have to look for a new place."

HEADLINE: McGreevey Seeks to Revamp Support for Poorest Schools 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
AFTER a year of conjecture about how Governor McGreevey might try to change the way the state's poorest school districts operate, the word is out. The shoe has dropped. Next month, lawyers representing the governor plan to ask the state Supreme Court to approve a shift in support for needy schools, not in the amount of support -- more than $3.5 billion last year -- but in how those schools allocate and spend it.
 The change would allow the schools to drop some programs and add others. The state says its goal is to have the schools place more emphasis on literacy in the early grades and on basic subjects like math, science and social studies. 
 "There is a necessity to focus on what works," Governor McGreevey said in an interview. "We need to understand that in an increasingly competitive economic climate, the education of our children in every community will be the single greatest determinant of our success." 
This is no small request. The governor is seeking to alter a series of decisions of the court itself dating to the early 1980's that fall under the general title of Abbott v. Burke.
The ground-breaking Abbott decision, widely considered of national importance, was one in which the court ruled, in 1997, that New Jersey had a constitutional responsibility to fill the gap in spending between the state's richest and poorest districts. Because the main source of local revenue for education, the property tax, made some districts rich and many others poor, the state had to give to the poor districts -- like Newark, Trenton and Camden -- and make them equal with the rich.
Although courts in many states have required increased aid for poor schools, none have reached as far as New Jersey's court in ordering direct parity.
"New Jersey was really the first state to successfully address this issue of school finance equalization," said Henry M. Levin, a professor of economics at Teachers College at Columbia University. 
The governor's request comes at an important time for school financing around the country. President Bush has asked the states to follow new guidelines stressing early childhood education and literacy in order to qualify for federal aid, at a time when the states are trying to redefine their own educational standards.
In New Jersey, tight state finances have led to fights over local school spending. And in the realm of state aid, some legislators are questioning one result of the Abbott decision -- that the 30 poorest districts now draw roughly half of all state aid provided for education. The other half is divided among 586 school districts.
The McGreevey request would alter some restrictions placed on districts that receive aid under the Abbott decision. The court ordered that the districts had to agree to adopt systems outlining day-to-day operations of their elementary schools, dealing with everything from technology in classrooms to social services. 
The problem, according to the McGreevey administration, is that the models, often adapted from plans for failing urban schools around the country, can be too restrictive, providing detailed staffing requirements and sometimes scripted lesson plans for teachers. And in many cases, the officials argue, the models have not worked. 
"Every school district has different needs," said James M. Davy, the governor's chief of operations. "You can't use a cookie-cutter approach to education. You have to look at each of the districts' needs and tailor the programs to meet those needs."
A N order that models be developed for middle schools and high schools was repealed last summer for one year. Now, if the court agrees to the McGreevey request, all schools would be allowed to opt out of the model programs and decide for themselves how to spend the aid they receive, based on need and results. The state would develop a way to monitor student performance in the poor districts as well as a way to monitor the entire Abbott funds program, trying to erase what critics say is a failure in knowing where the money goes.
Mr. Davy said the state had collected data indicating that the court-imposed plans have not produced the results that were expected. In some schools, he said, the plans have increased inefficiencies rather than making the schools more effective.
Officials plan to argue that the numbers show that some of the expense related to the court-mandated spending does not directly affect students. They say that several of the top performing Abbott school districts are in the bottom third in spending per pupil.
Moreover, the officials contend that the plans often require districts to hire support personnel who are not always needed to run the schools. In some cases, they said, districts have to pay for technology administrators for every elementary school and dropout prevention specialists. Others have been required to hire full-time people to make sure the schools are following the letter of the court-imposed plans.
Mr. Davy said some districts would prefer to share these administrators among a number of schools or to shift their responsibility to other workers. But they cannot do so under current rules. 
"Forget the fancy stuff," Mr. Davy said. "They may want to focus on ensuring that every third grader can read at grade level."
Defenders of the court-ordered programs argue that the state's claims are unfair and, in some cases, inaccurate.
Robert E. Slavin, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who designed one of the model plans, called Success for All, said it had produced demonstrable success in New Jersey schools.
"The schools that are using Success for All are making pretty substantial gains, and they are making better gains than the state as a whole," he said.
Dr. Slavin agreed with the state's desire to allow more flexibility for school districts. But he said New Jersey needed to ensure that schools that chose to move away from the models picked a new system "that has better evidence of effectiveness."
"The whole theory behind Abbott was simply that providing money to high-poverty schools was not sufficient," he said. "The money should be used for research-based programs that had a high likelihood of success."
Most of the Abbott schools that use Success for All seem happy with the program, Dr. Slavin said. He expects that few would choose to shift, because the programs are bringing good results and because the focus on early literacy is in line with the new guidelines from the state and federal governments.
The Abbott money "is there for a purpose," he said, "and it needs to be spent on something that makes sense for the kids."
Gordon MacInnes, the assistant education commissioner in charge of the Abbott school program, who was a state senator when the Abbott decision was issued, acknowledged that the court imposed the models at the request of the education commissioner at the time. But he said the department now believes the decision was wrong.
"The remedies they laid down reflected what was currently faddish in education," he said. "They came up with this idea that you could develop an off-the-shelf approach that a school could adopt and if they implemented it faithfully they could improve."
Mr. MacInnes also acknowledged that some schools have had success with the court-imposed models, and he said the administration did not want to force schools to drop the plans if they are working.
"We expect this to be a thoughtful process," he said. "There will only be a change if the school itself determines there should be a change."
David G. Sciarra, the executive director of the Education Law Center, which represents students in the Abbott districts, said the group did not plan to oppose the McGreevey proposal so long as the state requires the schools to adopt a practical alternative to models and gives them specific direction in spending. In fact, Mr. Sciarra said, his group opposed the imposition of the model school programs when the court ruled five years ago. 
"We opposed it at the time for the same reason the department is now moving away from it -- you can't mandate a one-size-fits-all approach," he said. "What happens is a bottom-up assessment -- how are kids doing in each school? -- and then design and improvement program that addresses the gaps."
In Jersey City, an Abbott district, Suzanne T. Mack, who has served on the school board for 12 years, said the models were imposed on the districts by the state. 
"The locals never got a chance to comment on the state's plan to begin with," she said. "This was something from the commissioner's office."
Ms. Mack said, however, that some grammar schools seemed to be doing well by using the models, at least so far.
"Whether we agree with it or not, there has not been enough time to tell," she said.
Supporters of the models argue that they have been successful in a number of schools. They also say that the models, some developed by leading universities, are backed by independent research.
W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, said models had been popular in some areas. But he said the key to any method was obtaining the cooperation of the local staff, rather than forcing a system on them.
"You can't force them to do anything because you cannot manage the logistics if they do not want to cooperate," he said.
Dr. Barnett said it could take several years to measure a program's effect.
In fact, some critics say the state Department of Education has very little idea of how effective spending has been in any Abbott school district. Mr. Sciarra said the state had only a rough idea of how financial aid translates into classroom programs and almost no idea of how effective the programs have been. 
"We don't have a database of how well students do in relation to what we do," Mr. MacInnes acknowledged. "We are trying to build a capacity to do that."
Mr. MacInnes said the state had taken steps to begin assessing all 30 Abbott districts. In October, the state notified the districts that they would be required to complete a detailed evaluation form describing their programs and their curriculum. The state expects to have evaluated by the reports by next summer. 
The state also plans to start using a database that will track the performance of all students in Abbott schools, starting with pre-schoolers. Education officials say that will allow them to focus on which programs are succeeding and failing in Abbott districts around the state.
"We want to be able to say here is what the objectives are," Mr. MacInnes said.
In line with new federal policy -- called No Child Left Behind -- the state objectives focus heavily on literacy and early education programs. The Department of Education wants elementary schools in the Abbott districts to provide programs that will increase reading scores in third-grade tests and to increase test scores in core curriculum areas like math and science.
"We want every student in the third grade to be reading at grade level," Mr. MacInnes said. "And we want students at every level to master these core standards."
Both the state's largest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, and the school superintendents association say they support the idea of offering more flexibility to the Abbott school districts.
"They want to keep the standards high but give the districts enough flexibility to implement their programs and probably save some money," said James H. Murphy, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators. "I am optimistic that will work out."
JAMES H. LYTLE, the superintendent in Trenton, said some schools in his district were showing good results using the model system, while others would be more likely to stop using models. Mr. Lytle was part of a working group that helped the McGreevey administration come up with its new proposal, and he said he supported greater flexibility, provided that the state continue to finance the schools at the current level.
"I am aware of the new guideline and supportive of it, with the idea that it not be used to decrease funding," he said. "That was a concern during the planning group meetings," he said, "and it was made clear that was not the intent."
Last year, the Abbott districts were expecting a $400 million increase, but the governor struck a deal with advocates for the Abbott schools and the Supreme Court to forgo that. But the state agreed to an additional $89 million that had already been committed to the districts and $140 million for pre-kindergarten programs.
Mr. Sciarra, who took a good deal of criticism from his own side for backing the deal, said he could not agree to another year of reduced financing for the Abbott districts.
"The Education Law Center has made it clear, on behalf of the students, we could not support that," he said.
It may be difficult to find enough money to go around. The governor is facing demands not only from the Abbott districts but also from school districts around the state. Last spring, because of a $6 billion deficit in the state's general budget, only the Abbott districts received any additional money over the previous year. As a result, many districts had to cut spending and ask for increases in local property taxes, which pay for most school expenses.
In one such district, the Matawan-Aberdeen regional school district, Bruce M. Quinn, the superintendent, points out that employee salaries and benefits rise every year, so programs must be cut when state aid does not increase. This year, he said, his district had to forgo several new hires and lease textbooks rather than buy them.
"We cut back on after-school activities, we eliminated some supplies," he said. "We used to have an aide in each kindergarten class, we are not going to have that anymore."
Legislators say middle-income districts like Mr. Quinn's are feeling the squeeze in educational funds. These districts are too wealthy to qualify for Abbott financing but not wealthy enough to absorb regular property tax increases.
"The governor and the legislature have not addressed this in a fundamental way for at least two and a half decades," said Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Flemington. 
Unless the state can find another way to pay for schools, or change the current formula, legislators like Mr. Lance say the cost will continue to be born by the property tax.
Senator John H. Adler, a Democrat from Cherry Hill, said he plans to introduce bills that will help school districts save money, but he said the state still needs to change the "structural catastrophe" of school financing.
"Abbott has absolutely the right philosophy of trying to equalize opportunity" for the relative few districts that qualify, Mr. Adler said. But, he added, "How do you accommodate the remaining 580 districts?"
Governor McGreevey said he does not plan to cut school aid in the forthcoming budget. The state is trying to find "other revenue sources" to increase the aid, he said, but declined to identify any of the potential sources.
Mr. Sciara and other Abbott supporters said the state might have to consider increasing the income tax to find money to pay for education. 
"The pot of state aid was substantially cut during the 90's through tax cuts that legislators of both parties supported," he said. "No politician wants to stand up and face it -- we do not have the revenues to do what needs to be done."

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
Ripken's Off the Roster, but Still in Baseball

BYLINE:  By GREGORY JORDAN 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
FOR Cal Ripken Jr. this off-season, curveballs are complex finance deals. Tricky grounders are design decisions he makes on his construction sites. The fastball at his eyes is the task of reviving baseball for a generation of children hooked on computer games and skateboards. And his big hit has been the purchase of a franchise that he has built into the Aberdeen Ironbirds, which had a sellout first season in his hometown, Aberdeen, Md.
 In his entrepreneurial first year of retirement, Mr. Ripken, 42, the former Baltimore Oriole with the record streak of 2,632 consecutive games, has shaped his name into a family-run corporation that one day could own a major league team. He manages Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill, the co-founder; his sister, Elly, the accountant for the Ironbirds; and a staff of 27. 
 The company, privately held, has not disclosed revenue or earnings, but it projects that its businesses -- stadium design, management consulting, youth baseball academies, minor league baseball ownership, apparel and merchandise, endorsements, books, videos and public speaking -- will all be profitable in the next year. 
While donating millions of dollars to youth baseball programs, Mr. Ripken has capitalized on his wealth, achievements and charisma to the point where he sees himself as a turnaround specialist for baseball, which has been struggling with faulty economics and declining popularity for many years. He will even promote baseball on Friday as grand marshal of the parade at the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., where Miami and Ohio State will battle for No. 1 -- in college football.
Some baseball insiders note that Mr. Ripken is building the company around his name -- a potentially hazardous practice in any business. Further, his growing role in youth baseball has created tensions with Little League Baseball, the 64-year-old federation of youth leagues, which historically has refused to align itself with any one star player.
Others say Mr. Ripken's goal of a baseball renaissance is noble but risky, considering that Major League Baseball attendance declined by 4.3 million last season from the previous year and that youth league enrollment declined by more than 100,000 in the last five years. 
"The game is struggling at all levels," said Fay Vincent, a former commissioner of Major League Baseball. "But Cal's enormously able and energetic. What he does can't be completely separated from what's going on in baseball generally, but with him there's hope. It's important for him to do well in order for baseball to come back."
MR. RIPKEN said he knew quite a bit about running a company just growing up in a baseball family, so the challenges faced by Ripken Baseball do not seem so daunting.
"We learned the game in a professional setting that included certain business insights," he said in a recent interview in a stone building that his company owns on the edge of horse country outside Baltimore. He referred often to the influence of his father, Cal Sr., a player, coach and teacher for 37 years who became the Orioles manager. He died in 1999.
"In the morning, Dad would always be pecking at the typewriter," Mr. Ripken said. "We knew that the business side was going on."
Mr. Ripken foreshadowed his career as a baseball businessman in 1994, when a 232-day players' strike crippled the game. He undertook a lead marketing role for the game, earning the unofficial title of baseball's ambassador because he would spend hours at stadiums around the country signing autographs. "I don't think anybody played a bigger role in the baseball recovery from that 1994 fiasco," Mr. Vincent said. "He almost did it by himself."
His breaking the mark for consecutive games is also credited with helping to bring baseball out of its poststrike malaise. Mr. Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 games on Sept. 6, 1995; the streak began on May 30, 1982, and ended at 2,632 games, on Sept. 20, 1998.
Mr. Ripken's agent, Ron Shapiro, a Baltimore lawyer who represents many athletes, said he recognized early in Mr. Ripken's career that he might seek business challenges after his playing days. "I came to realize that we had to do something different for Cal than for other clients -- create a business base from which he might operate," Mr. Shapiro said.
Their original plan was to focus on for-profit baseball youth academies and the nonprofit programs that encourage young players. But Mr. Ripken also wanted to own a minor league club based in Aberdeen, on the Chesapeake Bay and perhaps best known for the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, an Army testing center.
He invested $6 million of his money in the first phase of a 110-acre baseball complex that is home to the 6,100-seat Ironbirds stadium and his first baseball academy. Maryland and local governments provided an additional $12 million in financing. 
The project's $1 million second phase -- three youth baseball fields and a soccer field, all financed by Mr. Ripken -- will be completed this spring. Plans call for more youth fields, a hotel and conference center and the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation ballpark for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. There will also be stores and restaurants. 
Mr. Ripken said his main achievement last year was to make a success of the Ironbirds. He started by buying the Utica Blue Sox in New York for $3 million last January, moving the club to Aberdeen and renaming it. "Ironbirds" is a play on Mr. Ripken's nickname with the Orioles, Iron Man.
John Moag, chief executive of Moag & Company, a sports investment bank in Baltimore, said the Ironbirds probably earned at least $1.25 million the last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Mr. Moag called that a strong performance -- and better, obviously, than the bottom lines at many floundering major league teams. Ripken Baseball, he said, is "a diverse company that has enormous potential."
Most recently, Ripken Baseball introduced a consulting subsidiary, Ripken Management and Design, for municipalities and former big-league players who want to buy minor league clubs. The firm advises clients about how to create sports sites and organizations like the one in Aberdeen, and is negotiating to be the consultant for several municipalities, including Daytona Beach, Fla., and Evansville, Ind.
Christopher Flannery, a product development and marketing specialist from England whom Ripken Baseball hired as chief operating officer, said it had no investment partners but might as it expanded.
Mr. Ripken has financed the company partly from his income from endorsements for companies including Chevrolet, MBNA and Coca-Cola, and from fees for public speaking -- he earns $75,000 to $125,000 an engagement. Mr. Flannery would not quantify the endorsement value, saying a substantial part of it was in business-to-business barter.
With Bill Ripken, who was also a player for Baltimore and other teams, Cal Ripken plans to expand the Ripken youth academies. Last year, the first academy, which charges $400 to $575 for five days, drew 850 coaches and campers in four weeks of operation. Ripken Baseball plans to open 10-week camps at Aberdeen and other places around the country and intends to triple attendance in 2003.
The rapid expansion has demanded what Mr. Ripken calls an "absolute line" between Ripken Baseball and the youth and nonprofit commitments that he views as an obligation to his father and to baseball. The returns to Ripken Baseball created by Mr. Ripken's nonprofit activities are inevitable and could create some conflicts of interest.
"He'll have to be very careful with that tricky line," Mr. Vincent said. "But the word is noble. I think baseball needs more of him."
His focus on encouraging young people has, of course, been welcomed by many influential people in the sport besides Mr. Vincent. But Mr. Ripken's moves in the youth baseball world have not gone over universally well with Little League Baseball. 
The tension began in 1999, when the nonprofit Babe Ruth League renamed its age 5 to 12 division the Cal Ripken Division of Babe Ruth League Baseball, and Mr. Ripken reciprocated by helping to negotiate a television contract with Fox Sports to broadcast its championship games, setting up a competition for viewers. (Little League Baseball, which runs the Little League World Series, is broadcast on ABC.) Babe Ruth baseball will hold the Cal Ripken World Series next August in Aberdeen at the same time the Little League Baseball games are held in Williamsport, Pa.
Mr. Ripken and officials of Little League Baseball denied that there was competition. But Mr. Ripken said he thought that his strategy of branding and "rejuvenating fun" were the prescription for addressing the game's decline in popularity.
"We believe we can reverse this trend," he said. "It's clear that there are a lot more choices for kids. The game has gotten too serious all the way down. But we really believe the game is still the best asset."
MR. RIPKEN'S recent withdrawal from consideration to become general manager of the Orioles suggested that he is content, for now, to be a solitary entrepreneur.
But the advisory board of Ripken Baseball is an indicator that major league ownership is on the agenda. The board includes Mr. Shapiro and Stephen Bisciotti, a Baltimore businessman who is an owner of the Baltimore Ravens football team. Mr. Bisciotti and Mr. Ripken consult often, a relationship not dissimilar to that of Ted Leonsis, an owner of the Washington Wizards and Capitals, and another big investor in sports franchises, Michael Jordan.
Mr. Shapiro said that for now, Mr. Ripken's "focus is on baseball, and he certainly has dreams of ownership at the highest level, and I believe he will fulfill that."
Because of the success of the Ironbirds, Mr. Ripken said, he would at least consider ownership of another minor league club. "We're taking risks based on our abilities, and right now there's certain limitations in our manpower," he said. "Major league ownership is hard to factor from a business standpoint, but it's one of the dreams."

BYLINE:  By HOLLY HUBBARD PRESTON 

 BODY:
OTTIS BALLENGER, a retired neurosurgeon from Greenville, S.C., and his wife, Ann, recently returned from a 10-day cruise to five islands in the Caribbean. They got a chance to soak up the tropical climate, enjoy gourmet food and mingle with other retired couples. But the biggest draw, they said, was the professional investment advice they received on board.
 "The tourism part is really secondary now since many of the ports we are visiting we've seen before," said Dr. Ballenger, who has been on six ocean cruises with investment themes in as many years. 
 The Ballengers are part of a growing class of travelers known as "investment cruisers," often wealthy retirees who spend their days at sea mostly below deck discussing serious subjects like mutual funds, bonds and commodities with financial experts. In their case, the expert was Louis Rukeyser, the host of "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street" on CNBC. 
Mr. Rukeyser is considered a pioneer in seminars at sea, having been a host for them since 1998. Similar cruises, to name just a few, are offered by MorningstarAdvisor.com, Jim Lowell's Fidelity New Economy Investor, Forbes, and BusinessWeek, in a partnership with Standard & Poor's.
Eric Graves, the vice president of group sales for Crystal Cruises of Los Angeles, on whose ships many of these cruises take place, said the investment seminars attracted from 300 to 800 people a cruise, filling a significant portion of many ships, and represented "the fastest-growing segment of our group business."
"I can tell you that 10 years ago this investment cruise phenomenon didn't exist," Mr. Graves said.
Of course, part of the attraction is the chance to meet people like Mr. Rukeyser; Steve Forbes, the editor in chief of Forbes magazine; or Marshall Loeb, a CBS MarketWatch columnist. (Dr. Ballenger said he had sat next to Mr. Rukeyser at the blackjack table.) But cruise passengers say most of the investment lessons or stock tips come from the accompanying panel of experts, including independent professionals and senior-level business journalists.
"There is no one line of investment thought; I have seen so many of these financial people disagree with one another," said Marjorie North, a society columnist for The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Florida and a repeat customer of the Forbes Cruise for Investors. She said she and her husband, Bill Hirons, a former executive at DuPont, planned to take Ms. North's grown daughter, Christina, 30, a lawyer, on a Forbes investment cruise to Alaska in June.
"We think it is time she learned to invest," she said, "and these seminars are better than a book."
Ms. North says the investment cruises have helped make her more comfortable about investing in these rough economic times. The Ballengers, too, say they feel better equipped to handle market fluctuations, even though their portfolio, like those of many other investors, has suffered losses in recent years.
Investment cruises can provide benefits beyond stock tips and investing lessons. Passengers may qualify for group discounts of 25 percent or more off regular cabin rates, with prices starting at less than $5,000 a couple. The Ballengers said they paid about $13,000 for their Caribbean cruise and got a deluxe stateroom with a veranda that might otherwise have gone for more than $17,000. The trip left Fort Lauderdale the day after Thanksgiving.
To attend the seminar part of the cruise, they paid an additional $895. (At least one cruise organizer has waived such fees lately; cruise bookings in general have been down because of the weak economy and lingering fears of terrorism.)
A few investment cruisers may even be able to write off part of their trips on federal income tax returns, as they do for conventions and seminars held on land. But be forewarned: there are many restrictions. According to the Internal Revenue Service, each taxpayer can deduct up to $2,000 of investment cruise expenses in a calendar year, but only if the cruise seminar relates directly to his trade or business. The law also mandates that cruise ships visit only United States ports and that they sail under an American flag. (Ordinary investors like the Ballengers generally do not qualify for such deductions; those who think they may should contact a tax professional.)
Charles Githler, founder and chairman of InterShow in Sarasota, Fla., which organizes many investment cruises, said that several repeat passengers on InterShow investment cruises reported being able to deduct all or part of the cruise costs by tying them to their business. Likewise, he said, he knew of customers who managed large family investment accounts or trusts and could write off a portion of the trip.
The seminar-at-sea concept appeals not only to information-hungry investors but also to the financial advisers themselves. The T. Rowe Price Group, based in Baltimore, has been setting up investment cruises for its mutual fund clients since the late 1990's. "Since we are a no-load mutual fund company, we don't get a lot of chances to speak to people face to face," said Steve Norwitz, a company spokesman.
IN October, T. Rowe Price took a small group of investors on a fall foliage trip up the Eastern Seaboard for nine days. The cruise was organized by Continuing Education Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., which arranges accredited conferences for investors and professionals, including physicians, lawyers and architects. Passengers receive credits for courses.
Michael Murphy, editor and founder of the California Technology Stock Letter, who has been on several cruises, said he enjoyed meeting with clients as well. "I get two things out of the cruise," he said. "First, there are often some very sophisticated investors who have made a lot of money or know a lot about some sector of technology, especially niches in medicine. Second, I want to see face to face what people understand and what confuses them, what worries them."
Among the discussion topics on recent investment cruises were the weak economy and its impact on Wall Street, asset allocation in a bear market and how to spot investment charlatans.
The formats for the seminars are similar, although informal access to guest speakers outside scheduled seminar hours can vary. Prospective passengers may want to do some homework to find the program that is right for them.
Cruise organizers generally arrange their speakers and topics months in advance, so prospective passengers can nail down how much time will be spent in seminars versus time on shore. Generally, the seminar portion takes place only while the ship is at sea. Depending on the length of the cruise, three to four full days of seminar time is standard.
Featured speakers are not always on board for the duration of the trip. Mr. Murphy, the newsletter publisher, acknowledges that he did not typically stay for an entire cruise. (He said there was no "quicker way to be totally out of touch with the market than to get on a cruise ship.") Mr. Forbes also stays for only a portion of each cruise, according to conference organizers.
Prospective passengers may also want to consider the amount of scheduled time for questions and answers after the sessions -- and whether there will be soirees outside the formal seminars at which presenters and investors can mingle.
Mr. Rukeyser says the guest speakers he chooses for the cruises must be highly approachable people, like Joseph V. Battipaglia, the chief investment officer at Ryan, Beck & Company in New York. One former investment cruiser described how Mr. Battipaglia, when stopped in the hallway on one cruise, discussed her portfolio with her for a half-hour.
For his part, Mr. Battipaglia said he had come to welcome such interaction. After all, these people could be future clients.

If a Resume Lies, Truth Can Loom Large

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH STANTON 

 BODY:
THIS year, several high-profile executives were caught stretching the truth about their credentials -- among them, Ronald L. Zarrella, the chief executive of Bausch & Lomb, the eye-care products maker. Mr. Zarrella said he received an M.B.A. from New York University, when, in fact, he left before graduating. The board withheld a $1.1 million year-end bonus he had been promised. 
 Kenneth E. Lonchar left his position as chief financial officer of Veritas Software after the company learned that he falsely claimed to have an M.B.A. from Stanford. Then there was Sandra Baldwin, who resigned as president of the United States Olympic Committee after acknowledging that she had lied about her academic background. 
 Of course, false claims on resumes are not confined to the executive suite. They have been found at all employment levels for about as long as resumes have been around. But in a tight job market, where more security-conscious companies are checking backgrounds, employment experts say they worry that more people may be tempted to embellish their credentials as a means of gaining a competitive edge. 
Padding can take many creative forms: extending the length of employment so it doesn't look as though you've been out of work too long; changing a former job title, say, to account executive from executive assistant; or claiming to hold a degree when you're a few credits shy. Some people have made up eye-catching stints at defunct, and untraceable, dot-com companies, experts say.
Most people know what happens to high-level executives who are caught, but what about the rest of the working population? How can people recover from the embarrassment, not to mention the possible professional ramifications that lying on a resume can bring? 
Lynda Ford, the president of the Ford Group, a human resource consulting firm in Rome, N.Y., says the repercussions are not drastic for most people who are caught. "In the worst-case scenario, you're facing the same challenge that someone who was fired from their job faces," she said.
Ms. Ford says you correct the errors and move on, but that the tight economy is making it harder to bounce back. "Four years ago, I'd probably say they could get another job, but it's not an employee market anymore," she said, "so we're talking about a market where they need to exercise a little more discretion."
In other words, resist the temptation to pad.
"People are thinking, 'It's a competitive world out there, and I'm just going to get lost in the shuffle if I don't put my best foot forward,' even if it isn't true," said Robert P. Lawry, director of the Center for Professional Ethics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "But in the end, you will get lost."
Many people appear to ignore that advice. Automatic Data Processing of Roseland, N.J., the provider of payroll and other human resources services, said 44 percent of the 2.6 million background checks it conducted last year contained discrepancies between information the applicants provided and the data reported by their former employers. Forty-one percent of the total checks showed discrepancies in educational information, it said.
Michael W. Kramer, an associate professor of communications at the University of Missouri at Columbia who has studied resume writing, said that while he does not recommend stretching the truth, "the chance of being caught is still incredibly small." For one thing, he said, most small and midsize companies are not conducting background checks.
Companies that try to check may have a hard time tracking some employment records. "Sometimes, because of job turnover, you can't track a person's boss down because they've already had two or three other jobs," said Michael G. Kessler, the chief executive of Kessler International, a corporate investigation firm based in New York.
In other cases, previous employers cannot be tracked down because they no longer exist. Steven C. Morgan, chief executive of SalesRecruits.com in Northport, N.Y., says he sometimes encounters that problem with job candidates who list dot-com companies that have gone out of business. He says he can easily spot other resume embellishments. Candidates with less than two years of experience, for example, have "sprinkled technology nomenclature throughout the rest of their resumes to make it seem as if they have been working in the tech field for 10 years," he said.
IF you've already submitted a resume with an untruth or two, experts say the most obvious solution, but certainly not the easiest, is to come clean. "I'd say admit to it and get the resume back to the truth," said Jeffrey E. Christian, the chief executive of the executive search firm Christian & Timbers in Cleveland. "But I wouldn't necessarily go up to the C.E.O. and say, 'Hey, I lied on my resume.' Talk to an unbiased coach and figure out where you are in your career and what the situation is at your current job before you just put it all on the table."
Don't expect a career coach to help you reword any embellishments. "They want me to do that, but I can't be Stephen King and make up a work of fiction for them," said Michael Worthington, director of operations at Resume Doctor in South Burlington, Vt. A good resume coach, he said, will help highlight accomplishments so that the stronger areas of your employment history outshine the weaker spots.
Someone who has trumped up a resume should not compound the lie with another lie, Ms. Ford advised. "Just explain what happened to your next potential employer," she said. While there is no guarantee you will get the job, she said, most employers appreciate such honesty. "Once you have your resume back on track," she said, "tap into your network and use friends and trusted colleagues to open doors."
"Talk to people that will stand by you and say that 'yes, you did a stupid thing but it was just a mistake,' and get them to champion your cause," she said.
It's never too late to set the record straight. 
Thomas Manga, 26, who works at a technology company in Manhattan, says he plans to amend his resume. While he says he did not fabricate any academic or work experience, he says he stretched the truth about the length of service of his last job as a computer program trainer. He was laid off in April 2001, he said, but put on his resume that his employment ended in July that year, when his severance pay ran out. 
"I figured why not; I was technically getting paid by them," he said. "Six months is a lot of time for a tech worker to be out of work; it just didn't look good."
For those with years of resume fudges, the danger lies in believing those lies, Mr. Lawry said. "You begin to tell yourself a story, because you've told that story so often to other people and it's only when you get caught that you realize what you've done," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Remi J. Browne; 
Standish International Equity Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
REMI J. BROWNE, manager of the $55 million Standish International Equity fund, says the simultaneous declines in stock prices and interest rates around the world are making it much easier to find bargain stocks for his value-oriented investors.
 "The relationship between equity valuations and interest rates favors stocks to an extent not often seen in recent history," Mr. Browne said in a telephone interview from his office in downtown Boston. 
 Many stock markets around the world have tumbled in the last three years, making stocks a better value when measured against forecasts of their earnings. Even after a rally last fall, the average foreign stock is now trading at about 12 times its expected earnings for 2003, he said, compared with a multiple of nearly 15 in the United States. 
The fund lost 7.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing it among the top 8 percent of all foreign stock funds, which lost 16.9 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East index was down 17.3 percent during that time.
The fund lost 4.7 percent in the last 12 months, versus declines of 14.2 percent for its group and 14.1 percent for the index.
Mr. Browne, 49, is vice president of Standish Mellon, the fund's adviser and a unit of the Mellon Financial Corporation. He manages about $550 million more, mostly for institutions.
The fund is available from Standish Mellon for a minimum investment of $100,000 or through Fidelity and other mutual fund marketplaces for a minimum of $10,000.
The fund's allocations by country and economic sector essentially mirror those of the Morgan Stanley EAFE index, so Mr. Browne and the five analysts who work on the fund focus on picking the best stocks to match those index weightings.
To find the roughly 150 stocks in the fund, they screen about 1,500 companies in 22 developed markets, excluding the United States and Canada. They look for what Mr. Brown calls attractive valuations and improving business momentum.
THE valuation measures compare each company to its industry group, typically using four gauges: P/E multiples; the ratio of enterprise value (the combination of market value and net debt) to Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization); and ratios of price to cash flow and of price to book value.
To measure business momentum, Mr. Browne reviews trends in earnings forecasts over the last four months, including the number of upgrades and downgrades from analysts.
The roughly 300 companies found in these screens are then evaluated to see if earnings can be sustained. For example, the analysis eliminates earnings increases created by tax reductions or one-time events, he said.
Mr. Browne began buying shares of CNOOC, the publicly traded unit of the China National Offshore Oil Company, in January at 7.98 Hong Kong dollars, worth $1.02. The shares are now trading at 10.30 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.32.
The company, which holds exploration and production rights for offshore China, maintains exclusive rights to enter into production-sharing contracts with international companies off the Chinese coast, Mr. Browne said. He added that CNOOC has no exposure to the Persian Gulf.
"If we have war with Iraq and oil deliveries are disrupted from the gulf are disrupted, these folks are not affected," he said.
He bought shares of Nissan Motor, the Japanese automaker, in May 2000 at 532 yen, or $4.91 at the time, when a dollar bought 108.3 yen. They now trade at 933 yen, or $7.77, now that the dollar has strengthened to 120 yen.
"Nissan has been a great turnaround story since Renault took a 37 percent stake in early 1999 and sent their cost-cutter extraordinaire, Carlos Ghosn, to Japan to manage the business," Mr. Browne said.
While Nissan has strong earnings momentum, he added, its shares trade at 9.8 times projected 12-month earnings, versus a multiple of 13 for Toyota.
The fund does not hedge its currency risk, Mr. Browne said. However, if the dollar rises against the yen, the benefits of increased earnings in yen often offset the lower return when the proceeds from foreign stock sales are converted back to dollars.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which became the second-largest bank in Britain after taking over National Westminster Bank in 2000, is another bargain, Mr. Browne said. It trades at about 11 times projected 12-month earnings versus a multiple of 14 times for the largest British bank, HSBC.
"Royal Bank has also been a cost story," Mr. Browne said, because its chief executive, Fred Goodwin, "has been able to wring $:2 billion per year savings from their blockbuster merger" with National Westminster "while continuing to grow revenues."
The fund started buying shares in January 1998, paying $:8.03. On Friday, they closed at $:14.39, or $23.02.

A Chief's Anguish: Letting Workers Go

BYLINE:  By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
LYNN WUNDERMAN laid off seven people a year ago, and the memory of that day still haunts her.
 As chief executive of I-Behavior Inc., a data base marketing firm in Harrison, N.Y., she had never thought that she would have to carry out such a painful duty. The company, which she had founded two years earlier, initially thrived, and its prospects looked bright. 
 The terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare last year, however, brought business to a halt, and when a 10 percent, across-the-board pay cut didn't do the trick, she was forced to decide which of her 22 employees would have to go. 
"It was one of the toughest times I've ever been through," said Ms. Wunderman, who described the close-knit staff as an extended family. "I couldn't sleep at night. You build a company from scratch, you live and breathe with these people. No one thinks about what it's like for the C.E.O."
It has never been easy for executives to break the news to employees that they are out of a job, but the sheer repetitiveness of the task in the current economic climate is making the task harder, experts say. Hopes for a strong economic recovery have faded, and with the unemployment rate jumping to an eight-year high of 6 percent in November from 5.7 percent in October, there are new fears of a double-dip recession.
"Ten years ago, an executive may have faced the need to downsize once every 5 to 10 years," said Bernadette Kenny, executive vice president and chief global sales and marketing officer for Lee Hecht Harrison, an outplacement firm. "Now, it might be every few months."
That makes it harder for executives to shrug off the act as an unfortunate but necessary purging of unproductive workers. They are more likely to be torn by feelings of guilt and inadequacy, management experts say.
"It's an angry, open sore that sticks around," said Dr. David Zelman, a psychologist and founder of the Transitions Institute in Dallas, who often consults with chief executives about how to handle change. "They have a lot of feelings -- 'It was my fault, we didn't do it right, it wasn't fair.' They take it personally. The highest-level executives often don't have a place to vent."
With the exception of a few chief executives, like Albert J. Dunlap, the former Sunbeam chief who viewed rampant job-cutting as a badge of honor, most will avoid layoffs as long as possible. "I don't know of any C.E.O. that likes to do it," said Phil Simshauser, vice president at the Center for Executive Options in Manhattan, a subsidiary of Drake Beam Morin, an outplacement firm. "If they did, they were in the job too long."
Mr. Simshauser and others who help companies plan and conduct layoffs say there is a path that helps minimize the damage: Always let employees know when the company is facing difficult business conditions, so they aren't surprised when cuts are announced; communicate the business reasons for the layoff, and be as generous as possible with severance packages and job search assistance.
Despite the trauma of conducting her company's first sizable layoff, Ms. Wunderman said she believes she had no choice but to let those workers go. Her only mistake, she said, was not to announce the cuts sooner, once it became clear to employees that something was about to happen.
"The air was too thick," she said. "It dragged on. It was close to a month knowing this was going to happen."
When business hadn't improved by mid-December last year, the management team at I-Behavior adopted a plan to make staff cuts across the board, including the highest levels. "To make the right statement, we couldn't just remove a middle level," said Ms. Wunderman. "It had to include the management team."
One of the founders, the vice president for business and strategic development, volunteered himself for the list. But that bit of news was kept under wraps, since no announcement of the layoffs had been made. That caused some awkward moments at the annual Christmas party that Ms. Wunderman held for department heads at her home.
"We were celebrating, talking about the future, but I knew, and he knew, that one of the management team players was not going to be there," she said.
LIKE many top executives today, Ms. Wunderman was faced with cutting a staff that was already lean. For that reason, it took weeks for Ms. Wunderman and the rest of the management team to determine who would stay and who would go. "We looked at performance, work habits, attitude, revenue relationship, versatility," she recalled. "When we looked at the account services team, it was who had stronger ties to the larger clients. There were some that, as hard as they worked and as wonderful as their attitude was, had a hard time being reliable. If you can never get to a 9:30 meeting on time, it sends a bad message."
Managers looked at each job to see whether it was essential. Names went on and off the list. One particularly difficult decision involved a senior programmer who was well respected by everyone. "I knew the talent we were letting go, and that we would likely not get it back," Ms. Wunderman said.
The layoffs were announced after the holidays, in mid-January. Some of those who were not let go questioned the choices. "I took them through the thought process," she said. And while she acknowledged that she was plagued by doubt even as she explained the rationale, she knew she had really had no choice.
A year later, the company is well on its way to being profitable, she said, and has added three people to the staff. The senior programmer whose loss was mourned so much by his co-workers now works down the hall for another technology start-up. And he sees his former I-Behavior colleagues regularly for lunch. 
"There are people I still regret losing," Ms. Wunderman said. "But we did what we had to do, for the right reasons. If we hadn't, we might not be here today."

HEADLINE: The Fiscal Crisis, This Time Around 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "New York's Cry for Help: Echoes of 1975, but a Different Tone" (Week in Review, Dec. 22), an interview with Felix G. Rohatyn, who helped design the recovery plan for the city's last fiscal crisis:
 Mr. 
Rohatyn reminds us that what is missing today is a sense of urgency about the threat of bankruptcy. Therefore, the public does not appreciate the full dimensions of the crisis. 
 City leaders have not yet grasped that there is no bailout this time and no silver bullet short of real cuts in government spending, which has risen considerably over the last decade. 
The facts this time dictate that we must all tighten our belts, cut the size of government, search for new revenue sources like tolls on bridges that are now free, and not simply tax businesses and working people out of the city.

HEADLINE: Isolation, Not Engagement 

BYLINE:  By Victor D. Cha; Victor D. Cha is a professor at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
While the United States prepares its military for a war in Iraq, North Korea has precipitated an equally serious crisis by the unceremonious restarting of its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. These efforts have created a sense of urgency on the peninsula reminiscent of June 1994.
 To avert this crisis eight years ago, the United States and North Korea signed a nonproliferation accord known as the Agreed Framework. In doing so, they created a broad-based, moderate consensus that engagement with North Korea was effective. 
 By refusing to negotiate directly with the North after it was found to be in noncompliance with this accord, the Bush administration has rightly fractured this consensus. At the same time, it has shown a willingness, signaled in the last few days, to support measures to deal with the North through the United Nations. Thus President Bush has left open the possibility of allowing North Korea a way out of this crisis without condoning its conduct.
The engagement policy the United States followed in 1994 would be ineffective and unfeasible today. Indeed, if the North does not come clean, the true "moderate" position for both Washington and Seoul is isolation and containment.
Engagement's proponents argue that the North's tampering with the Yongbyon nuclear facilities last week -- including the unsealing of buildings, disabling of monitoring cameras and demanding the removal of international inspectors -- is a cleverly disguised attempt to create a crisis and thus coerce a reluctant Bush administration into negotiations.
Maybe so. But even if such talks could result in a more comprehensive nonproliferation agreement to replace the Agreed Framework, there is little evidence to believe that Pyongyang could be trusted to comply with it. Given the revelations in October of another secret nuclear weapons program, the credibility of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Washington is less than zero.
There is no denying that palpable anti-American sentiment exists in South Korea. The election of left-leaning Roh Moo Hyun over a conservative, "pro-American" candidate for president is evidence of a perverse domestic dynamic in Seoul in which bad actions by North Korea are seen to be the fault of the "hardline" policy of the United States. Yet the North's illicit nuclear activities started before the Bush administration took office (as did the waning of inter-Korean economic engagement).
Moreover, what is denigrated in Seoul as inflexibility on the part of the United States is in fact surprisingly measured. In response to North Korean provocations, the Bush administration has maintained that it will not be blackmailed into negotiations, but that it also seeks a peaceful solution to the crisis and has no plans to invade the North. In this regard, North Korea's continued bad behavior plays right into the Bush administration's plans: It reaffirms its policy of isolation and containment. Nowhere was this more evident than in last week's public statement of Mr. Roh, the South Korean president-elect, virtually pleading with Pyongyang to moderate its behavior lest it undercut any credible argument for engagement.
Some argue that greater United States engagement with the North is a useful interim measure to stem anti-Americanism in Seoul and save the alliance with South Korea. But this view is short-sighted. If North Korean nuclear brinkmanship continues unabated, South Koreans should realize that the threat of war on the peninsula emanates not from Washington's ambivalence but from Pyongyang's truculence. Crises should cause alliances to come together, not split apart. If South Koreans do not realize this, then there is no alliance left to save.
As in 1994, going to war to deal with the North Korean nuclear problem is not an option. If Mr. Kim chooses not to make unilateral efforts at resolving international concerns about his nuclear weapons programs, then the only alternative is isolation and containment of the regime.
But won't such a strategy cause Mr. Kim to lash out? Such concerns were justifiably voiced in the crisis eight years ago. But the North Korea of 2002 is very different from the North Korea of 1994. Since 1994, North Korea has won diplomatic ties with the European Union, economic ties with South Korea, a potential normalization settlement with Japan and international food aid. If faced with the choice of complying with its nonproliferation commitments or facing total isolation, the regime's decision will be complicated by one simple fact: It now has much more to lose than it did in 1994.
Different times require different thinking. In 1994, engagement was the level-headed consensus policy option, as any other alternative would have led prematurely to war. Today, engagement is not credible (nor, for that matter is preemption). If Mr. Kim chooses not to cooperate, the only true "moderate" option is isolation.

In Washington, What You See Is What They Paid for

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Where is the highest concentration of plastic surgeons in the country? Wrong. California ranks eighth. Washington, D.C., is No. 1 with one surgeon for roughly every 25,000 residents. 
 Last year, breast implants were the most common type of elective surgery, at an average cost of $3,043, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Liposuction was the next most common procedure, costing, on average, $2,049. 
 People who most felt the effect of gravity paid the most to reverse it. Lower body lifts, which involve the thighs and buttocks, cost an average of $5,183, followed by facelifts, at $5,007. Those looking to spend less could erase laugh lines or other wrinkles by getting a microdermabrasion procedure for $136. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

Buyers Take a Holiday, and Stocks Decline

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
Stocks drifted lower in quiet trading last week as investors stepped to the sidelines to celebrate the holidays.
 There appeared to be few good reasons to buy stocks anyway, as political tensions heated up around the world and as more signs of weakness emerged in the American economy. 
Retailers, for example, reported the worst growth in holiday shopping in about 30 years. 
 In a shortened trading week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 207.54 points, or 2.4 percent, to 8,303.78. The Nasdaq composite lost 14.74 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,348.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also declined, by 20.36 points, or 2.3 percent, to 875.40.
 Market analysts took the losses in stride, noting that the thin trading volume made stocks susceptible to sharper fluctuations. Some analysts predicted a rebound in January, when investors typically stop selling stocks for tax purposes and invest their year-end bonuses.
 More money, meanwhile, shifted into the bond market. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 3.81 percent last week from 3.96 percent the previous week. VIVIAN MARINO

After the Talk, Your Turn

 BODY:
THE last 12 months have been a vintage year for business news. As usual, many of the corporate scandals, economic ups and downs, market movements, bankruptcies and other events and incidents elicited telling remarks by executives and public figures. 
 How closely were you watching the business world? Here's a test. 

Who spoke these words? What were they talking about?

1. "There are lots of other important things to do in life."

2. "In litigation, as in life, timing is everything. Now is the time to end this chapter of the case and focus on enforcement."

3. "I know how hard it is for people to see me as a victim, but in this case, it's pretty close to the truth."

4. "Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel."

5. "I cannot think of a time when business over all has been held in less repute."

HEADLINE: States Of Alarm 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com; Maureen Dowd and Thomas L. Friedman are on vacation.

 BODY:
There is something eerie, even a little unnerving, about the budget crises that continue to spread, like a contagious, crippling disease, to states and cities across the U.S.
 In Connecticut, which is faced with a half-billion-dollar budget gap, 3,000 state workers were notified in the first week of December that they were being laid off. 
 In Kentucky, also facing a half-billion-dollar gap, Gov. Paul E. Patton has ordered the early release of more than 500 state prison inmates. The governor acknowledged that some of the prisoners would go on to commit other crimes, but said, "I have to do what I have to do to live within the revenue that we have." 
The Washington Post reported last week that some rural school districts in seven states had shifted to a four-day week in an effort to cut costs, and other districts may follow. But Julie Underwood of the National School Boards Association told me on Friday that a shorter week wouldn't do much to ease the enormous funding problems facing the nation's public schools.
"The root of the problem is that the states are in financial trouble," she said. "And, unfortunately, when states are in financial trouble, one of the very first things they look at is the public school budget. That problem is spread across the entire United States."
California's budget crisis is monumental -- a shortfall over the next 18 months of $34.8 billion. As The Times's John Broder wrote, that deficit "is bigger than the annual budgets of every other state except New York." Gov. Gray Davis is already hacking away at services, and big tax hikes are sure to come.
If you want a story with legs, this is it. President Bush will have a heck of a time getting the national economy back on track while states from coast to coast are trying to balance their budgets by raising taxes, cutting spending and laying off employees.
The National Governors Association, in a report last month, said states are facing "the most dire fiscal situation since World War II." Nearly every state "is in fiscal crisis," the governors said.
From nearly every perspective, the outlook is grim. "As states fight to balance their budgets, the solutions available to them are increasingly dire," the report said, "and some of the most difficult fiscal decisions have yet to be made."
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a study released two days before Christmas, said, "The budget deficits now looming over state governments will likely reach $60 billion to $85 billion in state fiscal year 2004 and constitute the largest state budget gaps in half a century."
The potential for human suffering is great. The center, in a separate report, found that cuts in health care programs that have been proposed in 11 states could result in the complete loss of health insurance coverage for a million people currently covered by Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
Meanwhile, the nation's cities are beset with their own (frequently related) problems. Cities in virtually every section of the country are taking a big hit on revenues from sales and income taxes, and from tourist-related levies, like restaurant and hotel taxes. At the same time, public safety costs (in this era of terror) are rising, as are health care costs.
Moreover, as the economy continues to struggle, the nation's mayors have been confronted with a sharp increase in the demand for emergency shelter, food and other assistance for the needy.
These problems cannot be solved without significant help from the federal government. The president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Thomas Menino of Boston, is hoping to form an alliance with the nation's governors to petition Washington for help.
He and Governor Patton of Kentucky, who is chairman of the National Governors Association, will meet Friday in Washington to see, in Governor Patton's words, "where we have a common interest."
The governor described the meeting as preliminary. "I've talked to the mayor about the general need to get some kind of relief from the federal government in a whole lot of different areas," he said.
Mayor Menino said, "In the past there has been tension between mayors and governors. But with the fiscal shape we're in, it makes a lot of sense for us to work together."

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Hungary and Suez; 
Memories of '56, When Eastern Europe Was the First Crisis of the Day

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
CAN a superpower handle more than one crisis at a time? With North Korea dismantling the international controls on its nuclear sites just as the United States contemplates a war with Iraq, the question is very much in the air.
 History never offers exact parallels, but it seems a good time to remember the fall of 1956, when the United States had to respond at the same time to the Hungarian uprising and a Middle East war. 
 The Hungarian revolution began with mass demonstrations in Budapest in October that shocked the Russians and encouraged American officials hoping for a crack in the Soviet empire. Then, to the Americans' dismay, came the Suez crisis, in which Britain, France and Israel -- without consulting the United States -- joined to try to reverse Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. When their forces took control of the canal and the Sinai Peninsula, they diverted attention from Hungary, which the Russians seized the opportunity to retake. An infuriated American president withheld support for the Suez takeover, and the British, French and Israelis eventually had to pull back. 
Today, Hungary is in NATO and the Soviet Union is no more. But the experience faced by American officials, as they tried to balance two crises and watched events spin out of their control, is illuminated in "The 1956 Hungarian Revolution: A History in Documents," a new book of archival material published by the Central European University Press in cooperation with the National Security Archive in Washington.
The documents show how the two superpowers weighed their options with one eye on each crisis and their full attention firmly focused on each other. CELESTINE BOHLEN
On July 12, 1956, American officials discussed the pros and cons of supporting rebellion against Communist governments in Eastern Europe. In minutes of a National Security Council meeting, Vice President Richard M. Nixon's remarks were paraphrased:
After all, we are not saying that we are going to initiate uprising and violence in the satellites. We are merely saying that we will not always discourage such uprising and violence if the uprisings should occur spontaneously. . . . The vice president commented that it wouldn't be an unmixed evil, from the point of view of U.S. interest, if the Soviet iron fist were to come down again on the Soviet bloc, though on balance it would be more desirable, of course, if the present liberalizing trend in relations between the Soviet Union and its satellites continued.
On Oct. 22, a Hungarian student group demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and demonstrators were on the streets of Budapest the next day. On Oct. 24, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles talked to Henry Cabot Lodge, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, by phone. A memorandum says Mr. Lodge was told:
Re Hungary -- apparently the fighting is developing in quite a big way and there is clear evidence of considerable Soviet military activity in the area to try to repress it. We are thinking of the possibility of bringing it to the United Nations Security Council. From a political standpoint the secretary is worried that it will be said that here are the great moments and when they came and these fellows were ready to stand up and die, we were caught napping and doing nothing.
At a National Security Council meeting on Oct. 26, Harold Stassen, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's adviser on disarmament, proposed that the United States assure the Soviets that the independence of satellites wouldn't be used to threaten Soviet security. Logs were kept of a presidential phone call to Mr. Dulles:
The president said he had been turning over in his mind what Stassen had said. . . . As far as the border states were concerned, they the Soviets need have no fear that we might make an effort to incorporate them into NATO or make them part of our alliances. We want to see them have a free choice.
Another telephone call, from Mr. Dulles to President Eisenhower, followed within hours:
The president said the evening paper looks as if it is spreading. The secretary said we are sending a cable to the British foreign minister Selwyn Lloyd that it should get before the Security Council in order to focus attention on it so the Russians will not commit vast reprisals, and give us a chance to talk privately with them there.
On Oct. 27, the Americans, British and French requested a Security Council meeting on Hungary, and it was set for Oct. 28. This was reflected in working notes from a meeting of the Soviet Communist Party presidium, (Sobolev is Arkadi Sobolev, chief Soviet representative at the United Nations):
Comrade Nikita S. Khrushchev: The matter is becoming more complicated. . . . We must set Sobolev right at the U.N. The workers are supporting the uprising. 
The protests embarrassed the Soviet leaders, who decided to support a declaration by Imre Nagy, Hungary's prime minister, seeking a truce and talks on the withdrawal of Soviet troops:
Comrade Khrushchev: I support the declaration. Politically this is beneficial for us. The English and French are in a real mess in Egypt. We shouldn't get caught in the same company. But we must not foster illusions. We are saving face. Fundamentally, the declaration must be adopted. But adopt it with corrections.
The uprising spread. On Oct. 30, Moscow issued a declaration that seemed to say it would accept the reform-minded leadership of Mr. Nagy. While it envisioned Soviet forces remaining at least temporarily, it also spoke of the possibility of negotiations over their departure:
The course of events has shown that the working people of Hungary . . . are rightfully raising the question of the need to eliminate serious defects in the sphere of economic construction, the question of further improving the living standards of the population. . . . However, this legitimate and progressive movement of the working people was soon joined by the forces of black reaction and counter-revolution. . . . At the same time, the Soviet government is prepared to enter into the appropriate negotiations with the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and other members of the Warsaw Treaty on the question of the presence of Soviet troops on the territory of Hungary.
On Oct. 31 -- with British and French planes bombarding Egyptian airfields two days after Israeli paratroopers landed in Egypt -- America was preoccupied by Suez. In Moscow, the presidium met and reached a final decision to intervene with force in Hungary.
Comrade Khrushchev: We should re-examine our assessment and should not withdraw our troops from Hungary and Budapest. . . . If we depart from Hungary, it will give a great boost to the Americans, English and French -- the imperialists. They will perceive it as weakness on our part and will go onto the offensive. We would then be exposing the weakness of our positions. Our party will not accept it if we do this. To Egypt, they will then add Hungary. We have no other choice.
In Washington on Nov. 1, a memorandum of a National Security Council meeting shows, the main focus had turned to the Middle East.
The president informed the members of the council that, except insofar as it was the subject of the director of central intelligence's intelligence briefing, he did not wish the council to take up the situation in the Soviet satellites. Instead he wished to concentrate on the Middle East.
Allen W. Dulles, director of central intelligence, raised Hungary anyway. The memorandum paraphrases his comments:
In a sense what had occurred there was a miracle. Events had belied all our past views that a popular revolt in the face of modern weapons was an utter impossibility. Nevertheless, the impossible had happened, and because of the power of public opinion, armed force could not effectively be used.
But Dulles was wrong. Soviet tanks were heading to Budapest to crush the revolt, and Khrushchev and presidium members would soon inform other Communist leaders. An account of their meeting with Tito of Yugoslavia from Nov. 2 to Nov. 3 is provided by Vljko Micunovic, a Yugoslav diplomat:
"What is there left for us to do," Khrushchev asked, meaning the Soviet Union. "If we let things take their course, the West would say we are either stupid or weak, and that's one and the same thing. We cannot possibly permit it." . . . 
Khrushchev said that British and French aggressive pressure on Egypt provided a favorable moment for a further intervention by Soviet troops. It would help the Russians. There would be confusion and uproar in the West and the United Nations, but it would be less at a time when Britain, France and Israel were waging a war against Egypt.
"They are bogged down there, and we are stuck in Hungary," Khrushchev said.
In the end, the Russians would stay in Hungary until their empire collapsed 32 years later. The British and French would leave Egypt in humiliation at America's lack of support. As for the Israelis, when Egypt again tried to block their shipping, in 1967, they would refight their way across Sinai -- this time after making sure America would not object.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Tarnished Arches 

 BODY:
"Would you care for some fries with that?" must rank among the most common of universal expressions. McDonald's 30,000 burger joints worldwide feed the equivalent of Spain's population -- every day.
 And yet the company's torrid growth rate has stalled. McDonald's has said that it will report its first quarterly loss since going public in the mid-1960's, and that it will do what would have once been unthinkable: pull out of some countries altogether. 
 McDonald's is not the first of America's mighty global brands to have fallen on hard times. Among companies seemingly on the verge of omnipotence a decade ago, when the term "globalization" carried a less ambiguous message, Coca-Cola, Disney, the Gap and Nike have also encountered unexpected turbulence in recent years.
There is more at play here than changing habits, an economic slowdown and an anti-American backlash. It is a fundamental human ambivalence toward the ubiquitous. 
One of the paradoxes of American life is our penchant for celebrating individualism even as we enjoy the fruits of standardization. By endlessly cloning an efficient Southern California burger joint, Ray Kroc turned McDonald's into an icon of America's assembly-line answer to a basic human need. It is no accident that McDonald's, the ultimate chain, dates to the Eisenhower era, when the Interstate highway system and network television began binding the country together like never before.
American companies exported this standardization to a world of consumers grateful for the promise of certainty -- the certainty that a Coke or a Big Mac bought today will taste like one bought yesterday, not to mention one bought on another continent. But after a while, once the likes of McDonald's have elevated consumers' expectations, their omnipresence can become as unsettling as it is comforting. Fickle consumers turn away, seeking to reassert their individuality. That helps account for the ongoing fragmentation of consumer taste. 
To reignite its growth after hitting an unexpected speed bump, Coca-Cola realized that it had better start selling juices and bottled water. The Gap owns Old Navy and Banana Republic. Nike now sells some product lines without its trademark swoosh. Reacting to the fragmentation of their TV audience, the owners of the three broadcast networks acquired cable channels. 
Similarly, McDonald's may be forced to tinker with its old formula, at home and abroad, if it is to cater to a more affluent clientele with more varied tastes. Fast-food joints are losing market share to a growing niche of more expensive, and possibly healthier, "fast casual" eateries, like Panera Bread and Cosi, that offer more customized selections. McDonald's itself is expanding its successful Chipotle chain of Mexican-themed restaurants. 
Trouble is, at its core restaurants McDonald's acts as if its main problem were insufficiently low prices. So it is pushing its $1 "value menu" items with renewed vigor. Upgrading its offerings might make more sense. Otherwise, the chain's main product may soon generate nostalgia for a more innocent age when standardization was still a novelty and nobody could have foreseen a backlash against the ubiquitous.

HEADLINE: A Fear of Vampires Can Mask a Fear of Something Much Worse 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
VAMPIRES are us, as vampire experts say. And that may explain why Malawi is now in the grip of a vampire panic. 
 Rumors that the government of that landlocked southern African country was colluding with vampires to collect human blood in exchange for food sent terrified villagers fleeing, wire services reported last week. A suspected vampire helper was stoned or beaten to death; three priests were attacked; and a foreign aid encampment identified as vampire headquarters was destroyed. 
 It didn't happen in a vacuum. Malawi faces widespread starvation and a severe AIDS epidemic, as well as an uproar over efforts by the country's first and only democratically elected president, Bakili Muluzi, to override a two-term limit and remain in office after 2004.
"Vampires say a lot about our fears and hopes," said Nina Auerbach, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of "Our Vampires, Ourselves." 
For millennia, the storied undead that emerge from the grave to suck the lifeblood of the living have embodied power "and our fears of power," Ms. Auerbach said. "They can be whatever you want." They are immortal. And unlike ghosts, they are robustly corporeal. 
Another scholar, David J. Skal, author of "The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror," has said that a fixation on demons often accompanies periods of national stress. "In times of social upheaval, the vampire asserts itself," he said. 
President Muluzi, in debunking the vampire rumors, may have inadvertently encouraged them when he said, "No government can go about sucking the blood of its own people."
The denial rang false, Ms. Auerbach said, because, "Governments have always sucked the blood of their people." 
It was for good reason, she said, that the vampire legend became deeply rooted in Eastern Europe, where the peasantry was cruelly persecuted for centuries.
In the United States, perhaps by the same reasoning, vampires come in friendlier form. There is Count Chocula cereal; Sesame Street's helpful arithmetic tutor, the Count; Anne Rice's novelistic dynasty of masterful and sexy vampires -- "practically spa people," Ms. Auerbach calls them; the empowered and liberated black lesbian vampires of Jewelle Gomez's "Gilda Stories;" and the wholesome cheeriness of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." 
THE origins of the vampire legend lie buried in antiquity, dating to Greece and perhaps Egypt, scholars say, at some point taking credence from the bats that suck the blood of horses and livestock.
Drawing on ancestor worship, cannibalism, human sacrifice and the Christian doctrine of transubstantiation, and real fears of violence, tales of ghouls nourished on human blood surfaced in widely separated cultures, including China, India, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, wrote the British author Anthony Masters in his book, "The Natural History of the Vampire." 
The medieval plagues that spread unseen contagion also fed the vampire legend, as did commonplace grotesqueries like live burials (by mistake and on purpose), body-snatching and grave-robbing, along with the capture of some all-too-real fiends like Gilles de Rais of France who fought along with Joan of Arc in the 1400's before becoming an orgiastic child-slaughterer, and Countess Elizabeth of Bathory in Hungary 200 years later who bathed in the blood of murdered virgins. 
Austrian forces returning from conquests in the Ottoman east in the early 1700's brought back vampire stories, which circulated throughout Europe, later inspiring Byron, Keats and Coleridge. It was left, however, to Bram Stoker, stage manager for the revered Shakespearean actor Henry Irving in the 1870's, to turn the fragments into terrifying form in his 1897 "Dracula."
But it was not until the vogue of vampire plays and films in the 1920's that the popular Dracula cult took hold, at a time when it was still believed that evil always wore an evil face, or at least a wicked-looking widow's peak.
Soon vampirism became as rule-bound as any orthodoxy. So today one can read, on the Web and in a slew of popular books, that an animal or a nun passing over an unburied body turns into a vampire. So will a child in the womb whose mother was looked at by a vampire (particularly after her sixth month), a seventh son and a dead wizard.
Of course, today, at least in much of the West, this is merely the stuff of high camp. But the fear stalking Malawi these days is a reminder that, among desperate people, who with reason feel their life's blood, or that of their children, is being sucked away, the vampire myth still resonates uncannily with human experience.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends; 
Eugenics and Sects Go Together

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. KEVLES; Daniel J. Kevles is a professor of history at Yale University.

 BODY:
AS much of the world has heard by now, on Friday the chief scientist of a company founded by a sect that believes space travelers created the human race by genetic engineering announced that a 31-year-old American woman had given birth to a seven-pound baby cloned from her own cells. 
 Whether or not the baby, named Eve, is a genuine clone -- or even exists -- remains to be seen. The sect, called the Raelians, not only exists, but in some sense is old news. 
 The group's founder was Claude Vorilhon, a French race car journalist who said he encountered space aliens in 1973 while out walking near a volcano in France. He said the aliens traveled by flying saucer and revealed that they were the Elohim mentioned in the Bible -- not God, but beings from afar who had engineered the creation of the human race on Earth from inert DNA. They named Vorilhon "Rael" and asked him to tell mankind the true story of its creation. 
The Raelian Movement, which claims 40,000 members in France, Canada, Japan and elsewhere, believes humanity is scientifically advanced enough to comprehend its origins, to create life from inert matter, and thus to achieve, through human cloning, eternal life. 
This futuristic blend of religion and science, of millenarian purpose with reproductive practice, has numerous antecedents, dating from the 19th century and continuing up to modern groups like the Branch Davidians. 
The historian Lawrence Foster has written of "the turbulent decades of the 1830's and 1840's before the Civil War, when thousands of Americans joined new religious movements that rejected existing marriage and sex-role patterns in favor of alternative life-styles." 
These movements included John Humphrey Noyes's Oneida Community in upstate New York, created in 1848. The utopian venture was organized around communal ownership of property and the practice of "complex marriage," which declared all members of the community wedded to each other.
"To be ashamed of the sexual organs is to be ashamed of the most perfect instruments of love and unity," Noyes said.
He ran Oneida autocratically, including its sexual relationships, usually initiating young women himself. 
He intended at Oneida to establish "right relations with God"; "right relations between the sexes," the kind that would foster harmonious living; "right economic relations," in contrast to the growth of vicious capitalism; and, by achieving these goals, the creation of the true millennium on earth, with the elimination of "disease and death." 
In 1865, in further pursuit of perfection, Noyes's Oneida newspaper, "The Circular," took note of the ideas of eugenics then becoming current and proclaimed in an editorial that "human breeding should be one of the foremost questions of the age, transcending in its sublime interest all present political and scientific questions." 
A few years later, Noyes launched volunteers at Oneida on an experimental program of selective human breeding. 
Unlike Noyes, Rael is no communitarian visionary, but sensuality and sexuality have long been a feature of Raelian doctrines. In 1987, the Raelians published a small book, "Sensual Meditation," with a cover showing two nude women in erotic postures and a text that urges the reader to "uninhibit oneself. " 
RAEL has also published a message from the Elohim asking "our last Prophet, Rael, to found a religious order that will bring together young women who wish conscientiously to put at the service of their creators and of their Prophets their interior and exterior beauty when we arrive at the embassy." "While awaiting our arrival," the message continued, "they shall prepare themselves for this day of such hope in placing themselves at the service of the Last Prophet, Rael, and in seeing to his well being when necessary." 
Dr. Brigitte Boisselier, the chief scientist at Clonaid, the company the sect founded, says that she is a Raelian "bishop," but it is likely that human cloning ultimately will have nothing to do with Rael's quest for eternal life or anybody's drive for perfection. 
Noyes's ideal of sexual freedom was ultimately divorced from utopian communitarianism, becoming an end in itself, aided by the technologies of contraception. So, too, human cloning, if it proves safe and effective, will likely become just another reproductive option for people who cannot reproduce otherwise.

HEADLINE: Freed From Prison, but Still Paying a Penalty 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Maurice Stewart finally got out of prison last summer after serving 14 years for armed robbery and manslaughter. He needed a place to live, so he called his mother.
 Mr. Stewart, a husky 33-year-old, wanted to come home to Stateway Gardens, the decaying public housing project on Chicago's South Side where he had grown up. 
 It sounded simple enough. But his mother, Pamela Stewart, knew otherwise. Under a little-noticed provision of federal law, anyone convicted of a crime is barred from public housing, and if Mrs. Stewart took her son in, even for a visit, the Chicago Housing Authority could evict her. 
The ban on living in public housing is among the penalties for criminals that are not spelled out at sentencing and do not begin until the sentence runs out. Most of the sanctions were passed by Congress and state legislatures in the 1990's to get tough on crime. Now, as the record number of men and women who filled prisons in the last decade are finishing their terms, the consequences of the penalties are being felt.
The penalties also include a lifetime ban on receiving welfare or food stamps for those convicted of drug felonies, prohibitions against getting certain jobs in plumbing, education and other fields, and the loss of the right to vote, for life in some states. 
Felons with drug convictions are barred from receiving federal student loans, and women who serve more than 15 months in prison may be forced to give up their children to foster care.
When the laws were passed, supporters called them extra deterrents to crime. They carried no cost and in some cases even saved money by reducing the number of people in public housing or on welfare.
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who was one of the main architects of the lifetime ban on welfare for women convicted of a drug felony, said: "We were mostly aiming at the drug trade. The thought was that if someone was buying drugs, we don't feel an obligation to support them."
Similarly, Mr. Shaw said, the bar on public housing for people convicted of a crime "was to deter people so they wouldn't get involved in drugs." Public housing tenants themselves wanted it, Mr. Shaw said, "so they didn't have drug deals going down in front of them and their children."
Although the sanctions were often passed with broad bipartisan support, some judges, prosecutors and advocates for the poor are now criticizing the laws as counterproductive and urging that they be re-examined.
"They make it even harder for newly released inmates to find jobs, housing and reunite with their families and therefore to lead productive lives," said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington, who coined the phrase "invisible punishment" to describe such penalties.
Mr. Stewart put it more starkly in a furtive visit to his mother at Stateway Gardens.
"Basically, this stuff is telling me I've served my time, I'm out, but I'm never going to be allowed to be part of society again," Mr. Stewart said. "So what do you want me to do? I'm going to end up doing something wrong again."
The criminal justice section of the American Bar Association adopted new guidelines recently suggesting that the laws need to be re-examined. Margaret Love, a former Justice Department official who headed the committee, said all the punishments should be codified in one place and made part of sentencing, so that defendants, their lawyers and judges understand what is happening.
Even some conservatives have asked whether these penalties have gone too far. Anne Piehl, an associate professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said, "These laws tend to get passed independently without considering all the consequences, so the cumulative effect is greater than what was intended."
The consequences affect millions of Americans. Thirteen million felons who are in prison or have done their time live in the United States, according to an estimate by Christopher Uggen, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota. That is almost 7 percent of the adult population.
Robert Johnson, the prosecutor for Anoka County, in the suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, says the new laws have begun to affect the way he does his job.
"Now you have to factor in these additional sanctions, almost as if they are part of a mandatory sentencing concept," said Mr. Johnson, a former president of the National District Attorney's Association. He said he had seen judges reduce charges to misdemeanors from felonies or expunge convictions entirely to avoid the sanctions.
In one recent case, he said, a judge with a tough-on-crime reputation allowed an 18-year-old man from El Salvador, who had already pleaded guilty to burglary and nearly completed his prison term, to withdraw his guilty plea and ask for a new trial. The reason for the unusual request, Mr. Johnson said, was that the man faced being deported as a convicted felon. Mr. Johnson objected to the maneuver but decided not to try the man again, since he had already served his time.
James Kalven, a writer who advises the residents of the Stateway Gardens apartments in Chicago, said the public housing eviction law had created a "whole group of guys who are essentially nomadic because of their felony convictions, getting out of jail and having nowhere to go."
It was Mr. Kalven who arranged for Mario Bailey, a 26-year-old at Stateway Gardens with several drug convictions, to be admitted to St. Andrew's Court, a residential center for men newly released from prison, so that he would not provoke the eviction of his grandmother and other relatives.
"They can't even go home for a visit; it is considered criminal trespass," Mr. Kalven said of men like Mr. Bailey, who has used a wheelchair since being shot and paralyzed by gang members.
Amy Hirsch, a supervising attorney with Community Legal Services, which provides legal assistance to low-income families in Philadelphia, said many female convicts are hurt by the lifetime ban on drug felons receiving welfare and food stamps, part of the 1996 welfare overhaul.
States are free to opt out of the ban, as New York and Connecticut have, but most states have kept some version of it.
"The ban is counterproductive because it makes it so much harder for women to stay off drugs once they are released from jail," Ms. Hirsch said. "A lot of the women I see come out of jail after being in drug treatment and they want to continue in treatment and reconnect with their kids, but then they run into this brick wall. They need money." 
A spokesman for former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who was an architect of the lifetime ban on welfare, said Mr. Gramm still strongly supported the law. "Welfare shouldn't be used to support drug habits," Mr. Gramm said before resigning from the Senate in the fall to become a vice chairman of UBS Warburg, the investment bank. 
In recent years the states have also passed legislation lengthening the list of jobs that bar people with a criminal conviction. In New York, there are more than 100 prohibited job categories, including plumbing, real estate, barbering, education, health care and private security.
In Pennsylvania, the Legislature in 1997 passed a sweeping law that prohibits people convicted of a long list of crimes, including the theft of two library books, from working in nursing homes or home health care for the elderly.
The new law caught Earl Nixon by surprise. Mr. Nixon had spent 30 years working in health care, rising to be the administrator of an assisted living center in Pittsburgh. But in 1971, when he was 18, he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and received probation. 
So when he recently quit his administrator's post and tried to change jobs, he was shocked to discover he could not be rehired, despite a shortage of health care workers. Unable to find a new job, Mr. Nixon moved to Michigan.
Last December, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled in a lawsuit brought on behalf of Mr. Nixon that the law had unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to earn a living. 
But Pennsylvania's attorney general, Mike Fisher, a Republican who was defeated last November in the governor's race, has appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court.
"The General Assembly passed this law in an effort to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens from those who would prey upon them," Mr. Fisher said. The law should be upheld, he said, even if in some cases it may seem harsh.
"The law makes no allowance for rehabilitation," Mr. Nixon said. "It just seems designed to go on punishing people forever."
The disenfranchisement laws do that in 13 states, where a felony conviction can result in a lifetime ban on voting. 
Since the 2000 election, several states, including New Mexico, Delaware and Maryland, have abandoned or modified disenfranchisement laws.
Florida, which has not changed its laws, has the largest number of disenfranchised voters, estimated at more than 600,000 banned for life, according to a lawsuit by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The lawsuit maintains that the ban disproportionately affects Florida's African-American population, prohibiting about one quarter of the state's black men from voting. 
Roger Clegg, of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research organization in Virginia, said there was no evidence that the disenfranchisement laws are racially discriminatory. 
"We don't let everyone vote," Mr. Clegg said. "We don't let children or noncitizens vote. There are basic requirements of loyalty and trustworthiness that we have for letting people vote. People who have committed serious crimes don't meet that minimum threshold."

HEADLINE: Ranchers Bristle as Gas Wells Loom on the Range 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN and DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: GILLETTE, Wyo. 

 BODY:
As it runs through Orin Edwards's ranch, the Belle Fourche River bubbles like Champagne. The bubbles can burn. They are methane, also called natural gas, the fuel that heats 59 million American homes. Mr. Edwards noticed the bubbles two years ago, after gas wells were drilled on his land. The company that drilled the wells denies responsibility for the flammable river.
 An hour's drive west, the artesian well on Roland and Beverly Landrey's ranch has failed. After producing 50 gallons a minute for 34 years, the well, the ranch's only source of water, stopped flowing in September. A well digger who examined it blames energy companies drilling for gas nearby, but the companies dispute that. So the couple -- he is 83 and ailing; she describes herself as "no spring chicken" -- hauls water in gallon jugs and drives 30 miles to town weekly to wash clothes and bathe. 
 Dave Bullach, a welder who lives near Gillette, couldn't take it anymore. For two sleep-deprived years, he endured the incessant yowl of a methane compressor, a giant pump that squeezes methane into an underground pipeline. There are thousands of these screaming machines in Wyoming, where neither state nor federal law regulates their noise. Mr. Bullach stormed out of his house at midnight last year with a rifle and shot at the compressor until a sheriff's deputy hauled him off to jail. 
This is the cantankerous world of energy extraction in the Rocky Mountain West, where natural gas is abundant and cheap to remove, and where the Bush administration, in its aggressive push to increase domestic energy production, is on the brink of approving the largest-ever gas-drilling project on federal land. Here in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, the Bureau of Land Management says that early next year it will give final approval to the drilling of 39,000 wells on eight million acres.
With natural gas consumption expected to soar in the next two decades, no one questions the need for new sources of this clean-burning fossil fuel. What alarms ranchers, along with environmental groups, is the hugely disruptive process of getting gas out of all those wells.
It is a 15-year-old drilling technique called coal-bed methane extraction, which can turn ranches and prairies into sprawling industrial zones, laced with wells, access roads, power lines, compressor stations and wastewater pits.
Stoking local outrage, the split nature of land ownership in much of the West, with mineral rights owned separately from surface rights, allows energy companies to operate on ranchers' land without their consent. Environmentalists also doubt whether energy companies can actually remove -- in a way that is profitable and ecologically sound -- the enormous amounts of methane that federal experts say is available in Western coal seams.
"Ranchers have never truly thought much of tree-hugging environmentalists," said John Dewey, 76, who owns a small cattle ranch outside Sheridan, Wyo. "But with these methane boys on our land, we are starting to see these environmentalists as conservationists who want to help us preserve land for our kids."
Most natural gas in the Rocky Mountain West lies fairly close to the surface, in coal seams, trapped under huge aquifers. To get to the gas, water is pumped out, peppering the landscape with large numbers of relatively cheap and shallow wells.
Oddly, in an arid region prone to persistent drought, the primary waste product -- and environmental threat -- of extracting coal-bed methane is water, in phenomenal amounts. In the Powder River Basin, for example, drillers are expected to pump out 3.2 million acre-feet of water -- as much as New York City uses in two and a half years.
It is primarily this immense draining of aquifers by thousands of wells that makes drilling for coal-bed methane so environmentally intrusive. Conventional gas wells are usually much deeper and more expensive to dig, and do not drain huge quantities of groundwater.
This water can, of course, be a godsend to ranchers -- if it is not too salty and shows up in a convenient place and in usable amounts. But if the water is contaminated with salts, as much of it is in Wyoming and across the West, it can turn pasture barren.
In addition, coal-bed methane wells often produce far more water than a rancher can conceivably use. Besides causing damaging erosion, too much water can sharply lower water tables, sometimes for decades, while drying up nearby wells and ruining natural springs used by wildlife. Methane drilling can also send unwanted gas into nearby stock troughs, house wells and creek beds.
These consequences can make ranchers loathe companies that extract methane.
"Polarization and demonization are absolute hallmarks of drilling for coal-bed methane," said Mickey Steward, director of the Coal Bed Methane Coordination Coalition, a Wyoming group that tries, and often fails, to make peace between agitated ranchers and impatient producers. Energy producers stopped giving the group money, complaining that it was too sympathetic to ranchers and environmentalists. The coalition now relies on state and county taxes.
"On one side, the producers feel very strongly they are helping to preserve the American way of life," Ms. Steward said. "On the other side, drilling is changing the lives of ranchers who are just not used to having anybody affect where they live except for themselves."
Compounding the anger is the fractured ownership of land in much of the Rocky Mountain West. Far more than in other parts of the country with oil and gas reserves, landowners here do not own the wealth under them. Farmers and ranchers settled more than 30 million acres of the West under the Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916. The act's rules, in almost all cases, granted mineral rights not to homesteaders but to the federal government.
Companies that lease these rights from the Bureau of Land Management have access to ranch land, whether ranchers want them there or not. Producers almost always try to make surface-use agreements with ranchers. But even without landowner consent, federal law allows them to build roads, pipelines, power lines, compressor stations and well pads, as well as to dam gullies and build wastewater reservoirs.
"Ways of life are being changed for the purpose of energy extraction," said Jim Ventrello, a Republican county commissioner in Delta County, Colo., "and it is not the quality of life that we seek here."
That overwhelmingly Republican rural county in western Colorado banned coal-bed methane operations this year. "We heard horror stories from other places in the West," Mr. Ventrello said, "and we decided not to allow this to go forward unless we can make sure it is done right." 
Delta, though, is one of only two counties in the West to slam the brakes on coal-bed methane. While energy companies are vigorously challenging the county moratoriums in the courts, coal-bed methane extraction is continuing to hurtle forward across much of the West, thanks to policies put in place by the Clinton administration and accelerated under President Bush, with the encouragement of state governments that rely on tax money from gas drilling.

The Need for More Gas
The eagerness of energy companies and the Bush administration to produce more coal-bed methane can be explained by these numbers: The United States consumes about 23 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, nearly all domestically produced. By 2020, demand is expected to jump by about a third, according to government projections.
The main hope for finding supplies to meet that demand in the long term is the Gulf of Mexico, the country's single largest natural gas resource. But energy companies and the White House see coal-bed methane from the interior West, the country's second-largest gas resource, as a vital part of the short-term solution. 
The cost difference between conventional and coal-bed methane drilling is extraordinary. A conventional well on land usually costs several million dollars. An offshore well costs tens of millions. A coal-bed methane well can be dug for about $90,000.
Coal-bed methane accounts for only about 9 percent of the country's proven natural gas reserves, or less than one year's production at current consumption levels, according to the Energy Department. But over the last decade, estimates of likely reserves have soared.
The federal Energy Information Administration has described the Rockies as having the potential to become "a Persian Gulf of natural gas." 
There are serious questions, however, about how real that potential is. "In the 1970's, oil shale was hailed as our energy salvation, and it turned into a huge bust," said Pete Morton, an economist with the Wilderness Society. "This could be history repeating itself."
In a new assessment released in mid-December, the United States Geological Survey said coal seams in five Western basins, including Powder River, might contain a total of 42 trillion cubic feet of additional gas. The agency, which said in 1995 that Powder River probably held undiscovered coal-bed methane resources of 1.5 trillion cubic feet, raised that estimate to 14.3 trillion cubic feet in its current study.
Another study, commissioned by the Energy Department and released in December, was even more optimistic. It estimated undiscovered coal-bed methane in the basin at 39 trillion cubic feet, or nearly two years' worth of national consumption.
Even if they are accurate, such estimates often gloss over how much gas is economically recoverable. In the Powder River Basin, the Energy Department study said that as much as 29 trillion cubic feet might be recovered in a cost-effective way. But it noted that the number could vary widely, depending on how particular environmental safeguards were adopted.
Environmentalists say any realistic cost-benefit analysis makes coal-bed methane look much less rosy.

More Drilling Than Grazing
In the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, where ranch land is as rugged as any in the West, gas wells outnumber cattle two to one. Over the last 15 years, the basin has been the pioneer in the coal-bed methane process.
Pinon and juniper woodlands are interwoven with thousands of miles of roads and pipelines. With 20,000 gas wells in production and at least 10,000 more planned, a swath of federal land the size of Connecticut accounts for 80 percent of the coal-bed methane produced in the United States.
Increasingly, however, the state's pride in coal-bed methane, which is a major source of tax revenue, is mixed with misgivings. Ranchers like Tweeti Blancett, a sixth-generation New Mexican, warn that a fragile balance between production and conservation is falling badly out of whack.
"We are a multiple-use land, and we understand that," Ms. Blancett said the other day, bouncing along roads rutted by drilling rigs and water tankers on land that is owned by the federal government but leased for both ranching and energy exploration. "But we want industry to understand that there are other users out there."
Ms. Blancett, a lifelong Republican, was Mr. Bush's political organizer in northwestern New Mexico for the 2000 presidential campaign. In November, she and her husband, Linn, and two other ranching families locked out energy companies whose plumbing of the gas beneath the surface of the land, they say, threatens their livelihood.
They call it an act of desperation. The industry has derided it as a publicity stunt. But many in New Mexico describe it as emblematic of a growing unease about the effect of coal-bed methane on the state's landscape and the ranchers' way of life.
"It would be disingenuous to pretend that there aren't impacts," said Steve Henke, director of the land management bureau office in Farmington, N.M. He oversees nearly all energy exploration in the basin because the federal government owns all but a tiny fraction of the land.
"If people are looking for peace and quiet and solitude, they're not going to find it in the oil patch," Mr. Henke said.
Oil and gas exploration is not new to the basin. The first drilling rigs arrived nearly a half-century ago. But it was not until the late 1980's, when drilling began to increase, that the relationship between ranchers and energy companies turned adversarial.
"It may be a clean fuel," said Don Schreiber, a rancher who joined the Blancetts and another rancher, Chris Velasquez, in locking out the energy companies, "but it is a very dirty business."
Across the basin, energy exploration occupies 8 percent of the land. Coal-bed methane production has pumped out 5.8 billion gallons of groundwater since the late 1980's. Nearly all of this water -- most of it unsuitable for drinking or agriculture -- has been reinjected deep underground.
Energy leases in the San Juan Basin date from the 1950's and 1960's, long before coal beds were explored for natural gas. The leases have allowed producers broader latitude than would be permitted under tighter environmental regulations today.
Ranchers say the effects have been upsetting, including cattle killed by traffic and spilled chemicals, and erosion set in motion by roads, pipelines and drilling pads.
The land bureau concedes that its oversight has failed to keep pace, and it has stepped up enforcement. Partly because of the impact of drilling, the bureau has reduced the number of cattle it allows to graze on federal land. The year-round total is now fewer than 10,000 head, down from the hundreds of thousands that roamed the dry highlands early this century.
In financial terms, ranchers in the basin have become insignificant tenants on federal land. They pay the government a total of about $100,000 a year for grazing rights. Energy companies pay about $350 million in federal royalties on gas they produce.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Henke says it may be wrong to imagine that the interests of ranchers and energy production can be balanced to the satisfaction of all.
"Ranchers are losing out to the energy industry in terms of their capability to grow grass," Mr. Henke said.
"Stepping back, though, what's in the public interest? It's not that this area is unsuited to ranching. But we've got a world-class gas resource here."

The Big Gas Play in Wyoming
Early next year, the federal regulatory gates are set to swing open in the Powder River Basin. When they do, there is almost certainly going to be a rush by ranchers to hire lawyers and file lawsuits.
Part of the reason is split ownership of land. Of the eight million acres in the basin, three-quarters of the surface rights are privately owned, while about two-thirds of subsurface rights are federally owned and leased to energy companies.
These numbers mean that most of the basin's 4,000 ranch families will have no choice but to put up with strangers on their land for the next 10 to 15 years. Except for nominal access fees, most ranchers will get little financial benefit from the hundreds of millions of dollars in gas revenue generated beneath their land.
As it is in the San Juan Basin, the land bureau will be charged with a seemingly impossible task. Under orders from the Bush administration -- which requires the agency to fill out an "energy impact statement" whenever it denies a drilling permit -- the agency is expected to cut through red tape and make it easy for drilling companies to get to work fast.
But the agency will also have to deal with increasingly angry ranchers, litigious environmental groups and a nervous state on Wyoming's northern border. They have all had a sneak preview of the fuss coal-bed methane can cause.
So has Wyoming's governor-elect, Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat. He believes that the ranchers' restiveness and the threat of environmental damage from coal-bed methane are "huge problems," said his chief of staff, Phil Noble.
Drilling began about five years ago on state and private land in the Powder River Basin. More than 15,000 wells are already in the ground. While many have been well managed, some have triggered uncontrolled water runoff, flooded pastures, eroded land and pumped large amounts of salty water into streams and creeks.
Rivers from the basin flow north to Montana, where irrigators have pressured their own government to demand strict limits on the salinity of the water that comes out of Wyoming. 
In the last year, the land bureau has lost two court challenges to its environmental plan for opening federal lands to gas drilling in the basin. A rewrite of the plans is expected in January, and the agency says it is ready to handle the permitting of 39,000 new wells, while protecting the environment.
"We have staffed up to handle the situation," said Richard Zander, resource manager for the agency in Buffalo, Wyo. "Our intent is not to leave a scar on the land."
Local environmental groups and many ranchers are skeptical. They point out that federal and state law does not require energy companies to repair all drilling damage. Companies do have to put up bonds, but they cover only the removal of drill pads and water impoundment ponds -- not the removal of roads and other scars.
Ranchers can negotiate binding surface agreements to cover such damage, but to do so they need legal help.
"If you have enough money to spend on lawyers, you might get somewhere," said Jill Morrison, senior organizer for the Powder River Basin Resource Council, a local environmental group.
Then, as always in the arid West, there is the question of water. Little of the 3.2 million acre-feet of water pumped out in the Powder River Basin will be pumped back into the ground. Companies say it is too expensive. Some water will naturally filter back into the ground, and some can be used for livestock or crops, but the federal government estimates that 57 percent to 85 percent will be lost to runoff and evaporation.
Neither Wyoming nor the federal government assigns any monetary value to the wasted water, state and federal officials say. Accordingly, energy companies need pay nothing for its disappearance.
Because of the water issue -- and the high probability that drilling in the Powder River Basin will disturb wildlife -- one prominent energy executive in Wyoming says that coal-bed methane drilling cannot be considered environmentally sound.
"Looking after the Earth is a pay-as-you-go process, but they don't have a plan like that here," said Raymond Plank, chairman of the board of Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas and oil companies in the United States. It does not operate coal-bed wells in Wyoming.
"What happened here is ready, fire, aim," Mr. Plank said.
He said that if energy companies had to pay for the water they waste, as well as put up bonds to cover all costs of restoring land when wells run dry, they would not make money in the basin.
"I don't happen to think that this gas here is probably economically viable with responsible land and water practices," he said.
Mr. Plank, it should be noted, has a Wyoming rancher's bias. A 20,000-acre ranch he has owned for decades and recently donated to a nonprofit foundation has been scarred by coal-bed methane drilling.

HEADLINE: To Balance Books, Oregon Districts Try Fewer School Days 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Across Oregon, schools struggling to save money in this year of budget woes have come up with a response: shorten the academic year.
 No other states have done that, education watchdog groups said this week. Laws in most states require 180 days of school. 
 But a loophole in Oregon's laws allows its school districts to deviate from the requirements for two school years, and that has led superintendents around the state to consider chopping as many as 15 days from the academic calendar.
Other states are cutting teacher pay, increasing class size, not filling vacancies and laying off employees, said Dave Griffith, the director of public affairs for the National Association of State Boards of Education.
"They are looking at the curriculum; postponing the kinds of things that are seen as extraneous, like school construction; increasing student fees for extracurriculars. It runs the gamut," Mr. Griffith said.
But in Oregon, school officials, who depend on the state government for 70 percent of their budgets, say they have no choice but to cut days.
Because the state's tax revenue is declining, spending on schools has been cut $178 million this year. Voters will decide on a three-year income tax increase in a special election in January, The increase would avert $95 million more in school cuts, but polls suggest it will not pass.
"Our options are starting to get pretty thin," Rob Saxton, superintendent of a suburban Portland school district, said recently.
Business leaders say they are worried that cuts may hurt Oregon's effort to attract new jobs. They say a reputation for bad schools will discourage companies from moving here.
High school students say they are worried that fewer hours in the classroom will hinder their preparation for college. State legislators are under pressure not to make further cuts in education, which consumes 43 percent of Oregon's budget.
"This has attracted a lot of attention," said Gene Evans, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Education. "We are getting the reputation that something is going on in Oregon."
Most districts are not planning to end the school year early. More likely, schools will close on some Fridays through the end of the school year, saving districts from having to pay unemployment benefits to school employees, which are required after five straight days without work. That has angered the teachers' union.
Some of the state's rural districts already have no-school Fridays to reduce costs. But they lengthen the remaining school days to make up the time. That would not be done in the budget-shortened years.
This approach to cutting costs is possible because Oregon requires only that districts adhere to a "standard school year," Mr. Evans said. The definition is left up to the state Board of Education, which requires about 165 days, allowing for six hours a day in classes.
Districts can apply for a waiver to offer fewer hours this school year. In dire circumstances, the waiver can be extended through June 2004. But starting in September 2004, Mr. Evans said, the district must restore the hours, or face serious consequences, including a loss of state financing and accreditation.
Cutting classroom hours is likely to generate a fight with the teachers' union -- one reason other states have avoided it, said Kathy Christie, vice president of the Education Commission of the States, in Denver.
"If you are cutting 18 days or so, that's a significant pay reduction," Ms. Christie said.

HEADLINE: Insurgents Create Growing Instability in Nepal 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: BHIMSEN NAGAR, Nepal 

 BODY:
His former neighbors describe him as "kindhearted" and "generous." His junior high teacher changed his name to "Lotus Flower" because he was so gentle and handsome. His father still shows off pictures of him as a grown man tenderly placing his hand on his mother's forehead as she lay dying of leukemia.
 "It was his habit to make people smile," said his father, Mukti Ram Dahal, in a rare interview with a foreign journalist. "He used to do it with everybody." 
 But to the rest of Nepal and to the outside world, the man now known by the nom de guerre Prachanda, or "the fierce one," is the leader of a violent Maoist insurgency that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since 1996 in this mountain kingdom that sits as a buffer between India and China. 
The United States has grown so concerned that it is providing $17 million in military equipment and sending American soldiers to train Nepal's army, a move that has Chinese officials worried about American meddling in their backyard. 
A post-Mao, quasi-capitalist Beijing disowns the rebels and accuses them of "usurping the name of the leader of the Chinese people." Indian officials, meanwhile, fear a rising tide of refugees and what a Maoist victory could do to re-energize sputtering insurgencies in their own country. 
The insurgents, who call themselves the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), modeled after Peru's own Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, have seized control of 40 percent of Nepal and paralyzed its economy and political system. 
Their success has been led by Prachanda, 48, who has managed to deepen the support for his movement by portraying himself as a Nepalese Robin Hood facing down corrupt and ineffective governments. 
Brilliant and charismatic to his followers, fanatical and opportunistic to his enemies, Prachanda, the son of a poor but upper-caste farmer, demands the eradication of chronic rural poverty and abolition of Nepal's constitutional monarchy, which he calls a "eunuch parliamentary monarchy." His war has exposed Nepal's vast inequalities, self-interested elite and, to the surprise of many longtime Western residents, potential for savagery.
"Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is undefeatable because it is a system based on truth," Prachanda said in an interview with a Nepalese newspaper in 1997, a year after he declared a "people's war" on "imperialists" and "reactionaries." "Marxism says the reactionaries continue to create problems until they are eliminated."
Since then, the Maoists stand accused of killing 800 civilians deemed "enemies of the revolution," kidnapping, extortion, forced conscription and the use of child soldiers. The Royal Nepalese Army, dispatched a year ago to crush the insurgents, has proven no kinder to its people, human rights groups say. Government troops are accused of secret detentions, torture and killing as many as 2,000 civilians and unarmed prisoners in the past year.
Since the army joined the fight a year ago, the number of deaths has increased from hundreds a year to 4,300 in the last year alone. A once peaceful tourist destination now stands as one of the world's bloodiest corners.
While their ideology may seem antiquated, the group's members have emerged as master tacticians and motivators who quickly surround government posts with 1,000 to 2,000 fighters before overwhelming them. They have also shown a keen, and in some ways curious, interest in how they are perceived. 
The group sent an open letter last March to foreign tourists explaining that they would not be attacked in Nepal. It begins "warmest greetings from the materially poor but spiritually rich people of Nepal." A letter sent to world leaders blaming the government for the failure of peace talks last year concludes with the line "looking forward to cordial and mutually beneficial relations in the days to come." 
Chhabi Lal Dahal, as Prachanda was known then, was born in a mountain village near the town of Pokhara in central Nepal in December 1954, the eldest of eight children. The timing of his birth was considered propitious; in Nepalese astrology, having an eldest son in December signals good things to come. 
When Prachanda was 6 or 7, the family moved along with hundreds of thousand of others from the mountains of central and northern Nepal to the country's fertile southern plains after King Mahendra, the Hindu kingdom's ruler at the time, decreed democratic elections and large-scale land reform. A year later, the king reversed his decision, dissolved Parliament and arrested top political leaders. The family was left stranded in this village of 25 families, today a jumbled and impoverished mix of the country's many ethnic groups and castes just outside of Bharatpur.
Balaram Bishwakarma, a lower-caste Dalit, or "untouchable," recalled how Prachanda bounced him on his lap when they were both children. "He treated every other kid as one of his brothers," he said.
Umanath Lamichhane, a 60-year-old farmer, glowed when he spoke about him. "He was such a kind-hearted man," he said.
Neighbors recalled asking Prachanda to settle petty disputes and seeing him move dozens of landless families to vacant, government-owned grazing areas. His leadership abilities quickly emerged.
"Everyone who met him would be very quickly impressed, and would stand to listen to hear what he had to say," said a former Maoist activist who attended a local agriculture college with him.
By the time Prachanda graduated in 1978, he held a bachelor's degree and a radical Maoist perspective.
Chinkali Shrestha, headmaster of a high school where Prachanda later went to teach horticulture, recalled being struck by his absolute confidence that Maoism would triumph.
Prachanda and other Maoist leaders took their hard-line Communist faction underground in 1996, after winning only 9 of the 205 seats in Parliament in earlier elections. Government officials initially scoffed at the group. But within months, Prachanda and other leaders had created a highly organized insurgency. 
They overran isolated police posts to obtain weapons. They robbed banks to obtain money. They banned drinking, gambling, trafficking in women and domestic violence. They staged plays that depicted caste and ethnic discrimination to recruit cadres. They soon became active in more than half of the country's 75 districts, forming shadow "people's governments" in 22 of them.
At first, civilian government officials countered the insurgents with brutal police sweeps. The corruption, ineffectiveness and harsh methods of successive governments also aided the insurgents' cause.
Over time, the Maoists' methods, too, grew more brutal. Villagers were forced at gunpoint to join their cause and pay a war "tax." Teachers and local activists were kidnapped and murdered. Mainstream politicians were beheaded.
A recent poll found that if the Maoists were to put down their arms today, they would win at best 10 percent of the seats in Parliament -- double their showing before, but not enough to control the government.
While both Prachanda and government leaders frequently express a willingness to talk, negotiations have yet to materialize. Infighting between the country's king, Gyanendra, and its mainstream political parties has also hindered the peace effort.
A recent photo captured by the army shows Prachanda as a bearded, pot-bellied man who scarcely resembles the rail-thin figure who cared for his dying mother. Critics joke that his belly symbolizes his own corruption. Prachanda's son, Prakash Dahal, who is in his 20's and apparently part of the movement, stands a few feet away from him.
Asked about how he felt about his son, Prachanda's father said in the interview that he feared for his son's life but also that he was proud that "this great revolutionary leader is a son of mine." He also added a caveat that echoed the sentiment of many in Nepal as the death toll soars.
"I also would like some kind of settlement to this problem," he said. "I'd also like to see a situation where people from either side are not killed."

HEADLINE: Chinese Dissident Relishes a First Taste of Freedom, and Exile 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
His eggs were getting cold, but Xu Wenli, newly arrived in New York, was too riled up to eat. After spending 16 of the last 21 years in a Chinese prison for his pro-democracy activities, Mr. Xu, who was released Tuesday, was distracted by talk of capitalism, Communism and the apparent liberties that even American pigeons enjoy.
 "Look at that," he said Friday, marveling at the sight of a plump bird that was holding its own against the throngs of Lower Broadway. "Here, even a pigeon can live freely. In China, he would have already ended up on someone's dinner table." 
 In the 48 hours after his Christmas-Eve release and exile to the United States, Mr. Xu, one of China's leading dissidents, talked nonstop: with his wife and daughter, the Chinese-language press and the American human rights advocates who had been pushing for his freedom since December 1998, when he was convicted of "subverting the state" for trying to set up the independent China Democracy Party. After serving less than a third of his 13-year sentence, Mr. Xu was unexpectedly released on what Chinese officials described as medical parole. Mr. Xu, 59, suffers from hepatitis B, which he says he contracted during his years in Beijing's Yangqing prison. 
In the days since his arrival from China, Mr. Xu's daughter, Jin, has had to ply him with sleeping pills to get him to rest.
"After so many years of separation from my family, the words keep coming out," Mr. Xu said, speaking in Chinese, his hands slicing the air for emphasis. In the coming days, he and his wife, He Xintong, will go to Providence, R.I., where their daughter is an art teacher.
Mr. Xu's release is viewed as a goodwill gesture by Chinese officials eager to burnish the country's human rights record. Although the White House praised the move, human rights groups here called it a cynical attempt to curry favor with the Bush administration. Thousands of others, they say, remain in prison for nonviolent political activity.
"I'm thrilled and delighted that Xu has been freed but it's really just a token move," said Mickey Spiegel, a senior researcher at the New York-based Human Rights Watch. "From my count, there are 10 other China Democracy members still in jail and last week, the government picked up four or five people who had posted political writings on the Internet."
Mr. Xu, an electrical engineer, first ran into trouble with the authorities during the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement, when he was editor of an unauthorized political journal. In 1981 he was arrested and for months held in secret while his family frantically sought to find him. "We didn't know if he was dead or alive," said his wife.
In 1982 he was convicted of counterrevolution and sentenced to 15 years, but was paroled after 12. The years Mr. Xu spent in prison, many of them in solitary confinement, did little to quell his passion for politics. After his release in 1993, he was relatively quiet but never lost his commitment to civil rights.
In 1998, emboldened by the impending visit of President Bill Clinton, he and several others stepped up their activities, openly calling for free labor unions and independent political parties. By the end of the year he was under arrest again and sentenced during a secret trial. 
Sitting in a noisy diner on Friday morning with his wife and daughter, Mr. Xu used a napkin to sketch out the accommodations he had shared with three other men, two of them convicted murderers on death row. He drew the room where seven guards sat and the black circles that represented rotating video cameras -- including one in the shower -- that recorded his every move.
"There are only 200 traffic cameras in all of Beijing and they had 8 for me," he said, laughing. "I think they kicked me out because I was costing too much money."
Last week, prison guards led him into a waiting vehicle. He was unsure where he was headed until the car drove onto the tarmac of Beijing's international airport, stopping at a plane bound for Chicago. Inside, he was stunned to find his wife, also headed for the United States. 
Mr. Xu said he was still unnerved by what he called a last-minute act of treachery by prison officials who secretly removed hundreds of his wife's letters and about 30 books from his luggage. The books, he said, contained personal thoughts he had scribbled in the margins over the years. "That one little cruelty provides great insight into the way the government works," he said. "They couldn't stop me from going to America but they knew they could hurt me one last time."
Over the years, hepatitis has weakened his body and poor nourishment, he said, has led to the loss of several teeth. A visit to World Trade Center site left him winded. However, the impromptu memorials reminded him of the hundreds of protesters who died during the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square.
"The young students loved their country and died for it, but there's no place in China to pay your respects to their loss," he said. 
In the coming months he will seek treatment for his illness and try to learn English. "Eventually I want to see the world, see how other democracies work and then figure out how to make China more open," he said.
Asked if China's newly appointed Communist Party chief, Hu Jintao, might do more to encourage human rights than his predecessors, Mr. Xu grimaced and uttered one of the few English words he knows: "No."
Only continued economic liberalization and the yearnings of a growing middle class, he said, can bring about real change.
Despite his own good fortunes, Mr. Xu said he was haunted by the plight of friends, incarcerated or harassed, he had to leave behind. "It's hard to feel joy," he said, "when so many others are still suffering."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S. READIES PLAN TO RAISE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has prepared a comprehensive strategy to increase financial and political pressure on North Korea if it does not abandon its effort to make nuclear weapons, according to senior administration officials.
 Under the new policy, the United Nations Security Council could threaten economic sanctions, and the American military might intercept missile shipments to deprive the North of money from weapon sales. North Korea's neighbors could also reduce economic ties to Pyongyang, though Washington is not now pressing them to do so. 
 Administration officials said the threat of growing isolation was the best way to force North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. The officials said the United States was not striving to bring down the regime, but that if North Korea refuses to change course it would face increasing hardship and could be confronted by the prospect of economic collapse. They also said that under their plan, which they call "tailored containment," they are willing to negotiate with North Korea but only if it first dismantles its nuclear weapons program. 
To offer new incentives, officials say, would be to reward the North Korean government for failing to live up to earlier commitments.
"It is called 'tailored containment' because this is an entirely different situation than Iraq or Iran," a senior administration official said. "It is a lot about putting political stress and putting economic stress. It also requires maximum multinational cooperation."
But the Bush administration's new containment policy is coming under criticism from former United States officials and proliferation experts. They say that the allied nations are unlikely to apply the pressure that would be needed to shake the North Korean economy and that the policy lacks a vital element: an open channel for direct American diplomacy with North Korea. 
"The administration's policy is a gamble that the North Korean regime will collapse before it acquires a substantial nuclear arsenal that threatens the stability of East Asia," said Robert J. Einhorn, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who led negotiations with the North Koreans during the Clinton administration.
"It's also a gamble that our relationship with our South Korean ally can survive a lengthy period of isolating and pressuring North Korea," Mr. Einhorn said. "Engaging North Korea has its downsides, but those must be weighed against the risks of not engaging." 
By most accounts, North Korea's nuclear efforts have created the most serious crisis in northeast Asia in a decade. Today, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it would withdraw two inspectors by Tuesday at the request of North Korea, which it said was acting in defiance of international obligations. 
American intelligence agencies believe that North Korea already has enough plutonium for one or two weapons. But it is a position to rapidly expand its supply, no small worry given that it has long sought to make money by exporting missiles. 
By reprocessing spent fuel from their research reactor at Yongbyon, North Korea could acquire about five bombs' worth of plutonium in six months or perhaps less, according to administration officials and experts outside government.
Restarting the Yongbyon reactor, as the North Koreans also seem intent on doing, would enable the country to churn out enough plutonium to build a bomb a year.
The eventual construction of a cascade network for enriching uranium would give North Korea yet another means of expanding its nuclear arsenal. The system could be finished in about the middle of the decade and could produce enough fissile material for two bombs a year, according to the Central Intelligence Agency.
North Korea has long been one of the most vexing foreign policy problems for the United States. The Clinton administration was faced with a similar crisis in the early 1990's when the nation removed the fuel from Yongbyon and indicated it might reprocess the spent fuel to produce bomb-grade plutonium.
The Clinton administration developed plans for a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea's reprocessing plant before it managed to reach an accommodation with Pyongyang. Under the deal, North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately eliminate its nuclear program.
In return, Washington promised a multinational effort to ship fuel oil to North Korea and to build two light-water nuclear reactors, which could provide North Korea with electricity but which Clinton administration officials said would be less useful in producing bomb-grade material.
In its final year, the Clinton administration tried to negotiate an agreement that would have required North Korea to give up its long-range missiles and end its missile exports, but President Bill Clinton's term ended before the agreement could be completed.
Later, North Korean diplomats indicated that they wanted to continue the talks with the Bush administration. But new administration was far more skeptical of the North's intentions. 
As the South Koreans expressed concern that Washington's approach would increase tensions on the Korean peninsula, the Bush administration insisted that it was prepared to begin talks with North Korea anytime and anywhere. 
At the same time, President Bush declared that he considered North Korea to be part of an "axis of evil" that included Iraq and Iran, a stance that surprised the North Koreans and fueled worries in the South that Washington was taking a position that was confrontational.
Earlier this year as administration officials prepared for their first diplomatic mission to North Korea, they fleshed out their negotiating strategy in a policy they called the "bold approach." The long-term goal of the strategy was the political and economic transformation of North Korea. 
Under that approach, the administration would not only ask North Korea to forswear efforts to make weapons of mass destruction; it would also ask it to reform its dismal human rights practices and to begin withdrawing conventional forces that are deployed near the demilitarized zone with South Korea and which threaten Seoul.
Washington never spelled out what it was prepared to give in return, but United States officials suggested it could have included economic investment and diplomatic recognition. 
"The notion was that they were headed toward a dead end, that the only way out was to forgo weapons of mass destruction, change their economy and improve human rights," a United States official said. "The point was to begin the process of transforming their country and the U.S. would respond at each step of the way." 
Some former officials believe that the new negotiating strategy was unrealistic. But before the Bush administration could present its new negotiating approach, American intelligence received fresh evidence that North Korea had begun a clandestine program to enrich uranium to make nuclear arms. 
In essence, North Korea had circumvented the agreement it made with the Clinton administration to freeze its plutonium production by moving to develop a new source of fissile material.
In October, James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, arrived in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, for what the North Koreans thought would be the first diplomatic opening. Mr. Kelly told the North Koreans that the United States had no intention of invading North Korea but had concerns about its record on human rights and its conventional military buildup.
Mr. Kelly also indicated that North Korea intended to shelve its "bold approach" and that Pyongyang would have to dismantle its uranium enrichment program before serious talks could continue. 
The two days of meetings did not go well. Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan suggested that North Korea had no need for the "bold approach" and that the people and the army loved Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader.
First Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju said North Korea was entitled to have nuclear weapons. He said the North Koreans needed a nonaggression pact with the United States and suggested that critical issues should be settled at a meeting between North Korea's leader and Mr. Bush.
Back in Washington, the Bush administration hammered out its new containment strategy. The delivery of fuel oil was halted. Officials said the plan to build light-water reactors could be scrapped.
Other steps to increase the "stress" on North Korea's economy were discussed. 
But the North Koreans did not relent. Instead of agreeing to dismantle their nuclear program, they announced that they would restart the Yongbyon reactor, expel inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, remove monitoring equipment and reopen the factory that reprocesses plutonium.
Experts have offered various theories about North Korea's motivations. Some say the North Koreans want to negotiate with Washington from a position of strength. 
Others speculate that North Korea has concluded that it is unlikely to extract substantial concessions from the Bush administration, has watched the United States make invasion plans for Iraq and has concluded that its security is best safeguarded by a nuclear buildup. 
"I think the Bush administration's tough rhetoric and tough policies toward North Korea have unnerved the North Koreans and perhaps led them to conclude that the only way for them to ensure security is to confront the world with a fait accompli by rapidly acquiring a substantial nuclear arsenal," Mr. Einhorn said. 
There is also considerable debate about the Bush administration's strategy. 
"Tailored containment was constructed to enable us to move in a number of different directions," a senior administration official said. "The main objective at the moment is to get them to give up their nuclear weapons program. If they don't, we can work with allies to increase their isolation. No one anticipates that North Korea will collapse right away. But we won't do anything to prop them up, and we will let the internal forces continue to work away." 
Senior Bush administration officials also say that they would be giving in to blackmail by offering new incentives and that North Korea's clandestine efforts to produce highly enriched uranium demonstrate that the Clinton negotiating approach does not work.
But skeptics say the policy of relying on allies will not work, in part because they are not prepared to use their full leverage to press for and possibly encourage the collapse of North Korea, an event that they fear would sow chaos in their region. 
China, American officials acknowledge, has not pressed the North Koreans as hard as Washington would like and is unlikely to support economic sanctions. South Korea's new president, for his part, has come to office on a platform that called for increased interaction with North Korea, not the increased its isolation.
"The third parties do not seem to want to put a lot of pressure on North Korea," said Joel Wit, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former State Department specialist on North Korea.

HEADLINE: The Rise and Fall of Murder in New York; 
Face of Police Work Has Changed, but Killings Are Down to 1963's Rate

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
There was no 911 emergency number. The Police Department had 25,500 officers, most of them men and almost all of them white. Most patrolmen walked a beat, without a radio, communicating through a network of street-corner call boxes. There was no DNA analysis or computerized ballistic fingerprinting. And the Supreme Court had yet to issue its ruling in a case called Miranda, so officers were not required to read suspects their rights.
 That was the New York City Police Department in 1963. Today, the force of about 38,000 responds to roughly 1,000 calls to 911 every day. Officers patrol the city mostly in cars, aided by a range of technology that seemed unimaginable in 1963. Computers in some patrol cars today can check motor vehicle data and criminal records. A pilot program lets some officers check records with pager-size devices worn on their belts. A hair or a droplet of blood can help solve a crime, lasers trace the paths of bullets and equipment can pinpoint a cellphone's location to track criminals on the run. 
 These changes over 39 years in law enforcement in the city provide the backdrop for a striking increase in the rate at which New Yorkers kill one another -- and then a decline perhaps even more striking in that rate. More than a decade after its homicide rate peaked at 2,245, in 1990, the city, with 573 killings as of yesterday afternoon, is set to end 2002 with fewer than 600 homicides for the first time since 1963.
The low murder rates of the early 60's conjure a perception of a more tranquil era, when crime was of little concern, when children walked to school without fear, when their parents were free from worry. It seems long ago: a subway ride was 15 cents, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge had yet to link Brooklyn and Staten Island, and the Mets were a comically inept expansion team in their second season, getting ready to move into their new home, a place called Shea Stadium.
But 1963 in New York City was not so tranquil. The 548 killings that year represented a significant increase over 508 the year before, and some of the men who investigated homicides recall concern about the rising rate, and about a city widely viewed as sometimes violent and dangerous.
"Of course it was busy, because we don't solve them like they do on television; it takes weeks" and sometimes longer, said Samuel K. Drexler, 80, who supervised a team of detectives in 1963 as a sergeant in the Manhattan North Homicide Squad. "There was always pressure."
Homicide detectives today work much the same way their predecessors did 40 years ago. New technology notwithstanding, some changes in the city's culture have made their jobs harder. Several investigators who worked in the 1960's said that the simplicity of that earlier age often made solving crimes easier, and that the more transient nature of today's society can complicate the task of catching killers.
"A Harlem homicide was easier to solve because people lived up there, they worked up there and they died up there," Mr. Drexler said. "Now everyone is on the move, everything is fluid, people are strangers where they live. It's got to be a little more difficult to come up with a suspect."
One of the most infamous crimes in 1963 was a double homicide in which Janice Wylie, 21, a copy clerk at Newsweek, and Emily Hoffert, 23, a teacher, were killed in the apartment they shared on East 88th Street near Fifth Avenue. They were bound ankles to wrists with strips of bedsheets and repeatedly stabbed and beaten with soda bottles. The attack came to be known as the Career Girl Murders. Although the term is itself an anachronism today, the killings symbolized the kind of seemingly random violence that then, as now, could make New Yorkers feel vulnerable.
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly joined the department as a cadet in 1961, when Mr. Drexler was supervising homicide investigations in Harlem. Mr. Kelly first worked as a switchboard operator at the old police headquarters on Centre Street, where he patched together calls by plugging heavy wires into a wall-size switch panel. Violence began to rise in the late 1960's, driven largely by the drug trade -- which pushed up the number of homicides, especially when crack became prevalent in the 1980's -- and by the increasing availability of powerful handguns.
"The world seemed to change dramatically as far as crime is concerned in the late 60's," said Mr. Kelly, who these days uses a Nextel cellphone. He cited not only the rise in drug-related violence, but also a broader atmosphere of crime and unrest fostered by the killing of police officers by black militants and the protest movement that was growing against the war in Vietnam.
Most experts and investigators agree that despite the precipitous drop in the number of homicides, the reasons people kill have not changed much. Homicide is still most often about love, hate and greed. And narcotics, in one way or another, have long played a role in murder, although killings over drug turf became more common in the 1980's and 1990's, perhaps because the organized crime figures of an earlier era quickly crushed challenges to their market hegemony.
The reasons for the stunning drop in killings remain something of a mystery, according to many experts and social scientists who have followed New York's declining crime rates.
Police officials point to the department's vaunted Compstat system, which uses an exhaustive computer analysis of where crimes occur to better deploy police resources to hot spots, and a nearly 40 percent increase in the number of police officers. But other analysts cite a wide range of factors, from drops in drug use to the economy and the city's arrest over the last decade of roughly a million people on minor violations for which they spent the night in jail.
Whatever is behind the decline, it has continued despite a downturn in the economy; a shrinking police force, which has been whittled away by the city's budget crisis; and rising crime rates elsewhere in the nation. 
The basic work that detectives do after a killing, like cordoning off the crime scene and photographing it, collecting evidence and canvassing for witnesses, has changed little. But now, when investigators lift fingerprints and find ballistic evidence, like bullets and shell casings, they can enter their findings into state and federal computer systems that compare them with the fingerprints of millions of people who have been arrested or to bullets and shell casings from guns used in other crimes.
Other developments in technology that are not often associated with crime-fighting are regularly used to track criminals, trace property taken from homicide victims or other victims of crimes and better understand the relationships between criminals and victims. Detectives can now use phone records to make connections between a suspect and a victim, or among suspects. They can track a person's movements through a MetroCard or E-ZPass. They can pull A.T.M. records or surveillance camera videos at A.T.M.'s or in other locations.
DNA can link killers to their victims, not just in sex crimes but also in cases where the attacker may have bled at the crime scene, smoked a cigarette, drank from a glass or struggled with a victim, leaving behind cells in any number of ways, including hair or bits of skin caught under the victim's fingernails.
But most investigators agree that no conceivable technological development could ever replace a seasoned investigator's ability to talk to people and a knowledge of the environment where killings occur.
"As has always been true, the devil is in the details, and so far, only a good investigator has been able to find him there," one veteran detective said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Millions Given, and Thousands of Lives Are Touched

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO 

 BODY:
After nine decades, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is still touching readers, still inspiring acts of generosity and compassion for those in despair.
 For the first seven weeks of this, the 91st Neediest Cases campaign, it seemed as if not even a sluggish economy could stop the flow of donations to the seven local charities supported by the fund. Through mid-December, the number of new donors was up by 8 percent. 
 For a while, the campaign was ahead of last year's in the amount of donations, too. But going into the Christmas holiday, that figure slipped behind last year's. 
"In the face of tough times economically, we're gratified to see the strong increase in first-time donors," said Jack Rosenthal, the president of The New York Times Neediest Cases Foundation. "Their contributions reflect growing public awareness of the increase in desperation."
The Neediest Cases Fund was established on Christmas Day in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, The Times's publisher. He started the charity after meeting an impoverished man who was looking for food on Christmas Eve, 1911. Mr. Ochs decided to publish the stories of New Yorkers facing hardships, hoping that the details of their lives would be a powerful call for financial assistance.
The charities supported are some of the oldest and most respected in New York: the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, the Children's Aid Society, the Community Service Society of New York, the Catholic Charities Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and UJA-Federation of New York. Over the campaign's history, it has raised over $132 million, including some $4.9 million so far this year.
This year, for the first time, Neediest Cases articles have appeared regularly in the newspaper's national edition. Officials at The Times attribute the increase in first-time donors to that national reach.
Donations have come from across the map: Hawaii to Texas to Maine. So, too, have the letters, in response to profiles of some of those who have been helped through tough times by the charities and Neediest Cases.
In one case, a fifth-grade class from Keysor Elementary School in Kirkwood, Mo., about 12 miles south of St. Louis, sent 18 letters of encouragement to Max Noto, an 11-year-old boy who suffers from eczema, a skin rash, after Max and his mother, who live in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, were profiled in November. His mother, Josephine, was able to go to school to become a hairdresser while Max was in day camp, which was partly paid for by the Neediest Cases Fund. The 10- and 11-year-olds wrote that they understood what it was like to be bullied, and to worry about their mothers; they said they were proud that Max was overcoming adversity. 
As Dustin Rios, 10, summed it up in his letter, "Good things happen to good people, and you sound like a great person."
Another reason for the early strength of this year's campaign may involve the events of 9/11. Officials at The Times said that last year's Neediest campaign was in competition with The Times 9/11 Neediest Fund. The 9/11 fund raised $62 million for people affected by the terrorist attacks.
This year, without the 9/11 fund, people returned in force to the Neediest campaign in the early weeks to make donations. 
One factor detracting from this year's fund-raising may be a general decline in charitable donations. Many charities across the city are experiencing such drops this year. A recent article in Crain's New York Business stated that "donations to charities across New York are plummeting with some campaigns down by more than 50 percent." Still, Neediest Cases officials remain optimistic about the campaign's ability to raise public awareness. They are buoyed by letters from people who have donated money thus far.
One such letter, from Joseph Feeks in Edgartown, Mass., included 33 checks totaling $1,503 for Neediest Cases.
The money was raised on a kayaking trip around Manhattan by Mr. Feeks and Deborah Pigeon, two sea kayakers from Martha's Vineyard.
"It really started out as a personal goal," Mr. Feeks said. "We said, "It's not every day you paddle around Manhattan -- is there any way we can turn this into a fund-raiser?' "
To the two kayakers, the logic was clear: if they were going to enjoy the skyline, it seemed appropriate to give something back to New York.
"It's my understanding that you have stopped soliciting donations for your special 9/11 fund, but we trust that this money will still be put to good use," Mr. Feeks wrote. "Even if it's to help charities that may have suffered when so many donations were diverted to 9/11 causes."
In fact, many of the donors' stories are colorful, and as varied as those of the people they have pledged to help.
One woman, from Teaneck, N.J., made her annual donation this year to continue her parents' tradition of giving to the fund since its inception.
A family asked that gifts to their son for his bar mitzvah be checks made payable to the Neediest Fund.
A 9-year-old boy from Wilton, Conn., raised $12.75 for the campaign by selling lemonade last summer. 
And one generous donor wrote that she had recently lost her job. Reading the articles, she said, made her "suddenly feel terribly lucky to have what I have."

HEADLINE: No Longer Snickering, Suffolk Discovers Nassau's Disease Is Catching 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Dec. 26 

 BODY:
When wealthy Nassau County neared bankruptcy a few years ago, becoming a governmental laughingstock, its neighbor to the east, Suffolk, looked on as any neighbor and occasional rival might -- with a mixture of horror and smugness.
 There has always been a bit of jostling between Long Island's two counties. So it was to be expected that as the richer, closer-to-New York, somewhat more cosmopolitan Nassau County experienced bitter squabbles among lawmakers, an insurance scandal that cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, and severe budget shortfalls, Suffolk rested on its laurels, which included a genial lawmaking process, a solid budget, and few governmental scandals. 
 In recent months, though, as Nassau has started turning itself around, albeit under threat of a state takeover, Suffolk's fortunes have taken a turn for the worse. The County Legislature's bipartisan governing coalition has dissolved. Bickering between legislators and Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, has intensified to the point that the Legislature vetoed Mr. Gaffney's budget. Instead, it passed one that Mr. Gaffney felt was so unsound that he invoked Nassau. 
On top of that, there was the disclosure that a health insurance plan devised to save Suffolk money had actually cost over $30 million more than the program it replaced. Throw in accumulating ethical questions about the handling of a Suffolk County land preservation program, and one sees why some observers of Long Island's political topography are starting to wonder: is Suffolk County the new Nassau?
"We took the voyage on the Titanic, so we recognize all the signs, and we recognize that they're starting to fight over the deck chairs," said Lisanne G. Altmann, a Democratic Nassau County legislator. "I was envious that they had a functional government, and we always thought that we needed a team therapist. But we're almost ready to start calling them with helpful hints."
Well, not quite. 
Nassau County, under the leadership of Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, is far from a model of how things should be. Its every move is still scrutinized by the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, a state-appointed board charged with monitoring its finances and authorized to recommend a state takeover. The Nassau fiscal mess created under the watch of the previous county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, whose government held the line on property taxes while increasing spending, is so great, however, that there is almost nowhere to go but up. That is not the case in Suffolk, which, like other counties across the state, is suffering from the current economic downturn.
"Probably the greatest thing that Suffolk County had going for it was Gulottanomics," said Desmond M. Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group, suggesting that Suffolk looked better by comparison. "But as soon as Suozzi came in and the lid was finally off the size of the problem in Nassau, the emphasis then turned to Suffolk, as soon as it came to light that they also had a fiscal problem." 
A chief difference, Mr. Ryan said, is that although Nassau's problems were swept under the rug for years, the Suffolk County executive, Robert J. Gaffney, has already sounded warning bells. "Gaffney, realizing that he smells smoke in an election year, is ringing the alarm bell very early," Mr. Ryan said. "Gulotta didn't sound the alarm bell until the house had burned down."
One of the main parts of Nassau's mismanagement troubles was the discovery that switching to a different health insurance plan, which was supposed to save the county millions of dollars, instead ended up costing the county $70 million, federal prosecutors estimate. The problem here was more than mismanagement. It resulted in the indictment of eight people, including Mr. Gulotta's chief deputy county executive, Robert J. McDonald, who pleaded guilty earlier this month to three felony counts and acknowledged that he had agreed to accept almost $500,000 in bribes. 
In October, Suffolk County discovered that a self-insurance program instituted in 1992 and expected to save the county $50 million over 10 years had actually cost taxpayers $34 million more than the program it was to replace. There have been no allegations of impropriety in the Suffolk plan, but the similarities rankle.
Andrew A. Crecca, chairman of the Suffolk Legislature's finance committee, is holding hearings on what went wrong with the health plan, and why the trouble was not discovered earlier.
Suffolk is also grappling with questions about an expensive land preservation program, which was inspired, in part, by the desire not to meet the same fate as the more heavily developed Nassau. A recent Newsday investigation disclosed that politically connected developers made millions selling land to the county, often at prices that were above market value, or based on flawed appraisals.
The Suffolk district attorney's office, with the United States attorney's office, is investigating the land preservation program. In April, Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, filed a lawsuit against Suffolk's former director of real estate, Allan Grecco, saying he used his position to manipulate land transactions to benefit a prominent developer with whom his private title company did business. Mr. Grecco resigned from his office about a year ago, but has denied wrongdoing.
Mr. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, has said he was not involved in the day-to-day operation of the land preservation program, but Mr. Grecco is his former law partner, and in an election year the publicity from the land program is unwelcome.
However similar the symptoms of the two counties may appear, their ailments are different.
"What happened in Nassau was the result of incredibly bad budgeting practices over a decade, which put the county in absolutely desperate financial conditions," said John V. N. Klein, a former Suffolk County executive. "Suffolk is completely different and is now in the company of other counties who are victims of sudden increases in expenses as a result of economic conditions regionally and nationally."
Nevertheless, after a couple of years when it seemed that the news coming out of Nassau could not get worse, the bad news certainly seems to have moved a bit farther east.
"I don't think there's any question that Suffolk County prided itself on not being Nassau County," said Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority and a board member at the Nassau finance authority. "I just can't see Suffolk getting into the same depth of problems as Nassau County did, if only for the fact that Nassau County is right next door, and everyone on Long Island understands what happened."
"The constant refrain from Suffolk County has always been, 'Hey, look at us, we're not Nassau,' " Mr. Kessel said. Then he offered a final cautionary word to the not-quite-so rich, but still-closer-to-New York county to the west.
"If Suffolk County gets into trouble," he said, "I wouldn't take any solace in that if I were Nassau County. Because Nassau County is nowhere out of the woods yet."

HEADLINE: HOME FRONT; 
A Benefit Program for a Fortunate Few

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
YESTERDAY was a significant day for thousands of New Yorkers, but it was hardly a day for celebration. It was the day that unemployment insurance benefits ended for some 62,800 state residents, even if they had yet to receive all of the 13 weekly checks to which they were entitled under a federal extension program.
 New York, unlike most other states, happens to have another program that could have helped some of the people whose benefits were abruptly terminated. It also might have been a blessing for some of the 84,200 other state residents who have exhausted their benefits and remain without work. 
 Under Section 599 of the state Unemployment Insurance Law, people who are enrolled in state-approved vocational courses can receive additional benefits for up to 26 weeks. The idea is to encourage jobless people to become more marketable by improving their skills or learning new ones. The problem is that the program is so poorly funded that few people can take advantage of it. 
And perhaps for that reason, the Department of Labor makes no effort to publicize it. The 599 program gets only $20 million a year in general revenue funds -- a sum that the labor department acknowledges is depleted two or three months into the fiscal year, which begins April 1. This year, 51,300 people applied for the benefits, but only 15,000 got them.
Joan DeLuca, of Oakdale, N.Y., on Long Island, was not one of the lucky ones. She lost her job as a software engineer in April when her division at Computer Associates was sold. Perhaps because she is 51, she said, she has been unable to find another job. But she figured that her age would not be a liability if she taught school. Teachers, she reasoned, are always in demand. 
In September, Ms. DeLuca learned about the 599 program through a chance conversation with former colleagues. By then she was enrolled in a teacher-training program at a nearby college. She applied for 599 benefits, hoping to pay some of the cost of a full-time student-teaching program, which begins next month. 
Her application was denied on the grounds that she was not taking enough credits when she applied. But Ms. DeLuca saw this reason as a pretext. At the time, she was taking the 10-credit prerequisite for student-teaching at her expense. Once she began student-teaching, she said, she would be in a classroom all day and evening.
Ms. DeLuca was unable to get the Labor Department to reverse its decision. And yesterday, her extended unemployment benefits ended, even though she qualified for three additional checks. Congress is likely to restore those lost weeks when it returns from the holiday recess, but getting the money will take time.
The experience with the program has left her bitter. "If I'm not qualified," she said, "Who is? Here I am, a viable candidate. They have a teaching shortage. I am willing to go through the training, which is intense, and they are not trying to help at all."
Labor Department officials declined to be interviewed about the 599 program and answered questions only by e-mail.
Ms. DeLuca's complaints are echoed by other disappointed applicants, most of whom said they were too embarrassed about being out of work to allow their names to be published.
Several other states link unemployment benefits to job training, but most are more generous because they are financed by a separate small payroll tax on employers, said Maurice Emsellem, the director of public policy for the National Employment Law Project. New Jersey's program, for example, has a cap of $46 million, more than twice the money available in New York. Last year, the New Jersey program spent $22.8 million on so-called additional benefits during training.
For the fortunate few, the 599 program can be very helpful, said Jonathan Bloom, executive director of the Workers Defense League, a nonprofit organization in New York. "It's not the answer to an 8 percent unemployment rate," he said, "but to give people extra benefits to encourage them to learn seems like a very progressive program."

HEADLINE: Staten Island Rail Line An Engine for Growth 

 BODY:
To the Editor,
 If the Port Authority is considering reopening the rail line on the North Shore of Staten Island to alleviate traffic ("As Local Traffic Worsens, Silent Trains May Toot Again," Dec. 15), they should also study the viability of using this route for freight traffic too. 
 By linking this rail route with proposed improvements at cargo handling facilities on Staten Island, and eventually other parts of the city, the Port Authority will make the North Shore Railroad not only profitable but also an engine for economic growth.

HEADLINE: In Hot Pursuit Of Those Elusive Bubbles 

BYLINE:  By Caroline F. Campion; Caroline F. Campion is an editor at GQ.

 BODY:
MOST people probably imagine New York as a heady nirvana for New Year's revels. Perhaps they conjure a holiday presided over by a singing Guy Lombardo who casts a spell of magic and romance over a swarm of sequins and tuxedos. Or they picture the scene from the movie "When Harry Met Sally," the one in which a teary-eyed Meg Ryan finally embraces her here-to-fore-unrealized soulmate (Billy Crystal) in a shower of confetti to a soundtrack by Harry Connick Jr.
What most New Yorkers can probably recall is the year they spent their rent money on an all-you-candrink (and we're not talking French Champagne) mosh pit, sponsored by a formerly exclusive nightclub. Or the evening where one true love never materialized at midnight but was later seem making out with a roommate. Or the evening capped not by a limousine ride through a snow-dappled Central park but by a greasy falafel sandwich eaten at 4 a.m. on the Bowery.
 Is there not an antidote to heart-ache and heartburn? Are there not some New Yorkers who have cast aside the liches to create something more enchanting and more true than any ideal? 
 Which brings us to a tale of two parties, held in one city, on the eve of a new year. One celebration will unfold behind the bright red door of a brick town house on Bank Street in the West Village. The other will take place in a third-floor walk-up on a shadowy stretch of Bushwick Avenue in the hipster badlands of East Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
 Despite locations as different as cobblestone and aluminum siding, both gatherings have an identical mission, to do their celebratory best at ushering in an uncertain yet hopeful future. In their separate but not so dissimilar ways, these two urban tribes will conjure the spirit of baby New Year, in his diaper and jaunty top hat, and by light of early morning, they will have sent the old man of 2002 packing.
 Behind the door on Bank Street is the home of Andy and Elyce Arons, who have played host to a New Year's Eve party here for the last three years. The guest list always includes their closest friends, someof whom they met in New York, some from the time before they were New Yorkers, most of them artists or entrepreneurs in their 30's or 40's, and all of them blessed with an attractiveness only seem in the fit and untroubled.
 The list of 16 dinner guests - more arrive later in the evening - is informal. Friends of friends are invited, as well as the wayward soul who shows up at the door. Once inside, and before throwing their coat on an upstairs bed, guests must pass a sentry of two canines, a Yorkshire terrier named Edna and a gentle Labrador named Sandy. The dogs bark and yap, attempting ferocity, them trax off politely to mingle with the dogs brought by other guests.
 An artist or writer may set off to hunt down the first of many cocktails while others circulate into the living room into the living room, which is decorated with tastefully shabby antiques and modern art hung on ice-blue walls. Mr. Arons will warily tend the Duraflame log in the fireplace (one of eight in the house), particularly cautious after a previous party during which overzealous guests from Australia produced a mild inferno that required calling the Fire Department.
 Ms. Arons, with cornflower eyes and pink-dusted cheeks, might be crouched next to the Christmas tree, which is near a window facing the street. If guests wonder why the pretty hostess is on the floor, they may notice that the tree is rustling, as if being blown by a gust of wind. In fact, the Aronses' infant daughter, Katie, is probably hiding beneath its brightly lighted boughs.
 EARLY arrivals will invariably include Kate and Andy Spade of handbag fame. They will be nattily dressed, Mr. Spade in a well-fitted sports jacket of fine wool and his wife in black cigarette pants with tiny ruby barrettes in her dark brown hair. Ms. Arons and the Spades are not only business partners, they are also best friends since college. The two women became friends as freshmen at the University of Kansas. They met Mr. Spade when they transferred to Arizona State University in their sophomore year. After graduating in 1985, they landed like two metropolitan Dorothys in the Emerald City of New York.
 Mr. Arons, who spends the early part of the evening tripping over dogs to refill Champagne flutes, is the chief executive of Gourmet Garage in Chelsea, a vocation that comes in handy when planning the menu.
 "When I came here," said Mr. Arons, who arrived from Boston in the 1980's, "I had never seen a prostitute, a roach or a rat. On my first day in the food warehouses, I saw all three."
 Also at the party will be Mr. Aron's best friend, Charlie Homet, who has the good looks of a ski instructor, and his wife, Meredith. This year they will be bringing another guest, their French bulldog, Calvin.
 The two men met while working as waiter and busboy, respectively, at a restaurant on Martha's Vineyard, and during their bachelor days, they often celebrated New Year's Eve together with other friends in their 20's who were starting out in the city. They'd rent tuxedos, sometimes stained with the remnants of the previous wearer's dinner, and assemble in someone's 500-square-foot apartment before venturing to a nightclub.
 "Andy was the only one with money to spare, because of his business," Mr. Homet recalled. "So he would always bring a huge tin of Beluga caviar - but probably on blinis instead of crackers. When the score of dinner guests have arrived and begun feeling the buzz from their first cocktails, they will head into the dining room, lighted with candles and a crystal chandelier that is original to the house, which was built in 1851. The table will be laid out for a feast and decorated by Ms. Arons - without the assistance of an uptown party planner or a maid - with woven Mexican placemats and party hats and whistles at every setting.
 One year they ate lobsters. This year the guests will dine on heirloom turkey from Mr. Aron's store. Nobody has any idea exactly what an heirloom turkey is 0 is it like the tomato? - but he will explain that it is important to eat them so more are bred before they become extinct. Everyone will tell stories, Mr. Homet about the time his friend had too many preparty drinks and on the way to a New Year's Eve ball tell head over heels down three flights of stairs, and still managed to make it out.
 They will toast one another with pink Champagne. They will reminisce about friends who have moved away and are missed. After dinner, some people will sprawl on the worn Oriental rugs and drink sweet, expensive port. They will also play games. Ms. Spade, who dislikes games, will insist on being timekeeper, even for games that have no time limit.
 One year a friend taught them a game called bite the Bag, which sounds a little X-rated but is not. Each player stands on one leg, bends over and must lift a brown paper bag using only his or her teeth. After each round, an inch is torn from the bag's edge until only the person most agile or least affected by the Champagne remains.
 Just before midnight, guests click on the television to watch the ball drop in Times Square, a few blocks and a world away. While drunken New Jersey teenagers and panicky tourists disperse into the paper-strewn streets of Midtown, the Bank Street crowd will turn up the music and fortify themselves with more champagne. They will push back the furniture and dance with awkward abandon to Motown records; Ms. Homet, despite the regal carriage of a Nordic ballerina, will perform in a manner her husband lovingly calls the "geek swirl."
 Some people will deift upstairs, some to seek out in empty room, some to a second-floor terrace to huddle arm in arm and smoke cigarettes in the cold night air. Anyone who wishes to rest by the fire will have to shove aside a napping dog to make room on the faded blue couches. Although most guests have usually left by 4 a.m., the party has no fixed end. Everyone can meander home whenever they choose.
 ON the other side of the East River, Bruce Mason, a swarthy Noel Coward type given to such Vreelandesque proclamations as "If I could be reincarnated. I'd want to be a ring on Gloria Estefan's finger," will be preparing a blowout on Bushwick Avenue.
 The first indication that there is something strange and possibly eccentric about his household are his two cats, Kitty and Cotton, both carrying 15 more pounds than a cat should and Cotton having the distinction of seven toes on each paw. When Mr. Mason scoops one of his cats into his arms, he looks like a herder cradling a sheep.
 Both cats are brown to lash out, divalike, with little warning. The onlyperson who gets along with both of them is Mr. Mason's boyfriend, Desmond Sheehan, hairdresser who moved in last summer after meeting Mr. Mason at his 2001 party.
 The two-bedroom apartment is a sprawling Bohemian lair. Furniture that looks as if it had been inherited by a mad aunt is scattered amid a variety of plant life and mounds of books, some piled like cairns on a ruined plain. Mr. Mason, who is 29, is a publicist with Miramax Books, and he could start a successful used bookstore with the work that has followed him home. In the corner of the living room is a ficus tree, which this year will be standing in for a Christmas tree. It is hung with homemade ornaments, one make from a photo of Willie Nelson.
 A dozen of Mr. Mason's closest friends are invited for dinner, with several dozen other guests arriving later for more of an open house party. The diners, who will start tricking in around 9, are an eclectic posse of 20- and 30-somethings that includes artists and writters, an economist and a Texan, an architect, a teacher and a lounge singer. There will be Aimee Blanca, who favors vampish scarlet dresses and matching lipstick and who last year introduced a Russian custom of writing one's wish for the New York on a scrap of paper and swallowing it with a shot of vodka at the stroke of midnight. Also present will be Lizzy Lorch, a friend from Mr. Mason's hometown, Little Compton, R. I., where they both worked at a fruit stand.
 The vibe at Mr. Mason's New Year's Eve party - this is his third - always involves the unexpected, fueled by copious amounts of beer, cigaretts and a cretaive spirit of happenstance. There is always the promise, or at least the pretense, of dinner. The meal is served in the dining room, whose walls are painted the color of a ripe strawberry and give the impression that one is feasting in a bordello. The walls are hung with framed photographs, some taken by Sunny Payson, a friend and professional photographer, who set up a studio at last year's party to take pictures of the guests.
 One of the most arresting images is of Wes Lang, an artist, posing shirtless to display the collection of tattoos on his arms and torso, including alush rendering of a film noir pinup girl on his forearm. Subject and artist became a couple after meeting that evening.
 Dinner is always eagerly awaited, and rarely served until after midnight. One year, Mr. Mason served on elaborate Asian spread, which all assembled were told had taken the entire day to prepare.
 "But later that night," explained Emily Mead, a writer who wears her hair in a stunning cascade of nut-brown ringlets, "I went into the kitchen and found all of the takeout containers stashed inside of the garbage can." (Mr. Mason admits to a emergency contingency plan arranged with the local Cheers Thai Restaurant.)
 After dinner, all the guests must make a speech. Mr. Mason also hands out cards bearing verses from the subway system's Poetry in Motion program for everyone to recite. Some gregarious guests may horde more than their share. "Sometimes I have to be very stern," Mr. Mason said. "There are several actresses in the group. So I cut them off after they try to read a fourth or fifth poem."
 As at the Aronses', there is dancing after dinner, but the music here has been known to veer abruptly from genre to genre, starting with Mr. Mason's favorite, Nina Simone, until someone hijacks the stereo and replaces bossa nova with the Beastie Boys. As the dancing grows wilder, a vase or plant may crash to the floor, and sometimes things get out of hand. At one party, an actress known as a darling of independent films took up an unseemly amount of space on the dance floor, despite her waifish frame. She was pushed aside by a guest from Sweden, which brought on the ire of the actress's boyfriend and led to a brawl that poured into the hallway.
 As morning nears, the party will only get louder. Strangers have been known to become dance partners, and maybe more. Before dawn, the still mobile will retire to the rooftop of Mr. Mason's building to keep dancing or just to gaze at the charcoal-colored imprint of the Lower Manhattan skyline to the west.
 During all this, the host will be swirling through the throng, his dark hair pushed back over his brow, sweaty from the exertion of dancing and preparing a lavish meal. The Bon Vivant of Bushwick, as his friends call him, was born to give New Year's Eve parties.
 Mr. Mason believes it was his mother, who is Vietnamese and met his American father in Saigon before the war, who raised him to be the ultimate social butterfly. Like many parents with first-generation American children, his mother was consumed with making sure that her son fit in, that he belonged. When young Bruce brought friends home after school, his mother greeted them in the kitchen wearing a silk dress and pushing a cart laden with dim sum.
 IT is a gift to be able to throw such parties. Although they take place in very different settings, the Aronses' Gotham fairy tale and Mr. Mason's Bushwick Avenue bacchanal share a few things. This year, a tin of Beluga caviar may appear on the coffee table at Mr. Mason's party, next to the overflowing ashtray; and Ms. Homet may break a vase of white lilies while preforming the geek swirl at 2 a.m.
 Daniel Fadin, a theater director who is a regular at the Bushwick Avenue gatherings, thinks that friends who gather at these New Year's celebrations are all struggling for perfection in life and art: "They are torn between their roots in whatever far-flung suburb they hall from and their reinvented lives among their city family," he said.
 Or, as Tobin Levy, another Bushwick Avenue friend, suggests, the motivation may be less profound. "What this is about," she said, "is friends who don't care what you do for a living or if you are great success. Everyone has to pay the rent. These parties are just about the people you want to be near on the last day of the year."

HEADLINE: Other Advice for Ford 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Ford and Goldman, So Cozy at the Top" (Dec. 8), which described the long friendship of William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, and John L. Thornton, a president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs: 
 The article brought to mind the firing in 1978 of Lee A. Iacocca by Henry Ford II, who gave as his reason that he just didn't like him. 
This happened as Detroit was facing a blitz of Japanese imports -- and about to even find Japanese assembly plants built in its own backyard. Mr. Ford soon turned over the reins to a nonfamily member who began the Ford recovery.
Among the importers was Nissan Motor, which successfully made the move into global markets only to be upended in the 1990's by severe recession at home. It was also bogged down by the huge debts of its affiliated suppliers.
Nissan, to save itself, sought a president from well beyond Japan's borders, from the French automaker Renault. The newcomer, not beholden to any parochial interests, administered the necessary moves. 
Now that Ford is again encountering perilous times, it might similarly consider injecting new blood into its executive suite that might transform the company into a global competitor.

HEADLINE: A Tunnel Too Far: L.I.R.R. Plan Panned 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
WHEN the New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, announced late last month that he supported a proposal to extend the Long Island Rail Road tracks from Brooklyn into Lower Manhattan, he might have expected many L.I.R.R. commuters to rejoice at the prospect of easier access to the financial district. But the details of the plan leave it unclear that it would provide substantially easier or quicker access to downtown, and the Island's business and political leaders, worried that such a project would imperil other transportation initiatives that they hold dear, have given the mayor's plan chilly reviews.
 The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said his priority big-money projects are the development of the Coliseum area, the so-called Nassau County hub; a third track on the L.I.R.R.'s main line; and the development of the East Side Access project that would take L.I.R.R. commuters to Grand Central Terminal in addition to Penn Station. 
 "Government is all about making priorities, and with limited resources, that is not my priority," Mr. Suozzi said of the Lower Manhattan project. "The first three are long-term projects. That one is long-term plus." 
Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, said simply, "Given today's economic climate, there are other projects that should move forward before something of this magnitude takes place." 
Mr. Bloomberg said his plan to reinvigorate Lower Manhattan would cost $3.7 billion and take nine years to build. Included in the plan is a new tunnel under the East River to create a nonstop ride to Kennedy International Airport from Lower Manhattan. From Kennedy, Long Island commuters would use the AirTrain to get to the L.I.R.R.'s Jamaica station, then take trains east.
The proposal would mean changing trains at least twice to get from downtown to Long Island, not much of a selling point for the many Long Islanders who now have to change only once, at Penn Station, to get downtown. But advocates of the mayor's plan say Long Islanders will save time by skipping a handful of subway stops.
Another plan to accomplish the same goal but use existing tracks was introduced last summer by Brookfield Properties, a major landlord in Lower Manhattan. It envisions an express subway from Jamaica to Lower Manhattan, with only one stop at the Metrotech complex in downtown Brooklyn. A spokesman for Brookfield, Lloyd A. Kaplan, put the price tag at $1.9 billion and said it could be built in four years.
Both the Brookfield proposal and Mr. Bloomberg's would pay for new rail service using the $4.55 billion the federal government has allocated for rebuilding transit lines in Lower Manhattan after 9/11.
But the Long Island Association, the region's largest business civic organization, said in a letter to federal officials on Nov. 25 that it feared the Lower Manhattan project would "siphon off very important federal and state funds" that it believes should be used for three Long Island projects it considers higher priorities.
The letter, written by Mitchell H. Pally, vice president for government affairs, said its priorities are the East Side Access project, adding a third track to the main line of the L.I.R.R. and making improvements to Route 347 from Hauppauge to Port Jefferson.
In an interview, Mr. Pally stressed that his organization is not against the express subway plan and would support it "if we had unlimited funds."
"Let's see funds allocated for our three projects and have them started before they approve" the subway project, he said. 
Lisa Tyson, director of The Long Island Progressive Coalition, a citizens' group, said that although an easier ride to Lower Manhattan from Jamaica is attractive, "there are limited transportation dollars out there."
"Right now on Long Island, public transportation doesn't work," Ms. Tyson said. "We need intra-Long Island travel, and that is where the focus should be. There is a plan to build light rail to the Nassau hub or start express bus service there because traffic is so bad it takes an hour for a 10-minute ride."
Mr. Kaplan said he understands those concerns but believes they are ill-founded because the money for his plan and the mayor's would come "from a different pot designed solely for improvements in Lower Manhattan; you can't use it for things not related to Lower Manhattan."
Mr. Suozzi said he has heard that argument but is skeptical.
"If they can establish that no money would be taken away, they would have a stronger case," he said. "But they have not convinced me yet."
Mr. Kaplan disputed assertions that the benefits of his plan were too small to be worthwhile. Mr. Pally argued, for instance, that the supershuttle would benefit only 5,000 Long Islanders while the East Side Access project would benefit 60,000. The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an transit advocacy group, said in a statement that "the plan would likely attract too few L.I.R.R. riders to justify service disruption for over 110,000 subway riders." And Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council, said the proposal "would only take two to four minutes off the ride for those who go to Penn Station and then take the subway downtown."
But Mr. Kaplan stressed that the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan with an improved transportation system would "make sense and be helpful to the region, including Long Island."

The unemployment rate on Long Island rose slightly last month to 3.9 percent, up from 3.7 percent in October, the state Department of Labor reported on Dec. 19. Regional employers cut back some 2,600 private sector jobs, mostly in Suffolk County. 
 The report showed a net loss of 400 jobs from the previous November. 
 In New York State, the unemployment rate in November was 6.4, up from 6.3 percent in October.

Symbol Resignation
 Symbol Technologies (NYSE:SBL) of Holtsville announced the resignation on Monday of its chief financial officer, Kenneth V. Jaeggi. William Nuti, the company's president and chief operating officer, will handle Mr. Jaeggi's duties while the company interviews for his replacement.
The resignation takes effect Jan 2.
In its announcement, the company, which manufactures bar code scanning technology and wireless telecommunications products, did not mention any link between Mr. Nuti's resignation and investigations into the company's nternal accounting practices by the Securities and change Commission and by the United States Attorney General's office, as well as a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders.

Pall in Agreement
 The Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL) of East Hills, a manufacturer of filtration and purification systems, said on Monday that it has agreed to acquire Whatman HemaSure, a manufacturer of blood filtration products, for $5.95 million, ending a patent infringement claim dating back to 1996.

Vail Has Big Bets Riding Off the Beaten Slopes

BYLINE:  By ALEX MARKELS 

 BODY:
LIKE a farmer eager to sell a bumper crop before it withers, Adam M. Aron, the chief executive of Vail Resorts, is taking every opportunity to crow. "Ten feet of snow!" he recently barked at a CNNfn studio camera three times in a three-minute interview. "We've got 10 feet of snow."
 Never mind the fact that by that day, Dec. 11, the Vail ski resort's early snowfall had already settled down to a solid but less spectacular 25-inch base. Mr. Aron, 48, was determined to put the best spin on an unusually good start to the ski season and to play down a less-than-bountiful net loss of $24.8 million, or 71 cents a share, on $113.9 million in revenue in Vail's most recent quarter. 
 Mr. Aron, a marketing veteran who cut his teeth dreaming up promotional campaigns for Hyatt Hotels and United Airlines, seized the moment to appeal to his core customer base: affluent New York financial types for whom a Vail ski vacation is an annual bragging right. 
"One out of 10 visitors to Vail is from New York City," he said. "A lot are both skiers and investors."
Ronald Baron fits that profile perfectly. "I am absolutely in love with skiing," said Mr. Baron, who was skiing at Vail over the Christmas holiday and whose Baron Capital Group owns about a third of Vail Resorts. "Vail is probably the best ski mountain in the world." He said he is excited about Vail Resorts whether or not the slopes are buried in snow.
Unfortunately for Mr. Aron, many investors feel the opposite, leaving him to wring his hands each season as the company's stock price inevitably rolls through a mogul field of weather-induced bumps and dips.
That is why Mr. Aron has stepped up a campaign to diversify the company far beyond its roots in Colorado. While many in the travel business are rentrenching amid an industrywide slowdown, Vail Resorts has invested more than $300 million in the last year alone, buying upscale hotels, desert spas, golf real estate developments and a large ski area, Heavenly, near Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada border. And those are only the latest in a string of about $1 billion in acquisitions and capital improvements at the company since the financier Leon D. Black and his Apollo Advisors investor group installed Mr. Aron as chief executive and took the company public nearly six years ago.
Last year, Vail Resorts bought RockResorts International, the hotel chain founded by Laurance Rockefeller in 1956. It includes properties in the Florida Keys and in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. (It does not include some of the more famous resorts in Hawaii and the Caribbean that were in the chain when Mr. Rockefeller started it.)
Since then, Vail has placed other recent purchases -- including the Lodge at Rancho Mirage, Calif.; the Lodge at Vail; and the Snake River Lodge and Spa in Teton Village, Wyo. -- under the RockResorts brand. Mr. Aron wants to turn the brand into an industry powerhouse by adding one or more hotels annually; it now has 10 properties. He also hopes to change how the company is viewed by investors, who currently value Vail Resorts at about 6.6 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Shares of leading luxury-hotel managers like Fairmont Hotels and Resorts sell at nearly twice that.
VAIL'S competitors have found some success by following a similar diversification strategy. "It takes the weather factor out of the equation," said Joe S. Houssian, the chief executive of the Intrawest Corporation, a resort development company in Vancouver, British Columbia, that operates both ski areas and warm-weather properties.
"Vail has a very high-end clientele, and they obviously feel they can migrate them from one leisure activity to another," Mr. Houssian said. "We feel the same; we just aren't spending as much capital to execute on that strategy."
Instead, Intrawest prefers to manage the properties it develops for outside investors.
Mr. Aron has different role models. "I watched the Pritzker family in action," he said of the seven years he worked at Hyatt Hotels, which the Pritzkers control. "I learned from them and I learned from Apollo: buy top-flight assets when you know you can change or improve them, and buy them inexpensively."
Despite the recent recession and the sharp decrease in corporate travel spending after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Aron said a spurt in occupancy rates at RockResorts hotels last quarter had demonstrated the plan's early success. 
Some investment analysts endorse the RockResorts strategy, pointing to changing habits among an aging population of wealthy skiers happy to trade a day on the slopes for one at the spa or on the golf course. "Don't trust that all your customers are going to want to ski," said Bryan A. Maher, a senior lodging and leisure analyst at Credit Lyonnais, who has an "add" rating on Vail Resorts' stock. "You need the spa and all the rest of it to increase revenues and gain market share."
Mr. Maher said it would make sense to lump all of Vail's assets, and even its name, under the RockResorts banner.
Others, however, are less sure. "Anyone can go out and buy a hotel -- that's not why I invested in Vail," said Mr. Baron, who was critical of the RockResorts purchase and instead favors redevelopment at Vail's base area. "There's a huge opportunity to increase profits just by bringing more people to Vail."
Capital improvements have already helped to triple Vail's nonskiing revenues, to about $500 million annually since Mr. Aron arrived. Yet neither local redevelopment nor the recent diversification has bolstered Vail's bottom line so far. The company's annual earnings of about 21 cents a share are about what they were when the company went public in 1997, while its long-term debt has more than doubled, to more than $600 million, since 1998.
Apollo, which controls the board, recently told Mr. Aron to trim expenses, prompting cuts of $20 million and 100 jobs from Vail's annual budget. The move has fostered resentment among some ski resort employees, whose bonuses have been cut and whose stock options remain worthless as underperforming acquisitions drain cash from Vail's profitable ski operation.
Vail's stock price, which plunged to a record low of $12.23 in October, has also curtailed Mr. Aron's bonuses and prevented him from cashing in options on more than 900,000 shares of stock granted to him since he joined the company. But he has profited in other ways, including grants of thousands of restricted shares, a home valued in 2001 at $1.5 million and two empty lots and golf club memberships in the company's developments west of Vail at the Red Sky Ranch and the Bachelor Gulch neighborhood near the Beaver Creek ski area. Similar lots in Bachelor Gulch sell for more than $2 million each.
Some company insiders complain that Mr. Aron has been the sole beneficiary of his tenure, while others at the company suggest that the recent drive to cut costs demonstrates that Vail's largest investors are becoming frustrated with Mr. Aron's performance. They point to a recent announcement that Mr. Black plans to step down from Vail's board as a sign that his patience with the company's progress may be wearing thin and that he and his associates are eager to sell their interest.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Black denied those assertions. He said he had left the board, along with four other Apollo-affiliated members, merely because New York Stock Exchange rules now require a majority of independent directors. Apollo maintains the right to choose two-thirds of the board.
Adding that he is pleased with Mr. Aron, Mr. Black said he believes the diversification effort will help balance Vail's weather-related fortunes. He also acknowledged that the timing of several recent acquisitions -- after Sept. 11 -- was unfortunate.
Yet subsequent concerns about traveling abroad may have helped domestic destinations like Vail, where Mr. Black and his family were vacationing over the Christmas holiday.
In separate interviews, Robert A. Katz and Marc J. Rowan, two Apollo partners and Vail board members who helped orchestrate many of Vail's recent acquisitions, also defended Mr. Aron and his compensation.
"Adam is the best-qualified C.E.O. in the winter resort business," said Mr. Katz, who worked under Mr. Black when he ran Drexel Burnham Lambert's buyout group in the late 1980's. "You have to retain him. And like everyone, he deserves a certain level of compensation."
Mr. Katz added that Apollo might well take advantage of the current malaise in the lodging industry to pick up additional assets at attractive prices.
THE vulture strategy is not unlike Apollo's approach in acquiring Vail in the first place: Mr. Black and his associates bought billions of dollars in junk bond debt held by Executive Life Insurance, now defunct, including bonds issued by Vail's previous owner, George N. Gillett Jr., a meatpacking magnate. It converted the bonds into equity after he declared bankruptcy in 1992.
Apollo cashed in when the company went public in 1997 and has since sold a total of $165 million in shares. It still owns 21 percent of the company.
Vail has two other large investors, Baron Capital and Ralcorp Holdings. Together, the three own nearly 75 percent of the shares outstanding. Mr. Aron said he has discussed with these big investors the possibility of selling some shares to bring in a broader base of shareholders. "We would be better off if they sold some shares because it would be easier for other institutional investors to get in and out," Mr. Aron said.
Yet with Vail's shares trading near their lows, industry analysts say it is unlikely that Apollo will be able to sell out anytime soon. And with much of Vail's profits still tied to the weather, it is unclear whether new investors will be interested.
Mr. Rowan says Apollo is committed to investing in its portfolio companies. "When we arrived in Vail, the local papers ran headlines saying 'Wall Street to strip area of resources,' " he said. "But it's been exactly the opposite. We've invested $1 billion in the company. And it's been a good investment so far."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Deficit Spending Can Help Republicans

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
"A DEFICIT will hurt economic vitality."
 That statement was made three months ago at a campaign stop in Flagstaff, Ariz., by President Bush, who has also overseen the sharpest two-year deterioration in the government's bottom line since World War II. Though he may publicly bemoan the economic effects of the deficit, the long-term political effects could suit his party just fine. 
 From the beginning of 2001 through the third quarter of 2002, the federal government leapt from a surplus (including Social Security) amounting to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product to a deficit of the same size. By itself, the current deficit is not terribly threatening. Indeed, running a modest deficit during an economic downturn can be useful, as long as the policies behind the deficit -- lower taxes and higher spending -- benefit consumers and businesses. 
More worrisome is the expectation of deficits in the future. In a new report released by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, William G. Gale and Peter R. Orszag assess the connection between fiscal expectations and long-term interest rates. Their figures, not to mention the vast majority of earlier studies, suggest a strong link between growing expectations for deficits and higher rates, which can stifle corporate investment and cripple the housing market.
The Bush administration has plans for much more spending and many more tax cuts in the name of economic stimulus and domestic security. If all the plans were put into effect, forecasts for deficits over the next decade could grow by hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if none were to become law, a war in Iraq could expand the deficit to more than 4 percent of gross domestic product, a level not reached since the last days of the elder President Bush's administration.
The White House says lower tax rates will lead consumers to work more and businesses to expand, resulting in higher tax revenues and eventually closing the budget gap. That notion, chided as "voodoo economics" by critics, turned out to be false when it was last in vogue, during the 1980's.
But there may be reason to believe that the president's team cares little whether the deficit disappears. In fact, abig deficit may suit its purposes perfectly.
In the late 1980's and early 1990's, several experts in political economy struggled to explain the public's acceptance of the huge deficits of the Reagan administration. Even though the federal deficit more than tripled during President Ronald Reagan's first term, and stayed high through his second term, Republicans held on to the presidency. Why didn't voters rebel against the threat of higher interest rates and taxes?
The political economists concluded that voters supported the Republicans' emphasis on tax cuts and on military spending. That part stood to reason, but the second conclusion was less straightforward: by pursuing extra spending and casting the nation into deep deficits, the Republican administrations tied the hands of their successors. If a future Democratic administration wanted to spend money on its agenda of social welfare programs, it would have to raise taxes -- a prickly political proposition.
THIS strategy, the experts conjectured, probably made the people who voted for the Republicans even happier. By constraining any Democrats who might take office in the future, Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush were serving their constituents.
In the early 1990's, the nation was hung over from the splurge of the 80's. President Clinton did have to raise taxes to bulk up social programs. Fortunately for him, the strongest boom in postwar history lightened the blow to consumers and business.
Now, President Bush may be playing the same game of blocking his unknown successors' ambitions. It seems unlikely that he's doing so on purpose, though. "The president and this administration do not like deficits," said Trent D. Duffy, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. "We want to get back to balance as soon as we possibly can."
Yet having a surplus that could be spent by future governments seemed equally unattractive. "President Bush in his campaign said that if you leave money in Washington, it will be spent," Mr. Duffy said. In the coming year, he added, "we cannot repeat the guns-and-butter mistakes of the past."
Elsewhere, voters have learned skepticism from similar policies. In Britain last year, the Labor Party crushed the Conservatives by warning of a return to the "boom-bust" policies that paired high spending with economic uncertainty in the 1980's and early 1990's.
Will Americans decide that they're facing the same choice in 2004?

HEADLINE: NOTICED; 
Another Dad Flick, and Guys Are Crying

BYLINE:  By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
AS if the economy and the plight of the Knicks and the Rangers weren't enough, men now have something new to cry about. A movie called "Antwone Fisher" opened 10 days ago, and all over the country men are honking into their handkerchiefs as the movie ends with a crawl saying, "In memory of my father . . . "
 The film is a virtual fatherfest, with Denzel Washington (who also directed) playing a psychiatrist-father figure to the title character, a mixed-up (and fatherless) Navy seaman played by Derek Luke. One surefire audience grabber occurs at a Thanksgiving dinner, when the seaman recites a poem that begins, "Who will cry for the little boy?" Later the manly psychiatrist (who has no children himself) tells Antwone, "I love you, son." And a scene at the end that includes a grandmother sitting at a groaning table and croaking, "Welcome," is bound to choke up any holdouts. 
 "That one gets everyone," said Joy Bryant, who plays Antwone's love interest. She watched the movie in a screening room with a group of men. "Men kind of have this shifting in the seats thing, a lot of umm-umm frog-in-the-throat to keep from crying," she said. "And some men really bawled. One big manly celebrity, a young cute stud, came up to me with his eyes bloodshot. He said, 'I tried to hold it in, and I couldn't take it anymore -- wah!' " 
Sure, women cry at movies, but as men are wont to say, women cry at anything. Men have traditionally cried less often and less hard, and even after decades of urging by therapists (and women) for them to express their feelings, most men still feel that crying shows a loss of manliness.
"Antwone Fisher" is the latest of a subgenre, the male weepie -- others include "Field of Dreams," "Saving Private Ryan," "Bang the Drum Slowly" and "Braveheart" -- that undam the waterworks. In time for the traditional upwelling of male sentiment on New Year's Eve, its popularity raises a question: what does it take to make strong men cry?
Randolph R. Cornelius, a professor of psychology at Vassar, has studied the matter under laboratory conditions. He showed men films like "Peege," a 1972 short about visiting a grandmother in a nursing home, and what he considers the champion male weepie, "Brian's Song," a 1971 television movie about an interracial friendship between two Chicago Bears, one of whom dies. (In his lab, women get the death scene from "Steel Magnolias.") Women cry when they are angry or frustrated, Mr. Cornelius said, or when there are conflicts in a relationship. "Men cry more in situations involving loss," he said, "or about re-establishing connections."
Terrence Real, a psychotherapist at the Family Institute of Cambridge in Watertown, Mass., echoed that conclusion. "What men think about when they cry are the losses, the missed opportunities, the missed connections with other people," he said. "They have regrets about bad behavior, like drinking, or being too angry, or not being with their kids enough. And their issues with their fathers."
Come Tuesday night, adding the fuel of alcohol to the accumulated kindling of regret over the year's losses and disappointments, men across America will be letting the tears flow on hearing, "Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?"
"If you think about that song -- the Robert Burns poem -- it's about loss and connection," Mr. Cornelius said. But, he added, "You can always blame the tears on the alcohol."
Mr. Real said: "Women continue making friends all through life. As men grow older they have fewer friends. So as they go down the conveyor belt of life, they cry more."
American men, mind you, more than hold their own in the international crying Olympics. A study in 29 countries completed in 1999 found that American male college students cried 1.9 times a month on average, half as often as American female college students but tied for first place with Nepalese male college students.
Many men are more likely to grow teary watching a movie or a television drama -- even a Hallmark commercial -- than in real life, even after a wrenching event like a parent's death.
"That's the power of movies," Mr. Cornelius said. Not only do they take place in the dark, where men feel safe, he said, "but they can create this alternative life space in which we express our emotions, and they are freer and less complicated than our real lives."
The movies that bring on men's tears, Mr. Cornelius said, are in essence about male bonding -- losing or winning at sports, sacrifice on the battlefield, or losing or gaining a father. " 'Ordinary People' was a real tear-jerker for men," he said. "A boy says, 'I love you,' to his father at the very end. As the lights came on, every man in the house wiped his eyes very quickly."
They wiped their eyes because men fight not to be seen with tears. Jim Olson, 62, an architect in Seattle, calls himself a crier. But he doesn't like others to see him cry at movies. If he knows the movie is almost over and feels a sad scene coming on, he will take protective measures. "I fight it back just so it won't happen," he said. "You force yourself to think about other things. You bite your tongue. It's painful, but it works."
It's easy to say such men fear being seen as wimps. But something about men's tears is itself upsetting. Consider how CNN handled footage of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa choking back tears for a full minute before speaking about his friend Senator Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash in October. Before rolling the tape, CNN issued a viewer discretion advisory. Senator Harkin "gets very emotional," cautioned the anchor, Wolf Blitzer, who added, "I just want to issue that alert to those of you who may not want to watch this."
It was as if the sight of men's tears threatened viewers' own composure, implying that the social order itself was in danger.
"It's seeing the combination of masculine strength and vulnerability that makes men cry," said Michael Mayer, the director of "Thoroughly Modern Millie" on Broadway. "That gets me every time."
After the Sept. 11 attacks, when national figures like President Bush and Dan Rather shed tears publicly, a number of commentators noted how far society had come in allowing men to express emotions publicly. They contrasted those displays with the moment in the 1972 presidential primary campaign when Senator Edmund S. Muskie was shown apparently crying over speculation about his wife's mental health. (Shortly after, Mr. Muskie withdrew from the contest.)
Many sports fans feel that there has been an upswing in the number of male athletes shedding tears. Whereas it was big news in 1989 when Mike Schmidt broke down on retiring from the Phillies, it seemed almost commonplace by 1999, when wide receiver Cris Carter and his fellow Vikings cried over losing the National Football Conference title to the Atlanta Falcons. The same year, quarterback John Elway cried several times when he announced he was retiring from the Denver Broncos. This year, John Franco, the Mets reliever, cried after suffering what could be a career-ending injury. And running back Curtis Martin cried both in relief and in gratitude on learning in August that the Jets had given him a $46 million contract extension.
Many men cry when an Olympic athlete steps onto the winners' stand to the strains of a national anthem. "In that context, a man crying has a certain kind of legitimacy, a nobility," Professor Cornelius said. "People think if a man is crying, something really deep must have happened."
Then there is Douglas McGrath, the director of the movies "Emma" and "Nicholas Nickleby," which opened Friday, who says he cries at almost anything. "I'll be in bed at night with my wife," he said, "and a rerun of 'I Love Lucy' starts, and just as the heart is closing around the title, the tears well up in my eyes." Why? He thinks it's because of the contrast between the triumph of love of the fictional Desi and Lucy, and the fact that they broke up in real life. Now that's a sensitive guy!
But for most men it is the father-centric films like "Antwone Fisher" or books and plays with father figures, like "Tuesdays With Morrie," that get to men the way "Old Yeller" breaks up young boys. As Mr. Real put it: "Want to see men cry? You put them together in a room where they feel safe, give them a facilitator and have him ask them, 'When I think of my father, I . . . ' "
This moment of free-flowing men's tears may be coming to an end. "I see it changing back," Mr. Cornelius said. "We are moving into a more of a 'you've got to tough it out' phase as our culture is preparing us for war and there will be a lot of sacrifices. It's like, 'We've got to get through all this, and there's no crying about it.' "

HEADLINE: Coming Up Roses In a DowncastYear 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL ONEAL 

 BODY:
THE year 2002 will surely go down as one of the worst in business history.
 Scandal rocked corporate suites and Washington offices, jobs evaporated, the American economy muddled along and Europe and Latin America reeled. Rogues at companies like WorldCom and Enron were bad enough, but even superstar executives like Jack Welch contributed to the staining of corporate America. 
 Payment was coming due, it seemed, for the hubris and excess of the late 1990's. This was not just a down year. The troubles seemed biblical. 
The truth, of course, was much less dire. The economy grew a bit and the stock market, while down over all, provided many opportunities for investors willing to take a risk. Low interest rates led to a refinancing boom that kept consumers in the malls.
Some people in the business world, in fact, had an exceptionally good year, often thriving on the troubles of others. Many of them were lawyers -- working on bankruptcies, defending those accused of corporate malfeasance and filing class-action suits on behalf of shareholders. Among investment bankers, those advising bankrupt companies obviously racked up business.
Other executives, operating under tough conditions, managed to have a good year, too, avoiding the storms in their industry or harnessing them to their advantage.
Money & Business selected about a dozen people who made 2002 a winning year -- or just happened to have fortune smile upon them. Many, though, may find 2003 to be a challenge.

DAVID NEELEMAN -- JetBlue Airways
If the ultimate definition of a good year is to succeed mightily when all those around you failed miserably, Mr. Neeleman had a very good year indeed. As founder and chief executive of JetBlue, Mr. Neeleman, 42, not only brought his upstart carrier public during the worst airline crisis in history, he also managed to double profits, to $34 million, and revenue, to $448 million, in the nine months ended Sept. 30.
Mr. Neeleman's low-cost airline doesn't feel like one. All the seats on its new Airbus 320's are leather and come with satellite television connections. Its customer service draws rave reviews, and its fares give high-cost rivals like United and US Airways fits. Mr. Neeleman's operating margin even outshines that of industry superstar Herb Kelleher, the chairman of Southwest Airlines.
Plenty of airline entrepreneurs have done an Icarus act, falling from the sky as competitors were stirred to action. But Mr. Neeleman is nothing if not tenacious. Now a father of nine, he never finished college at the University of Utah and suffers from attention deficit disorder. Yet he became the co-founder of a charter airline company and sold it to Southwest in 1993 for $128 million in stock. His 8 percent stake in JetBlue is flying at an altitude of $137 million. Pushing it higher will be next year's challenge.

CLIVE CALDER and CLIVE DAVIS -- BMG
It was a great year to be a Clive -- especially if you happened to be doing business with BMG, the music unit of Germany's Bertelsmann.
Two years ago, Strauss Zelnick, then BMG's chief, created a firestorm by ousting Mr. Davis, the legendary founder of Arista Records. Bertelsmann gave Mr. Davis, now 69, his own label, J Records, but the ouster hurt.
Mr. Davis, who made his name shepherding the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Janis Joplin, quickly struck gold with the rhythm-and-blues diva Alicia Keys. In November, BMG, which had by then ousted Mr. Zelnick, embraced Mr. Davis anew, giving him an estimated $50 million for the 50 percent of J it did not already own and installing him as head of the RCA Music Group -- vindication wrapped in a fat paycheck.
But that pales next to the billions that BMG showered on Mr. Calder, the reclusive South African founder of Zomba Music. More than a decade ago, Mr. Calder quietly negotiated a distribution deal with BMG that included a novel twist: in 2002, BMG would be obligated to buy out Mr. Calder at a certain price based on Zomba's revenue in previous years.
Mr. Calder went on to deliver the teen idols Britney Spears and 'N Sync. Revenue soared and BMG's obligation ballooned to an astonishing $2.8 billion by the time Calder's "put" came due this year. Sadly for BMG, Britney isn't what she used to be, and sales are sliding fast. Mr. Calder, meanwhile, is long gone -- trying to figure out where to spend that $2.8 billion.

LAWRENCE F. PROBST III -- Electronic Arts
The year has been the best of times for purveyors of electronic fantasy -- especially Mr. Probst, 52, the chairman of Electronic Arts Inc.
Riding a mighty surge in the sales of computer games and consoles, Electronic Arts almost doubled its revenue, to $2.1 billion, in the 12 months through September 2002, the latest figures available. It posted profits of $237 million for the same period, versus a loss of $8 million in the previous 12 months.
Electronic Arts prospers because its hits, like Madden Football, play on anything, from the Sony PlayStation to Microsoft's Xbox. Its Sims series dominates the PC. This year, Mr. Probst's pricey strategy of buying the rights to produce games based on hit movie series like "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of the Rings" has proved brilliant.
For investors, the company's highly volatile stock has been as harrowing as one of its adventure games. Having almost tripled since early 2000, to a high of around $72, the price has tumbled in December, closing at $51.50 on Friday. Wall Street appears convinced that the growth of games will slow sharply in 2003, although Mr. Probst has been saying publicly that the company will continue to thrive. Nevertheless, insider trading records show that he has cashed in options at a profit of $13.5 million over the past year.

JOHN MACKEY -- Whole Foods Market
Anyone who doubts that yuppies still have plenty of money to spend hasn't seen the lines at the local Whole Foods Market. High prices? So what. Consumers can't seem to get enough of that organic Swiss chard and Amish free-range chicken.
Organic food is hot, especially since the Agriculture Department released national standards in October that define "organic." But Mr. Mackey, 49, the chief executive of Whole Foods, has been driving the bandwagon for years. After starting the chain in 1980, he has been consolidating the industry since 1988 by picking up regional rivals. Now Whole Foods seems to be growing as if it were sneaking in some fertilizer.
For its fiscal year ended in September, revenue grew 18 percent, to $2.7 billion, while earnings shot ahead 25 percent, to $85 million. Sales per square foot dwarf those of traditional supermarkets. Since early April 2001, Whole Foods' shares have sprouted 160 percent, to $52.90 a share, or 38 times earnings, which some analysts say is unsustainable. Mr. Mackey's 1 percent stake is now valued at a cool $30.7 million.

SALLIE L. KRAWCHECK -- Citigroup
Money magazine called her "the Straight Shooter." Fortune called her one of the nation's most powerful businesswomen. Then Sanford I. Weill called and asked Ms. Krawcheck, 37, to help him salvage the reputation of his scandal-ridden Citigroup. Her mission (and she chose to accept it) is to clean up Citi's newly independent retail brokerage unit, to be called Smith Barney. 
Mr. Weill, Citigroup's chairman, plucked Ms. Krawcheck from Sanford C. Bernstein, a small Wall Street research firm known for its staunch independence from the investment banking world. Bernstein has no banking business and, therefore, little incentive to hype stocks to attract investment banking fees. 
Whether Ms. Krawcheck can bring something of Bernstein's culture to Citi -- where conflicts have run deep -- remains to be seen. It may help her cause that the bank has just agreed to the biggest fine, $325 million, in the landmark settlement between regulators and Wall Street. New rules devised to put distance between investment bankers and analysts should also make a difference. In any event, Ms. Krawcheck is certainly being well compensated. Mr. Weill gave her 750,000 options over five years, which, valued conservatively, could be worth more than $11 million.

ELIOT SPITZER, attorney general of New York State
Wall Street's $1.5 billion settlement was the crowning achievement of a remarkable year for Mr. Spitzer. With his dogged pursuit of conflicted analysts like Henry Blodget, formerly of Merrill Lynch, and Jack B. Grubman, formerly of Salomon Smith Barney, Mr. Spitzer, 43, helped expose how the rabid search for investment banking fees corrupts research on Wall Street. 
He took on the investment industry at a time when federal regulators like Harvey L. Pitt, the departing chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had little appetite for it. Though the S.E.C. and the major stock markets eventually joined in, it was Mr. Spitzer who lit the investigative fire. That bodes well for his Democratic political ambitions.

MICHAEL S. DELL -- Dell Computer
Mr. Dell's rampage through the computer business has gone on for so long that it is easy to take it for granted. Analysts sometimes worry that Dell Computer's low-cost telephone and Internet sales system will eventually run out of gas. They've often predicted that Dell may trip up as it moves into servers, the high-speed machines that power corporate networks and databases. But then Mr. Dell posts another blistering quarter and shows that his company is in full control of its destiny.
In November, Dell said its fiscal third-quarter profits grew 31 percent on a 22 percent increase in sales. Stretching back nine months, sales grew 11 percent, to $25.7 billion, while profits jumped 15 percent, to $1.5 billion. In a stagnant PC market, Dell's growth is coming directly from the hide of competitors like Gateway and Hewlett-Packard. As for servers, Dell's business grew 24 percent in the quarter, nearly five times the industry's pace.
Mr. Dell, 37, is hoping that his new server business will power results next year. Just last month, he entered the market for hand-held PC's, and he is taking aim at Hewlett-Packard's printer business. New forays mean new risks. But Mr. Dell is in the habit of proving doubters wrong. That may explain why Forbes magazine ranks him No. 11 on its 2002 list of richest Americans, with a net worth of $11.2 billion -- up 14 percent from 2001.

CARLETON S. FIORINA -- Hewlett-Packard
Mr. Dell's chief competitor these days is Ms. Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. The year started badly for her. She was caught in a bruising and very personal proxy battle with Walter B. Hewlett, son of a Hewlett-Packard founder, over her $19 billion merger plan with Compaq Computer. Ms. Fiorina staked her career on the merger, and she prevailed. In November, Michael D. Capellas, Compaq's former chief executive, left to take the reins at WorldCom, leaving no question of who is in control at H-P. 
Now she faces the stiff challenge of integrating the two sprawling companies profitably, and confronting Mr. Dell. While Dell's worldwide PC shipments grew 23 percent in the third quarter, Hewlett-Packard's fell by almost 5 percent. Dell, the leader in market share, is forcing Hewlett-Packard to discount heavily to stay in the race. H-P's server business faces similar pressure.
The ever-confident Ms. Fiorina, 48, has closed factories and cut jobs to stem PC and server losses. She has crisscrossed the globe to talk to employees about how to make the merger work. So far, investors have been impressed, driving up the stock 54 percent since July 26. But for Ms. Fiorina, the real work is just beginning.

JAMES F. ROTHENBERG -- Capital Research and Management
You may have heard that once-dazzling mutual fund companies like Janus and Putnam Investments lost assets in 2002 like water running down the drain. Through November, they bled about $13 billion each. Wonder where all that money went? Mr. Rothenberg, 56, the president of Capital Research and Management, knows. The 29 American Funds managed by his firm sopped up a good portion of it.
Through November, American Funds raked in $37.7 billion in new assets, according to AMG Data Services. Over all, it trailed Vanguard, which pulled in $42 billion, but in terms of equity funds, American blew away the competition. It grabbed $16.5 billion, while Vanguard's equity offerings came in second, with $10 billion. (The big winner in bond funds was Pimco, which drew almost $26 billion, AMG data shows.)
If you've never heard of Mr. Rothenberg or American Funds, you're not alone. The funds are sold exclusively through investment advisers, and the firm -- wary of hot money -- belongs to the Howard Hughes school of public relations. But its consistent emphasis on long-term value speaks for itself. Among the top 25 fund families, it ranks second in relative 1-year, 5-year and 10-year returns, according to Morningstar Inc.

JEFF BEWKES -- AOL Time Warner
For most executives at AOL Time Warner, 2002 must have seemed like something out of Dante's "Inferno." Earnings restatements, S.E.C. investigations, investor unrest and a plummeting stock price: each presented a new and more painful circle of hell. 
For Mr. Bewkes, however, 2002 was a career-making year. Not only did the HBO cable network he ran for six years continue to blossom into one of the most highly acclaimed television properties in history, but a management shakeup installed him as chairman of AOL Time Warner's entire entertainment division and made him one of the company's top four officers. Now Mr. Bewkes is presiding over the company's crown jewels: HBO, the Turner networks, Warner Music and the movie studios.
Don Logan, the former chairman of Time Inc., also benefited from the management shakeup, joining the AOL Time Warner inner circle. But he has been given responsibility for the tortured AOL division. As Mr. Logan, 58, wrestles with an online property racked by conflict and desperate for a coherent strategy, Mr. Bewkes, 50, will be collecting Emmys at HBO and counting the returns from blockbuster movies like "The Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter."

BARRY DILLER -- USA Interactive
Mr. Diller, 60, has his pick of jobs these days. Ever the opportunist, he's the one person most likely to benefit from problems at Vivendi Universal of France, which rivals AOL Time Warner for trouble.
A year ago, Mr. Diller sold his USA cable, television and film assets to a Vivendi joint venture for $11 billion, renamed his company USA Interactive and turned his attention to electronic commerce. The company is now producing more cash than either Amazon.com or eBay. And its brands, like Expedia, Hotels.com, and Ticketmaster, are growing quickly. The Home Shopping Network continues to be a cash cow. 
But Mr. Diller also retained a stake in the Vivendi joint venture, both on his own and through USA. So when the French conglomerate erupted in scandal earlier this year, Vivendi's new chairman, Jean-Rene Fourtou, asked Mr. Diller to oversee the company's entertainment assets -- the same ones Mr. Diller had sold earlier, plus the Universal movie studio and Universal Music.
Now, because a tax twist in Mr. Diller's original deal gives him the power to block any restructuring of the entertainment assets, he has a big say in their future. Many analysts believe that he'll end up running the show. Forbes magazine put Mr. Diller's net worth at $900 million this year. But if Vivendi ends up spinning out Universal, look for that number to jump through the roof.

JEFF BEZOS -- Amazon.com
Wasn't it just two years ago that Ravi Suria, then a Lehman Brothers analyst, famously predicted that Amazon.com would run out of cash in four short quarters? It was a call that helped puncture the Internet balloon and seemed to foretell the end for Mr. Bezos's "e-tailing" colossus.
But a funny thing happened on the way to insolvency. Amazon continued to flourish, as Mr. Bezos, the founder and chairman, cut costs and added new businesses. By the fourth quarter of last year, Amazon began posting thin operating profits. More remarkable was that Amazon stock got a fresh shot of helium while most of Wall Street was given over to chagrined retrenchment. While the stock remains 82 percent off its peak of December 1999, it almost tripled this year, from a low of around $9 a share in January to a 52-week high of $25 in late November. Hurt by reports of gloomy holiday retail sales, it closed on Friday at $18.86.
Many analysts call the stock overvalued, noting that Amazon has yet to prove that it can produce consistent profits. But with sales approaching $4 billion this year and growing at a double-digit clip, few doubt that the company is here to stay. That counts as a major victory for Mr. Bezos, now 38. And oh, yes: the surge in Amazon stock has added around $1.1 billion to his net worth.

Limiting Lawsuits On a National Scale

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH never much cared for lawyers, though he once tried to be one. 
 Rejected by the University of Texas law school, Mr. Bush instead earned an M.B.A. from Harvard and set out for the oil patch. As governor of Texas, Mr. Bush had few political enemies, but he never flinched when his actions drew the enmity of some of the state's wealthiest lawyers. 
 Now, Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans are poised to back changes in tort law next year, including proposals that would make it harder to win large jury awards for medical malpractice and force many class-action lawsuits out of plaintiff-friendly state courthouses and into federal courts. Other proposals would protect companies facing asbestos-related claims.
The arguments for and against change often take the form of anecdote, with debates over such things as the merits of overweight children suing fast-food restaurants. Corporate America blames trial lawyers for making everything from football helmets to health care premiums more costly. Trial lawyers -- and the Democrats they often support -- argue that lawsuits make products safer and that the Republicans want to allow corporations to evade responsibility when they hurt people.
But it is possible to get some idea of the impact of a new system by looking at Texas, which over the past dozen years has become something of a tort-reform laboratory. The changes Texas made, most of them under then Governor Bush, differ from what Congress is likely to consider, but they demonstrate how dramatic the effect can be on plaintiffs, defendants and insurance companies.
In 1989, before Mr. Bush became governor, the Texas Legislature revamped the state's workers' compensation system, which was in disarray. The insurers were bleeding money, and business groups complained about large premium increases. The new system made it more difficult for workers to hire lawyers. 
Then, in 1995, under Governor Bush, the Legislature passed a series of bills that made it harder to win big punitive-damage verdicts, narrowed the state's primary consumer protection law and limited what deep-pocketed defendants had to pay in multiparty lawsuits.
Immediately after all these measures were passed, payouts plunged for lawsuits, settlements and other claims covered by insurance companies. After 1995, for example, annual payouts by automobile liability insurers fell by more than $500 million, reversing an upward trend in the first half of the decade, according to data reported by insurance companies.
But premiums paid by consumers and businesses didn't drop nearly as fast as insurers' payouts did, and the profits of insurance companies soared. Before the workers' compensation system was changed, for example, insurers had been paying out all of their premium income, and then some, to cover losses. But by 1994, under the new system, insurers were paying out just 40 cents for every $1 collected in premiums. Similarly, after 1995, auto liability insurers went from paying more than 70 cents for every dollar of premium to about 54 cents. 
Over the years, the premiums eventually fell, and insurers' profits moderated. Last year, auto liability insurers were paying 79 cents for every $1 in premiums. Payouts by workers' compensation insurers have also been rising, and total premiums are a half-billion dollars less than a decade ago.
Mr. Bush and state officials have argued that the 1995 changes cut insurance bills by almost $3 billion. The muscle behind that claim originated with a provision that year by a Democratic legislator requiring officials to roll back rates ahead of time to account for tort reform, so that insurance companies did not keep the savings from reform.
But even state officials acknowledge that insurers have most likely kept some benefits. Moreover, insurers overcharged consumers $2.9 billion for auto insurance in the three years after the system was changed, argued D. J. Powers, a former general counsel of the Texas Department of Insurance who is president of the Center for Economic Justice, a consumer-advocacy group based in Austin.
The changes had another effect, other critics say. Trial lawyers and consumer advocates argue that plaintiffs were stripped of much of their ability to seek redress for everything from workplace injuries to consumer fraud. In fact, studies done for the Texas Department of Insurance found that businesses facing lawsuits became more aggressive because of the new laws, making low settlement offers or refusing to negotiate.
"Instead of settling a case, more insurers are telling their counsel to take it to trial," reported one study by the University of Texas conducted for the insurance department two years after the law changed. "Soft-tissue injury cases in auto and premises liability cases are way down in value." 
INSURERS say the changes have weeded out many specious lawsuits and restored fairness to the state civil justice system. They say other factors, like safer cars and workplaces, have contributed to the higher profits as well.
But they now want more changes in the tort laws, arguing that jury awards are still too generous. "There are still certain jurisdictions in Texas that are viewed as judicial hellholes," said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. 
Rick Gentry, the executive director of the Insurance Council of Texas, another industry group, said plaintiffs' lawyers have found creative ways to get around the 1995 laws. Insurers' profits did improve after the changes, he said, "but we're still not where we ought to be."
For the Bush administration, tort-law changes at the federal level makes almost perfect political sense. It unites business groups willing to send millions of dollars to sympathetic politicians to fight plaintiffs' lawyers, often generous patrons of Democrats.
Despite Mr. Bush's long-held views on "junk and frivolous" lawsuits, Karl Rove, his longtime top political adviser, apparently had to persuade Mr. Bush to make tort reform part of his 1994 campaign for governor. 
"I sort of talked him into that one," Mr. Rove is quoted as saying in a coming book, "Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential," by Wayne Slater and James Moore.
Mr. Rove didn't return a call seeking comment, but in an interview, a senior Texas Republican official recalled Mr. Rove's dislike for trial lawyers. "He thinks they're quick-buck artists out to make a lot of money for doing very little," he said.

The Republicans Try to Redefine Civil Rights

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS Bill Frist spoke last week of "healing the wounds of division" caused by Trent Lott's racially divisive remarks, several of his colleagues said the doctor-senator should translate the medical metaphors he loves into something more solid. Many Republicans of various stripes say Mr. Frist should unveil a significant civil rights gesture next week, after he takes over as majority leader.
 "It's important that we show the African-American community and other minorities that we are an inclusive, tolerant and diverse party," said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. "We have to show not just in words but in actions that we mean what we say on that subject. Now the question is, how do we best go about it?" 
 Ms. Snowe's question is likely to hang heavily over the 108th Congress when it convenes on Jan. 7, because almost any item on today's civil rights agendas has become starkly partisan in nature. The issues championed today by traditional civil rights groups, from affirmative action to ending racial profiling, have become virtually identical to the Democratic Party platform, and many are antithetical to the race-neutral goals of Republicans. The most egregious forms of discrimination were essentially dealt with in the sweeping legislation of the 1960's and 70's, supported by mainstream members of both parties.
Senator George Allen, a Virginia Republican who was instrumental in persuading Senator Lott to step down as majority leader, said the incident had produced what he said was "a greater understanding." 
But there is no reason to alter the party's policies, he said, because they would help all Americans, including minorities. For example, many Republicans have said that President Bush's so-called faith-based initiative, which would allow a greater share of federal funds to go to religious groups, is in essence a civil rights issue, because some money would go to inner-city churches, mainstays of many black communities. 
But that measure is strongly opposed by groups like the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which represents 180 of the best-known traditional civil rights organizations, because it would remove a provision that bars recipients of federal funds from practicing any form of discrimination.
There are those on both sides of the aisle who argue that extending unemployment benefits, which ran out for many people on Saturday, is also a matter of civil rights, because so many minorities are unemployed. A benefits extension is almost certain to pass next month, now that President Bush and Congressional Republicans have agreed to the idea. 
"I would argue that unemployment benefits are a form of civil rights," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Democratic delegate who represents the District of Columbia in the House. "Because of the great work of the 1960's, there are only a few clear-cut issues left, like hate crimes and racial profiling. Now we're following the bread-and-butter issues that we share with a broader array of Americans, because issues like health insurance and unemployment affect us so disproportionately."
Members of both parties say the only traditional civil rights proposal with even a slim chance of gaining bipartisan support in the coming session does not deal with race. Instead, the bill would make it a federal crime to physically attack someone because of his or her sexual orientation, sex or disability. It came close to passing in 2000 but lacked enough Republican support this year. (Mr. Frist and Mr. Lott opposed it.)
Traditional civil rights groups are pressing for more, even though they are unlikely to get very far. Atop the list is essentially a negative item: stopping the confirmation of several conservative judges to the federal appeals court, including Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. He was unsuccessfully nominated by the Bush administration this year and is likely to be brought up again.
Judicial nominations were a principal item in a letter sent to President Bush earlier this month by the Leadership Conference. "We are very concerned that many individuals who you have nominated to serve on the federal bench have records of deep hostility to core civil rights principles and to Congress's historic role in protecting the civil rights of all Americans," said the letter, signed by the group's leaders and sent on the day Mr. Lott stepped down. 
Several moderate Republican senators, like Ms. Snowe, have suggested this area is one where the party could demonstrate its new sensitivity, but several more conservative senators said last week that Mr. Bush should nominate his previous candidates.
The Leadership Conference also plans to push for an amendment to this year's transportation bill that would prohibit states from engaging in racial profiling, the practice of stopping cars based on the occupants' race. And it wants the Bush administration to support the University of Michigan's law school affirmative action policy, which will be the focus of an important Supreme Court case this year.
Nancy Zirkin, the conference's public policy director, said that civil rights groups will also seek adequate financing for the recently passed election reform act, allowing states to improve their voting procedures, and for additional money for President Bush's education initiative, known as the "No Child Left Behind" act.
Ms. Zirkin said she misses the days when Republicans and Democrats could agree on a basic civil rights agenda, a consensus that seemed to wither in the 1970's when they diverged sharply on affirmative action. But she said Mr. Lott's fall has provided new energy to her constituent groups, lending hope that the Republicans' search for sensitivity would help produce some common ground.
"Of course I wish things weren't so lopsided," she said. "But maybe members will step back a bit now, and not go back to business as usual. There's a new awareness about these kinds of issues, and maybe we'll have an easier time."

Missileson a Budget: Navy Meets Home Depot

BYLINE:  By Erik Baard 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's military buildup to fight Al Qaeda and possibly Saddam Hussein has piqued public interest in new high-technology weapons -- hardware with names like Bird of Prey, Super Hornet, Predator and Javelin. But the Pentagon is confronting another foe: an ailing economy. 
So here comes the Affordable Weapon.
 The Office of Naval Research has established a venture with the Titan Corporation, a military contractor in San Diego, that has developed a prototype of what it calls the affordable weapon, a missile made from off-the-shelf commercial components, as an alternative to Tomahawk cruise missiles. 
 While the Tomahawks cost about $500,000 apiece, the smaller new missiles will cost less than $40,000 apiece, said Capt. Stephen Hancock, the director of the Naval Expeditionary Warfare Science and Technology Department. "Maybe they pack a little less bang per missile, but we get a lot more bang per buck," he said.
Its flight is powered by an inexpensive, souped-up jet engine, guided by Global Positioning System satellites, and can be controlled by soldiers holding specially equipped hand-held computers. The Navy is not revealing what commercial products it is using. 
"We don't want some hostile walking into a motorcycle shop and saying, 'Could you modify that turbocharger to do this, this and this,' " Captain Hancock said. Erik Baard

Asia's Splits Deepen Korea Crisis

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
IF centuries of brutal power struggles over the Korean Peninsula could be ignored, if Seoul could be protected, if Asia had a NATO, the crisis that has re-ignited in Korea would lend itself to a swift -- if temporary -- solution.
 Yongbyon, the nuclear plant that North Korea began reactivating last week, might be the perfect place to execute the pre-emptive strike that the Bush administration has talked of as a last resort in protecting the world against weapons of mass destruction. 
 "All we would have to do is take out one building," a senior national security official said this month, referring to the nuclear reprocessing center where North Korea said it would begin converting a long-dormant stockpile of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into bomb-grade plutonium. 
Yongbyon is remote, and the international inspectors who have lived there for eight years were just asked to pack their bags. So the perfect moment for a precision attack would be right now, before blowing the building to bits could spread nuclear material across the countryside. 
But then the official added, "If it was only that easy." It isn't, and not just because of the 11,000 North Korean artillery tubes north of the demilitarized zone that could set all of Seoul afire.
The truly complicating factor is how Asia has worked for decades -- or, more precisely, how it hasn't worked. 
In the decade since the cold war ended, Asia has largely failed at the task Europe has fairly well mastered -- defusing many of its geopolitical land mines. Even as China and Russia have embraced their own forms of Western-style capitalism, any talk of creating a common security structure has remained just talk. The major capitals -- Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul -- have never overcome the centuries of distrust, competition for dominance and open conflict that sucked the United States into three Asian wars in the 20th century.
Now, President Bush's doctrine that America can no longer tolerate rogue states with weapons of mass destruction has run into that reality. He cannot pick up the phone and call the Asian NATO; it does not exist. Many Asians question whether the United States should remain keeper of the peace, while admitting there is no current alternative.
So this weekend, as he settles into his ranch here to rally the world against Iraq, Mr. Bush must now simultaneously rally Asia's disputatious players in a cause in which each has a very different set of interests. It has fallen to him because none of the countries within easy reach of the North's missiles has taken the lead. His national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, delicately calls the process "alliance management." A more accurate term might be "rivals management."
"The way to understand Northeast Asia today is as a Pandora's box," said Moon Chung In, a political science professor who moves among Korea, Japan and the United States. "North Korea can go bad easily, but the North Koreans know they have the capability to create huge divisions between the United States and South Korea, and with Russia and China and Japan. And in some ways, that is their greatest weapon."
Kim Jong Il, the North's reclusive and odd leader, understands this reality and is playing it skillfully. 
So China, which provided much of the early technology that got North Korea into the nuclear business to begin with, now plays a double game: It condemns the North's brinkmanship, but there is no evidence it is cutting off trade. China's main interest, it seems, is in keeping desperate North Koreans from flooding across its long border. 
Japan, weakened economically and diplomatically, desperately seeks guarantees that the American military will protect it from Korean missiles. Japanese politicians know that if the American shield is in doubt, the country's right wing will call for a stronger military, and the rest of Asia will fear that Japan is preparing its own nuclear deterrent.
The Russians, once the North's arms and technology dealer, now want to pretend they never heard of the place, even as they tweak the United States for, in their eyes, failing to live up to agreements to provide North Korea with energy aid and for acting antagonistically toward the North.
From the perspective of American hawks, South Korea has all but encouraged the North to flout disarmament demands by continuing to build rail and trade links to North Korea, as protesters demand the removal of the 37,000 American troops who remain in South Korea.
In short, each of North Korea's neighbors sees the crisis through its own prism. "It is, in one sense, a great opportunity for the U.S., Japan, China, with the tacit consent of the Russians, to put concerted pressure on a state that is in the last stages of desperation," Lee Hong Koo, a former South Korean prime minister, said recently in Seoul. "But will we take advantage of it? I don't know if we are ready."
Han S. Park, a professor at the University of Georgia who left South Korea nearly four decades ago, also wonders if the Bush administration is ready. "Nothing in the first two years of Mr. Bush's presidency has forced him to confront just how divided Asia remains to this day," he said. "But now that we have let North Korea go too far, now that they have their weapons and no one has much leverage over the North Koreans anymore, it's about to become obvious."
In public, all the players insist they are on the same page, calling for a peaceful settlement and stability on the peninsula. But that is not a strategy for disarming a regime that probably already has two nuclear weapons, and might, if unchecked, produce five or six more in the next six to 12 months.
Just as every country's interests differ, so do their strategies.
In South Korea, the fear is not so much of a nuclear North as of a collapsing one. The essence of President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" was to delay that day by investing in the North and reducing suspicions. Now the incoming president, Roh Moo Hyun, has vowed to let even more sunshine in -- at the very moment that President Bush seeks to punish the North.
The Chinese and the Russians don't want a nuclear North Korea. But they also don't want to run the risk that America will end up even more powerful in the region. So they resist following its lead.
The Japanese, as always, want Washington to solve the problem, but not too forcefully.
Like many members of the South Korean elite, Professor Moon admits to conflicted feelings. 
"I'm a supporter of the sunshine policy, of engagement," he says. "But I can't tolerate weapons of mass destruction, because if North Korea has the bomb, Japan will have it, and South Korea has to have it."
And as the United States knows from the cold war, as soon as any state has a nuclear arsenal, pre-emption is not an option.

HEADLINE: Trickle of Oil Starts Flowing in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: PUERTO LA CRUZ, Venezuela, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Nearly a month into Venezuela's devastating national strike, all systems were back up and running close to normal this week at the refinery here that supplies gasoline to the eastern half of this country. Night shift workers were bursting with the pride of war heroes.
 Felix Deliso, who has worked at Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, for 12 years, stood watch over a console with so many blinking buttons and computer screens that it looked like the bridge of a spaceship. Mr. Deliso monitors 3,000 machines and processes that turn crude oil into gasoline. Though he has a high school education, he has been trained to be a specialist here, and he considers his job as delicate as disarming a live bomb. 
 Politics made his job even more explosive four weeks ago in this country, which is the world's fifth-largest oil producer. Most of the refinery's supervisors abandoned Petroleos de Venezuela, which pumps the lifeblood of the nation's economy, to join the strike that is aimed at forcing the ouster of President Hugo Chavez. 
Operations at the company, a chief supplier of oil to the United States, ground to a halt. With support for Mr. Chavez strongest among the country's poorer residents, rank-and-file workers like Mr. Deliso weighed their options.
"We decided to stay on the job," he said, "Some of us are Chavistas. Some are anti-Chavistas. But here, there are no politics."
"Basically we are Venezuelans," added Cipriano Hernandez, who also has worked at the company for 12 years. "We love our country and we do not want to see it fall."
With skeleton crews working lots of overtime, Mr. Chavez is getting gasoline trickling back into Venezuela's pumps. Officials here said that since the beginning of last week, this refinery had produced 60,000 barrels of gasoline a day, about 70 percent its normal capacity and almost a fourth of the 225,000 barrels normally consumed by this country each day.
Still, with domestic shortages mounting over the last month, the gasoline produced here is only a drop in the bucket of Venezuela's needs. The country remains far from recovering its export capabilities, which provide up to 80 percent of its foreign currency. Economic aftershocks are expected through the first few months of next year. 
Strike leaders charged that the government's assertions of an industrial rebirth were little more than a mirage. They contend that the overwhelming majority of oil workers have stayed off the job and that Mr. Chavez is using inexperienced workers to staff gas and oil installations, risking accidents.
Lines stretch for miles outside most gas stations across the country, sharply contradicting Mr. Chavez's claims that gas supplies are returning to normal. Shortages of food and medicine have stirred comparisons to Cuba. Tens of thousands of people march almost every day to denounce Mr. Chavez.
As the national strike drags into another week, battle lines have been drawn at the nation's gas pumps. Mr. Chavez's beleaguered opponents renewed calls for their followers, especially 35,000 oil workers, to stay off the job. Meanwhile Mr. Chavez struggled in the face of gale-force political winds that have swept the country to get the paralyzed oil industry crawling again.
"They thought they could impose their illegitimate will on this country, but they were wrong," said Ali Rodriguez, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, referring to the strike leaders. Then he heaped praise on the workers standing before him. "Because of loyal workers like you, the enemy is being defeated."
After suspending at least 90 striking executives, Mr. Chavez assigned new management teams to take over crucial oil installations. In raucous meetings with oil workers in recent days, Mr. Rodriguez called the executives "traitors to the nation," and said the government would press criminal charges. 
The refineries at El Palito, just east of here, are expected to be operating at 70 percent of capacity within a week. 
The government also regained control of several Venezuelan tankers anchored off the coast by striking crews. In the region that gave birth to this country's oil industry around Lake Maracaibo, 22 million gallons of gasoline were unloaded from the tanker Pilin Leon, which had been stranded for nearly three weeks.
"We have made a situation that seemed impossible, possible," said Edgar Ortiz, 46, the leader of a union representing gas truck drivers in the Lake Maracaibo region. "The crisis has not ended. But the government is finding solutions."
The refinery here at balmy Puerto La Cruz has become a showcase of the government's comeback. Almost all high-level executives at the plant joined the strike. But officials said fewer than 20 percent of the operators, mechanics and technicians walked off the job.
"We are prouder now than ever," said Wilfredo Bastardo, a 17-year oil veteran. "We have shown our supervisors that we can run this plant without them."
International oil analysts, however, are describing Mr. Chavez's gains in gasoline production as a quick fix that delays progress on more fundamental long-term challenges. Most of the nation's oil wells remain closed, as does its largest refining complex, at Paraguana, which can refine one million barrels of crude oil a day. Analysts report that in the four weeks since the start of the strike, oil exports from Venezuela dropped from 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 2 million barrels last month, sending oil prices rising above $32 a barrel.
Fareed Mohamedi, an economist with PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington, said that in the wake of this political crisis, Venezuelan oil customers might decide to take their business elsewhere.
Still, political analysts said, it appears that Mr. Chavez remains determined to ride out the storm. Winning the support of oil workers is a crucial part of his strategy. In a ceremony on Friday, he gave out medals to about 60 oil workers and said that strikers are traitors.
"They wanted to stab the heart of Venezuela," he said. "But thousands of workers have come to save the country from their premeditated attack."
Mr. Chavez has agreed to negotiate with the business and labor representatives who lead the opposition. But sources close to the talks said that it had become clear that both sides intended to fight to the political death.
After a meeting with Mr. Chavez last week, the American ambassador to Venezuela, Charles Shapiro, said the risk of violence was rising daily. Meanwhile, the night crew at Puerto La Cruz downed espresso and tried to make light of the tension. The maintenance chief, with 32 years on the job, joked that he was one of the "inexperienced workers" whom foes of Mr. Chavez called a threat to the company's security. Other workers faked Cuban accents to poke fun at charges by opponents that Mr. Chavez had allowed Communist workers to infiltrate oil installations. Then they talked about about their colleagues who had joined the strike.
"To me, this is a political fight," said Willians Arevalo, operations manager at Puerto La Cruz. "I have participated in many strikes, to demand better pay or better conditions. But I don't think I should use my job to try to force out the president."

AXIS OF EVIL -- In his first State of the Union address, on Jan. 29, President Bush called North Korea, Iran and Iraq "an axis of evil." Many allies worried that the United States would act unilaterally against the countries, while hawks within the administration were delighted that the president took such a muscular stance against Iraq.

CHURCH SCANDAL -- Roman Catholics and others were outraged by revelations in files from 84 civil suits involving the Catholic archdiocese in Boston. Included were depositions by bishops who were aware of sex-abuse accusations against the Rev. John J. Geoghan Jr., who was convicted later in 2002 of indecent assault.

REGIME CHANGE -- Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, right, testifying before the Senate, said the administration was settling on a plan for "regime change" in Iraq --a phrase borrowed from the Clinton administration. Expanding on earlier remarks made before a House committee, Powell's testimony seemed to emphasize the potential for war with Iraq in the near future.

CORPORATE MELTDOWN -- At a tense Senate hearing on Feb. 26, Jeffery K. Skilling, Enron's former C.E.O., listened as Sherron S. Watkins, a company whistleblower, accused him of playing a pivotal role in Enron's collapse. Skilling, in turn, complained that Enron managers had been called everything from hucksters to criminals during the monthlong investigation, which was a dramatic first chapter in a year full of corporate scandals and collapses.

A BLOODY MARCH -- March was one of the bloodiest months in the Middle East since the war in 1967. Israeli tanks pushed into Palestinian refugee camps for the first time, then bombarded Gaza from the land, sea and air. Suicide bombers attacked a conservative Jewish neighborhood, then a popular cafe. Washington and the United Nations pressured Israel to pull back its forces. By midmonth, the U.S. envoy, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, went to the region with an American peace plan. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel agreed to a cease-fire, but by month's end the bloodshed was continuing. A suicide bombing in a hotel during Passover dinner killed more than a dozen people, prompting Sharon to call Yasir Arafat an "enemy of the free world" and to send Israeli tanks into Arafat's Ramallah headquarters.

SIEGE AND SUICIDE -- Despite efforts by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to broker a cease-fire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the tit-for-tat violence continued, with the cycle of suicide bombings and Israeli military raids increasing the toll of dead and injured on both sides. Ignoring American pleas to withdraw from the West Bank, Israeli raids that were directed at the "Palestinian terrorist infrastructure" grew in intensity.

HOLLYWOOD NOIR -- In a B-movie version of the O.J. Simpson case, Robert Blake, the faded star of the 1970's TV series "Baretta," was arrested with his bodyguard and charged with plotting to kill Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. Bakley was shot to death on May 4, 2001, as she sat in her husband's car outside a Los Angeles restaurant. Blake, 69, pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of murder and conspiracy. He is in jail pending trial.

The two nations, both nuclear powers, mobilized one million troops along the Kashmir border. British and American officials rushed to calm tensions.

BELATED JUSTICE -- It was the final page of an infamous chapter in the nation's civil-rights history. Bobby Frank Cherry, a 71-year-old former Klansman, was convicted of murder in the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala., that killed four girls. He had been on a 1965 F.B.I. suspect list, along with two other men who were convicted earlier, one in 1977 and one last year. The verdict was as complete and as satisfying as a human being could ever hope, said Doug Jones, the lead prosecutor.

The Security Council would eventually approve a plan to revive inspections, but this left open the possibility of American military action if Iraq didn't cooperate.

ANNIVERSARY OF TERROR -- Observances of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were held across the country.

NOVEMBER SURPRISE -- Two days before the Nov. 5 elections, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said, "This is the least decided election in my lifetime." After the dust settled, the Republicans and especially President Bush were the big winners, regaining the Senate, where they now control 51 seats, and adding 6 seats to their slim majority in the House. The results also flew in the face of historical precedent, which decrees that the party holding the White House usually loses seats in midterm elections. President Bush spent three weeks aggressively campaigning for his party, including for his brother, Jeb, right, who was re-elected governor of Florida.

LOTT STEPS DOWN -- Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, resigned his leadership post, but stayed in the Senate, after a tempest created by his remarks at Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party.

HEADLINE: Pondering the Imponderables; 
Yao Is Now, O'Neal Is Out, Jury Out on Rose

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
The answer to the question Who's New? in sports is now Yao. The Houston Rockets' 7-foot-6 Chinese center, Yao Ming, is the future looming. In 2002, as in all years, the zero sum balance means there must be a Who's Through? And that's Shaq. 
 Which is not to say that Shaquille O'Neal is toast or that he won't win another ring with the Los Angeles Lakers. We will see him in ads and holiday specials for years; the light from a dead star shines for eons. It just means that Shaq, like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, is no longer about breathless possibility. While Shaq and Tiger move inexorably from ESPN to ESPN Classic (Michael is already there), Yao will mature before our eyes on "SportsCenter." 
 This is good, and certainly better in sports than in everyday life, where chasing the new to stay in the now -- hooking up with strangers or betting on a fresh stock -- is often defeating. The fungibility of athletes is the basis of much of sports' charm; we appreciate Joe DiMaggio, Sandy Koufax and Jim Brown, who, for various reasons, quit before they bored or embarrassed us.
Yao Ming is far more than a genetic freak show; he is a schooled and talented athlete, tough and smart. He is also the most visible of a remarkable wave of Asian performers sweeping into American concert halls and sports arenas. The impact of Japanese baseball players, South Korean female golfers and now, assuming Yao has inspired a long march to the hoop back home, Chinese basketball players, may be as significant as the impact of African-Americans.
The imported competition does not mean that African-Americans are Through; for example, all hail King James. LeBron James, the 18-year-old high school senior also known as Bron Bron, is so compelling that his games have been televised. There has been no fevered discussion about his college plans because he has none; LeBron is N.B.A.-bound. Given the fatally corrupted state of big-time college sports (the non-Division I schools have their issues, too), LeBron's jump may some year be noted as a signal that the National Collegiate Athletic Association is Through.
Tiger Woods is careering toward Throughness through no fault of his own; poor Tiger's piece of the controversy over the all-male membership of the Augusta National Golf Club is an albatross. I'm in conflict over what he should say about that dead white bird. On one hand, as a citizen with a platform he should feel some responsibility to stand up for equal rights. On the other hand, I am uncomfortable with children listening to understandably ignorant athletes, used mostly to sell unnecessary apparel and junk food, being used for political and social commentary (Check the networks' jocks in the box for stunning shallowness.) 
Meanwhile, we will have not only Master's Madness to deal with in the new year. There are a number of pressing women's issues. The recruitment of stars for high school teams and the W.N.B.A. makeover in the N.B.A. mode are harbingers of the masculinization of the conduct of women's sports. There is the struggle to save Title IX, the return of the Women's World Cup (was it a one-shot?) and the subtle shift in women's thinking about sports from fitness to competition.
Lance Armstrong was Sports Illustrated's inspired and inspiring choice for Athlete of the Year, but he's probably Through, too. If he wins a fifth Tour de France, ho hum, we'll probably niggle that his times on the hills weren't as fast as last year's. 
My own choice for athlete of the year is Esera Tuaolo, the former N.F.L. defensive lineman who came out in 2002. His courage in a homophobic SportsWorld befits what we have been conditioned to believe about football players. Too often we've been disappointed, not the least by several of Tuaolo's teammates who were concerned that showering with a known gay man would cause people to question their masculinity.
To be Who's New requires support from the market; if you are not bankable (Esera might get a Subaru commercial, but what else?) there's not going to be the critical commercial drumbeat. Can the Ukrainian brothers Klitschko move product? Powerhouse heavyweight boxers Wladimir and Vitali are colorful and buff, but they will have to score some major knockouts to replace Mike Tyson, the sport's only true Newness since last century. And it's hard to imagine Tyson (New and Through and New and Through for years) getting any commercial endorsement deal besides a home security system. 
Certain sports, like ice hockey and American soccer, may never produce a crossover star. Nascar has a chance in 2003 with its new champion, Tony Stewart. Stewart has the sullen good looks, humor and talent of the young Elvis along with a quick temper that lights up an obviously pretty decent guy. Jeff Gordon is cute and gifted, but his public personality has been bland. Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt had the goods to be crossover megastars, but Nascar wasn't on national TV when they were burning up Southern tracks. 
We must remember that simply being the best is not enough to be New (two-word explanation: Barry Bonds) although sometimes you don't even have to be particularly talented (Anna Kournikova). A few will be Forever New (Muhammad Ali, who turned 60 in 2002) and even fewer have been Through so long they have a chance to be New again (Pete Rose).
The world has changed since 1989, when Commissioner Bart Giamatti, who was more fan than insider, banned Rose permanently for conduct not in the best interests of baseball. Giamatti said he believed Rose had bet on Cincinnati games and others when he managed the Reds, a charge Rose denies. Since then, the Charlie Hustles of Wall Street have bet on their own games with devastating effects on the national economy and on individual lives. Even if Rose is guilty, and I have no opinion or information, the injuries he perpetrated may seem quaint and mostly self-inflicted to a new generation. 
So who knew that the Who to watch starting this week would be Pete Rose? He just may be New. May you be, too.

HEADLINE: Options Payday: Raking It In,Even as Stocks Sag 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
BY most standards, 2002 has not been a good year for Tenet Healthcare. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided one of its hospitals to determine whether two doctors there had performed unnecessary heart surgeries. Medicare officials began scrutinizing the company's billing practices. Tenet badly missed its profit projections, and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an inquiry into a steep decline in its stock, which closed on Friday at $15.13, more than 60 percent below its level a year ago. 
 But by another measure -- the paydays for Tenet's top executives -- the past year looks glorious. Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the chief executive, cashed out company stock worth $111 million in January shortly after calling the company's business "sensational" and increasing its profit forecast. Thomas B. Mackey, the chief operating officer, made $16.4 million in stock profits before he resigned in November, after Mr. Barbakow lost confidence in him. Other executives made an additional $12 million selling stock. 
Similar contrasts between executive pay and corporate performance are fueling much of the public anger with corporate America. Yet even with business under intense scrutiny in 2002, many executives and board members have continued to cash in the stock options they were awarded as part of their pay, making millions of dollars even while their companies lost much of their value.
The sales suggest that the measures enacted this year by Congress and by the New York Stock Exchange will not end the entrenched disconnect between pay and performance, compensation experts say.
The chief culprit is the proliferation of stock options over the last 15 years. Options, which allow holders to buy stock at a fixed price, no matter their price later -- have given executives the chance to profit handsomely from a stock's temporary jump.
Reining in options grants, pay experts add, will fall to corporate boards, only a few of which have adopted rules to prevent executives from turning quick profits on blips in stock prices.
In 2002, executives at AOL Time Warner, Best Buy, Intel, Safeway, Computer Associates International and dozens of other companies reaped large gains despite disappointing results, according to an analysis by Money & Business and Thomson Financial, a research company. Even executives at Calpine and El Paso, two energy companies that have struggled to convince investors that their profits were real, cashed out some of their shares.
At the 100 worst-performing companies in the Standard & Poor 500-stock index, 47 executives and directors took home at least $5 million each by selling stock through early December, while the average share price of their companies has fallen by more than 60 percent.
"It's hard to argue that this is how the system should work," said Kenneth F. Broad, a portfolio manager at Transamerica Investment Management in San Francisco. "Failure gets rewarded."
Mr. Barbakow, who ranks first on the list of big sellers at lagging companies, is joined by many familiar names. Ted Turner, the vice chairman of AOL, was 9th, with sales of $35.9 million. Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of Intel, was 16th, selling $14.2 million. Scott G. McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, was 26th, selling $11.2 million.
None of this is uncommon, of course, or illegal -- unless regulators find evidence that executives knew of undisclosed, impending problems when they sold. 
Details of the sales vary, with some executives selling before they disclosed that they would fail to meet financial goals and others selling after their stock had already fallen. At some companies, the sales came after years of solid performance that were followed by a single bad year.
Among this year's sellers, said Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains, "you have a mixed bag of the innocent, some people doing some things they shouldn't be doing and some people in between."
Almost all of the executives declined to comment. Other company officials said that when the executives sold their shares they had no reason to think that the price would drop later. Some emphasized that the executives were just following government-approved schedules that they had set up to sell stock at pre-arranged intervals. They also called options a crucial incentive.
EXECUTIVES at Network Appliance, a data storage company, "made money over a 7- to 10-year period and just realized our gain this year," said Daniel J. Warmenhoven, the company's chief executive, who sold $3.7 million of shares this year. The company's stock has fallen about 50 percent this year but is worth more than four times what it was at the end of 1995.
Harry Anderson, a Tenet spokesman, said Mr. Barbakow had accepted responsibility for some problems and planned to discuss his future compensation with the board. But his stock sale and those by other executives were proper, Mr. Anderson added. "A lot of people got very wealthy trading Tenet stock in the last few years," he said. "There was wealth created here."
Tenet stock closed at $15.13 on Friday, down 65 percent from $43.35 when Mr. Barbakow made his large sale in January and down 29 percent from its price five years ago.
Still, many investors and management experts say a legal sale is not the same as one that is right. Like Mr. Barbakow, some of this year's other sellers benefited financially from their own misreadings, forecasting profits that did not materialize but selling stock before its price reflected reality.
"It seems to me that if someone's going to be filthy rich, they should at least wait until they've shown they've accomplished something," said Peter M. Gilbert, the chief investment officer of the State Employees' Retirement System of Pennsylvania. Pay "should be tied to long-term performance," he said.
"The system has just distorted itself," Mr. Gilbert said.
IN mid-January, for example, Thomas M. Siebel appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine predicting the end of the technology recession during the year's first quarter and a rebound for his company, Siebel Systems. Later that month, Mr. Siebel, the chief executive, sold one million shares of stock when they were trading at $34.98. 
His brashness disappeared a few months later, but he still owned the proceeds from his sale. "The first quarter might have been the worst in the history of the industry," he said in April, with Siebel's stock at about $25, acknowledging that his earlier prediction had been wrong. Since then, Siebel has announced layoffs, saying it should have cut costs earlier; its stock has fallen to $7.60.
Patrick Dillon, a spokesman, said Siebel stock has outperformed the S.& P. 500 since the company went public.
The chief executive of Best Buy, Bradbury H. Anderson, similarly made $7.2 million this year, mostly during the first half, when he was forecasting strong profits and the stock was trading near $50. By September, the company had repeatedly cut earnings estimates, and Mr. Anderson attributed its "disappointing" results partly to its inability to reduce costs. 
On Friday, Best Buy shares closed at $23.11. Lisa Hawks, a company spokeswoman, said she did not have a response to the sales.
Of course, executives at many struggling companies have held on to their stock this year, suffering through the decline along with long-term investors. At Bristol-Myers Squibb, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot and Sears, Roebuck -- all among the worst performers in the S.& P. 500 -- executives at each have together sold less than $1 million in stock this year, according to Thomson Financial.
Across the market, total insider sales -- minus the cost of exercising stock options -- fell to $22.3 billion through November, from $33.5 billion during the comparable period last year, Thomson said.
Helping to cause the falloff in sales, analysts say, were the market's continuing decline and the publicity surrounding stock sales at Enron and other collapsing companies.
The publicity has also prompted at least two companies -- General Electric and WorldCom -- to take a stab at the problem. They have created rules restricting the ability of executives to cash out their options.
In September, G.E. began requiring its top 23 executives to hold for at least a year most of the stock they buy when exercising options. The executives can sell only enough shares to pay for the options' exercise and to pay taxes on the transaction. Tax bills can be high, because option gains are taxed as ordinary income.
(Starting on Jan. 1, G.E. will adopt even tighter rules for its outside directors. They will no longer be paid with any stock options, instead receiving actual shares of stock, which they cannot sell until a year after they have left the board.)
Nearly every public company grants options and, on average, they make up more than half of a top executive's pay. At most companies, executives can lock in gains by selling stock immediately after buying it through an options exercise, eliminating any financial risk for them.
For example, Richard M. Scrushy, the chief executive of HealthSouth, exercised almost 5.3 million options at $3.78 each in May and sold the shares the same day at $14.05, making a profit of more than $50 million. After the company withdrew its profit forecast for the year in August, shares of HeathSouth, the nation's biggest operator of rehabilitation hospitals and clinics, have fallen to $4.
The combined stock sales of Mr. Scrushy, who stepped down as chief executive in August but remains as chairman, were the fifth largest at the bottom 100 companies this year. He has previously said that the options were expiring and that he sold the stock to diversify his holdings.
But management experts point out that the expiration date of an option is the last day when an executive must buy or forfeit the underlying share; the expiration does not require them to sell the share. Convincing them to hold the stock, experts add, should be the board's job.
"Long holding periods focus executives on long-term results," said Richard E. Cavanagh, the chief executive of the Conference Board, a business-backed research company that set up a commission on corporate governance this year.
"You can always dress up a company to make it look good for six months," he said. "It's real hard to dress it up and make it look good for five years."
WorldCom has adopted rules that may be even stricter than G.E.'s. WorldCom's new chief executive, Michael D. Capellas, must hold 75 percent of all stock he receives -- after exercise costs and taxes -- until at least six months after he leaves the company. If the company emerges from bankruptcy, Mr. Capellas will receive $12 million in stock, according to a contract approved this month by two federal judges.
"What this says here is, 'we are going to start a new tenure,' " Mr. Capellas said to reporters. "It starts at the top and it sets a tone, and it sends a positive message."
Former WorldCom executives -- including Scott D. Sullivan, who has been indicted on charges of securities fraud -- made millions of dollars on stock sales in recent years, before the company restated its earnings.
Of course, some companies have given executives so much stock that they can still become wealthy by selling only 25 percent of it.
Some compensation consultants predict that rules like WorldCom's will become more common as board members and executives take more steps to distance themselves from the scandals of the last year. 
"You're going to have more comp committees that say, 'If I'm going to give significant equity opportunities, I want you to hold it for a substantial amount of time,' " said Mr. Foley, the executive compensation lawyer. "That holds your feet to the fire."
G.E. has already received calls from "a lot of big companies" requesting detailed information about its policy, according to Gary Sheffer, a company spokesman. 
THE Conference Board's commission of executives, investors and others -- which included John W. Snow, President Bush's nominee for Treasury secretary -- has also joined the effort. Blaming excessive pay and stock grants for some of the "unprecedented loss of confidence" in corporate America, it released a set of recommendations in September for companies to consider. In addition to suggesting that companies treat options as an expense on their income statement, the group called on companies to adopt holding periods for executive stock.
The commission did not recommend a specific holding period. Some members argued that it should be the length of an executive's career, and others wanted shorter periods, Mr. Cavanagh said.
The fact that the commission could not arrive at a detailed compromise may end up the best predictor of the popularity of holding periods. Many executives have said they have no interest in adopting them, and relatively few corporate boards have defied their executives in recent years.
"Change is difficult," said Mr. Gilbert of the Pennsylvania retirement system. "You have a lot of people who've gotten very wealthy and don't want to give that up. It's going to require leadership -- more leadership from corporate America than we've seen and more leadership from investors."

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN PICTURES: JANUARY/FEBRUARY 

 BODY:
 For many Americans, 2002 as it opened felt like the year after, a turn in the calendar from the previous September and all it signified. In New York City, a new mayor took the oath of office on New Year's Day as the grim effort of digging through the remains of the World Trade Center went on. In Washington, crews were still working to fill the gaping hole in the side of the Pentagon. Gradually, the sense of shock would easen and signs of recovery appear, but in the early months of the year, much of the news remained disturbing. The full scale of the Enron debacle became clear as the company declared bankruptcy and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, resigned. The Ford Motor Company announced it was shutting down five plants, adding another 35,000 to the growing number of unemployed Americans. And in a precursor of revelations to come, John J. Geoghan, a former Massachusetts priest accused of sexually molesting 130 children, was convicted of the indecent assault of a young boy. Overseas, a suicide bombing in Jerusalem, the first ever by a woman, set the tone for a vicious cycle of bombings and retaliations that would continue through the year, and in Pakistan, terrorists kidnapped and then gruesomely murdered Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal correspondent. 
 The Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City were dominated by figure skating, with the judges taking the spotlight. When a crowd-pleasing Canadian couple was narrowly defeated by the Russian performers in the pairs event, an uproar ensued. The Canadians were later granted a second set of gold medals when a French judge admitted succumbing to pressure in what was described as a vote-trading deal. Sarah Hughes, a Long Island teenager, upstaged a potent field in the women's skating event with a performance no one disputed.

HEADLINE: Europe Banker Open to Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
A war in Iraq would hurt the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, said today, and he indicated that the bank would not rule out a further cut in interest rates next year to bolster growth.
 In an interview on Dutch television, Mr. 
Duisenberg said he thought that consumer confidence in the United States was already suffering as a result of uncertainty over a prospective war with Iraq. 
 "A war is bad news for the economy," Mr. Duisenberg said, adding that rising oil prices would be costly to consumers as well.
In a separate interview with a German paper, Bild am Sonntag, Mr. Duisenberg said the central bank remained open to a further easing in rates, after a decision on Dec. 5 to lower them by half a percentage point.
"We are always flexible on this," he said. "But we are also focused on stability and continuity."
Mr. Duisenberg said he expected economic growth in the euro zone to increase next year, although recovery would occur more slowly than expected. "Things will improve again next year, maybe even during the first half of the year," he said. "But over all, it will happen more slowly than we had hoped for."

HEADLINE: A Big Fat Increase at the Box Office; 
A Record Year, but Reasons for Caution Amid Hollywood Riches

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
An awesome achievement! Enormously enriching! The biggest box-office year of all time! 
 Sometime in the next few days, when the final figures dribble in from the farthest-flung theaters in the back end of nowhere, the crowing will begin in Hollywood about yet another record-shattering year at the movies. 
 More than $9 billion worth of tickets were sold in North America in 2002, up about 10 percent over last year's record. Even with higher prices, actual attendance was up at least 5 percent, reaching levels not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House.
But let's not pop those Champagne corks just yet. There are plenty of reasons for concern and doubt amid the hype and hyperventilating. 
This was the year of both "Spider-Man" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," when the major studios embraced franchise series for dear life -- the sequels, prequels, remakes, spinoffs and comic-book blockbusters that offer the path of least risk -- and then declared themselves puzzled that audiences adopted an inexpensive, sentimental, starless comedy that at least offered something light, comforting and family friendly.
It was also, by general consent in Hollywood, an unusually strong year for movies, spurred by well-regarded spring and summer fare like "About a Boy," "Insomnia," "Minority Report" and "Road to Perdition" and then bolstered by the best holiday movie season in years: critically acclaimed efforts like "Chicago," "The Hours," "About Schmidt," "Adaptation," "Far From Heaven," "Talk to Her," "Nicholas Nickleby," "Gangs of New York" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." 
But it was also a year in which many of those films either struggled to find an audience or performed more weakly than expected, some of them threatening to get lost altogether in a late-year gush of Oscar contenders. One of the most ambitious and expensive of the holiday epics, for instance, Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York," looks unlikely to come anywhere near its estimated $110 million production costs in United States ticket sales. 
Yes, "Spider-Man" led the 2002 box office, its $404 million gross nearly a third larger than the $310 million earned by second-place "Star Wars: Episode 2 -- Attack of the Clones." And yes, whether the year's final tally turns out to be $9.2 billion or only $9.1 billion, it is a significant increase that comes at a time when almost all other forms of popular entertainment are suffering shrinking revenues and dwindling audiences.
But it does not mean, as some may interpret it, that movies are more central to American life than ever.
"It's a totally different world, and people have a lot of options other than movies," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles-based company that monitors box-office results. "In a sense it's intriguing that as relatively old-fashioned a medium as movies are still one of the top entertainment choices for Americans."
In 1929, when the annual box office was $720 million, the average person in the United States (including everyone, infants and all) went to the movies 40 times a year. There were 4.9 billion tickets sold that year. 
This year an estimated 1.5 billion tickets were sold, the highest since 1.8 billion in 1959. But because of population growth, the average person saw only about 5 movies this year, compared with 10 in 1959. 
Even this is a little misleading, because the 2002 audience is actually made up of a small core of people -- mostly under the age of 25 -- who go to the movies regularly, and a smaller group that goes only once or twice in a year. 
"The situation is that 20 percent of the audience represents 80 percent of the box office," said Robert Bucksbaum, president of ReelSource, a company that monitors the box office. "So you have a lot of movies that are geared towards that same audience."
Even the "Spider-Man" millions seem a tad less impressive when measured against blockbusters from years past, once the grosses are adjusted for inflation.
The $159 million that "The Sound of Music" made in 1965 becomes, in today's dollars, an eye-popping $905 million. The $260 million that "Jaws" earned after its 1975 release is suddenly $866 million. 
And the $323 million that "Star Wars" made in its initial round of releases in 1977, followed by an additional $138 million for a 1997 rerelease, becomes $1.1 billion in today's dollars. Take that, web-slinger.
"The movie business is all about hype and buzz," said David Davis, an entertainment analyst for Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, an investment banking firm. "And inflation really works to their advantage."
In the mid-1980's, when newspapers and magazines first began publishing weekend box-office figures, the studios resisted the trend. But soon, when they saw a way to use the lists to help market films, the process was gradually co-opted and controlled by the studios, which can simply ride the inflation rocket and release their movies in more and more theaters to create record after record. Producers of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," for instance, have been promoting it as the No. 1 romantic comedy of all time, which is true, to a degree. It has made about $218 million since its release in April, beating the previous record of $178 million set by "Pretty Woman" in 1990. But adjust those 1990 dollars for inflation, and "Pretty Woman" made $244 million in today's economy. 
And in terms of the actual attendance, about 37 million tickets were sold for "Greek Wedding" compared with 42 million for "Pretty Woman."
Studio by studio, there is no question: this was the year for Sony Pictures Entertainment and its Columbia TriStar Pictures banner. The studio is expected to have sold $1.55 billion worth of tickets in North American theaters by year's end, a record not only for Sony but also for any studio. Its $1.3 billion in international sales creates a $2.85 billion worldwide gross that beats 20th Century Fox's $2.7 billion record in 1998, the year it had "Titanic" in theaters.
"We're ahead by an obscene amount," Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said happily. "We had the good fortune to have some good franchise pictures that really delivered."
Still, even Sony had its flops. "I Spy," a comic thriller loosely based on the 60's television drama, was a substantial dud in October. And "Stuart Little 2" earned less than half of what the first film made two years ago.
A certain amount of franchise fatigue was in evidence elsewhere, too. Warner Brothers offered several clunkers (the sequel "Analyze That" was the most recent) but also kick-started a new franchise with last summer's "Scooby-Doo." It's biggest year-end film, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," looks to top out at about $250 million, compared with $318 million the first "Harry Potter" film generated last year.
New Line Cinema, a ministudio that is also owned by AOL Time Warner, had no such problems with its year-end sequel, "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." It looks likely to earn considerably more than the $313 million the first installment, "The Fellowship of the Ring," made last year.
Universal Pictures, which had strong showings the last two years, claimed a profitable 2002 but had no mega-hit. And two of its franchises -- "Red Dragon," a prequel to its Hannibal Lecter series, and "The Scorpion King," a spinoff from the recent "Mummy" films -- both earned far less than previous movies in those series. Is franchise fatigue to be the trend of the future? 
Universal, which is owned by Vivendi, a French conglomerate, had (like AOL Time Warner) its share of executive squabbling. Its former chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, was ousted, and rumors grew that the company, a former water utility, intended to sell off its entertainment assets, including the movie studio. "I know this studio is very focused on what we have to deliver," said Nikki Rocco, Universal's president of distribution. "We are a stable management, despite what is going on internally at the top of the corporation."
MGM, meanwhile, had a perfectly dreadful first half of the year, with a string of high-priced flops, only to be saved at year's end by its own stalwart hero, James Bond, in "Die Another Day." 
The case of Viacom's Paramount Pictures was particularly perplexing. With the most stable management in Hollywood and a corporate strategy that has reliably produced a steady steam of profitable fare, the studio had one miss after another in 2002, culminating with "Star Trek: Nemesis," a box-office fizzle that has all but buried one of the studio's most durable franchises. 
Disney, which looks to end the year in second place, had a huge hit with M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs," and some relatively smaller hits like "Santa Clause 2" and "Lilo & Stitch." But the failure of "Treasure Planet," from the studio's legendary animation team, was a distressing sour note at Thanksgiving.
And then there was Miramax, the upstart ministudio that is part of the Disney empire; it had not a single breakout hit all year long. But Miramax, as is its practice, has flooded the last weeks of the year with more than a half-dozen Oscar-bait films, including the struggling "Gangs of New York" and "Chicago," a critically acclaimed adaptation of the Broadway musical that has emerged as the early Oscar front-runner.
"Without question, the two movies that exemplified the year were 'Spider-Man' and 'Greek Wedding,' " Mr. Dergarabedian said. "They couldn't be more different in terms of budgeting, marketing, everything. But they were both mega-blockbusters. It just says that moviegoers are open to anything. As long as it's a good movie of course."

HEADLINE: Finding Wrongs, Through the Prism of Silicon Valley 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
Seeking to mirror its aggressive pursuit of executives on Wall Street, the Justice Department is putting a new focus on Silicon Valley, pursuing managers of the technology boom who are suspected of crossing the line into securities fraud and insider trading.
 The United States attorney here is under pressure from Washington to mount prosecutions swiftly . The effort was punctuated last month by the indictment last month of Phillip E. White, the former chief executive of Informix, a database company that was based in Menlo Park, Calif., and has since been bought by I.B.M. Prosecutors assert that the company lied about its revenue, leading it to inflate the value of its stock by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 The government has also brought charges or received convictions in the last year against executives or employees at least nine high-technology companies, including Critical Path, the e-mail network company.
But as federal law enforcement officials increase their scrutiny here, Valley executives say the effort may be more political than practical. And they say the government is unlikely to find extensive fraud at the Valley's most well-known firms -- the equivalent of Enron or WorldCom -- but will instead make examples of smaller entrepreneurs. 
Other Silicon Valley executives, along with lawyers representing shareholder groups, say that the peculiarities of the high-tech business, particularly its emphasis on selling software and reliance on stock options, may provide fertile ground for aggressive prosecutors.
"The efforts are definitely intensifying," said Andrew C. Hruska, senior counsel to the deputy attorney general in Washington. Mr. Hruska said the California office had been charged with being "better and swifter" and bringing more cases. "We want more concentration on getting results," he said. "We don't want to rush anything, but it's important to work swiftly."
Patrick Robbins, chief of the securities fraud section for the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, based in San Francisco, said the government had a number of executives under investigation.
"They generally revolve around the computer industry, but they're not really dot-com bubble-type companies," Mr. Robbins said. He said the other common thread here and elsewhere in the country was the enormous pressure for companies to meet revenue and growth projections. "You can see evidence of it throughout the 90's and during the last two years," he said.
Mr. Hruska conceded that the effort meant moving resources into the corporate fraud investigations and prosecutions from other areas, though he declined to specify which kinds of cases might receive less attention. In the Northern District of California, nine lawyers are assigned full time to a securities fraud section, the second-largest such section after New York's 25-lawyer group. (Two members of the San Francisco team are assigned to the Enron case.)
In the case of Informix, which made database software, prosecutors contend that in 1996 the company created what are known as "side agreements" with several major distributors. According to the indictment, Informix reached agreements with Hewlett-Packard, in a deal worth $6.4 million, and with Fujitsu, for $4.7 million, that would have allowed the technology companies to back out of their contracts.
The indictment alleges that Mr. White, the chief executive, learned about the deals in 1997 but did not disclose them to auditors or finance staff at first to avoid having to restate revenues, then tried to change the deals in a way that would mask, but not eliminate, the legal problems they represented.
According to a statement issued by the United States Attorney's Office, Mr. White took his actions "in order to falsely inflate Informix's financial performance, to induce investors to continue to invest in the company, to artificially sustain Informix's stock price and to maintain Mr. White's position in the company and reputation."
The indictment asserts that when Informix ultimately disclosed in 1997 that it would have to restate its 1996 revenue by more than $200 million -- including tens of millions in overstated revenue in Europe, according to the federal government -- its stock price dropped to $6.25 from $12.20, costing shareholders $900 million. The company also reported that rather than turning a profit of $97 million during 1996, it actually suffered $73 million loss. Informix was acquired by I.B.M. in 2001.
Mr. White, who resigned from Informix in 1997, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Elliot R. Peters of San Francisco, said in a statement that Mr. White had acted "properly and responsibly" and said that when Mr. White was cleared, the public would "ask why an innocent man was forced to answer these baseless charges."
The case is one of several here revolving around years-old activities. In August, prosecutors won a conviction against Steven J. Allan, a former officer of Media Vision Technology, for actions intended to inflate earnings at the company in 1993 and 1994. (The company later filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, renamed itself Aureal Semiconductor and was ultimately sold.) And in August, a former executive from California Micro Devices, a chip maker, was sentenced to 30 months for insider trading for charges stemming from activities that took place in 1994.
Mr. Hruska, who said he had urged swifter action from prosecutors, declined to say why indictments and convictions had lagged. Mr. Robbins also declined to comment on the pace of investigations and prosecutions.
There have been indictments and convictions involving more recent activity, too. The White indictment comes on the heels of a guilty plea for insider trading by Jonathan A. Beck, 31, a former vice president at Critical Path -- the fourth Critical Path executive to plead guilty this year. The government this year also has obtained insider-trading indictments against an executive from Adaptec Inc., a maker of storage and networking products, for trades made in 1999.
But Mr. Robbins, the chief of the securities section here, said the larger focus had been on accounting fraud. The government has gained convictions this year in various accounting fraud schemes perpetrated by executives of Indus International, a management software company, as well as in a case against HPL Technologies, which makes software for semiconductor companies. The government also brought indictments against executives at Quintus and Unify, two software companies.
But some Valley executives and legal experts say there has not been an indictment involving a big-name firm since 2000, when the government indicted two former executives of McKesson-HBOC (now known as just McKesson), a large pharmaceutical wholesale company based in San Francisco. Charges in that case are still pending. 
The cases brought so far "don't strike me as being particularly noteworthy," said Ronald J. Gilson, a professor of law and business at Columbia University and Stanford University. Mr. Gilson said that he was not certain the increased scrutiny of the Valley would yield major results approaching the multibillion-dollar fraud schemes in Enron.
"The Valley has been reasonably clean of the massive stuff," Mr. Gilson said, but he added, "Given certain practices that have turned up as peculiar to tech companies, you'd expect the U.S. attorney to start looking."
The practices that have raised flags, even for some longtime veterans of the Valley who ultimately defend them, have to do with how some technology companies recognize revenue, and particularly the way they did during the boom.
In the case of software sales, which often involve multiyear deals, a major gray area exists in determining whether to book the revenue when the deal is signed, or when some or all of the software is delivered and installed. The problem worsened during the boom, when both software and Internet companies were signing many multiyear deals ultimately worth tens of millions of dollars.
Another peculiarity of the boom time was the popularity of barter deals: a dot-com start-up would buy a product from a company, and the company would then advertise with the dot-com, which would book the advertising as revenue.
Stewart Alsop, a venture capitalist with New Enterprise Associates, said the Valley was relatively free of fraud, but he added that some people sought to take advantage of the gray areas during the dot-com boom.
"The carpetbaggers showed up, and the day-trippers and tourists came along, and with that you got some crooks," Mr. Alsop said. "There is a pretty gray line between incompetence and fraud."
Still, Mr. Alsop and other executives and long-time venture capitalists said that the region was less susceptible to widespread fraud because the companies tended to be small, entrepreneurial and closely watched by venture capitalists, who are sophisticated investors.
But James M. Finberg, a lawyer who represents shareholders, including those in a suit against Informix that he said had resulted in settlements of more than $220 million, said Silicon Valley was particularly susceptible to fraud because of another of its peculiarities: its reliance on stock options.
"People who are compensated in options had an incentive to inflate prices," he said.
Mr. Finberg commended the United States attorney in San Francisco, asserting that the office was "getting faster" at bringing indictments once it learned of cases. He said that second to New York, no other district had had as many security fraud cases as the San Francisco area.
"There is a pattern here," he said, referring to company behavior. "There will be more indictments."

HEADLINE: Glass Panes And Software: Windows Name Is Challenged 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
There is no question that Microsoft Windows, the name of the dominant personal computer operating system, is one of the leading brands in the world. Today, Windows is the face of computing for nearly 400 million people worldwide -- the software that determines the look and basic operations of more than 90 percent of all PC's.
 But success, money and monopoly, it seems, do not put even so familiar a name as Microsoft Windows beyond challenge. An upstart company, Lindows.com, is trying to persuade the Federal District Court in Seattle to invalidate Microsoft's trademark on Windows. 
 At issue is the level of legal protection that should, or should not, be accorded to an ordinary word that Microsoft adopted as its own: windows.
The litigation so far -- a mounting pile of evidence and briefs -- provides a detailed narrative of the origins and rise of a mega-brand, and a primer on trademark law. And an order by Judge John C. Coughenour, refusing Microsoft's plea for a temporary injunction against Lindows.com, suggests that Microsoft has a fight on its hands against a feisty start-up with fewer than 50 employees. 
In January, Judge Coughenour is expected to decide on Lindows.com's motion for a summary judgment -- a ruling from the bench -- that the Windows trademark should be revoked. But that is a long shot. Both sides are preparing for a trial that is scheduled to begin in Seattle on April 7, when a jury is expected to begin weighing whether Lindows is an illegal copycat brand and whether Microsoft's trademark on Windows should be taken away.
Lindows.com is defending a broad principle, its lawyer says. "No company, no matter how powerful, no matter how much money it has spent, should be able to gain a commercial monopoly on words in the English language," said the lawyer, Daniel Harris, a partner at Clifford Chance.
Microsoft, understandably, says a different principle is at stake. According to its court filings, the company has spent $1.2 billion on marketing and promoting Windows since the first version was announced in 1983 and shipped in 1985. "Our request in this case is simply that Lindows not free-ride on the investments we have made in building Windows into one of the most recognizable brands in the world over the last 20 years," said Jon Murchinson, a spokesman for Microsoft.
Microsoft started the legal spat. It filed a complaint against Lindows .com last December claiming trademark infringement, trademark dilution and unfair competition. That was five months after Lindows.com was founded and before it had a product on the market. 
Lindows.com's stated intention is to market desktop operating software based on Linux, an operating system, distributed free, whose basic code is written and debugged by a volunteer community of programmers. To date, Linux has done well as an operating system for the server computers that run corporate networks and the Internet. But it has made scant progress in loosening Microsoft's grip on the market for PC operating systems, where Microsoft enjoys a monopoly.
Microsoft filed its trademark suit against Lindows.com, saying it was using a copycat name, and then asked the court for a preliminary injunction to halt quickly what it deemed an illegal practice by an emerging rival.
Nonsense, Lindows.com replied. "Windows" is a generic term, it said, first used more than two decades ago for software systems that could display programs or data in rectangular windows on PC screens. Lindows.com submitted declarations from expert witnesses and trade press articles from the 1980's, when several software companies were offering desktop environments. They spoke of the "window wars" of those years and had headlines like "Microsoft Does Windows."
In his order last March, Judge Coughenour denied Microsoft's request for a preliminary injunction in a 29-page order indicating that the little-known defendant had scored some points.
"Although Lindows.com certainly made a conscious decision to play with fire by choosing a product and company name that differs by only one letter from the world's leading computer software program," the judge wrote, "one could just as easily conclude that in 1983 Microsoft made an equally risky decision to name its product after a term commonly used in the trade to indicate the windowing capability of a G.U.I." G.U.I. stands for graphical user interface, the system that lets people navigate by using on-screen icons and a mouse to point and click.
Lindows.com was emboldened. It sued to invalidate Microsoft's trademark on Windows in October and asked for a summary judgment. "After Microsoft tried to get the court to shut us down and failed, we're fighting back," said Michael Robertson, the founder and chief executive of Lindows.com. "They lobbed a grenade into our office, and we just lobbed it back."
Mr. Robertson, who is 35, is well aware of the commercial value of association with a familiar name, and he is no stranger to lawsuits. He was the chief executive and a founder of MP3.com, a music-sharing service on the Web named for the popular software format for sharing audio files. MP3.com was sued by major record companies, including Universal, Warner, EMI and Sony, for copyright infringement.
Mr. Robertson sold MP3.com to Vivendi for $372 million in cash and stock in May 2001. The MP3.com experience, he says, was good training for taking on Microsoft. 
Microsoft sees a pattern in Mr. Robertson's past, regarding him as a serial opportunist who is trying to exploit the intellectual property rights of others once again.
Microsoft observes in a filing that the courts have typically slapped down copycat brands selected by newcomers: Prozac won legal protection from Herbrozac in antidepressant drugs, Apple prevailed over Pineapple in computers, and Huggies successfully challenged Dougies in diapers.
The Lindows.com side replies that Prozac, Apple and Huggies were names made up by Eli Lilly, Apple Computer and Kimberly-Clark. Trademark law affords the greatest protection to words that are fanciful or arbitrary, like Apple. Next in line for legal protection are names that are suggestive of what a product does, like Huggies. Next comes a descriptive term, which describes an attribute of a product, and last come names that are generic, or widely understood to mean a category of products. Generic terms cannot be trademarked.
The legal fault line in this case lies between descriptive and generic. Microsoft's argument, in essence, is that Windows is a term for the window feature of the company's product that, by dint of Microsoft's huge investment, has acquired a powerful "secondary meaning." In a court filing last month, Microsoft submitted as evidence a consumer survey that found that 83 percent of people who used PC's at work and 73 percent of PC users at home regarded Windows as a Microsoft trademark and not a generic name. 
In written testimony last month, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, asserted that while Windows enabled the display of on-screen windows, its ambitions were much larger. Mr. Gates said that unlike most competing products in the early 1980's, which were simple window systems, Windows is a layer of software between an operating system and an application like a word processor. As such, he added, the Windows layer has allowed outside software developers to write all kinds of applications that run on Windows.
In the early 1980's, "Windows represented a new kind of product for personal computers," Mr. Gates wrote. "It was not part of any existing product category."
Developers of products like Microware Windows -- graphical window software that preceded Microsoft's entry -- may take issue with Mr. Gates's claim. But his testimony is the basis for Microsoft's assertion that the company was not using the term in a generic way when it came up with the Windows name in 1983.
The single person most responsible for Microsoft's selecting the name Windows, according to court documents, was Rowland Hanson, a marketer who came from Neutrogena, the soap and cosmetics maker. Until Mr. Hanson arrived in May 1983, the new software was called Interface Manager, which the programmers liked.
Understandably, Mr. Hanson scrambled for an alternative. He had scant knowledge of computers at the time. "I recall that windowing or something like that had been used by somebody," Mr. Hanson said in deposition testimony, "and that's what triggered me to think about it as windows. . . . I looked at our product, and ours was clearly, had windows on the screen."
So Microsoft Windows it was.
The rise of the Windows brand came slowly, and Microsoft's efforts to win a trademark for the product were rebuffed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 1995, the court records show. In rejecting the company's application to register Windows in 1993, the agency found that the word was "a generic designation for the applicant's goods" and that "no amount of evidence of de facto secondary meaning" could justify trademark status.
In the 1993 deliberation, Borland International, a software maker that had trademark applications pending on products containing the word "windows," filed a letter protesting Microsoft's application. Later that year, according to court records, Microsoft purchased Borland's pending trademark applications for $1 million.
Microsoft then renewed its efforts unopposed, and in early 1995 the trademark office approved the registration of the Windows trademark. The 1995 approval, Judge Coughenour noted in his order, was rendered "with no analysis or explanation for its reversal of the original decision to refuse registration."
The historical record, according to Lindows.com, supports its countersuit against Microsoft. 
If Microsoft lost its trademark on Windows, what difference would it make now? Legally protected or not, the Microsoft Windows brand is firmly entrenched, a monopoly in people's minds, it seems.
Still, a loss of trademark would open the door to an uppity PC maker or AOL that wanted to use the Windows name. Imagine "H-P Windows," "I.B.M. Windows," "Dell Windows" or "AOL Windows." Most likely, Mr. Robertson speculated, a big-brand alternative would be based on Linux, like Lindows.com. "It's not out of the realm of possibility at all," he said.
Today, any such Linux-based alternative would probably pose a more imminent threat to Mr. Robertson's company than to Microsoft. No matter, said Mr. Robertson, who portrays his David-versus-Goliath adventure as a quest for greater competition in the economy. People, he said, are always complaining about Microsoft. "But if you want to do something about Microsoft, go give them some competition," he said. "I'm young, I'm rich and I can do it."

Northeast Quietly Becomes A Health Care Corridor
With little of the fame that can be claimed by Silicon Valley, the Northeast's urban corridor has quietly built its own economic powerhouse by becoming the nation's health-care epicenter. Roughly following the line of Amtrak's Metroliner and stretching from Boston to Bethesda, Md., this medical megalopolis encompasses a vast array of health care facilities.
 The region is anchored by urban complexes serving as homes for many influential teaching hospitals and includes big suburban campuses of most of the world's major drug companies. It also stretches to clusters of research outfits in the Boston area and around the National Institutes of Health outside of Washington. Economic Pulse. Page A1. 

A $9 Billion Year for the Movies
Sometime in the next few days, the crowing will begin in Hollywood about yet another record-shattering year at the movies. More than $9 billion worth of tickets were sold in North America in 2002, led by "Spider-Man" with its $404 Million gross. Even with higher prices, actual attendance was up at least 5 percent, reaching levels not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House. The Arts.

HEADLINE: After 9/11, Parcels of Money, and Dismay 

BYLINE:  This article was reported and written by Edward Wyatt, David W. Chen, Charles V. Bagli and Raymond Hernandez.

 BODY:
In the months after nearly 2,800 people died in the terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center, the Bush administration pledged $21.4 billion to address the emergency. The extraordinary allocation of federal disaster relief, while less than local elected officials had petitioned for, was meant to reassure, restore and restart an emotionally and economically ravaged New York City and surrounding region.
 More than 15 months later, some $4.5 billion to $5 billion has made its way from Washington to New York. Significant sums of money were made available almost immediately, and they made possible early progress in providing for victims and establishing a sense that the city could rebound. 
 Roughly $600 million was sent to cover the costs of the monumental task of cleaning up the site. An additional $401 million has been distributed to some 10,000 downtown businesses to keep them afloat. And $493 million in tax-free bonds have been approved to help finance major construction projects, including three residential complexes around ground zero. 
But many victims, elected officials, business executives and others are both confused and angry about why, more than a year after the most serious terrorist attack on American soil, less than a quarter of the federal government's promise of financial assistance has been realized, why hundreds of millions of dollars that are in the hands of New York officials have gone unclaimed, and why firm decisions have yet to be made on how additional billions of dollars will actually be spent.
The explanations, based on an examination of financial filings and interviews with government officials, real estate experts, watchdog organizations and downtown residents and business people, are varied.
Some $1 billion of the $21.4 billion in aid, it turns out, will buy insurance for the companies that conducted the cleanup, which they would use to defend themselves against any lawsuits. Aides to some New York elected officials who have tracked the money also believe that some of New York's promised millions have gone to victims and institutions in Pennsylvania and Washington, the other two sites of devastation wrought by terrorists on Sept. 11.
Moreover, federal officials never intended to deliver another huge chunk of the money -- some $5 billion to rebuild the transportation network downtown -- for years, determined to wait until there was a fully formulated plan. No one doubts that the government will make good on its pledge. But the jobs that such a project would bring and the tangible benefits to the city remain far off.
Further, many businesses and residents were shocked to learn that hundreds of millions of dollars in grants available to them were subject to federal taxes, a fact that both reduced the real value of that aid and discouraged some from taking advantage of it. Many people have also failed to realize that about a quarter of the total aid package -- some $5.5 billion -- was made up of tax breaks, not real dollars. So the ultimate value of that portion is the subject of great debate, with some economists and real estate experts in the city worried that it is largely an illusion.
Distrust among the government agencies involved in controlling the aid, and self-confessed bureaucratic missteps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is in charge of channeling nearly $9 billion to New York, has also led to delays in payments and disillusionment among potential recipients.
And finally, some of the money has not made its way to New York because local and state officials have not figured out exactly how to take advantage of all the available types of aid. Other bids for financing certain projects -- $90 million to help assess the long-term health of thousands of trade center rescue workers, $980 million to reimburse the city and state for the cost of deploying its uniformed forces and future fire department training, have been stalled.
"You can look at the trees, and see many things that should have been done better or quicker," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has been involved in negotiating the aid packages. "But if you look at the forest, it's a large and unprecedented sum of money that's basically being used in the way that it was needed and intended. The spending of the money has been far from perfect, but over all, it's been pretty good."
Determining precisely how much money has made it to New York and actually been distributed is difficult. An examination by The New York Times of the dozens of sources and uses of the promised $21.4 billion in disaster aid found significant disparities in accounting for the money, both among the federal officials handling it and the organizations, people and institutions in New York and the region receiving it.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget has one set of figures for how much has been given, and congressional staff members have a different set, and there is some belief that double counting has occurred. Beyond that, the number of government agencies and organizations involved in the effort is daunting, and the money was appropriated in different pieces of legislation. Indeed, a tabulation by The Times of the total amount pledged by various federal agencies adds up to only $21.3 billion.
Responsibility for definitively tracking where it has all gone remains unclear. For instance, last September, an official with the federal General Accounting Office told New York officials that the O.M.B. appeared to be so uncertain of how much had been spent that it asked the General Accounting Office -- an unusual request since it is the O.M.B.'s job to monitor federal expenditures.
But establishing some specific answers and general trends was possible, as was identifying unanswered questions about enormous amounts of money.
It is clear, for instance, that FEMA, after much confusion and repeated complaints, has spent $84 million in its program to provide emergency rent and mortgage assistance. But FEMA says it still has more than $360 million that, absent specific requests by New York officials, has no determined fate.

The Agency
Much-Disputed Role In Delivering Aid
Of all the federal agencies involved in New York's recovery effort, none has played a greater or more disputed role than the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The agency, which many officials at local and federal levels now believe was a poor choice to play such a large role in a unique economic disaster, was charged with handling $8.8 billion in aid meant to address multiple needs.
Currently, some $2.3 billion of that total has been paid out, or is close to being claimed by recipients, including roughly $600 million for those involved in cleaning up ground zero, $62 million for the city medical examiner's office and $16.7 million for people who lost their jobs after Sept. 11.
Officials with the agency, after months of requests from elected officials, recently released what they said was the definitive accounting of the agency's money. As part of that listing, FEMA officials said that in addition to the $2.3 billion paid, $6.1 billion has been earmarked for certain programs or projected as the likely costs for a range of efforts. One of those projections, for instance, involves a possible $800 million payment to the Port Authority; another involves the $91 million allocation for an environmental cleanup program. 
And finally, the agency said the fate of some $366 million was as yet undetermined.
But while the agency has drawn praise for its prompt and complete payment for the cleanup effort, virtually every other aspect of its performance and its accounting has been the object of criticism and debate -- the rate and speed with which it compensated people who suffered economically, its failures to publicize some of its aid programs, and the delayed public disclosures about where its money had gone.
"Is it moving along as expeditiously as we hoped? No," said Representative John E. Sweeney, Republican from New York, who added that he thought New York officials had often gotten "the runaround" from FEMA. "But I think the pressure needs to be constant from Congress." He added, "I'm not ready to say that I am absolutely frustrated, but I think the next six months are going to be rather critical."
For all the acrimony and suspicion, though, FEMA officials have sought to dispel any notion that New York will not get the full amount of money it was promised.
"FEMA will spend the $8.8 billion on this disaster, no question about it," said Brad Gair, the agency's federal recovery officer in New York. "It will all be spent."
For FEMA, which typically tackles hurricanes, earthquakes and ice storms in rural or suburban settings, the terror attack in Lower Manhattan was a disaster without precedent in terms of scale, cost and landscape. And some of the most intense criticism of the agency has grown out of the issue of whether its models for distributing aid work in a situation where much of the damage was not just physical, but economic. The victims, too, were spread over different boroughs and states.
The agency's handling of its program to help people avoid eviction or foreclosure has been a representative problem. The agency has admitted bungling the program, sending out the wrong applications and having people without knowledge of New York's geography review aid requests. When it was revealed that the agency was turning down applicants at a rate never before seen in a disaster, it was forced to adjust its requirements.
To date, some $84 million has been paid out in the program -- less than half the $175 million that has been dedicated. And the $91 million program intended to help people clean their downtown apartments has so far paid out only $19 million, in part because eligible residents were unaware of it.
"We feel FEMA has done a good job getting the money out the door," Mr. Gair said.
The modest amounts paid out in some of FEMA's programs, though, raise the question of whether it is doing enough to distribute the cash. But they have also provoked great curiosity over whether FEMA will make any leftover money available for alternative uses.
The $366 million that by its own account is unallocated could grow by hundreds of millions if its payouts continue to run below projections.
The priorities are myriad for the remaining money. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, for instance, wants $90 million to monitor the long-term health of rescue workers who assisted in the trade center recovery effort. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, wants FEMA to live up to its promise to provide $33 million in funds for mental health services in New York's schools.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki want FEMA to reimburse the city and the state $980 million for expenses like the cost of deploying uniformed personnel and for future fire department training costs that are not already covered under FEMA regulations.
So far, those efforts have stalled. Further, numerous officials have begun to express alarm about whether FEMA's $8.8 billion will be enough in the end.
Mr. Gair has conceded that New York may have more needs than FEMA can cover. 
"New York shouldn't have to choose whether it needs to take care of fire, police or rebuilding its infrastructure," Mrs. Maloney said. "Historically, the response to disasters was based on need, and this is the first disaster where it's been based on how much money is available."
The debate over how much money remains available has focused more on the $21.4 billion, and whether it would prove adequate. After all, that figure was not based on any assessment, but was rather a number that grew out of early conversations between Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer and President Bush days after the attacks.
Securing any additional funds will not be easy, given the concerns over the ballooning federal deficit.
"Part of what we have to do is to show that we're not being greedy, we're not overreaching," said Mrs. Clinton. "But if you look at every other disaster, we are being conservative in saying what we need. So I am confident that we will be able to make the case."

The Bonds
Unused Tax Breaks In Uncertain Times
One of the biggest question marks in the federal aid effort is the $5.5 billion Liberty Zone tax package intended to stimulate employment and the construction of new office towers, residential buildings and retail shops in Lower Manhattan.
The $5.5 billion sum, which sounded a lot like cash to anxious New Yorkers back in March, is the value over time of the tax breaks accorded to employers and construction projects that contractors and entrepreneurs might undertake. It was not, and will never be, an infusion of cash.
Now, some state and city officials believe that the package was an ill-conceived device for addressing the damage to the city's economy. They say that the usefulness of the aid is dependent upon the willingness of people to invest in office buildings and other business opportunities at a moment when the future of downtown, and especially the market for office space, is seriously clouded.
To date, there are only four projects in line for a total of $493 million in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds, and three of them are residential complexes. State and city officials, as well as many real estate and business experts, say the tax enticements could not possibly be used by the end of 2004, the deadline established by Congress.
"The jury is out on how much of this will be used and how effective it will be," Mr. Schumer said.
Even estimating the total potential value of the package has proved difficult. The bond plan was trumpeted as a $5.5 billion funding package when it was announced, but the O.M.B. now puts its value at $5 billion. And a report done for the city by the accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers said that the entire package of tax incentives was worth just $3.8 billion.
"Our number's a more realistic estimate," one New York government official said. "But we don't want to appear ungrateful."
In the weeks after the attacks, Liberty Bonds emerged as a reconstruction tool in meetings between the White House, elected officials, the New York City Partnership and the Real Estate Board of New York. Those involved assumed that the bonds could be used to replace much of an estimated 25 million square feet of office space that had been damaged or destroyed. 
The economic stimulus package provides tax credits of $2,400 per employee in 2002 and 2003 for every business south of Canal Street with fewer than 200 employees. One provision allows the city, the state and other agencies to refinance certain debts, while another grants accelerated tax benefits for investment in new office space, equipment and technology. 
Finally, the legislation allows the city and the state to issue up to $8 billion in tax-free bonds for developers of office buildings, housing and retail projects below Canal Street. Of that, up to $2 billion in bonds can be used for commercial, but not residential, projects outside Lower Manhattan.
But clearly, the greatest concerns about what the aid will mean in real terms involves the city's current economic climate.
With the economy weak and layoffs sweeping Wall Street, there is little demand for new office towers in Lower Manhattan. Indeed, there is more vacant space in Manhattan now -- 46.4 million square feet -- than there is office space in all of San Francisco. That has led some officials to question the value of the Liberty Zone benefits as tools for rapidly reviving the downtown economy.
"No one can argue that hard cash for our immediate needs is much better than tax relief that might come later in an amount that might never be quantified," said Mrs. Maloney. "Lower Manhattan is economically still reeling from Sept. 11. We need help now."
The city and state have so far approved the use of the tax-exempt bonds for three residential towers in Lower Manhattan and an office building at Atlantic Center in Brooklyn for the Bank of New York. But in no case has the bond financing been completed, and experts say there is little current appetite for applying for more.
State and city officials say it is clear that they will not be able to use most of the bonds by the 2004 deadline. Recognizing that few commercial projects will qualify, city officials have been working with Mrs. Clinton to see if some of the bonds could be used for residential projects outside Lower Manhattan.
City and state officials say that they will almost certainly ask Congress to extend the deadline beyond 2004. "If demand perks up, we'll push for an extension of the deadline past 2004," said a senior state official. "Otherwise, we'll let it expire and ask them to give us some more cash."

The Grants
Many Are Offered, But Few Are Taken
In devising the aid package for New York, legislators in Washington and rebuilding officials in the city found a way to channel nearly $4 billion through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. The housing agency has the power to make block grants of money to address needs of particular urgency if existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to a community's health and welfare. 
Thus empowered, officials decided that $3.66 billion in grants of various kinds would flow through the two agencies. But only about $690 million, or less than one-fifth of the total, has been paid to downtown businesses and residents.
The most successful part of that financing effort has distributed $401 million to thousands of businesses large and small, giving some an opportunity they otherwise would not have had: the ability to survive in a precarious economic environment. And some $41 million has been used to make grants of up to $14,500 to any family willing to remain in Lower Manhattan for two years. That has at least played some role in helping return occupancy rates in residential buildings around ground zero to what they were before the attack.
But there are a variety of reasons why so much of the allocated money has been unused. Many small businesses felt the application process was too burdensome and confusing, and effectively gave up applying. Other businesses and residents discovered that some of the grants were subject to federal taxes and opted not to pursue the more-diminished amounts of money.
Further, some businesses found that because they were just outside the designated disaster zone, they were ineligible for money that many elected officials in New York believe was clearly intended to help them.
In Greenwich Village, for example, tourism dropped drastically. In Chinatown, restrictions on truck movements halted deliveries to many businesses, particularly garment factories. Businesses in much of those neighborhoods were entitled to grants totaling only a few days' receipts.
A second small-business program, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant program, is scheduled to distribute up to $291 million, but only $18.6 million has been distributed so far. Officials from the Empire State Development Corporation say they are trying to promote the program more to address a lack of applicants. 
And even the $41 million used to entice people to stay in Lower Manhattan amounts to a fraction of the money that was allocated for that effort. In all, officials had set aside $280 million for the retention program. But only 8,500 grants have been approved among 28,000 applications that were submitted as of early December. So far, only some 2,000 residents of the 50,000 eligible have actually received the grants.
Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said so little of the money for attracting companies has reached its intended targets because "we are in an economic situation where lots of companies are not making moves and are tightening their belts." However, he added, "the programs have been successful in helping a substantial number of businesses."
Rebuilding officials have had an easier time reaching out to big companies. A category of grants intended to benefit companies with more than 200 employees pays cash for a guarantee that a company will move to or remain in Lower Manhattan. That program, with a budget of $320 million, has so far paid 63 grants totaling $215 million.
Yet that program, too, has come under fire from fiscal watchdogs who question the need to pay grants to institutions -- like Pace University and the American Stock Exchange -- that were at small risk of leaving Lower Manhattan. The program has also had limited success in attracting new companies to downtown.
The distribution of HUD money has been complicated for months by the decision by Congress to use two different agencies to deliver it. Congress gave responsibility for $700 million in aid to Empire State Development, the economic development arm of the Pataki administration. It then opted to direct $2.7 billion through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the special entity set up by Mr. Pataki and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to oversee the rebuilding effort. 
When Empire State Development requested some $800 million in additional money to continue its grant programs and retention efforts, it had to go through the Lower Manhattan organization, which balked and turned over only $350 million. It then angered its counterpart by asking for a full accounting of the money Empire State had already handed out. 
As it stands, $1.3 billion of the $2.7 billion given to the Lower Manhattan agency still remains unspent and unallocated. Various people have their eyes on the money, not least Mr. Bloomberg, who laid out an ambitious plan to build housing, revitalize business districts and improve transportation in Lower Manhattan. The mayor said he intended to draw on many sources for that money, among them the development corporation.

The Wish List
A Grand Vision And a Hard Reality
The greatest chunk of hard money Washington promised to New York was meant to cover the costs of rebuilding, and perhaps vastly improving, the transportation hub downtown. While most everyone understood the money would come only after perhaps years of planning and preparation, it was viewed as one of the most vital components of aid if New York was to prosper.
But in the end, the package of transportation aid pledged was barely half what local officials desired.
For decades, downtown property owners and economic development officials had argued that the area suffered from a shortcoming that afflicted none of the country's other large central business districts: the lack of a rail connection to the region's major airports. Some also wanted better connections to the suburbs to the east and north enjoyed by Midtown. And there was talk of a grand point of arrival to house the newly connected transportation systems.
Thus, state and city officials went to Washington with a transportation wish list including those and nine other projects, with a total price tag of $7.5 billion. But federal officials balked at some of the efforts, like a new ferry terminal in Hoboken, N.J., that clearly had little relationship to Sept. 11. Other projects appeared to overlap: the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey wanted to build a point of arrival, but their proposed stations were two blocks apart.
A compromise totaling $4.5 billion was reached, but left out some projects on the wish list. Officials in Washington left it to New York to decide which ones. The money was a mix of nearly $3 billion from FEMA and roughly $2 billion more issued as part of a federal Department of Transportation grant.
"You figure out what is best and we are going to help fund that for you," Michael Brown, the deputy director of FEMA, told New York officials last summer.
Washington is still waiting. In October, Mr. Pataki sent a list of six projects, but no cost projections, to FEMA and the Federal Transit Administration, which will oversee the transit financing.
"We need further clarification defining the scope of the projects and the dollar amounts attached to each," said Kristi M. Clemens, a spokeswoman for the transit administration. 
Rebuilding officials say they are nearing an agreement, and promise that a full transportation plan will be offered early next year.
"The question now is," said Mr. Schumer, "are we going to think in a large-scale way that will change the face of downtown, or will we allow the money to be cannibalized into a lot of worthy but smaller-scale projects that ultimately won't change downtown?"
That the money will eventually reach New York may be inevitable, but its delayed arrival underscores how the federal government's emergency commitment to New York is in fact an extended work in progress.

On top of that, $2.3 billion worth of funds either has been paid out or is on the doorstep of its destination, so the total amount that FEMA is likely to contribute is about $8.8 billion. Transportation infrastructure: $2.8 billion State and city agencies (includes M.T.A., N.Y.P.D., F.D.N.Y., Port Authority, insurance for cleanup contractors): $2.6 billion Hazard mitigation (reinforce buildings or bolster security in subway and train stations): $420 million Human services (includes mortgage and rental assistance, and other assistance to individuals and families): $260 million Undetermined: $370 million FEMAAbout $6.5 billion has been pledged. TransportationThe federal Department of Transportation has about $1.8 billion left to allocate, but city and state officials must provide a list of specific projects and costs before any money is distributed. Another $550 million has been pledged to cover emergency and other transportation expenses. Department of Transportation (rebuild damaged subway and train lines at the World Trade Center): $1.8 billion Miscellaneous transportation (includes PATH and New Jersey Transit facilities, emergency ferry service, Amtrak tunnels): $550 million About half of these funds apparently remain unspent.: $225 million Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (H.U.D.) has about $1.3 billion left to allocate to specific projects. The Small Business Administration has distributed about $400 million in loans, costing the government about $200 million. Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, L.M.D.C. (possible uses include transportation, residential construction and memorial): $1.3 billion 'Liberty Zone' benefitsLiberty Zone (below Canal Street) benefits include tax credits for small companies, debt refinancing and tax-free bonds for developers of projects in the area. The O.M.B. initially estimated the value at $5.5 billion. It was revised to $5 billion after a different version of the spending package was passed in September. Officials assumed the bonds could be used to replace damaged office space downtown, but a recession has undermined demand, so the package's ultimate value remains uncertain. A revised estimate of the value drops it by: $500 million Potential benefits for the Liberty Zone (credits and tax savings): $4.9 billion A Clear Accounting of New York City's Federal Disaster Money Is Not EasyAfter Sept. 11, the Bush administration ultimately pledged about $21.4 billion in federal aid for New York City. Accounting for the pledges, obligations and spending is a difficult task because amounts vary depending on who is counting. The White House's Office of Management and Budget (O.M.B.) has one set of figures, Congress and the various agencies have others. The figure above is an attempt to bring the sources of funds together and show how they add up to about $21.3 billion. Amounts are rounded. Pledged Amounts Agencies have announced plans to spend these funds, but the money has not been delivered, so amounts and recipients could change. Obligated or Paid Amounts These funds either are very likely to go to the stated recipients or have already been paid out. $2FEMA.3 billion has been obligated;$1.9 billlion of that has been paid out. Infrastructure (includes state and city agencies with about $600 million for debris removal): $1.6 billion Miscellaneous (includes rental and mortagage assistance, reimbursements to other federal agencies, security and building reinforcement): $470 million Administrative costs: $250 million About half of these funds have been spent.: $225 million H.U.D.: $2.1 billion has been obligated; $690 million has been paid out. The Small BusinessAdministration made loans for $420 million to businesses in Lower Manhattan. With subsidies, guarantees, etc., the estimated cost of these loans to the government is about $180 million. Empire State Development (includes money for thousands of small and large businesses): $700 million L.M.D.C. (additional funds for Empire State Development programs): $350 million L.M.D.C. (repair utilities in Lower Manhattan): $780 million L.M.D.C. (includes housing assistance, job training): $300 million Tax-free Liberty Zone bonds have been approved by the city and state for $490 million. With the lost tax revenues, the estimated cost of these loans to the government is about $70 million. Odds and EndsVarious disaster-related federal aid programs not under the FEMA umbrella. Some money has been paid or is en route to a wide array of city and state agencies for purposes both immediate and longer range, while some money has not been sent. The total reaches about $1 billion. Justice Department programs (includes crisis counseling): $40 million Federal and other buildings (for relocating and enhancing federal buildings and agency offices in New York affected by the disaster, aid for public broadcasting): $100 million Labor Department programs (includes workers' compensation and emergency employment aid in New York): $240 million Health and Human Services (includes reimbursements to hospitals, health monitoring and counseling): $250 million Other mandatory funding (food stamps, Medicaid, children's health insurance and public safety issues): $360 million (Sources: FEMA; Empire State Development; Lower Manhattan Development Corporation; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Transportation; White House Office of Management and Budget; staff research for members of United States Congress)(pg.

HEADLINE: When Christmas Is a Wednesday, 2 Workweeks Can Evaporate 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
Are you an author looking for your agent? Pray he checks his e-mail. A homeowner midway through a refinancing who needs something from the mortgage broker? You may have to wait until 2003 -- and then a few days more. For a full two weeks this year and into next, New York City is a mess of unreturned telephone calls, automated e-mail responses, dark offices and legal briefs half-written. 
 With both Christmas and New Year's Day falling on Wednesdays, the week-or-so-long hiatus that normally takes place between the holidays has stretched into two weeks. Sure, not everyone technically has both weeks off, but look at it this way: the Tuesdays are bound to be unproductive, as Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are practically holidays themselves. Knowing that, how much are you going to accomplish on the Mondays? The Wednesdays are the official holidays, the Thursdays are for recovering from the holidays, and the Fridays are, well, Fridays. 
 All of which leads to a 14-day stretch during which many offices are closed, and those that remain open are filled with a mix of dazed workers frustrated that they cannot reach anyone, and chairs left empty by co-workers on vacation. The answering machines cheerily warn that messages will not be returned until Jan. 6, and the sense of an endless holiday is everywhere.
"There's two weeks of absolutely nothing getting done," said Seth Miller, 25, a computer consultant who noticed the phenomenon in the companies he works with, as well as among his own colleagues. 
"Monday was kind of slow," Mr. Miller said yesterday. Then there was Christmas Eve and Christmas. "Thursday and Friday, everybody just sat around talking about what they got for Christmas," he said. "I have a funny feeling that this week is going to be the exact same thing all over again." 
Those who found themselves unemployed Dec. 20, like Mr. Miller's girlfriend, Linnea Hartsuyker, are likely to continue to be unemployed until at least Jan. 6. 
"Everyone's like, 'After Christmas,' 'after New Year's,"' said Ms. Hartsuyker, 24, who gave up looking for work as a computer consultant, at least for the time being. "It's just that much longer a window." 
Christina Ruiz, who is looking for a job in the television or film industry, has had similarly bad luck. "The bigwigs aren't in the offices, they're at their ski lodges," she said. "Only the peons are working."
This was certainly not the first time both holidays fell on a Wednesday. This was also the case as 1996, 1991, 1985, 1974 and so on drew to an end. 
The silence was notable yesterday on the steps of City Hall, where not one single attention-seeker called a news conference. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration has hardly stopped. Almost all of the deputy mayors have been spotted at City Hall in recent days, and there has even been evidence of work being done.
On Friday, if anyonemissed the mayor's radio program, his aides stressed that it was because the host was on vacation.
For those left behind, even the dress code has hardly let up. The mayor's press secretary, Edward Skyler, came to work on Friday in khakis and a sweater to be met by a sea of senior staff members in suits. "They gave me a hard time for it," he said.
The publishing world usually shuts down between Christmas and New Year's, but not necessarily for this long. "I think everyone in publishing had a very tough year and needed a vacation," said Jane Gelfman, a partner in Gelfman Schneider Literary Agents, which closed after the office holiday lunch on Dec. 20 and will reopen next Monday. 
For freelance writers, the work ethic must be self-enforced. 
Take Sara Eckel, 36, who spent much of last week in Syracuse visiting her parents but dutifully returned home to Brooklyn on Thursday. She got back to work first thing Friday morning. Or tried to.
"Friday I'm trying to rouse myself to work, and trying to convince myself that it's Monday," said Ms. Eckel, who had to work yesterday evening to complete an assignment due today. "Your body knows that it's Friday." 
Even for those whose work lives are not disrupted by the bloated holiday season, there can be something unsettling about the idea of celebrating on a Wednesday, arguably the most glum weekday normally.
"It's disorienting, for sure," said Steve Zousmer, a freelance speechwriter from Scarsdale. "It just seems all wrong. Wednesday is not the right day for a holiday." 
In some school districts, two weeks with holidays stuck in the middle have translated into two full weeks of school vacation. 
Some parents suggest that 14 days may be a few too many. But at least that means that the back-to-school day may be less painful. 
"I think everybody will be happy to go back to school, believe it or not," said Susan Weiller, a preschool teacher from New Rochelle. "And we're only halfway through."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S. Plan for Trade Penalties for North Korea Worries South Korean Investors

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
If the Bush administration hopes to use trade sanctions to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear bomb program, it has not counted on the likes of Kim Yoon Kyu, an energetic South Korean capitalist who is proud of his photos with North Korea's leader. 
 Next month, Mr. Kim's bulldozers are to break ground on what is planned as the largest foreign investment in North Korea: a $9 billion, 19-square-mile industrial park and new town. When completed, in 2010, the development is to hold 3,000 factories, 100,000 housing units, 1,100 hotel rooms, a shopping center and two 18-hole golf courses. 
 All of this will be only 45 miles from Seoul at Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. After three years of negotiations and North Korea's passage last month of a law guaranteeing visa-free access and corporate tax incentives, Mr. Kim, president of the Hyundai Asan Corporation and a veteran of business with North Korea, does not want to let North Korea's nuclear weapons program slow his pace. 
"We will have very low-wage workers who will work hard," Mr. Kim said, warming to his pitch. Flipping through a glossy, multicolored brochure prepared for foreign investors, he continued: "We have good land. We have a railroad. We are very near Seoul. Our government will give the electric power at a very low rate."
This weekend, Bush administration officials started sketching out a policy of economic sanctions intended to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Even if the United Nations Security Council endorses the policy, it will be a hard sell in South Korea. At the same time, officials concede that without American investors and customers their economic ties with North Korea are not likely to work out.
In recent years, South Korea has become North Korea's largest provider of aid, and, after China, its second-largest trading partner. This year, inter-Korean trade should hit $600 million, about 50 percent higher than last year. In the last five years, about 36,000 South Koreans have visited Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and 500,000 have visited Mount Kumgang, a tourist enclave.
Since September, in response to capitalist overtures, North Korea has created three special economic zones: one in Sinuiju in the north to attract Chinese investment; one in Mount Kumgang to attract South Korean tourists; and the industrial park in Kaesong. Part of a wider experiment in freeing prices and adopting more realistic exchange rates, the zones mimic China's early, controlled openings to free markets and foreign investment.
On Dec. 19, South Korean voters endorsed their nation's economic engagement with North Korea by electing Roh Moo Hyun, a staunch advocate of continuing President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" of increasing aid to North Korea and expanding trade with it.
"In Kaesong and Sinuiju, I would like to see South Korean investors as well as foreign investors building factories and hiring North Korean workers," Yoo Jay Kun, the lead foreign policy adviser to President-elect Roh, said in an interview. "We have to have more frequent contacts between North and South. We have been isolated for so many years."
Ben Q. Limb, another adviser to Mr. Roh, said that under the Roh administration, "Kaesong will be accelerated."
"Both sides are saying that, irrespective of tensions building, work will proceed, will go ahead," he said.
But American and Japanese opposition could slow the project, by keeping out investors and shutting off two of South Korea's largest export markets, and there have been other criticisms.
In one less ebullient moment, Mr. Kim admitted: "Without United States government support, this will not work. Our target market is the United States -- we have to export."
Shin Ji Ho, an economist, wrote recently of Kaesong for the Korea Development Institute, a government agency. "Unless there are improvements in the problems concerning weapons of mass destruction with the U.S. and Japan," he wrote, "exporting to these two markets seems implausible." Mr. Shin also contended that North Korea's pricing of land and labor would cost companies planning to move there three times as much as to operate in China, which is now home to 8,300 South Korean-owned factories.
South Korea's economic pressures are causing it to look to North Korea, though. With a fast-growing economy now larger than Russia's, South Korea has driven its unemployment rate down to 3 percent while its wages have increased this year by an average of 7.3 percent. With a looming labor shortage, it is easing visa requirements for ethnic Korean workers from China and Russia.
But there is a widespread fear here of an invasion by North Korea's impoverished millions. "Instead of them coming down, we should go north," said Dr. Seong Y. Park, honorary chairman of Kumho, a chaebol, or business group.
With South Korea's per capita income at $8,900 and North Korea's at $706, many businessmen here dream of tapping into North Korea's labor pool.
"Korean businesses cannot compete with China, so Kaesong is a golden opportunity for them to use skilled North Korean workers," Mr. Limb said. "South Korean investors are ready. The time is right."
Mr. Kim said 780 South Korea companies had applied to set up shop in Kaesong -- to make textiles, clothing, shoes, toys and electronics parts.
By 2010, he said, the park could be earning $2 billion a year for North Korea, four times as much as it is believed to earn now on its largest export item -- missiles.
"They could make much more money by setting up dozens of factories than by selling those Grade B Scud missiles," said one Western diplomat here.
At the American Chamber of Commerce of Korea, though, the day when American companies will invest in what is formally called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is believed to be far away.
"American companies remain curious about North Korea, but as long as the D.P.R.K. remains committed to pursuing a nuclear weapons program, I can't imagine any U.S. firm seriously considering an investment there," said Tami Overby, the executive director.
So far, in fact, the showcase foreign projects in North Korea have languished. The first "special economic zone," set up a decade ago near Russia, foundered for lack of investors. The Sinujiu site got off to a bad start last October, when the Chinese police arrested the Chinese entrepreneur who had been picked by North Korea to head the zone, charging him with tax evasion. 
The Mount Kumgang tourist zone has lost millions of dollars and only keeps going because of Hyundai's bottomless patience and because South Korea's government started subsidizing the program.
Pitfalls have also marked North Korea's other large joint venture with the West, a multibillion-dollar project, largely financed by South Korea, to build two light-water nuclear reactors, designed to produce power, not fuel for bombs.
On the job, North Korean workers rankled at taking orders from South Koreans. Before work started, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, the construction managers, agreed to pay workers $110 to $220 a month, plus lodging and food. But in 2000, North Korea demanded nearly triple the money. The builders refused, North Korea withdrew nearly 100 workers and the builders imported 700 construction workers from Uzbekistan, who remain there today.
"I was in charge of KEDO, and I went to Uzbekistan to hire the labor," said Shim Jae Won, executive vice president of Hyundai Asan. "KEDO's problem was not an economic problem. It was a political problem."
In the most promising sign of inter-Korean cooperation, though, soldiers two weeks ago completed clearing land mines from two wide corridors, one on the east coast, the other on the west. Work is now under way on building crossborder road and rail links. Vocal business constituencies support those projects. Hyundai needs both of the road crossings for its two major North Korea projects.
This eastern crossing has been completed, customs and passport control offices have been constructed and Hyundai plans to start sending buses across the border next month. At the western crossing, Hyundai earthmovers are to cross next month, on their way to Kaesong.
Russia wants to see the railroad links restored, hoping to make the Trans-Siberian Railroad a major passageway for South Korean freight to Europe.
"The North's nuclear issue is a political matter, whereas the railway project is an economic one," Vladimir Sazonov, a Russian deputy railway minister, told reporters here two weeks ago. "The railway cooperation program has the potential to draw North Korea into the international community. Halting such projects could drive the North further into isolation."
Smaller ventures are also chipping away at North Korea's isolation.
Starting this spring, credit cards issued in South Korea will be accepted at 100 hotels and shops across North Korea through a credit card clearing company established by Hoonnet, a South Korean company. Earlier this year, Kim Beom Hoon, president of the company, set up North Korea's first lottery and first Internet cafe.
"Inter-Korean ventures and exchanges are proceeding ahead; they are not affected seriously by the crisis," Kim Jung Ro, a spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, said Friday. "Roh Moo Hyun made it very clear during the campaign that he would carry on the sunshine policy, that he would continue to promote the idea of Kaesong, of integration of the railroads."

HEADLINE: The (Same) Old Neighborhood; 
A Brooklyn Enclave Happily Avoids Assimilation

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
One unchanging truth about New York City's neighborhoods is that they constantly change. Yet there are city neighborhoods that seem to defy that rule, and one of them is Gerritsen Beach in Brooklyn.
 Tucked between Sheepshead Bay and Marine Park, Gerritsen Beach is a seaside colony of more than 2,300 closely packed bungalows and brick homes, a village where sea gulls wheel across somber skies and a lone cormorant may perch for hours on a rotted piling. Its inhabitants include the families of firefighters, police officers, garbage collectors, subway conductors, "people who make everything work," says one resident, Michael Taylor Jr. And most are of Irish, German, Scandinavian or Italian stock. 
 That profile was pretty much true 20 years ago and 40 years ago. Even 80 years ago, when the neighborhood was first settled, it was not all that different from what it is today. 
Most New Yorkers have never heard of Gerritsen Beach, and that is just fine with its residents, who are insular to the bone. Lorraine DeVoy, the neighborhood's unofficial historian, estimates that one-third of the residents have relatives living in the neighborhood. She accounts for a big share. Her grandparents moved to "the beach" in the 1920's and now three of her sons live there with her four grandchildren.
As a result of such ties, people look out for each other, dispelling the urban anonymity that some New Yorkers may find liberating but that most in Gerritsen Beach find chilling.
"What I hated growing up here, I love about it today: everybody knows everybody," said Joe Benecke, a 40-year-old subway conductor who represents the third generation of his family in the beach. He has a brother, aunt, uncle, two nieces, a nephew and a dozen cousins with homes there.
Growing up, Mr. Benecke bridled at having neighbors who told his parents when he cut school. But now, as a father of three boys and two girls, he appreciates such watchfulness.
"If my son is doing something wrong, I know about it before he has a chance to come home and give me his side of the story," said Mr. Benecke, a former marine, who serves as a captain in Gerritsen Beach's 28-member volunteer fire department, Brooklyn's only such corps.
In sociological parlance, Gerritsen Beach is an enclave, and in 21st-century New York, tossed about by three decades of robust immigration, the number of middle-class enclaves is shrinking. In Queens, Howard Beach, St. Albans, Broad Channel, Breezy Point and Middle Village (which is virtually surrounded by cemeteries) still qualify. So do City Island and Woodlawn in the Bronx, and Mill Basin and Bergen Beach in Brooklyn.
Urban experts have a number of explanations for why such neighborhoods resist change, and almost all of them apply to Gerritsen Beach. Enclaves tend to be either hard to reach or isolated, and Gerritsen Beach is both. There is practically only one way in -- through the main thoroughfare, Gerritsen Avenue. Residents need a car to get to Manhattan, or the willingness to take first a bus, then a subway -- a round trip that can stretch to three hours. As a result, it is not particularly attractive to immigrants seeking to buy their first hard-won homes.
Enclaves like Gerritsen Beach display strong bonds among the generations or strong ties forged by similar occupations or religious practices, said Sharon Zukin, Broeklundian professor of sociology at Brooklyn College. Hasidic Williamsburg is considered a religious enclave. Enclaves can be economic, like the Upper East Side, too expensive for most people to afford, or they can be too run-down to attract all but the poor. But generally, enclaves are places where the residents really want to live.
Gerritsen Beach's nearly 7,000 residents like the canal and creek, where they can dock their cruisers and fishing boats alongside their homes. They like the alphabetized narrow side streets that are safe for children to caper in and the two local schools, Public School 277 and Resurrection School, where students commonly have the same teachers their parents did. They like having a Kiddie Beach for $285 a season, a Little League, and homespun parades several times a year. They like a neighborhood where many men consider it a moral obligation to serve in the military.
Gerritsen Beach residents deny that they willfully exclude people, and the city's Human Rights Commission has no record of any discrimination cases against Gerritsen Beach homeowners or brokers, according to Betsy Herzog, its spokeswoman. The 2000 census counted 293 Hispanics, 151 Asians and 27 blacks, numbers larger than in the 1990 census. Still, the residents suggest that not everyone would feel welcome in so clannish a neighborhood.
While Americans typically move far from their roots, usually after they attend college or marry, the people of Gerritsen Beach stay close or return.
"You can live in an area and that's all it is, but Gerritsen Beach is a true neighborhood," said Doreen Greenwood Garson, a local real estate broker who grew up in Gerritsen Beach and has two grown sons and a daughter who live there. "If you go away, people will take care of your dog and water your plants if you give them a key."
Houses don't often come on the market and those that do are usually snapped up by local families eager to see their relatives settled nearby. The small lots, typically 45 feet by 50 feet, and their clapboard wood-frame houses are still affordable for people whose median household income is $52,582. The average value of a house, according to the 2000 census, was $189,320. 
Gerritsen Beach has its drawbacks, often the flip side of its virtues. People acknowledge they are wary of outsiders.
"Any place that small and close-knit you're going to have a distrust of outsiders," Mrs. DeVoy said. "We like our community to stay the way it is. Doesn't everybody?"
The Rev. Francis J. Fahy, pastor of Resurrection Roman Catholic Church, grew up in Gerritsen Beach and, after assignments at parishes in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Long Island City and Ridgewood, came full circle 10 years ago to take the place of the priest who had trained him as an altar boy. He also senses an inbred suspiciousness toward strangers.
"Anything that unbalances the harmony, people are concerned about that," he said.
Yet Gerritsen Beach is changing, however imperceptibly. Mrs. DeVoy notes that starting in the 1970's, more of the beach's offspring began attending college -- 15.5 percent of residents 25 or older have at least a B.A. degree -- and many moved out, never looking back. Rising home values are causing more residents to put their homes on the market.
"You used to go to church and you knew everybody," said Mrs. DeVoy, who serves as a dispatcher for the fire volunteers, adding, "Now you don't."
Close ties have also meant a deep communal chauvinism, a spirit kindled by the rebellious early homeowners who fought with the original real estate developer to get the same water, gas and electric service that their neighbors in other parts of Brooklyn had.
More recently, residents wanted to create a memorial on the park baseball field to Lawrence Veling, one of two firefighters who lived in Gerritsen Beach who were killed in the World Trade Center collapse. They found themselves mired in city red tape, so they brought in a cement truck and bulldozer and built it themselves.
Some people who grow up there cannot wait to leave, often complaining of a narrowness of outlook. George R. Broadhead, who left Gerritsen Beach after serving as a marine in the Korean War, where he was awarded a Silver Star, remembered the beach as the kind of neighborhood that "if you were to tell the kids, 'I went to a museum,' they'd say, 'What are you, a sissy?' " He himself would sneak away to readings by E.E. Cummings at the 92nd Street Y.
Mr. Broadhead said that as an ambitious young man, he wanted out of Gerritsen Beach and spent much of his adult life as an advertising executive in Greenwich, Conn.; Nashville; and Beverly Hills, while pursuing his first love: collecting first editions. But after his mother died two years ago, he moved back into her house in Gerritsen Beach and was surprised to find less provincialism.
He was pleased to see a black veteran, a former Marine sergeant, in the local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall and a Chinese-American neighbor next door on Knapp Street. He liked what he called "creeping diversity." But he was also pleasantly surprised by how much he liked, now that he was older, being in a neighborhood where people knew him in their marrow.
"From Beverly Hills, where I used to eat at Spago, the Grill and Musso and Frank's," he said, "I walked into a place where people called you Georgie."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: Gazing Into 2003: Economy Intrudes on Dreams of New Services -- 3G; 
In Europe, a Promise Of Mobile Multimedia

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
The coming year, cellphone evangelists say, will be the year of 3G in Europe. Of course, that's what they said about 2002.
 3G, or third-generation cellular service, which uses high-capacity networks to deliver multimedia services in addition to phone calls, has become the perennial tease of telecommunications -- its arrival eagerly awaited and endlessly predicted, yet seemingly always further in the future. 
 Now, though, the Hong Kong company Hutchison Whampoa has become the first cellular operator to test 3G services on a commercial scale in Europe. The company is offering an array of features, including locator services and video calls, under the brand name (or numeral) 3, in Britain.
"By the end of 2003, the penny will have dropped," said John Tysoe, an analyst at West LB Panmure in London, who has watched all the delays but remains an unabashed enthusiast about the concept.
Third-generation cellular service started on the wrong foot two years ago when Hutchison, and virtually every European telecommunications provider, engaged in a frenzied bidding war for spectrum licenses.
The thinking was that 3G, with its vastly expanded capacity, would be almost as big a revolution as the mobile phone itself. Companies could beam stock quotes, video games, Internet data and even images of the person on the other end of the line to a standard-size cellphone.
The would-be operators spent $190 billion on licenses, stocking government treasuries from Berlin to Madrid. Then the bottom dropped out of the worldwide telecommunications market.
As buyer's remorse set in, the license holders scaled back their plans. Some, like KPN of the Netherlands, wrote down the value of their 3G ventures. Others, like Telefonica of Spain, walked away from licenses in Germany and elsewhere.
Adding to the angst, the Japanese mobile provider NTT DoCoMo signed up far fewer customers for its 3G service, the world's first, than it had hoped. Analysts said DoCoMo's service suffered from a patchy network.
In the United States, where the development of 3G was stunted by the emergence of competing technological standards, the carriers have shown more interest in intermediate technologies and less ambitious services, like the swapping of digital photos over mobile phones. They have also been reluctant to roll out third-generation networks because of the growing popularity of Wi-Fi, a rival technology that gives users relatively inexpensive high-speed wireless Internet access from portable computers.
In Europe, meanwhile, rivals are scrutinizing Hutchison's tentative steps into the market. The rollout of its service has already been pushed back twice, and a spokesman no longer offers a date by which 3 will be in business, though it is likely to be in the first half.
"This is virgin territory so there's no road map for what we're doing," said Hutchinson's spokesman in London, Edward Brewster.
Mr. Brewster steers the curious to a Web site (www.hutchison3g.com), where the company lays out its offerings. Some, like video calls, are intriguing, while others, like a stock-quote service, are familiar to anyone who has ever heard media executives extol the marvels of interactive technology.
If Hutchison aspires to be anything, it is a media company that peddles phones instead of cable subscriptions. "These are not telephones," Mr. Brewster said. "They are multimedia communications devices." MARK LANDLER

Making a Statement In Tunes and Pictures

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
Pity the poor cellphone. No longer is it enough that people can call their loved ones from 20,000 feet, conduct a business conference call while riding in a cab or call for help from the side of a mountain 
 Now they want pictures, too. And games. And music. 
 And 2003 will most likely be the year they get a great deal of it. Cellular phone carriers are moving quickly to create a range of new consumer services. 
"A substantial number of consumers want to make a personal statement with their phone," said Seamus McAteer, principal analyst at the Zelos Group, a market analysis firm in San Francisco. 
New phones from Nokia and others allow consumers to download games and melodious ring tones, browse the Web and send and receive e-mail. Better screen technology, coupled with better file compression, will permit cellphone users to send and receive photographs. 
It may be that this more creative use of cellular phones is being driven by the greater number of young customers, analysts say. By the end of next year, Mr. McAteer predicts, roughly half of all American cellphone customers, which today number about 140 million, will be 14 to 20 years old. 
Short message service, which allows cellphone customers to send and receive short text messages, is already a mainstay of cellular communications in Europe and Asia, though its adoption in this country has been far slower. Telecommunications analysts say that is about to change. By this time next year, cellphone users in the United States will be sending a million text messages every month, up from about 300,000 a month today. 
Similarly, the market for downloadable games is just beginning to take off. And customers will spend as much as $200 million next year just in downloading new ring tones -- including show tunes and snippets from popular music -- to replace those that come with every phone, Mr. McAteer said. 
Last year, a few cellular phone companies began selling phones that could display and send postage-stamp-size digital photos, using a tiny camera that customers buy separately. Next year, phone companies will start releasing phones with digital cameras built in, with Sanyo among the first. The quality will not match that of full-size digital cameras anytime soon, but the idea is simply to enhance the phone conversation, not create a scrapbook.
"It won't displace the digital camera," Mr. McAteer said. "But it will add a new dimension to communications." 
And that, it appears, is what consumers want. LAURIE J. FLYNN

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 30 about new services being offered by cellphone companies misstated a prediction by Seamus McAteer, principal market analyst at the Zelos Group in San Francisco, about the concentration of young cellphone users in the United States by the end of 2003. He estimates that half of 14- to 20-year-olds will have cellphones, not that half of all cellphone customers will be 14 to 20.
The article also misstated a growth estimate for the number of short text messages sent by cellphone users in the United States. By early next year, it will be a billion messages a month, up from 300 million -- not a million, up from 300,000.

Mendoza Is Signed By Red Sox

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If the Boston Red Sox cannot compete with the Yankees for the services of expensive players, they can, they demonstrated last night, sign the Yankees' castoffs.
 The Red Sox, who suffered a major disappointment last week when the Yankees signed Jose Contreras, the heralded Cuban pitcher, reached agreement on a two-year contract with Ramiro Mendoza, the relief pitcher the Yankees chose not to re-sign when he became a free agent last month. 
 The Yankees publicly attributed their decision to let Mendoza walk to their payroll problems. At the time, they said they had to reduce their payroll, and Mendoza, a 30-year-old right-hander, and another veteran reliever, Mike Stanton, were two of the victims of that economic stance. Since then, the Yankees have committed $53 million to Contreras and Hideki Matsui, the Japanese outfielder. 
But a person who was told about the Yankees' thinking on Mendoza said they were concerned about his work habits and conditioning. He was on the disabled list each of the past three seasons.
The Red Sox, seeking to fortify their relief corps, made Mendoza the third reliever they have added this off-season. They previously signed Mike Timlin and Chad Fox. But they still lack a closer, having let Ugueth Urbina leave as a free agent after he gained 40 saves for them last season.
"I think he is the last piece of the puzzle for the bullpen," General Manager Theo Epstein said, referring to Mendoza, in Boston. "I think in terms of acquisitions, we are done until spring training."
The Red Sox, however, continue to talk to the Montreal Expos about a starting pitcher, Bartolo Colon.
Should the Red Sox decide to close by committee, Mendoza could be part of that plan. He had 10 saves in his last two seasons with the Yankees. Last season Mendoza relieved in a career-high 62 games and pitched 91 2/3 innings, second most among American League relievers. 
It was also the first time in his seven seasons with the Yankees that he did not start any games. Mendoza joined the Yankees in 1996 as a starter but the next season began dividing his time between starting and relieving, gradually taking on more of the latter assignment.
Mendoza did not pitch effectively in the Yankees' playoff series against Anaheim last October. He pitched an inning and a third in the Yankees' 8-5 Game 1 victory and gave up a home run to Troy Glaus. In Game 4 he relieved David Wells in the fifth inning and faced only two batters, giving up a run-scoring single to Shawn Wooten and a two-run double to Bengie Molina for the final runs of an eight-run explosion that propelled the Angels to a 9-5 victory.
Mendoza, a Panamanian, completed his tenure with the Yankees with a 54-34 record, 16 saves and a 4.08 earned run average in 57 starts and 220 relief appearances.

HEADLINE: For the Hungry, a Meager Helping 

 BODY:
With unemployment in New York City at its highest level in more than four years and demand at food pantries and soup kitchens up 45 percent from two years ago, it could reasonably be expected that the number of food stamp recipients would also have jumped last month. And it did -- backward. Some 4,000 eligible recipients were removed from lists because of a bookkeeping backlog, according to the Human Resources Administration, which manages the food-assistance program. In addition, almost 7,000 other recipients fell off the program, too, at a time when enrollment should be growing. Officials said they could not explain what happened. 
 The blunder last month recalls the Giuliani administration's mishandling of food stamps, which moved federal officials to chastise the city for failing to help eligible applicants get food assistance. In Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's zeal for welfare reform, food stamps equaled dependency and big government entitlement that should be eliminated. In fact, food stamps are not welfare, not even charity, but a nutrition program that helps the poor buy food. The program is the best tool the government has against hunger. And while many recipients are on welfare, more than half work but earn too little to afford groceries for their families. Food stamps can be the boost that keeps people on the road to independence. 
 The Giuliani approach contributed to a 42 percent drop -- more than half a million people -- in the distribution of food stamps. The diminished numbers greatly outpaced the drop in poverty during that time, and the city's miscalculation helped to fuel a crisis in which one million people, many working poor, now depend on soup kitchens and food pantries for their meals. While Mayor Michael Bloomberg until last month could say that under his watch, the number of food stamp recipients was slowly on the rise, there is still much lost ground to be regained and many families who need immediate help rather than more missteps from the city. While some 800,000 New Yorkers get food stamps, an equal number more are eligible but not getting help, according to advocates for the hungry. That means the city lags behind the state and the rest of the country in food stamp distribution, and it is losing nearly $1 billion in federal benefits.
The human resources agency says it is reaching out to find those who might be eligible and that it plans to streamline its 16-page application. But its efforts have been slow and ineffective, and too little to turn around a system long wired to discourage any takers. Further, many of the same key people who carried out Mr. Giuliani's food stamp policy are now on the job for Mayor Bloomberg, and the ambivalence shows.
Pressed by Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn at a Dec. 16 City Council hearing, Verna Eggleston, the human resources commissioner appointed by Mr. Bloomberg, and her deputy Seth Diamond -- a Giuliani holdover -- missed the point about the value of food stamps to the city. They were concerned about what it would cost their agency to enroll more recipients. While the city's fiscal situation is dire, the stamps are 100 percent federally financed and Washington pays half the city's administrative costs. By any formula, the returns, socially and economically, are greater than expenditures. That realization helps to explain the healthy endorsement the federal government gives food assistance, promoting it with the slogan "Food Stamps Make America Stronger." New York needs to get with the program.

Health Care Economy Gives Northeast a Boost
With little of the fame that can be claimed by Silicon Valley, the Northeast's urban corridor has quietly built its own economic powerhouse by becoming the nation's health care epicenter, a 15-year transformation that has provided the region with an important economic cushion in the recent downturn. A1

Bush Rivals in the Senate
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina are about to become junior members of the Senate. They will be the best known, and probably most closely watched, members of the new class, in no small part because of their shared distinction of having once taken on the president. A1

The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert to law enforcement agencies across the nation to help find five Middle Eastern men who are believed to have recently entered the country illegally. A9

Cloning Claim Scrutinized
The Food and Drug Administration is trying to reconstruct the chain of events that led to a religious sect's claim last week to have created the first human clone. If part of the process took place in the United States, the agency would have jurisdiction over what it would probably consider an unauthorized experiment. A10

Confusion and Anger Over Unused 9/11 Money
Many victims and others are confused and angry about why less than a quarter of the federal government's promise of $21.4 billion in financial assistance has been realized, why hundreds of millions of dollars that are in New York have gone unclaimed, and why firm decisions have yet to be made on how additional billions of dollars will be spent. A1

Upstate Homicide Rate on Rise
Killings have been increasing in many cities in upstate New York, while New York City continues to bask in a plummeting homicide rate. Violence -- especially shootings -- has been rising in Rochester, a prosperous city known more as a home to engineers than as a haunt of criminals. B1

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The Northeast; 
Growing Health Care Economy Gives Northeast a Needed Boost

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER, N.J. 

 BODY:
When Fred Hassan wanted to prove that Pharmacia could become a globally powerful drug company five years ago, he moved it out of its London headquarters to an office park here in the state he considered "the medicine chest to the world."
 That shift of 380 of his employees into a gray one-story building that AT&T had abandoned to cut costs proved to be just the beginning. 
 By 2000, Pharmacia had outgrown the space, and it took over a nearby group of buildings that was once occupied by an investment company. This summer, Mr. Hassan, Pharmacia's chief executive, also bought a campus in Basking Ridge that had been AT&T's headquarters. Not far away, other drug companies have moved into buildings once filled with employees of Exxon and I.B.M. 
The expansion is part of a 15-year regional transformation that has provided the Northeast corridor with an important economic cushion during the recent downturn.
With little of the fame that can be claimed by Silicon Valley, the Northeast's urban corridor has quietly built its own economic powerhouse by becoming the nation's health care epicenter. Roughly following the line of Amtrak's Metroliner and stretching from Boston to Bethesda, Md., this medical megalopolis encompasses a vast array of facilities.
It is anchored by urban complexes serving as homes for many of the nation's most influential teaching hospitals. It includes the big suburban campuses of most of the world's major drug companies. It also stretches to clusters of research outfits in the Boston area and around the National Institutes of Health outside Washington.
"This is the center of the nation's health care economy," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. "Just as chips do it for the Bay Area and Boeing does it for Seattle, health care drives the economy in this corridor."
The growth has come as other traditional engines of the region have faltered. Even as health care companies in the Northeast's medical megalopolis have added 50,000 jobs, since 2000 all other industries combined have lost 220,000, ending a decadelong boom that had left many taking prosperity for granted. 
Now, Wall Street has retrenched deeply, bringing New York City its worst budget woes in decades and wounding the mutual fund companies in Boston. The fallout from Sept. 11 has hurt tourism, particularly in New York and Washington.
The burst Internet bubble has had its effect too, echoing among publishing companies throughout the corridor that had added workers when advertising was plentiful. And major telecommunications companies like AT&T and Lucent Technologies have cut thousands of jobs, many in the New Jersey suburbs. 
"The telecom industry and the financial industry have crashed," said Henry A. McKinnell, the chief executive of Pfizer, the drug company based in New York that recently bought Pharmacia and now owns AT&T's old headquarters. "We're still growing."
Partly as a result, almost one out of every 10 jobs in the Northeast corridor today is in health care, a higher portion than in any other region of the country. That is up from one out of 14 in 1987, according to Economy.com. In New York City, 4 of the 10 largest private employers are medical institutions. In Philadelphia, it is 7 out of 10.

An Economic Engine
Health care's gains have helped keep unemployment in the region lower than in the rest of the country. By contrast, during the recession of a decade ago, the Northeast suffered far more than most other areas and took much longer to recover.
The rise of this regional health care complex has also solved part of the Northeast's long quest for an economic engine to replace its disappearing manufacturing sector. Moreover, like information technology -- an industry the region has never fully succeeded in attracting -- health care, on average, pays relatively generous salaries.
In fact, some people who once worked in the region's technology sector have now found a refuge in health care.
Michael J. Mercurio, 32, who lives in Hanover, Mass., was one of many young workers who left jobs in the last five years for a dot-com. But by the end of 2000, when he realized that the Web design company where he worked, Event Zero, would probably collapse, he had scrambled back to his old employer -- the billing department of Massachusetts General Hospital.
"I feel extremely fortunate," said Mr. Mercurio, whose wife, now attending business school at Babson College, also worked at Event Zero. "I have numerous friends who were laid off. Some of them are still looking a year and a half out."
But not everyone can make such a transition, and the health care boom is by no means an economic cure-all. Many jobs in hospitals and home health services still pay poorly, and health care's rigorous educational standards often make upward mobility difficult.
Drug companies have increased their sales and employment partly through a wave of advertising that many scientists say can be medically dubious. And spending on health care rarely makes an economy as productive as manufacturing or financial services.
Health care's powerful presence in the Northeast springs from a series of developments, including the growth of drug companies, which have long been located here.
The older age of the population has also created a large need for doctors and home health care workers. Research hospitals are increasingly attracting patients from other parts of the country and from overseas who are eager to get the best treatment money can buy.
Whatever the reasons, economists say the medical industry has now reached a critical mass that makes its regional importance likely to grow even further. Pharmaceutical workers know they can settle in New Jersey and switch jobs in later years without moving. Two-income families in which both spouses have medical careers can live in, say, Columbia, Md., with one commuting to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore while the other works at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.
Employers have eagerly chased these workers, with Boston becoming a leading biotechnology center even as Celera Genomics and other human-genome research companies have opened in suburban Maryland. "This is where the pool of talent is,' said Patricia M. Danzon, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Foreign drug makers have continued to move to the corridor, too. In May, Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, announced that it would build a research center in Cambridge, Mass., that would be led by a Harvard Medical School professor and eventually employ 900 people.
In September, Altana, a German drug maker, opened its marketing headquarters in an old Exxon building in Florham Park, N.J. It chose New Jersey over California partly because of the shorter flight times from Europe and the lesser time difference. The company also wanted to be near the biggest pool of pharmaceutical workers, said George W. Cole, the president of the division.

East Versus West
The origins of the health care corridor stretch to the late 19th century, when the nation's largest universities -- then all in the Northeast -- began to build teaching hospitals. 
The modern pharmaceutical industry was born around the same time. New Jersey's proximity to New York and Philadelphia and its access to natural resources helped attract early drug companies like Johnson & Johnson and chemical companies that expanded into drug making.
By the late 20th century, however, newer industries, concentrated on the West Coast, were growing more quickly. Despite repeated attempts by politicians and executives, the Northeast's technology clusters, including Silicon Alley in New York and Route 128 around Boston, never approached the weight of Silicon Valley or Seattle's software industry.
As a result, the Northeast region, while certainly basking in the national economic boom of the late 1990's, lost ground. From 1995 to 2000 the number of jobs in the already crowded metropolitan area that encompasses Silicon Valley grew more than 4 percent a year, according to Economy.com. In the Northeast corridor, the rate was just 2 percent.
Since 2000, however, the crash of technology spending has caused Silicon Valley's employment to fall 3 percent a year, while the drop has been only 0.5 percent from Boston to Bethesda. If anything, the failure of efforts to make the Northeast's economy look more like that of the San Francisco area now looks fortunate.
Economists call health care an unusually good job creator because the industry tends to grow even in recessions and employs people at many wage and educational levels. In the Northeast corridor, health care pays $43,200 a year on average, well above the national average for all jobs of $37,000, Mr. Zandi of Economy.com said. Health care jobs pay a little less than the average job in the Northeast only because the concentration of exceptionally lucrative Wall Street jobs skews the overall numbers. 
The biggest downside in health care, however, may be the difficulty in moving from one wage level to another. Assembly-line workers can become foremen; copywriters at advertising agencies can rise to the executive suite. Getting a significant raise in medical care often requires getting a new degree. Many workers struggle to escape the entry level.
"As a home-care worker, you can't go any higher," said Mary Toni, a Bronx resident in her 50's who makes $6.55 an hour taking care of elderly patients in their homes, up from the $6.25 she made when she began in 1996. "For any upgrade, you have to go back to school."
Ms. Toni has already taken one computer class and plans to receive more training. But finding the time is not easy. "The bills are coming in," she said.

Growth and Problems
With the aging baby boom generation on the cusp of its most medically dependent years, health care appears likely to continue growing more quickly than the rest of the economy. That should only help the Northeast.
But the coming surge in the elderly population also leaves the medical megalopolis prey to shifts in how the United States pays for its health care needs. Health costs have recently risen rapidly, making employers less willing to pay insurance premiums and contributing to an increase in the number of people without insurance.
"We are naturally vulnerable to the government's willingness to pay for health care," said Robert D. Martin, chief executive of the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
Faced with budget deficits and increasing medical costs, many states have stepped up efforts to reduce their spending on drug prescriptions and hospital stays.
Delaware, for example, has joined a consortium of states that buys drugs in bulk, and it has consolidated some of its insurance policies, favoring less expensive ones. "It is the fastest-growing part of our budget, no question about that," Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, a Democrat, said in an interview. "We have to look at how we can control the costs and still provide the service."
Even the most valiant efforts to control costs, however, cannot hold back the demographic pressures to spend more on health research and services. Given the American preference for free markets, any limits on drug prices are also likely to be less restrictive than those in Europe, which helped send the pharmaceutical industry fleeing to the United States.
"The R&D has just shifted to the U.S.," said Tom McKillop, a native of Scotland who is the chief executive of AstraZeneca, which is based in London and employs about 4,000 people in Wilmington, Del. "America has been big winners in macroeconomic terms." 
While the jump in drug spending has no doubt been good for the Northeast's economy, it has sometimes come at the expense of the welfare of the nation as a whole. Many scientists maintain that drug makers have at times exaggerated the benefit of their costly new products, steering people away from less expensive but equally effective medications.
Health care spending also does not generally make other parts of an economy more efficient, in contrast to technology investments that allow a society to produce more goods and services with the same effort.
But medical spending can contribute to society in ways that many people consider more valuable than money: adding years of healthy life. The newly intense search for longevity -- caused by the aging of society, an increase in disposable income and a burst of new treatments, particularly for heart disease -- is the prime reason the region's medical megalopolis should continue to thrive.
Of the five cities whose institutions receive the most research money from the National Institutes of Health, only No. 3 San Diego is not along the Metroliner medical corridor. The other four, in order, are Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. 
Patients follow this money, looking for advanced treatment. For example, 18 percent of the patients at Johns Hopkins now come from outside Maryland, up from 13 percent a decade ago. 
Consider Andrew J. Lee, whose mother in South Korea recently learned that she had thyroid cancer. Her doctors there told her that surgery was the best treatment, but the family wanted to know that the world's top doctors agreed with the diagnosis. So Mr. Lee, a young lawyer who lives in Northern Virginia, began to help his parents plan a trip to the United States.
Looking at the cancer centers ranked highest by U.S. News and World Report, he focused on Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York and on Johns Hopkins, he said, because they "were a distance that we could travel to in a day."
Doctors at the hospitals, which both have special offices to work with foreign patients, agreed that Mr. Lee's mother should have the surgery. She flew home, where she was insured, to have the operation.
Mr. Lee said his family had no regrets about spending $6,000 on travel and doctors' consultations to be assured that they were making the right decision.
"We were able to get total confirmation," he said.

Resolutions For New Year, And New York

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE new year. The traditional time for optimism and hope, for promising to be better and to do better. 
 Therefore, some devoutly-to-be-wished-for resolutions for New York's most prominent. Unthinkable and impractical, but also maybe -- just maybe -- possible. 

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
To invest his vaunted independence (and apparent tolerance for public disapproval) in three elusive but essential reforms: 1) Move ahead on tolling all the toll-free bridges and borrow against the income to help close the budget gap; 2) Use large fines and towing to really eliminate double-parking in Midtown; 3) Create boot-camp boarding schools for youngsters found guilty of disrupting instruction with acts of violence.
James L. Dolan, chairman of Madison Square Garden and president of Cablevision
To devote himself to rescuing the Knicks instead of denying the Yankees to his customers.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation
To level with the public by conceding that there is little chance that the destroyed trade center site will soon be rebuilt; and that those fanciful models of new towers are not really designs to be judged, but mere props to illustrate pending land-use decisions ranging from the scope of a memorial to whether once-blocked streets should run through the site.
Betsy Gotbaum, public advocate
To close down her office and support its permanent abolition if the mayor agrees to give her a real job with a real mission and a decently financed staff.

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
To devote as much energy to sponsoring and enacting one signature piece of legislation -- one that might even risk offending a voter or two -- as to raising campaign money.
Derek Jeter, Yankee slugger
To listen to his boss and get a few good nights of sleep.
Joel I. Klein, the schools chancellor
To finally tell his boss that the spectacular Tweed Courthouse is no place for the Department of Education.
Lorin Maazel, new music director of the New York Philharmonic
To pay a little more attention to the "New York" part of the Philharmonic's name.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney
To announce, with his reputation intact as dean of prosecutors, that he will retire at the end of his current term in three years, paving the way for an orderly transition from the Morgenthau era -- which began in 1975, when he was 55 years old -- to the next generation. 
Gov. George E. Pataki
To hereafter err on the side of candor and never again hide hard financial realities from the public, or defer tax and fare increases to lather his own way to re-election.
Senator Charles E. Schumer
To find and enroll in -- or create -- a 12-step program for politicians who cannot stop themselves from holding Sunday news conferences about little of substance.

The Rev. Al Sharpton
To forget about running for president and instead build a nationwide campaign based on his recent observation that black youngsters must shed the idea that self-improvement and success are only "white" virtues.
Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease to the trade center property 
To admit that he will not be replacing the twin towers in any foreseeable future and instead will negotiate a deal that would leave him a profit, pay off his partners and lenders and leave insurance proceeds for building in another time.
Jack Welch, retired chief executive of General Electric, author of the best-selling "Jack: Straight From the Gut," and party to an embarrassing divorce case arising from his affair with Suzy Wetlaufer that revealed his extravagant corporate perks 
To write a sequel, "Jack and Suzy: Foiled by the Gut" -- how to mismanage a marriage, lose nearly a lifetime's worth of perks and make your estranged wife one of the year's most welcome whistle-blowers.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: Gazing Into 2003: Economy Intrudes on Dreams of New Services -- Spending; 
A Mature Industry Has Room for Growth

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Over the years, worldly philosophers ranging from Willie Sutton to Deep Throat have offered much the same advice: Follow the money. So where is the money likely to be spent in technology in 2003?
 First, most industry executives and analysts expect the coming year to be much like 2002, with spending levels flat to slightly higher and customer attitudes and concerns little changed. 
 The research group IDC predicts that worldwide spending on information technology -- computer hardware, software and services -- will rise about 5 percent in 2003, to $925 billion, after two years of decline.
Yet the slump has brought a lasting shift in the thinking of corporate customers. Most companies no longer see Internet-era computing as an enemy or a savior, but mainly as a tool that can cut costs, streamline operations and enhance communications with employees, partners and suppliers. That, it seems, represents a return to the traditional view of information technology.
"Customers haven't given up faith in the core technology," said Samuel J. Palmisano, chief executive of I.B.M., above.
This more pragmatic perspective extends to the industry's view of itself as not so special after all. "We're a mature industry with pockets of high growth," observed John Gantz, director of research at IDC.
One sign of maturity is that the low-cost technology from increasingly powerful personal computers is moving into corporate data centers. That means data-serving computers using Intel-compatible processors and running Microsoft Windows or Linux software. "We'll see crushing, crushing server price pressure," said Albert Lill, a research director at Gartner.
The PC insurgents are led by Dell, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. The company most exposed is Sun Microsystems, whose lifeblood is big servers that run its version of the Unix operating system, Solaris. (Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. also sell Unix machines but are far more diversified.)
Growth areas? China, most notably. Its growth appears poised to continue, with IDC expecting information technology spending in China to rise 20 percent in 2003. The United States should have a slight recovery, while Europe could be a weak spot.
By product group, analysts say one prime candidate for growth in 2003 is "applications integration." The ungainly term means getting a company's various databases and large software applications to talk to one other. Applications integration involves mostly software and services. I.B.M., BEA, Oracle, Sun, Microsoft and others have offerings.
Personal computer sales look stagnant, but don't tell Microsoft that personal computing is a mature business. David Vaskevitch, a senior vice president and an architect of the company's strategy, says the consumer market is probably "where the next revolution is." The spread of digital photography and new forms of interpersonal communication like instant messaging (I.M.) will stimulate demand for PC hardware and software, he says.
Just look at young people, Mr. Vaskevitch notes, and how they consume technology. "You try to take I.M. away from a teenager today, and you'd better be wearing Kevlar."
The desire for instant messaging, it seems, is already broadening. Corporate users will double in 2003, to 60 million worldwide, IDC projects. STEVE LOHR

A Call for Partnership, A Hint of Regulation

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
When Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation and Fox Entertainment, addressed the assembled technology elite at the Comdex trade show in November, his message was one of solidarity against digital copyright infringers. "We have nothing more urgently in common than the escalating theft of our products," he declared.
 But a subtext of the speech foreshadowed what may be a crucial showdown between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. If technology executives do not voluntarily heed Hollywood's call to partnership, a strong entertainment lobby is pushing the federal government to require them to do so. 
 As television and movies increasingly take digital form, Hollywood is worried that the availability of unauthorized, perfect copies online will significantly damage its bottom line. Companies like Fox and Disney want devices like DVD players and personal computers to be redesigned so consumers cannot use them to redistribute copyrighted material over the Internet. 
The first arena for 2003's copyright tug-of-war is likely to be the Federal Communications Commission, which is weighing a plan to require manufacturers to implant copy-protection technology in digital television receivers. The idea is that television producers would embed a digital "flag" in transmissions to designate which ones can be copied and under what circumstances.
Critics say the plan adds a manufacturing expense that would be passed on to consumers and would not work. Since even a moderately dedicated hacker could find a way around the protections, they argue, programs will still be freely distributed on the Internet. 
But the commission is under pressure from Congress to speed the transition to digital television, and Hollywood studios have threatened to withhold their most valuable material from digital transmissions until such a plan is in place. If the agency does not adopt the plan, it is likely to take the form of proposed legislation instead. 
Technology companies fear an attempt to regulate personal computers and the Internet. To judge from skirmishes on this front in 2002, the battle is likely to be hard fought. 
"We object to government-dictated mandates that will only serve slowing down technological progress," said Leslie L. Vadasz, executive vice president of the Intel Corporation, whose chips are in most of the world's computers. "We will vigorously oppose any such efforts." AMY HARMON

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR ANXIETY; 
U.S. EASES THREAT ON NUCLEAR ARMS FOR NORTH KOREA

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 29 

 BODY:
The Bush administration backed away today from a longstanding declaration by the United States that it would not tolerate a North Korean nuclear arsenal, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other officials insisted that it would be counterproductive to set deadlines for North Korea to meet American demands or make threats to take military action.
 Appearing on several Sunday television news programs, Mr. Powell refused to characterize as a crisis North Korea's expulsion of nuclear inspectors and its declaration that it would begin manufacturing plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, insisting instead that it was a "serious situation." He acknowledged on the ABC News program "This Week" that the Clinton administration had what he called "a declaratory policy" that if North Korea began to reactivate its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear facility, "they would attack it." 
 "We don't have that policy," said Mr. Powell, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Bill Clinton during the start of the previous North Korean nuclear crisis. "We're not saying what we might or might not do." 
The ambiguous signal to North Korea, made after lengthy consultations with President Bush at his ranch here, represents a major strategic gamble. The C.I.A. has warned that once the North begins reprocessing nuclear fuel into plutonium, it could produce five or six weapons by early summer. The C.I.A. has estimated that it already has two. 
But Mr. Bush and his aides have concluded that warning North Korea that it would not be allowed to produce more weapons would only create a sense of crisis, exactly what officials say the North seeks, and what they want to avoid. The administration has opted to pursue economic isolation of a country that is already one of the world's most isolated. Page A8. The administration's position was met with considerable skepticism today by Democrats and Republicans alike. 
The Republican who is about to take over the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, declared during an appearance on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that "This is a crisis," and he was mildly critical of the administration for refusing to negotiate directly with the North Korean government.
But he welcomed Mr. Powell's announcement that the administration would work through the United Nations Security Council, saying that approach was working in Iraq, and "it's got to work in Korea." 
Several of Mr. Bush's national security aides said in interviews that Mr. Powell was simply giving voice to the military reality that the United States has no effective way of protecting South Korea or Japan from a North Korean counterattack if the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon were bombed.
"I'm not saying we don't have military options," one of Mr. Bush's most senior advisers said in an interview. "I'm just saying we don't have good ones."
Still, the diplomatic, nonconfrontational approach the administration has taken has clearly put Mr. Bush's aides in the odd position of explaining why they are massing troops around Iraq, as it lets inspectors roam the country and releases lists of weapons scientists, while insisting on patient diplomacy with a country that has expelled those inspectors and announced that it will restart plutonium production immediately.
Mr. Powell argued today that the approach makes sense because intelligence officials believe that North Korea has probably been an undeclared nuclear power for some time but has never used any weapons or threatened to use them. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, by contrast, has used chemical weapons before and, Mr. Powell says, has demonstrated far more evil intent, seeking to dominate the Middle East.
He also argued that the administration was actually listening to those who urge it to work with allies, rather than act unilaterally. 
Mr. Powell said repeatedly today that the administration was willing to communicate with North Korea, even if it rejected direct talks. He seemed to suggest that messages would be sent through China and Russia, or through the North Korean mission to the United Nations.
But he insisted the North would receive no benefits while its nuclear programs remained active. "They want us to give them something for them to stop their bad behavior," he said. "What we can't do is enter into a negotiation right away where we are appeasing them."
It is unclear what Mr. Powell meant by "right away." Mr. Lugar suggested that, directly or indirectly, negotiations were inevitable.
When not speaking for attribution, some administration officials concede that the argument for confronting Iraq militarily while slowly squeezing North Korea economically seems, in the word of one senior diplomat, "considerably harder to explain on TV than it was a month ago."
"The best you can say about it," he added, "is that North Korea is an example of why we cannot allow Saddam to hold on to his weapons of mass destruction.
"Once he gets them, he'll have the same power to intimidate his neighbors that Kim Jong Il enjoys today," he said, referring to the reclusive and unpredictable North Korean leader.
There are several theories here and in Washington about the underlying strategy Mr. Bush is pursuing.
One is that he simply cannot afford a confrontation with North Korea when the United States military is preparing for a possible war with Iraq. 
But Mr. Powell strongly argued that the United States was capable of handling both situations at once, and one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers called a reporter this weekend to argue that if Mr. Bush was seeking to play down the seriousness of the North Korean threat, he would not have ordered the State Department to confront the North Korean government in October with evidence that it was secretly developing a nuclear weapons program.
A second theory is that the administration has calculated that Mr. Kim, even if he adds to his nuclear arsenal, is essentially more predictable and less dangerous than Mr. Hussein, who has never successfully produced a nuclear bomb.
Mr. Powell made that argument today. "This is a country that's in desperate condition," Mr. Powell said. "What are they going to do with another two or three more nuclear weapons when they're starving, when they have no energy, when they have no economy that's functioning?" 
For the Bush strategy to work, China and South Korea must go along, officials acknowledge, and for now both are balking. The Chinese fear an economic crisis in the North will lead to a flood of starving refugees. The South Koreans fear Mr. Bush's economic squeeze could lead to a collapse in the North and perhaps a political explosion.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Bush administration's strategy to "increase financial and political pressure" on North Korea if it doesn't abandon its effort to make nuclear weapons is flawed (front page, Dec. 29). If the strategy hasn't worked in Iraq (as the administration claims), then why would it work in North Korea, which is in an economic mess and where thousands have died from starvation? 
 The danger is not so much that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, which would likely be used as a deterrent against "regime change," but rather that a starving country like North Korea could sell a nuclear weapon to the highest bidder, possibly Al Qaeda, to feed its people and keep the regime in power.
Although the United States may be able to intercept such a sale, the possibility that it could go through is chilling.

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Drops Plans for Elaborate New Museum on East River 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
After months of growing fainter and fainter, the gigantic titanium cloud that was to have been the Guggenheim Museum on the East River dissipated completely yesterday, victim of the Guggenheim's financial straits and a weak economy.
 In a three-paragraph e-mail message, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation announced that it had withdrawn its proposal to build a polymorphous, 400-foot-tall building designed by Frank Gehry on Piers 9, 13 and 14, south of the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan. 
 Thomas Krens, the foundation director, acknowledged as unrealistic the prospect of financing the $950 million project at a time when the museum is cutting budget, staff and programs. Beginning Sunday, for example, the Guggenheim Las Vegas is to go dark indefinitely. 
Mr. Krens said the Guggenheim would still need to expand within the next decade and still believed that a strong cultural presence would help revitalize downtown. "But given the current situation," he said, "the Guggenheim project has to be rethought, perhaps on a more modest level, and certainly in the context of the city's master plan for the development of Lower Manhattan."
In November 2000 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani designated the Guggenheim Foundation as developer of the piers and pledged a $67.8 million contribution to the project. The Bloomberg administration has accepted the museum's withdrawal.
"A new Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry could have been a marvelous addition to the downtown cultural community," said Andrew M. Alper, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "However, given the museum's current financial difficulties, we understand and support their decision."
The city seems to have anticipated the decision.
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg released "New York City's Vision for Lower Manhattan" on Dec. 12, the fantastic cloudlike building was conspicuously absent from renderings showing the possible future of the East River waterfront. Although the city envisions museums there, none would be remotely close to the scale of the proposed 572,000-square-foot Guggenheim project.
"I'm disappointed but not surprised," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance, which runs the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District. Working with Community Board 1, the alliance developed its own East River plan last year that accounted for a reconfigured Guggenheim museum.
As planned, the East River museum was to have some 200,000 square feet of exhibition space (about four times as much as the original museum on Fifth Avenue by Frank Lloyd Wright), a center for arts education and 400- and 1,200-seat theaters. Around the enormous structure were to have been six acres of open space and sculpture gardens. It would have been built on connecting platforms extending from Old Slip to Maiden Lane.
Just the prospect of a New York building designed by Mr. Gehry, the architect of the remarkable Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, drew large crowds to the Fifth Avenue museum in 2000 and 2001 to see a 12-by-5-foot model of the East River structure, surrounded by smaller models and renderings.
The museum anticipated three to four years of construction after a two-year review. The project would certainly have been challenged on environmental grounds and criticized for its potential impact on light, air and views along the riverfront.
But it was welcomed in The New York Times by Herbert Muschamp, the architecture critic, who declared in April 2000, "Here comes architecture."
"If New York is a perpetual gift to the future," he wrote, "this design is its bow: a flourish of titanium ribbons (Mr. Gehry calls them wrappers) curled around half a million square feet of gallery space." Whether or not it was ever built, Mr. Muschamp wrote, it would serve as "an icebreaker of a design, a plan for crunching through rigid streetscapes and frozen minds."
As recently as August 2001, just before the attack on the World Trade Center, it appeared that downtown was poised for a cultural renaissance, with several ambitious projects, including the Guggenheim and the Museum of the City of New York, which planned to move into the Tweed Courthouse. That landmark building was instead designated by Mayor Bloomberg as the new headquarters of the Department of Education.
With most everyone involved out of reach yesterday, it was not immediately clear whether the shelving of the East River project might in turn open the door to the Guggenheim's presence in the redevelopment of ground zero, which has been the subject of some discussion recently.
Mr. Weisbrod said the alliance continued to support the idea of a cultural or performing arts magnet on the East River. Mr. Alper said that the Bloomberg administration's "commitment to developing cultural institutions as an integral part of Lower Manhattan's revitalization is stronger than ever."
And Peter B. Lewis, chairman of the Guggenheim Foundation, did not entirely foreclose the future in his valedictory to the East River project.
"I remain personally committed to supporting an extraordinary architectural and cultural project for Lower Manhattan," he said. "I am looking forward to seeing this project, on another scale and perhaps at another place, realized in the years to come."

HEADLINE: F-16's for Poland? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Poland to Buy Fighter Jets From the U.S." (Business Day, Dec. 28): Poland has announced plans to purchase 48 F-16 combat jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation for $3.5 billion in order to meet NATO's weapons requirements. 
 But can a country with 18 percent unemployment and a virtually stagnant gross domestic product justify such an expenditure?
Perhaps what I have overlooked is that the military-industrial complex is thriving and the American taxpayer will indirectly help with the purchase. Did we not learn last century that trade was good but military might was dangerous?

HEADLINE: Crisis In Prices? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Some fuzzy math: In the first 30 days of December 2000, according to Nexis, only six articles in major news sources contained both the word "deflation" and the phrase "United States"; none of those articles suggested that deflation in this country was a real possibility. In the same period last year there were 292 hits; this past month there were 566.
 Will deflation be even more on our minds a year from now? About five years ago economists realized that monsters from the 1930's were once again walking the earth: Japan, the world's second-largest economy, was trapped in a cycle of falling prices and rising unemployment. But not many people in the U.S. cared about the woes of a faraway country. Like big-time corporate malfeasance, deflation didn't seem like something America had to worry about. 
But like corporate malfeasance, deflation has turned out to be something that can happen here. It's by no means a foregone conclusion: Federal Reserve officials assure us that they can and will steer us away from a Japanese-style black hole. But we're close enough to such a black hole that it's already warping our economic space.
 Here's how it can happen: First, for whatever reason, the economy becomes depressed. The central bank responds by cutting interest rates -- but it turns out that even cutting rates all the way to zero isn't enough to restore more or less full employment.
 At that point the economy crosses the black hole's event horizon: the point of no return, beyond which deflation feeds on itself. Prices fall in the face of excess capacity; businesses and individuals become reluctant to borrow, because falling prices raise the real burden of repayment; with spending sluggish, the economy becomes increasingly depressed, and prices fall all the faster.
 We know from Japan's experience that the descent into such a black hole is a gradual process. Although most economists now date the beginning of Japan's malaise to 1991, the Japanese economy actually grew, albeit slowly, until 1998 -- and it wasn't until 1998 that Japanese officials appreciated the severity of the problem. 
 So we shouldn't take too much comfort from our own sort-of recovery in 2002. Yes, the U.S. economy grew, but too slowly to employ an expanding and increasingly productive labor force. The output gap, the difference between what the economy could produce and what it actually produces, continued to widen. And so the threat of deflation is worse now than it was a year ago.
 In fact, by some measures deflation is already here. Prices paid by consumers are still rising, but those received by many businesses aren't: the government's index of the prices received by nonfinancial corporations has been falling since the third quarter of 2001. 
 As a result, we've moved closer to the event horizon. The Fed funds rate is only 1.25 percent, yet nothing suggests that the economy is about to close the output gap. The back of my envelope says that G.D.P. would have to grow at least 4.5 percent over the next year to bring an end to deflationary pressure. That's well outside the range of consensus forecasts. 
 And the pull of the black hole is increasing. Consider: A Fed funds rate of 3 percent was low enough to get the economy moving in the early 1990's, so why isn't a rate of 1.25 percent low enough now? In part because back then business prices were rising, while now they are falling, discouraging borrowing even at very low rates. What if a year from now the Fed funds rate is zero, but prices are falling even faster?
 O.K., let's take a deep breath. Nothing I've said is news to Fed officials -- a group that now includes my Princeton colleague Ben Bernanke. Also, the black hole metaphor can be pushed too far; as Mr. Bernanke points out, the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal besides low interest rates. The policies he describes haven't been tested, but in theory they should work. Those policies would be more likely to succeed, of course, if the Bush administration would stop playing politics with fiscal policy and . . . oh, never mind. Anyway, the Fed will do its best.
 But two years ago deflation in America seemed a prospect literally not worth writing about. Will it be all over the newspapers a year from now?

HEADLINE: Two Leading Buyers Of Home Mortgages Pass Financial Test 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage loan buyers, held enough capital and were sufficiently buffered to survive a major collapse in housing prices or sudden swings in interest rates as of Sept. 30, their government regulator said today. 
 The regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, said Fannie Mae had $729 million more than its minimum capital requirement of $25.76 billion. 
The office calculates minimum capital as a ratio of capital to assets and obligations. Freddie Mac had $2.12 billion more than its minimum capital requirement of $20.54 billion, the regulator said. 
 In addition, both companies had more than enough capital to withstand a sharp drop in housing prices or sudden changes in interest rates. 
Under this risk-based capital assessment, the regulator said, Fannie Mae had $5.84 billion more than its capital requirement of $21.44 billion and Freddie Mac had $18.18 billion more than its required $4.92 billion. 
This assessment was the first that could have resulted in the government's requiring the companies to repair their finances if they had fallen short of the risk-based standard. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are Congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned companies. They buy home loans and repackage them as securities for investors or hold them in portfolios. Congress grants the companies certain benefits, like multibillion-dollar lines of credit to the Treasury, which lead many investors to believe that the government would step in to bail them out in a financial crisis. 
Critics have found fault with the companies' financial-disclosure and risk-taking practices and have accused the regulator of being weak. 
The companies and their supporters counter that they make extensive data public monthly and that the regulator devotes its resources to monitoring only two companies.

HEADLINE: Two Reports on Economy Fall Short of Forecasts 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Two economic reports released today fell short of analyst expectations, with the housing market cooling from a record pace and manufacturing expanding though still fragile. 
 One report showed that business activity in the Midwest slowed in December from November. The Chicago purchasing management index showed a continued expansion in manufacturing but at a pace that remained sluggish. 
 In the other report, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes fell 3.5 percent in November, a surprisingly steep slide. 
Sales of previously owned homes slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.56 million units in November, from a pace of 5.76 million in October, the association said. Analysts had expected 5.63 million.
"There is a decline but the level of activity is still the sixth highest ever," the group's chief economist, David Lereah, said. "The level of sales is still very strong." 
Analysts said they were not surprised that housing was declining from its breakneck pace. 
"It's still a very good sales rate for any month," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist for the National City Corporation, a banking company in Cleveland. 
Economists said home sales were likely to taper off in 2003 as borrowing costs rise in an anticipated economic recovery. Saturation is also expected to play a role. 
"There are only so many houses a person can buy; there won't be as much pent-up demand next year," said Christine Chmura of Chmura Economics and Analytics. "Total housing sales should be off by 5 percent in 2003 from 2002." 
In the manufacturing report, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago index, which surveys companies in the manufacturing and service sectors, declined to a weaker-than-expected 51.3 in December, from 54.3 in November. A reading below 50 indicates a regional manufacturing sector that is contracting, while a reading above 50 signals expansion. 
The index fell below 50 in September and October, showing contraction for the first time in eight months. 
In a positive sign, the employment component of the index climbed to 50.3, from 43.3 in November, rising above the crucial 50 mark for the first time since March. 
Analysts warned that one month's data is not enough to conclude that a hiring turnaround has occurred.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Stocks Are Mixed, With Political Fears Clouding Trading

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
A negative comment on the chip industry led technology stocks lower yesterday while blue chips rose modestly. 
 Political worries on prospective international conflicts kept some investors away, while talk of stable production of crude oil pushed prices off two-year highs and, at least for the moment, eased concerns that rising energy prices would crimp corporate earnings. 
 "The best way to describe today's stock market and bond market is uninspiring," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. 
Investors worried over American confrontations with Iraq and North Korea stayed on the sidelines. And a four-week strike in Venezuela has severely reduced oil exports, helping to drive world prices higher and threatening higher business costs. 
"The most important factor weighing on the markets is the geopolitical situation," Mr. Johnson said. "There's some relief that Venezuela is talking about doubling their oil production. But you can't get far from the fact that the market today is trendless and friendless." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 29.07 points, or 0.35 percent, at 8,332.85. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.99 points, or 0.46 percent, to 879.39. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 8.77 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,339.54. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those declining by a 4 to 3 margin. Volume increased to 1.06 billion shares from 768 million on Friday.
Stanley Nabi, managing director at Credit Suisse Asset Management, calling the political news "decidedly negative," said: "This is creating a huge amount of uncertainty among corporate managers. They can't focus on what they are going to spend and when they are going to spend it until this cloud lifts." 
Only one day remains in this year's trading, with Wall Street headed for the first streak of three consecutive losing years since 1939-41. 
Shares in chip makers fell yesterday after a research group, World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, said global sales growth slowed to 1.3 percent in November from October, well below average growth for the month. Among big producers, Intel fell 64 cents, to $15.76. Applied Materials, a leading maker of semiconductor equipment, lost 23 cents, closing at $13.29. 
Oil stocks gained. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, advanced 11 cents, to $34.75. ChevronTexaco rose 75 cents, to $66.65. Amerada Hess gained 47 cents, to $55.13. A senior delegate to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said yesterday that the cartel was considering increasing output by 500,000 barrels a day in the next two weeks or so.
Retail stocks advanced, buoyed by a rise in the shares of Wal-Mart Stores, up $1.48, to $50.64. Wal-Mart said it expected December sales at stores open at least a year to be up 3 percent, though it forecast that sales at its Sam's Club warehouse store chain would be down. J. C. Penney also ended higher, up 82 cents at $22.89, after it reported better-than-expected holiday sales. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after industry reports showed declines in sales of existing homes and in Chicago-area manufacturing, heightening expectations among interest-rate-sensitive bond buyers that the economic recovery might weaken further. 
Talk that the Bush administration would mount an attack on Iraq and that North Korea would resume development of nuclear weapons also drove some investors to the refuge of government bonds. 
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed 4/32, to 101 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 3.80 percent from 3.81 percent on Friday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 13/32, to 109 19/32. Its yield fell to 4.76 percent from 4.78 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: More People On Welfare After Years Of Declines 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Welfare rolls grew in three-quarters of the states last summer and the national total crept up, too, as low-wage jobs became scarcer, a private survey has found.
 In many states, the increases are small, but the widespread rise contrasts with the striking declines in the mid- to late 1990's, when the economy was booming and strict new rules were pushing people from the rolls. 
 In 1994, more than five million families received cash assistance each month. That had plummeted to just over two million by this July. 
The Center for Law and Social Policy, a liberal research group, surveyed the states and found that the rolls rose from July through September of this year in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Official figures for that quarter are not yet out.
Nationally, the group found an increase of 0.9 percent in the number of families receiving assistance.
In Mississippi, caseloads have risen 10 percent since July. There are now just under 20,000 families on welfare in Mississippi; the number had fallen to below 15,000.
"We should accept in this economy that the welfare rolls will rise," said Vera Butler, who directs Mississippi's welfare program.
The Health and Human Services Department has not reported a national rise in the welfare figures since the rolls began falling in 1994.
In May, the government said welfare caseloads fell slightly at the end of 2001, though updated numbers now on the department's Web site show that the caseloads actually crept up in the final months of last year, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.
The department has not called attention to the revision.
The figures are important for both welfare policy and politics. Conservatives have typically argued that tough welfare rules can succeed in good and bad times, and they point to the falling numbers as proof. Liberals contend that the tough rules will not work when low-wage jobs that require little education, training and experience are scarce.
Changes in the welfare program have been debated for the last year in Congress, which is considering renewal of the landmark program it created in 1996.
Unable to reach agreement on renewal this year, lawmakers simply extended the current law and promised to try again in 2003. Major issues to be resolved include whether states should be required to make more people on welfare work for their benefits, as President Bush wants, and whether Washington should give states more money for child care, which Democrats want.
The figures released by the center will probably differ only slightly from the official numbers when they come out, said Mark Greenberg, a welfare expert who helped with the study.
Mr. Greenberg attributed the rise to the weak economy and the increasing number of people without jobs. The nation's unemployment rate jumped to 6 percent in November, matching an eight-year high set in April. Some economists say the rate could move to 6.3 percent or 6.5 percent by the spring of 2003.
Mr. Greenberg said caseloads could rise more as unemployment benefits run out, as they did for more than 750,000 families last week.
In most states, caseloads are close to their historic lows, and they have not risen nearly as much as some liberals predicted. Nor have there been worst-case scenarios like starvation and homelessness, as some opponents of the 1996 welfare law predicted.
Mr. Greenberg said it was not clear why states did not have even larger increases in caseloads when the economy was so bad. It was possible, he said, that many people had gained work experience over the last few years and were now able to cope better without welfare, or that they now qualified for unemployment benefits because they had a job history. "That's certainly the hope," Mr. Greenberg said.
It was also possible that many people were no longer eligible for assistance because they had used up their time on welfare, he said, or that the states had made it difficult to apply for help.
Steve Barbour, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department's welfare agency, said the administration had no comment on the report and would release its own figures in late January.

PERSON: Edward Joseph Kulik 

HEADLINE: Edward J. Kulik Dies at 76; Revived Chrysler Building 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Edward J. Kulik, an insurance executive who led the revival of the Chrysler Building in the midst of New York's fiscal meltdown of the 1970's, died Thursday at a hospital in Springfield, Mass. He was 76 and lived in Longmeadow, Mass.
 The cause was a brain tumor, his family said. 
 Like the city itself, Manhattan's steel-spired monument to Art Deco had fallen on hard times, grown seedy and was shunned by tenants as it repeatedly flipped ownership. In 1975, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company of Springfield had its turn, as New York City's financial and real estate interests kept an anxious watch.
Mass Mutual took over the Chrysler Building in foreclosure when the previous owner defaulted on the mortgage. Mr. Kulik was senior vice president of the insurance company at the time; he also was its chief lending officer.
He was credited with persuading the company's board to restore the faded building to its glory, steel eagles, gargoyles, magnificent lobby and all. His vision prevailed at the depth of a painful recession, with an office-leasing market to match.
"Many people felt that the city had lost its image and significance as the location for major corporations," Mr. Kulik said at the time. "We did not share this view."
In backing his act of faith in the city's future, Mass Mutual spent $23 million to upgrade the landmark skyscraper, at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. (Altogether it invested about $58 million in the building.)
The murals of the marble and granite lobby were restored, and the stainless steel eagles and spire regained their glint. More essentially, the Chrysler was outfitted with modern heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, and its elevators were retooled beneath the restored veneer.
Having achieved its rejuvenation, Mass Mutual sold the refurbished Chrysler Building in 1979, by which time more than 96 percent of its space had found tenants.
Edward Joseph Kulik was born in Hartford and served with the Navy in the Pacific in World War II. He graduated in business administration from the University of Connecticut in 1950 and spent some years with companies in Hartford and Baltimore before joining Mass Mutual in 1958.
He also was a former president and chief executive of Massachusetts Mutual Mortgage and Realty Investors, and president of Baystate West Inc. of Springfield. He retired in 1988.
Mr. Kulik is survived by his wife of 53 years, Marion Colbert Kulik; two daughters, Nancy Holstein of Mystic, Conn.; and Betsy Phillips of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a son, Edward Jr. of Rye Brook, N.Y.; and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Revamping Air Travel, From the Ground Up

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
THERE are a lot of different ways to measure air traffic. You can count the number of airline seats available at any given time, or the number of passengers getting on planes or the number of miles flown with a paying customer in a seat.
 But no matter how you cut it, air travel is down significantly. Passengers on domestic airlines flew 13.7 percent fewer miles last month than in November 2000, the closest year to make a reasonable comparison, given the catastrophe of the autumn of 2001. Over all, the airlines put 10.2 percent fewer seats in the skies last month compared with November of 2000, according to the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group. 
 That capacity is going to be cut further in 2003, especially with two major carriers struggling through bankruptcy and one of them, United Airlines, likely to slash schedules further by the spring. 
For business travelers, these capacity reductions mean fewer options across the board. But the cutbacks in air service have not been distributed equally at airports across the country. While a traveler using O'Hare in Chicago or Hartsfield in Atlanta may still have plenty of choices in flights, airline cutbacks have occurred disproportionately in small and medium-size cities.
As the industry continues to contract, the trade group's president, Carol B. Hallett, said last month, those smaller communities "will be disconnected from the national air transportation system -- a system vital to their economic health."
Many transportation experts say they believe that in the United States, long-term federal transportation planning is woefully myopic when it isn't downright incompetent. But the current crisis has energized groups of transportation and environmental activists at state and local levels, some of whom cut their teeth in local drives to rejuvenate railroad stations during the 1990's.
One of those grass-roots organizations is called the Reconnecting America Project. Financed in part by the MacArthur, Packard, Surdna and Turner Foundations, Reconnecting America has set out on an ambitious project to redefine national policies for intercity travel. The goal is a transportation system that links airplanes, trains and intercity buses.
The overworked word "crisis" precisely describes our current transportation system, says Hank Dittmar, a former airport manager and transportation planner who is a co-director of Reconnecting America. The effects of last year's terrorist attacks on air travel merely "exposed the fault lines" in a chronically unstable air travel system, he said, and highlighted the pressing need for serious planning toward an intercity travel system that does not depend so heavily on a financially unsound air travel system that is highly vulnerable to terrorism.
Last week, the organization released a study, Missed Connections, the first in a planned series of reports on intercity travel. The report, which is available at www.reconnectingamerica.org, compares the number of scheduled weekly flights in September 2001 with October 2002. Among the most striking findings is that while big hub airports lost about 10.3 percent of their scheduled flights, airports in some small and medium-size cities lost a third or more of their scheduled commercial flights.
There is a lot of political power in regions of the country where those air cutbacks have been sharpest, Mr. Dittmar pointed out. Given the current crisis, the time seems right to enlist those regions for the first time in a national dialogue on public transportation, he suggested. 
"After 9/11," he said, "when the airlines came in for their bailouts and Amtrak seemed to be imploding, with the finding that they could not be self-sufficient, it seemed to me it was the appropriate moment in terms of public awareness to start talking seriously about interconnecting air, rail and bus, in the way that it works in virtually every other developed country in the world." 
Among the airlines, Continental has already shown itself open to new thinking about interconnected systems, as evidenced by its support of the ambitious train-plane link that ties the Continental hub at Newark International Airport directly to Amtrak's Northeast corridor and to regional commuter-rail systems. JetBlue Airways has also signaled a serious interest in the subject, he said.
Now it's a matter of fanning the sparks of public interest that, for example, sent intercity train use on the East and West Coasts soaring this year, not to mention trying to get the attention of Congress as major transportation finance bills come up for renewal. 
"It's a hard lift, but we're trying to start the conversation," Mr. Dittmar said.

HEADLINE: G.E. Workers Set to Strike Over Insurance 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company's union workers are planning their first national strike in more than 30 years as the company prepares to raise health care co-payments on Jan. 1. 
 The unions will set a strike date once the company raises the medical costs, said Lauren Asplen, spokeswoman for the International Union of Electrical-Communications Workers of America. 
About 17,500 workers at General Electric are preparing for a walkout as the unions set picket assignments and prepare strike materials and headquarters, she said. 
 General Electric still plans to impose the co-payment increase that was announced in August, a company spokesman, Gary F. Sheffer, said. Employees on average will pay about $200 a year more for health care, he said. The union had asked General Electric to cancel its plans and discuss the issue when negotiations for a new contract begin in May.
"There is no reason for them to force an increase through at this point in time," Ms. Asplen said. "When you have a company making close to $16 billion of net income, they can maintain health care benefits." 
General Electric's health care costs have risen 45 percent, to $1.4 billion, this year from $965 million in 1999, Mr. Sheffer said. 
"We, like a lot of companies, are seeing our health care costs increase dramatically," Mr. Sheffer said. "That's the reason we've asked employees to contribute more in 2003." 
The union would be joined in the strike by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, Ms. Asplen said. Active workers from those two unions represent about 6 percent of the company's work force, Mr. Sheffer said. They have the only contracts that are negotiated on a national basis, he said. Other contracts are negotiated by local plants.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Stockholm; 
High Technology And Lots of Salmon

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Stockholm rode the technology boom as well as any area outside of Silicon Valley, and is now feeling the pinch, too. Besides being home to telecommunications giants like Ericsson, Stockholm and the nearby towns of Sodertalje and Uppsala also have a robust medical-device industry, with more than 100 companies like Q-Med and Biacore International. And there are 24 biotechnology companies and 54 drug makers.
 The region has had its share of new-economy failures -- none more spectacular than boo.com, the Internet retailer that wanted to become the Amazon.com of luxury goods. Boo blew through millions of dollars of investors' cash, much of it on lavish parties to burnish its image, before collapsing six months after being introduced. 
 Despite such potholes, new technologies have made the city much more than the capital of a scenic Scandinavian nation where the entire country has only as many people as New York City. Computer, telecommunications and entertainment companies alone employ one-fifth of all workers in the metropolitan region, a local business-development group estimates. In addition to homegrown technology companies like Teleca and Telelogic, Stockholm has also drawn investment from Intel, I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems and Microsoft, among other foreign concerns.

AIRPORT
STOCKHOLM ARLANDA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is served by 64 airlines, but only members of the Star Alliance of airlines -- United, SAS and Lufthansa -- offer nonstop service from the United States; most other airlines connect through London.
Arlanda has four terminals, confusingly numbered 2 through 5; most trans-Atlantic flights depart from Terminal 5. Making connections to other Nordic cities, like Oslo or Helsinki can involve walking between terminals, so allow enough time.
Stockholm recently completed a nonstop train service, the Arlanda Express, from the airport to the center of the city. The 20-minute trip costs about $17.50. "It's quick as a flash and better than a taxi," said Patrik Sandell, a currency trader based in Zurich for Scania, a Swedish truck maker.

HOTELS
The GRAND HOTEL (011-46-8-679-3500, $229 to $405), built in 1853, has high-speed Internet lines in most rooms and a technologically competent staff to help foreign guests get balky computers and other equipment up and running. The hotel is close to the city center and overlooks the harbor and the Royal Palace. (To call a Stockholm phone number from the United States, requires dialing 011-46-8 and then the number. Not all Swedish phone numbers have the conventional seven digits.)
For a bargain, there is BENTLEY'S HOTEL (14-1395, $85 to $150), at the end of Drottninggatan, a main shopping street. Its good-size rooms all have high-speed Internet connections.

RESTAURANTS
GONDOLEN (641-7090, $135 for dinner for two with wine and tip) sits atop a 100-foot tower, giving it spectacular views of the city and its islands. The food is less spectacular, but includes local specialties, like gravadlax (cured salmon) with asparagus and roasted reindeer fillet with cranberry sauce. "It has the unusual combination of good food and a good location," Mr. Sandell said.
OCEAN (652-4090, $100), as the name suggests, specializes in the ubiquitous herring and salmon as well as scampi and blackfish. There is modern decor and a patio that is sublime in the summer, when the sun can linger until near midnight.
For value, COLLAGE (611-3195, $40) is a plainly decorated budget restaurant that serves generous portions of Scandinavian dishes like grilled salmon and smorrebrod (open-faced crispbread sandwiches topped with herring, salmon or ham). Avoid weekends, when boisterous students flood the place.

ENTERTAINMENT
In the Royal Opera House is CAFE OPERA (676-5807), a popular restaurant that evolves into a nightclub and casino as the evening wears on. "It has been one of the 'in' places for 20 years," Mr. Sandell said.
For jazz and blues, there is STAMPEN (20-5793), a casual pub that attracts the best touring musicians. On Saturdays, there is a free blues jam open to everyone.
A younger, hipper crowd gathers at KHARMA (662-0465), a club open Wednesdays through Sundays from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. in a restaurant with the same name. It is in the buzzing Sturegatan entertainment district.

ON YOUR OWN
The VASA MUSEUM (519-54800), Scandinavia's most visited museum, was literally built around the warship Vasa, the only remaining intact 17th-century ship in the world. The top-heavy Vasa, overloaded with cannons to try to intimidate Poland, sank a few minutes after it was launched in 1628 and stayed on the bottom of Stockholm harbor until it was salvaged in 1961.
The cobblestone streets of the Old Town on one of the 14 islands that make up the city are lined with shops, restaurants and bars in buildings dating to the 16th century. For just a walk (or jog), try STRANDVAGEN, a seaside promenade lined with 19th-century houses now mostly converted to embassies or expensive apartments.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Official Criticized for Remark Will Not Run for Re-election 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Two weeks after he came under intense criticism for a remark about Rochester's mayor, the Monroe County executive, Jack Doyle, said yesterday that he would not run for re-election in November.
 The announcement by Mr. Doyle, a white Republican, had been widely expected, and culminated a dispute over comments that struck some as racially insensitive and prompted comparisons to the furor surrounding Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
 It also heightened speculation about whether the Rochester mayor, William A. Johnson Jr., a black Democrat, would run for the countywide post now held by Mr. Doyle.
"I am carefully considering a run," Mr. Johnson said in an interview yesterday.
Mr. Doyle, 60, who has been the Monroe County executive since 1996, said at a news conference that he planned to serve out his term, which expires at the end of 2003. He said he had decided months ago not to run for re-election, and wanted to spend more time with his family.
But by bowing out of the 2003 campaign so far in advance, Mr. Doyle acknowledged the imbroglio that erupted after his remark about Mr. Johnson appeared in The Democrat and Chronicle, the city's daily newspaper.
"If there was a mayor that looked like me, it would be a whole different landscape," Mr. Doyle was quoted as saying. He later denied that the comment had anything to do with race, and said it was meant simply to suggest that Rochester would be better served by a Republican mayor.
His explanation did little to quiet criticism. "What does a Republican look like?" Mr. Johnson said to an interviewer on Dec. 21.
Yesterday, Mr. Johnson said he had expected for months that Mr. Doyle would decide not to run for re-election, but that his remark "was the nail in his coffin."
"He was in deep trouble before," said Mr. Johnson, 60, Rochester's first black mayor. Mr. Johnson was elected in 1993, and has been repeatedly at odds with Mr. Doyle over fiscal policy and proposals to consolidate city and county agencies.
"We would run against his record, which has been indefensible," Mr. Johnson said.
Rochester, with about 30 percent of Monroe County's residents, has been a Democratic stronghold for decades, and the rest of the county has been consistently Republican. While Mr. Johnson has sought to merge government services, Mr. Doyle has fought such consolidation, saying it would raise taxes, reduce accountability and undermine high-quality schools.
If he does run for county executive, Mr. Johnson said, he could do so while remaining mayor. If he won, he would step aside as mayor, and a successor would be appointed by the Rochester City Council to serve out his mayoral term, he said.
Given the sharp divisions between city and county voters, Mr. Johnson's chances in a countywide race are unclear.
"He would be the big elephant in the room," said Gerald Gamm, chairman of the political science department at the University of Rochester. To county residents outside Rochester, he said, Mr. Johnson "would be like Hillary Rodham Clinton, an outsider with incredible name recognition, somebody who a lot of people like and a lot of people don't."

Before Seeing The Ball Drop, Go Figure

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
WITH 2002 drawing to a close, it seems reasonable to take stock of the new millennium. Ignore the bleating of cynics who will damn the exercise as premature, given that the millennium is only two years old. It is never too early for snap judgments.
 One that may safely be made is that New York is off to the worst start of a millennium in its history. We've had the terrorist attack. The local economy is in a tailspin. City and state budgets are worrisomely in the red. Mass-transit fares are about to go up. And the Yankees have yet to win a World Series. 
 None of those problems plagued the city at the dawn of the last millennium. Not one. We're sure of that. We checked with historians.
By now, one or two of you may be warming up the computer -- or, bless your hearts, reaching for pen and paper -- to dash off a letter protesting that the millennium is not two years old but rather three years old.
It began in 2000, you say. That is also, you may well add, the year that the Yankees last won the Series.
But 2000 was in fact the final year of the old millennium. The new one did not begin until Jan. 1, 2001. Most people simply chose to ignore that reality when 2000 arrived, fascinated as they were with the Odometer Effect, all those zeroes tumbling into place.
This familiar point is being revived here not to beat a dead horse -- who needs angry letters from PETA? -- but to raise an issue that must be dealt with sooner or later. How many years are there in a century? The question is not as simple as it sounds.
Because of the Odometer Effect, the 20th century was alloted only 99 years.
Back in the day, people knew how to count. In 1900, they understood that it was the last year of the 19th century. That is why they celebrated the arrival of the 20th century on Jan. 1, 1901. When Jan. 1, 2000, was forced upon us as the start of a new millennium, and thus also of Century No. 21, we effectively shortchanged hapless No. 20 by a year.
So now what? Do we twiddle our thumbs and perpetuate the mistake for another 998 years? Or do we correct it by proclaiming this a 101-year century? If we make the adjustment quickly, our great-great-grandchildren will no doubt hail us one day as visionaries.
Granted, this is not a problem faced only by New Yorkers. It certainly lacks the urgency of coping with terrorist threats or balancing the budget. But it affects New York more than most places because the world always turns to the city this time of year. What would New Year's Eve be without the illuminated ball dropping in Times Square? So shouldn't we at least try to get the centuries right?
Another unresolved matter is what to call this double-zero decade. As it enters its third year, it is still a no-name orphan, at risk of an identity crisis. Many names have been proposed, but none have stuck. The Oughts, the Naughts, the Naughties, the Zips, the Preteens are a few that have been suggested. Considering the events of the last two years, and the possible dangers to come, how about the Oh-Ohs? That seems fitting enough.
One way or another, someone has to make a decision. The clock is ticking. We've already lost 2002, whose distinctions include the fact that it is the last palindromic year until 2112. (Some math wiz figured out that by squaring 2002 you get another numerical palindrome, 4008004. That neat trick will not be repeated until the year 10001. Just thought you wanted to know.)
FOR New Yorkers, 2002 has been a palindrome in spirit as well as numbers. When it began, the economy was on its uppers, war was in the air and the Knicks were dreadful. As the year ends, not much has changed, has it, on any of those fronts.
But all of us, New Yorkers or not, do have something new and troubling to contemplate. This is a claim by the Raelian religious sect to have created a human clone.
The Raelians, in case you are not familiar with them, believe that aliens used cloning to create human beings 25,000 years ago. They supposedly revealed themselves in 1973 to a Frenchman, who said they called themselves Elohim (which just so happens to be the Hebrew word for God).
It all makes sense, when you think about it. Can anything other than alien influence explain Michael Jackson, Tiny Tim and Madonna fans?
By the way, word is that the extraterrestrials will return to Earth by 2035. It would be nice to stick around for them. Anything could happen. By then, the New York tabloids might have even stopped running pictures of Jennifer Lopez every day.

HEADLINE: Disillusion Rises Among South Africa's Poor 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: SOWETO, South Africa, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
For decades the fervor of the antiapartheid struggle burned in these ragged streets. People sang and danced for joy in this impoverished black township when apartheid finally ended in 1994.
 But eight years after South Africa elected its first black government, a small but growing number of blacks are arguing what once seemed unimaginable -- that life was better under white rule. 
 Twenty percent of blacks polled in a survey released this month said they approved of how South Africa was governed during the apartheid years, up from 8 percent in 1995. Political analysts warn that this suggests worrisome levels of disillusionment among the people who elected Nelson Mandela the country's first black president with such hope in 1994. 
Most blacks clearly do not want to turn back the clock. In the survey, called the Afrobarometer, conducted by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa, the Center for Democracy and Development in Ghana and Michigan State University, about 60 percent favored the current political system, which gave blacks the right to vote and expanded their access to housing, water and electricity. 
Today, the benefits of the post-apartheid era seem plain: There are black faces in Parliament and in businesses, integrated schools and neighborhoods and a rapidly growing black elite.
But disappointment is clearly surging among the poor, the working class and the undereducated. Western officials have praised the black government for its conservative fiscal policies, but the nation has lost thousands of jobs in recent years as the previously sheltered economy has been liberalized.
Unemployment is nearly 30 percent, up from 17 percent in 1995. It is not unusual to hear some blacks talk wistfully about the apartheid era when jobs were plenty and layoffs few.
No one is suggesting that blacks are longing for a return to racial oppression and political disfranchisement. It is just that white rule sometimes seem rosier when people consider today's levels of unemployment and crime and the increasing competition with foreign immigrants for jobs.
"Things were better before," said Kala Kgamedi, 33, who lost his job as a salesman two years ago. He was unemployed for nearly two years before he found another job, which provides little in the way of medical benefits and does not provide a company car, as his previous post did.
"In the years of apartheid, things were running smoothly," said Mr. Kgamedi, who works at a car licensing office. "We never had such retrenchments. Now, most people here are jobless. When you get a job, it's not permanent; it's part-time. Me, I would be happy to go back to the apartheid era."
Natale Koanaite, a 27-year-old driver, says the high hopes poor people had when they voted for the black government are fading. "Voting is supposed to change the lives of people who are disadvantaged," he said. "But after voting, what did people get? In Soweto not much is changing."
The governing African National Congress has acknowledged the mounting dissatisfaction. The party's membership has declined in four of the country's nine provinces over the last five years. This month, Kgalema Motlanthe, secretary general of the party, warned that it was in danger of losing young supporters.
Less than half of the people between 18 and 25 voted in the 1999 presidential election. A.N.C. officials fear that disaffected young people, who often lack jobs and vivid memories of apartheid, may be wooed by other political parties, black or white.
"If as a society and a movement we fail to conscientize and mobilize the student and young professional and intelligentsia, other forces will step into this vacuum," Mr. Motlanthe warned.
He said the party's weaknesses in communicating its positions to the public on key issues had left it vulnerable.
"This provided space for both the right and the ultra-left to attack the movement on issues ranging from the pace of delivery to the challenges of unemployment and poverty," he said.
Dissatisfied blacks are hardly seeking a white president. The Afrobarometer survey, of 2,400 people across the country, showed that less than 3 percent of black voters intended to vote for a white political party. The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of 2 percentage points, suggests that blacks do not want another white government but miss what they view as the efficiency of the old one.
"It's not nostalgia for apartheid per se, but for the way things are seen to have worked under apartheid," explained Robert Mattes, a political analyst at the University of Cape Town, who conducted the recent Afrobarometer survey.
Here in black township of Soweto, on a block of cramped houses and wilting dreams, Sabelo Sibanda, 28, has already decided not to vote. He is a law school graduate who has been searching for a job for more than a year.
"We wanted to contribute to our country," said Mr. Sibanda, who lives with his parents and wonders now whether he was foolish to dream such lofty dreams. "We fought for so long for equal rights, to be respected, to be treated as people. I wonder now, the struggle, was it worth it?
"Here I am, young and qualified, and I cannot get a job. Why should I vote when I don't benefit from this government? They say they're trying to alleviate poverty, but I don't see it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Split at U.N. Over Products That Iraqis May Import

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The Security Council, acceding to anxious pressure from the United States, voted today to revise a list of goods that must be approved by the United Nations before Iraq can import them.
 In a sign of fissures in the unity the United States achieved in November with Resolution 1441, which obliged Iraq to cooperate with new weapons inspections, Russia and Syria abstained today. The other 13 Council members voted in favor. 
 The goods review list was first drawn up last May under what is called the oil-for-food program, in which the United Nations uses revenues from Iraqi petroleum sales to buy goods for the civilian population. Broad economic sanctions imposed by the Council on Iraq in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait have severely eroded living conditions for most Iraqis.
The United States was determined to add its items to the list by Dec. 31 to bar Iraq from making new purchases of questionable goods in January, when administration officials expect the pace of their own preparations for a potential war with Iraq to quicken.
The United States also wanted to pass the measure before the composition of the Council changes at the turn of the year, when five new countries not familiar with the issue will become members.
Russia, a permanent Council nation, withheld its support because it had tried unsuccessfully to take one model of Russian-made heavy dump truck off the list so that Russia would be able to export it freely to Iraq, Russian diplomats said.
Earlier this year, the United States said it had satellite photos to show that Baghdad had converted some of the dump trucks to use as mobile rocket-launchers. Russian diplomats argued that Washington's pictures did not prove that Iraq had used trucks it bought from Russia and not years ago from the Soviet Union.
"The record we have is that there was no proof presented," the Russian ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, said today.
American and British diplomats made little secret of their frustration with Moscow, noting that France and China, the other permanent Council members, had supported the measure.
James B. Cunningham, the United States deputy representative, said pointedly that Russia had withheld support over a "very narrow item."
"It must be sad to go from superpower to truck seller," one senior Bush administration official said in exasperation.
Washington had little difficulty persuading the other Council members to accept most of its revisions to the list, many of which were items -- like rocket motor cases and full-motion flight simulators -- that Baghdad would be hard put to argue that it required to care for the needy.
In a compromise, the Council agreed to ask the United Nations to come up with standards to evaluate the quantities that Iraq would be allowed to import of medicines like Atropine and Pralidoxime, as well as Ciprofloxacin and several other antibiotics. Baghdad made requests for large quantities of the drugs, raising Washington's suspicions that it intended to use them as chemical and biological warfare antidotes for its military troops.

Tyco Admits to Gimmickry In Inflating Its Earnings
Tyco International engaged for years in financial gimmickry to inflate its earnings, the company acknowledged for the first time, saying that it would erase $382 million in profits it had previously claimed.
 Tyco said that an investigation had uncovered a corporate culture that encouraged managers to use accounting techniques to mislead investors. Until now, Tyco had contended that financial abuses were not widespread and that most of the abuses were related to the criminal charges that its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, had looted the company of more than $600 million. Page A1.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE OVERVIEW; 
TycoAdmits Using Accounting Tricks To Inflate Earnings

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Tyco International engaged for years in financial gimmickry to inflate its earnings, the company acknowledged yesterday, saying that it would erase $382 million in profits it had previously claimed.
 Tyco said that a five-month internal investigation had uncovered a corporate culture that openly encouraged managers to push the rules of accounting to mislead investors about the company's results. A memorandum to employees at one division directed them to find cost savings by "financial engineering." At another unit, employees were told to "create stories" to justify an accounting change that would improve Tyco's earnings. 
 Until now, Tyco had contended that financial abuses at the company were not widespread and that most of the abuses were related to the criminal charges that its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, had looted the company of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The report said that many of the accounting maneuvers at Tyco, while stretching the rules, did not violate generally accepted practices and therefore did not require additional restatement. Page C1. 
Released after the stock market closed at 4 p.m., the report was prepared by a team of accountants and lawyers hired by Tyco's board in April. The team was led by David A. Boies, a lawyer who has been hired frequently by companies under a cloud.
Given the extensive size of Tyco's operations -- which produced $36 billion in revenue last year selling everything from surgical supplies and security alarm services to plastic hangers and undersea fiber optic cable -- the investigators cautioned that they had not uncovered "systemic or significant fraud."
Still, the 33-page final report makes clear that the integrity of the company's earnings suffered from "a pattern of using aggressive accounting that, even when not erroneous, was undertaken with the purpose and effect of increasing reported results above what they would have been."
The report also detailed more instances of excessive personal spending of company funds by Mr. Kozlowski beyond his extensive art collection, redecorated homes and his now infamous $6,000 shower curtain. These included a newly discovered $110,000 hotel bill paid by Tyco for a 13-day stay in London.
Tyco, which is nominally based in Bermuda to help it escape income taxes, was built into an extensive conglomerate during a late 1990's buying spree engineered by Mr. Kozlowski from its headquarters in Exeter, N.H., and offices in Boca Raton, Fla., and New York, where he also maintained residences. The company employs about 267,000 people around the world.
While Tyco remains a viable business, the abuses uncovered at the company cap a year of spectacular corporate failures at Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing. Other scandals, including disclosures of abuses at Adelphia and other big companies, along with revelations about extensive conflicts of interest in Wall Street research, helped depress the stock market by undermining investor confidence in the integrity of corporate earnings.
The report and the restatement are part of Tyco's effort to put its troubled past behind it and move forward under its new chief executive, Edward D. Breen, a former president of Motorola who took up the post in July after Mr. Kozlowski was arrested. The company said that in the future it planned to pursue much more conservative accounting practices, which has already resulted in a lower earnings forecast for 2003.
For the 2002 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the company previously reported a net loss of $9.1 billion after a series of earlier write-offs. Tyco's accounting, tax and executive pay practices continue to be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Manhattan district attorney's office, federal lawyers in New Hampshire and the Internal Revenue Service.
In a separate filing with the S.E.C. yesterday, the company said that it had received subpoenas for the "production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls" and that it could face large penalties as a result of the investigations.
Some investors may be relieved that the abuses uncovered by the investigation did not add up to a huge sum. Yesterday, before the report was released, Tyco's stock rose 20 cents, to $15.35.
But the report, by describing in detail abuses Tyco has long vehemently denied, calls into question the techniques Mr. Kozlowski used to create his conglomerate. It demonstrates how Tyco regularly put pressure on its many acquisition targets to report lower earnings just before being bought so that Tyco could sharply increase its profits as soon as the deal was completed. Investors had long suspected that Tyco's huge year-over-year growth was a result of artificial inflation of its short-term earnings in a way that could be sustained only by constantly acquiring more businesses.
Beyond the accounting issues, the report determined that the company's corporate governance procedures were severely lacking. The report found that the company suffered from "poor documentation; inadequate policies and procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior executives that occurred; inadequate procedures for proper corporate authorizations; inadequate approval procedures and documentation."
At least one document found by the investigators included a handwritten notation stating, "I would strongly recommend Never to put this in writing!!"
And in an instance of improper authorizations, investigators discovered that three employees who had company cars were also receiving additional car allowances. They also uncovered a $150,000 charitable contribution made to an organization that did not qualify as a charity.
In addition to the criminal charges against Mr. Kozlowski, Tyco's chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, has been indicted on charges of helping Mr. Kozlowski loot the company.
Mark A. Belnick, Tyco's former general counsel, has been charged with falsifying company documents to conceal some $14 million in unauthorized pay.
Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former Tyco director, pleaded guilty this month to securities fraud, becoming the first board member to be charged with a crime in the recent wave of corporate scandals. He settled the case and avoided prison time by agreeing to repay the $20 million he had been secretly paid and to pay a $2.5 million fine.
About half of the profits that Tyco determined needed to be restated involved the way it had accounted for new contracts at its ADT security services business, which operates home and business security systems.
The systems are sold both directly by the company and through a network of independent dealers who install the systems and sell the new accounts to ADT for about $1,000 each. ADT then charges customers a fee of about $30 a month, much more than the company's cost, to monitor their homes for break-ins. Over time, the company hopes to recoup its upfront payment and earn a profit. But during Mr. Kozlowski's time as chairman, ADT overpaid dealers for the new accounts it bought. The company then asked the dealers to reimburse it about $200 for each account, supposedly to cover its costs for taking over those accounts.
In fact, ADT's costs to begin monitoring an account were much less than $200, Tyco said in its report. So Tyco was able to book most of the $200 fee from dealers as an immediate profit, while in reality the company was doing little more than shifting the $200 from one pocket to another. That gimmick inflated the company's profit by $185.9 million from 1999 to 2001, Tyco said yesterday.
Despite the extensive investigation, the Boies team members acknowledged that they did not manage to examine every transaction and that some additional problems might have been missed. And some short sellers, who profit when a company's stock falls and have long been critical of Tyco's accounting, said the investigation and report did not go far enough.
"I think this is a complete and utter whitewash," said Marc Cohodes of Rocker Partners, a hedge fund that is short Tyco's stock. Mr. Cohodes said that by failing to restate its profits for earlier fiscal years, Tyco was denying investors the information they needed to be able to forecast its earnings. Without a more accurate history, Mr. Cohodes said, the company's true value is unknowable.

HEADLINE: They Choke On Coke, But Savor Mecca-Cola 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The idea, says Tawfik Mathlouthi, who runs a radio station for France's Muslim minority, came to him in the shower: to create a competing product to Coke that would satisfy the needs of Arab speakers in Europe and elsewhere for soft drinks, while providing jobs and economic growth.
 "My son adores McDonald's and Coke," Mr. Mathlouthi, 46, the father of two young boys, acknowledged in an interview. His 10-year-old was chagrined when his father urged him not to patronize American brands. "He said to me, 'Papa, I agree not to drink Coke, but you have to give me something.' That's how the idea was born." 
 In November, after months of preparation, Mr. Mathlouthi came out with Mecca-Cola. Borne aloft by Muslims in France desirous of boycotting American brands, to protest policies in the Middle East, the company he created delivered more than a million bottles by early December.
Now, orders for the liter-and-a-half bottles with labels whose bright red and sweeping white script evoke those of Coke are pouring in from around the world -- from Britain, Belgium and Germany -- together with bids from companies wanting to become local distributors.
"We've had requests from California, Florida, New York," said Louiza Chennoub, the company's marketing director. "Apparently there's a lot of interest on college campuses."
The biggest boost for Mecca-Cola, says Mr. Mathlouthi, a French citizen who immigrated from his native Tunisia in 1977, would be war in Iraq. "If there's a war," he said, "you'd have an extraordinary flare-up of Mecca-Cola."
In recent years, calls for Arab boycotts of American brands -- from Coke to McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and even detergents by companies like Procter & Gamble -- have multiplied, as leaders across the Middle East try to protest American policies, most notably support of Israel against the Palestinians. 
Sometimes, the appeals have taken bizarre turns. In Egypt, a recent leaflet campaign accused Procter & Gamble of naming Ariel, as the detergent Tide is known in Northern Europe and the Middle East, to honor Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
The boycotts can buoy local competitors. In the United Arab Emirates, a regional drink called Star Cola has seen sales explode. In Iran, Zam Zam Cola, which replaced Pepsi there when the revolutionary government of Ayatollah Khomeini drove out American businesses, is struggling to satisfy demand -- to the point that when Mr. Mathlouthi approached it as a possible supplier for Mecca-Cola, the Iranians turned him away.
In four months this past summer, Zam Zam delivered more than 10 million bottles to sweltering Saudi Arabia after a Saudi boycott of Coke and Pepsi.
Mecca's sales are going so well that new flavors will come out in January, including lemon and coffee flavored beverages. Mr. Mathlouthi and friendly investors plan a chain of fried chicken restaurants called Hallal Fried Chicken, or HFC, with negotiations under way to open the first outlet in March, probably in Egypt.
"We're creating work," Mr. Mathlouthi said, "and we're fulfilling a political objective."
A blurb on Mecca-Cola's label announces that 10 percent of the profit on every bottle is donated to a Palestinian children's fund; a further 10 percent goes to a local charity. Mr. Mathlouthi said South African officials had also contacted him, desirous of channeling the additional 10 percent to groups that work with AIDS-infected children.
But Mr. Mathlouthi has taken pains to produce a product that sells on its taste, rather than a customer's sense of solidarity with a political cause. The company worked with local food chemists in France to produce a formula remarkably similar to Coke's, though with less sugar. Consumers concur that it tastes exactly like Coke.
"It's doing well, a lot of people are asking for it," said Ahmed Segheir, 41, who owns a bakery in the heavily Muslim Saint Denis area of Paris. Mr. Segheir displays Mecca-Cola in his store window, but also sells Coke from a dispenser inside, both at the same price, about $1.70 a bottle. 
Coke acknowledges that the Arab boycott has hurt. Singling out North and West Africa, most notably Morocco and Egypt, the president of Coca-Cola Africa, Alexander B. Cummings Jr., told analysts in October that "our business in these countries has been hurt by the boycotting of American brands."
Another Coke executive, asked about Mecca-Cola, said simply, "We are aware of Mecca, and we have felt the impact of the boycott of American goods."
Asked whether Coke contemplated legal action because of Mecca's similar label, he replied: "Our lawyers are aware of it, absolutely. But I don't believe there's a decision to take legal action."
Although Mecca-Cola started its sales campaign in mom-and-pop stores in largely Muslim neighborhoods, it quickly drew the attention of big supermarket chains in France, like Auchan, which recently stocked two of its markets in northern Paris with Mecca-Cola.
Mr. Mathlouthi, who visits the United States regularly, says that he is a great admirer of the American way of doing business, and indeed that his company reflects the American spirit of competition.
"I am influenced by the United States and its dynamism," he said. "But I have the right to refuse the dictates of American policy, like any American who opposes the administration's policies."
Mr. Mathlouthi makes no bones of his distaste for Israel, which he simply calls "the Zionist entity." 
"Some choose violence; I am against it," he said, adding that "the Arabs have behaved like imbeciles." "We have to bring the United States to be a partner, and not a guardian," he said. "America is the foster parent of the Arab world, and the Arab peoples are like minors under the guardianship of the United States."
"Even friends have their dignity, and we want to remain friends with America," he said. "But with America the open society, with civil culture, that gives a chance to everyone."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR POLITICS; 
South Korea Criticizes U.S. Plan For Exerting Pressure on North

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea said today that pressure and isolation would not persuade North Korea to end its nuclear arms program, pointing up the South's differences with the United States.
 "Pressure and isolation have never been successful with Communist countries; Cuba is one example," Mr. Kim told his cabinet, in remarks tailored for an American audience. The United States has announced a plan of political and economic pressure against North Korea to try to force it to halt its renewed nuclear arms efforts. 
 But today in Washington, the Bush administration suggested that the pressure would be accompanied by diplomatic engagement. The State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said the administration was "prepared to pursue a bold dialogue aimed at having a better relationship with North Korea." 
South Korea will begin a diplomatic drive to try to resolve the issue, Mr. Kim announced. Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tae Shik will go to Beijing this week, and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hang Kyung will go to Moscow the following week for consultations, he said.
"We will work closely with our allies to solve this Korean peninsula problem, and we will firmly oppose North Korea's nuclear arms program, but no matter what, we will pursue a peaceful solution," he said. "We cannot go to war with North Korea, and we can't go back to the cold war system and extreme confrontation."
The statement today highlighted the growing rift between the United States and South Korea, long a close ally. Anti-Americanism has been rising in South Korea, especially among the young.
In Washington, the State Department said today that James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, would travel to South Korea and other countries in the region to discuss ways of countering the new nuclear threat from North Korea.
Mr. Reeker said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke about North Korea over the weekend with the Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer; with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan; and this morning with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain .
Mr. Reeker said the United States would wait until the International Atomic Energy Agency met on Jan. 6 before deciding whether to bring the North Korean situation before the United Nations Security Council. He said there was no suggestion by anyone in the administration that the United States should impose new sanctions on North Korea. 
Mr. Reeker denied that there was any emerging rift between the United States and South Korea, noting that the departing and incoming presidents both have endorsed the policy of putting pressure on the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
Russia, a North Korean ally, warned it today against withdrawing from the international agreement to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. "Pyongyang's recent decisions to send away I.A.E.A. inspectors and prepare for renewal of the uncontrolled work of its nuclear energy complex cannot but elicit regret," Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said.
Mikhail Lysenko, the director of the Foreign Ministry's security and disarmament department, also warned North Korea against withdrawing from the treaty. He said Russia supported the 1994 agreement and insisted on a "constructive dialogue" among all involved. 
North Korea disclosed recently that it was starting a new program to produce nuclear arms. Then it said it would reactivate another nuclear installation, removed monitoring devices and ordered United Nations inspectors to leave.
 The two United Nations arms inspectors expelled from North Korea, a Chinese woman and a Lebanese man, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday en route to the atomic energy agency's headquarters in Vienna, Reuters reported. 
South Korea's statement today pointed up the growing rift between the United States and South Korea, long a close ally. Angry demonstrations against the American military here are revealing a broader strain of anti-American feelings, especially among young people. 
Many South Koreans resent what they see as American condescension, from an era that younger people here do not even remember. These days, South Korea has Asia's second-most-dynamic economy, after China's. Half the people here in their 20's are in college or have degrees, and the country has such large foreign currency reserves that it doles out foreign aid.
South Koreans can rattle off a string of American slights and insults: a Winter Olympics medal taken away from a South Korean skater, a joke in poor taste on an American television show, a lukewarm reception given their president in Washington last spring and the daily friction of 37,000 American troops in one of the world's most densely populated nations.
"It is absolutely necessary to eradicate the toadyism toward the United States," Chun Chu Song, an economics professor with an American doctorate, wrote last week in the daily JoonAng Ilbo. "A conference in Korea is considered enlightening if a famous American scholar attends, no matter what he says."
The anger at the military surged after the accidental deaths last summer of two teenage girls who were hit by an American military vehicle. When an American court martial acquitted the two soldiers who were in the vehicle, protests became mainstream. On Tuesday night, organizers hope to convert Seoul's traditionally festive downtown New Year's Eve into a vigil and an anti-American protest attended by one million people. 
Earlier this month, similar mass vigils helped elect Roh Moo Hyun as president. Mr. Roh, a liberal labor lawyer who will take office on Feb. 25, won a much higher percentage of the vote from people under age 40 than from older people. 
Now, though, recognizing that the country's security and economy depend in large measure on the American ties, he is asking protesters to use "self restraint."
"To take care of the North Korean nuclear problem is a matter of national survival," Mr. Roh told protest organizers on Saturday, though he also said the need to revise the Status of Forces Agreement, the law that governs the conduct of the 37,000 American troops here, "is a matter of national pride." 
South Korea signed an agreement today with the American military to give the South Korean authorities a greater role in investigating crimes committed by American troops. 
On Saturday, Kim Hyo Jin, a 26-year-old university student, was seeking participants for the New Year's Eve rally. "When we ask whether these people are protecting us or not, the answer would be no," she said, displaying photos of the girls killed by the American vehicle.
On the one hand, some of the anti-American rallies, an outgrowth of mass rallies last summer by World Cup soccer fans, demonstrated national pride.
"The demonstrations are not about anti-American feeling," said Kim Jae Hwa, a 57-year-old manager of a spice company. As his wife, Sun Sook, 50, nodded in agreement, he said of a demonstration the family attended, "It is more about our people's showing their pride in themselves, trying to be in an equal position with U.S. with our own sovereignty."
Koreans already had a love-hate relationship with the United States, which exerts omnipresent cultural and economic influence here. But there is a backlash. With 69 percent of the economy now dependent on foreign trade, many Koreans contend that they are being passed over for jobs that go to less qualified, but bilingual, Korean-Americans.
Many young South Koreans do not understand why American troops are stationed here. Indeed, young South Koreans are a world away from the privations that their parents endured during the Korean War, a conflict that took one million lives. 
South Korea's new leaders are considering a new approach to curb anti-Americanism. "We are telling the young people that American troops are not just here for national security, but for our economic security," said Ben Q. Limb, an adviser to President-elect Roh. "The young people don't know the war, but they know about their affluence."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE COST; 
WHITE HOUSE CUTS ESTIMATE OF COST OF WAR WITH IRAQ

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The administration's top budget official estimated today that the cost of a war with Iraq could be in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion, a figure that is well below earlier estimates from White House officials.
 In a telephone interview today, the official, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, also said there was likely to be a deficit in the fiscal 2004 budget, though he declined to specify how large it would be. The administration is scheduled to present its budget to Congress on Feb. 3. 
 Mr. Daniels would not provide specific costs for either a long or a short military campaign against Saddam Hussein. But he said that the administration was budgeting for both, and that earlier estimates of $100 billion to $200 billion in Iraq war costs by Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's former chief economic adviser, were too high. 
Mr. Daniels cautioned that his budget projections did not mean a war with Iraq was imminent, and that it was impossible to know what any military campaign against Iraq would ultimately cost.
"This is nothing more than prudent contingency planning," Mr. Daniels said from his home in Indianapolis, where he was reviewing the fiscal 2004 budget at his kitchen table. "At this point there is no war."
Mr. Daniels's projections place the cost of an Iraq war in line with that of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, which cost more than $60 billion, or about $80 billion in current dollars. But the United States paid for only a small part of that conflict, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan bearing the brunt of the costs. 
This time, the gulf nations are less supportive of the United States and, diplomats say, Americans are likely to bear most of the cost of a war with Iraq.
Mr. Daniels declined to explain how budget officials had reached the $50 billion to $60 billion range for war costs, or why it was less in current dollars than the 43-day gulf war in 1991. He also declined to specify how much had been budgeted for munitions and troops. 
"All of these are major costs," he said.
The driving expense for the military in any war would be the size of the American force and the length of the conflict. In the 1991 war, 550,000 American troops were based in Saudi Arabia, which picked up the cost of virtually all housing, fuel and food. 
If President Bush orders an attack against Iraq, the American force would be half the size of that in the 1991 war. The Pentagon's war plans call for deploying as many as 250,000 military personnel, but the initial offensive should start with a much smaller number, with a sizable force in reserve.
The budget director's projections today served as a more politically palatable corrective to figures put forth by Mr. Lindsey in September, when he said that a war with Iraq might amount to 1 percent to 2 percent of the national gross domestic product, or $100 billion to $200 billion. Mr. Lindsey added that as a one-time cost for one year, the expenditure would be "nothing." 
Mr. Lindsey was criticized inside and outside the administration for putting forth such a large number, which helped pave the way for his ouster earlier this month. He could not be reached for comment this evening. (Congressional Democrats have estimated that the cost would be $93 billion, not including the cost of peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts after a war.) 
But today, Mr. Daniels sought to play down his former colleague's remarks. "That wasn't a budget estimate," he said. "It was more of a historical benchmark than any analysis of what a conflict today might entail."
Pentagon officials say the cost of munitions in a potential war with Iraq will not be materially more than the cost of munitions in the 1991 gulf war. The reason, they say, is that the military now uses more precision-guided bombs, which are far more accurate, so fewer are needed.
In 1991, about 10 percent of bombs and munitions were precision guided. In the conflict in Afghanistan, the share of precision weapons rose to about 60 percent.
Although precision-guided bombs cost more than conventional munitions, they are not always exorbitantly more expensive, at least by Pentagon standards. Many of the "smart" bombs used in Afghanistan, for example, were simply 2,000-pound unguided bombs with a $20,000 mechanism attached to the bomb's tail that allowed it to be steered to a target by satellite.
The major costs of an Iraq war, Pentagon officials say, will be those for dispatching tens of thousands of military personnel overseas, feeding and sheltering them, and maintaining equipment deployed to the gulf.
Mr. Daniels said that Mr. Bush had been kept apprised of the budget projections for a war with Iraq and that all preparations were still in the realm of the theoretical. "At this point," he said, "our position is that the president has made no decision."
The cost of any war with Iraq would not be part of the budget for the 2004 fiscal year that Mr. Daniels is reviewing. Rather, the money would have to be appropriated as emergency spending by Congress. The cost of a war would also not be part of a record $355 billion military spending measure approved by Congress this year.
Mr. Daniels declined to specify the amount of a likely deficit for fiscal 2004, but he described the tax cuts scheduled to take place that year as only a "minor factor" in the red ink. Critics of the administration's tax cut acknowledge that the costs of the tax cuts will grow to large numbers only in 2006.
He laid blame for the deficit on the sluggish economy and the slump on Wall Street and said there would be deficits without the administration's tax cuts. After four years of surpluses, the Bush administration announced a deficit of $159 billion for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. It has projected a $109 billion deficit for the current fiscal year.
Mr. Daniels said today that the budget for the 2004 fiscal year is one of "moderate growth" and that he was not projecting any immediate return to a balanced budget. 
"Last year was a year when we presented a lot of new spending," he said. "This year we've said we'll be looking at much lower growth. The big reasons for that are the flatness in revenue and the return of deficits, as well as the uncertainty in the potential expansion of the war on terror."

HEADLINE: $4 Billion Debt Relief Plan Approved byHynix Creditors 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

 BODY:
Hynix Semiconductor, the troubled South Korean chip maker, won another reprieve yesterday as its creditors approved a $4 billion plan to keep the company alive. 
 The debt relief was approved despite opposition from some creditors, who said that their institutions would not advance more funds to the company, once a core member of the Hyundai conglomerate. There have already been two rescues of Hynix in the last two years. 
 The latest rescue comes even as Hynix Semiconductor stands accused by two rivals, Micron Technology of the United States and Infineon Technologies of Germany, of receiving unfair assistance in the past. 
Hynix's creditors took over the company in June after the previous board rejected a proposal by Micron to buy it for nearly $3 billion.
Still hoping to prepare Hynix for sale, the creditors, led by the government-controlled Korea Exchange Bank, rolled over $2.4 billion in debts and agreed to exchange another $1.6 billion of its debts for equity. Hynix's overall liabilities have soared to more than $6 billion despite the two previous rescue plans. Hynix remains the world's third-largest producer of memory chips behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea and Micron, and just ahead of Infineon. 
Hwang Hak Joong, a vice president of the Korea Exchange Bank, said that the company's creditors appeared to believe that the latest exercise in debt restructuring would "put creditors in a better position to eventually sell the company." 
Needing approval of creditors holding 75 percent of the $6.25 billion in acknowledged Hynix debts, Korea Exchange Bank as lead creditor won assent from those with 86.5 percent. The plan provides no additional money for the research and development needed to keep up in a fast-evolving field. 
The company's total liabilities, including hidden debts that might surface in a due diligence process, are thought to be considerably higher than the amount that is publicly known. 
The company's financial difficulties are viewed as one reason several leading banks, notably Chohung Bank and the two banks that merged to form Woori Bank, as well as Korea Exchange Bank, fell under government control during the Korean economic crisis of 1997 and 1998. 
The latest plan for Hynix's survival is certain to further inflame its rivals. In complaints filed with the Commerce Department in the United States and the European Union, Micron and Infineon have charged that Hynix could not have remained in business without substantial government subsidies, notably huge infusions of credit by government-controlled banks. 
With little if any prospect of finding a buyer for the entire company, Hynix has been shedding assets. In what appeared as a gesture to smooth ruffled feathers, the company announced, before yesterday's meeting of creditors, that it would sell its 47 percent share of ImageQuest, a flat-panel manufacturer, for $37 million to GB Synerworks, also a Korean company.
