HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Getting There Is Challenge For Latin America E-Tailing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
Any one of the 500 million people who live in Latin America can sign on to the Internet, given access to a computer and a phone line. They can buy a book, CD or anything else offered for sale on the Internet, given a credit card. And they can have their purchase delivered to their home or office, given luck.
In many parts of Latin America, postal service outside of major business centers is erratic at best. At times, the only reliable national delivery system belongs to the soft drink and potato chip manufacturers that stock the bodegas and mom-and-pop stores that do business in almost every community, no matter how small or remote. 
 Even in the cities, packages from abroad can be delayed in customs for days, and letters arrive weeks late, if at all.
That, to a large extent, leaves the final leg of electronic commerce in Latin America the province of private services. Each big city has a few local fast-freight companies, and recently specialized e-commerce companies like Sky Box Services allow Latin Americans to have Internet purchases sent to an address in the United States. Sky Box then carries them south and delivers them to homes and offices, bypassing often unreliable local carriers.
The most visible deliverers are the large international companies like United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL, and all are expected to play a part in the growth of e-commerce in Latin America. They have been preparing to handle the new business, although they do not expect it to boom anytime soon.
"We liken the status of the Internet in Latin America to being where the United States was in 1996," said John Menna, vice president at U.P.S. for marketing for Latin America and the Caribbean. "It'll take about four or five years to start seeing anything substantial develop there. Nonetheless, U.P.S. is putting in place all the pieces and the infrastructure to facilitate electronic commerce and the buying and selling of goods throughout Latin America."
According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the number of computers connected to the Internet last year rose more rapidly in Latin America than in any other part of the world. Even so, while the region accounts for 8 percent of the world's population, it represents just 3.5 percent of Internet users and less than 1 percent of global e-commerce.
Many obstacles hamper development of the Internet in Latin America. Poverty is so persistent that many people still lack access to a telephone, and the possibility of buying a computer, let alone logging onto the Internet, is reserved for a relatively small group of city dwellers with sufficient incomes. Few people have credit cards, which still are essential for e-commerce to work. Computer literacy lags far behind levels in other parts of the world, and telephone service competition has not yet brought down the cost of Internet access.
And then there is the issue of delivery. "Local delivery of goods is something that many people in Latin America associate with the local postal service, which in the past has been a very poor service indeed," Mr. Menna said.
To strengthen its Latin American operations, U.P.S. is buying Challenge Air Cargo, an airline that serves Latin America from Miami. Besides increasing the U.P.S. fleet, the acquisition provides landing rights in virtually every developed country in Latin America, a process that could have taken years had it been negotiated nation by nation.
The Challenge purchase "clearly says that we think Latin America is a growing region," Mr. Menna said. But e-commerce, he added, "is still all potential."
Competition is intense among the air delivery services. DHL Worldwide Express has spent $30 million the last two years preparing for more cargo, including substantially more e-commerce deliveries. In 1998, the company bought three Boeing 727's, upgraded its hub in Panama City and built a new hub in Buenos Aires. Last year DHL also acquired DHL S.A., a contract operation in Argentina that was run by a local company. DHL is spending up to $10 million to improve service in Argentina.
"Latin America has an awful lot of people, an awful lot of land and huge potential," said Colum Joyce, an electronic commerce manager at DHL's headquarters in Brussels. "But it's no different from anywhere else in the world. There are a few relatively concentrated points of consumption, and pickup on the Internet is concentrating on those socioeconomic segments of the community."
The other big air delivery service in the region, FedEx, is building a larger cargo handling operation at Miami International Airport, the gateway through which most shipments to Latin America pass. But its real focus is on streamlining the process for getting goods in and out of Latin America.
Juan N. Cento, president of FedEx Express International's Latin America division, said his company was helping customers, like the hammock manufacturer in Merida, Mexico, he visited recently, design and build their Web pages to take full advantage of the global market available on the Internet.
"They say, 'Here's what we need,' and we help them with everything from building a Web page to monitoring the shipping, tracking and tracing of packages," Mr. Cento said.
FedEx is also working to reduce customs delays for packages coming into Latin America. It recently opened a new clearing house at the Toluca Airport outside Mexico City that enables local customs agents to clear shipments worth less than $200 on the day they arrive. A similar system is planned for Campinas, Brazil, near Sao Paolo, and will later be replicated throughout the region.
"E-commerce is an increasingly integral part of the business environment in certain markets in the region," said Gregory M. Rossiter, a FedEx spokesman. "But quite candidly, for FedEx, the potential for e-commerce in the region as a whole is still a number of years away."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Blue Chips Slump Again; Nasdaq Gains Are Modest

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks stumbled lower yesterday as worries about a slower pace of consumer spending dogged retailers for a second day and investors continued to lock in profits on recent gains.
Technology shares, however, clung to modest gains, as positive earnings news buoyed individual stocks and the semiconductor sector resumed its rebound. 
 Investors took news of slightly stronger-than-expected consumer prices in stride, viewing the data as unlikely to rattle the market's confidence that the Federal Reserve will leave rates steady on Tuesday.
The Consumer Price Index for July showed a rise of 0.2 percent, higher than the gain of 0.1 percent expected by economists polled by Reuters, but well below June's increase of 0.6 percent. Excluding volatile energy and food components, the core index rose 0.2 percent in July, in line with expectations.
But that news failed to lift most stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average, slumped 58.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,008.39. That drop came on top of the Dow's 109.14-point loss on Tuesday.
The Dow and the Nasdaq have neared the upper end of recent trading ranges, said Francis Gannon, senior portfolio manager for United States equities at SunAmerica Asset Management.
"People are getting nervous that we will get up near those resistance levels and back off," Mr. Gannon said, "and that is perhaps what we are seeing today."
Broader market measures also slipped, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index down 4.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,479.85.
The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, rose 9.54 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,861.20.
The 30-stock Dow index suffered largely from the weight of its floundering retailing components.
Home Depot declined 2 3/4, to 51, after a number of Wall Street analysts lowered their opinions of the stock. On Tuesday, the company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that met expectations, but disappointed investors who had been hoping for better results.
Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, fell 2 1/16, to 49 11/16.
"The retailers seem to be in a very bearish mood. I think that's more of a function of overall consumer spending slowing down," said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisers. "They were priced maybe higher than they should have been, given the slowing in the economy that we all expect."
Adding further to retailers' woes, Heilig-Meyers, a home furnishings company, said it would file for bankruptcy protection and close some stores. Trading in the stock was halted in the late morning.
The Dow's financial services stocks weakened, giving up strong gains made recently amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates. American Express was off 1 7/8, to 57 5/16, while J. P. Morgan tumbled 4 1/4, to 142 7/16.
"The group had a terrific bounce a couple of weeks ago, and it has been slowly giving it up," said Lawrence Cohn, banking analyst at Ryan, Beck & Company.
But the Dow's losses were offset in part by gains in the shares of the oil giant ExxonMobil, which rose 1 29/64, to 82 49/64. Oil services shares also floated broadly higher as crude oil prices headed back toward 10-year highs. The Standard & Poor's international oil index climbed 1.24 percent.
On the Nasdaq, Analog Devices jumped 17 5/8, to 94 7/16, after saying third-quarter earnings nearly tripled, beating analysts' estimates.
BEA Systems also gained on the Nasdaq, adding 8 1/8, to 57, after the company, a software maker, posted second-quarter profits that beat Wall Street forecasts.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
China's Censor Is Customer No. 1

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
When Saatchi & Saatchi set out to create a Chinese television commercial for Daktarin, an athlete's foot medication made by a unit of Johnson & Johnson, the advertising firm faced a predicament. Chinese government regulations prohibit advertisements from showing patients or symptoms -- critical elements for a pharmaceutical commercial.
Saatchi & Saatchi eventually resolved the problem by using weeds as a visual analogy for a foot fungus. That satisfied the regulators, but frustrated the ad agency. 
 "Creatively, we could be 10 times better than now if it wasn't for the regulations," lamented Philip Li, executive creative director for Saatchi & Saatchi's Beijing office.
Rigid government control, however, is the price to enter one of the world's fastest-growing advertising markets. Mr. Li said he had often had to rework commercials to address the objections of Chinese censors -- or to avoid running afoul of them in the first place. "The regulations are always in the back of your mind," he said.
Advertising is just as problematic for the government. In China's march from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, officials have promoted advertising as an accelerator of economic development and welcomed it as a way to supplant government subsidies for many television stations and periodicals. On the other hand, the government has also criticized advertising as a conduit for both fraud and unwelcome foreign ideas.
"They will try to be as lenient as possible, but whenever anything touches cultural values or political stability, it is something they have to crush right away," said Louisa Ha, president of Dr. Ad Marketing International, a consulting firm based in the United States that focuses on China.
Coca-Cola, for example, recently withdrew a multimillion-dollar campaign for its Sprite soda because the ads featured a popular Taiwanese singer, A-Mei, who had sung Taiwan's national anthem at the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
"If they allowed her to be on the commercial, they would be allowing dissidence," Dr. Ha said. "Politics is above everything else in this country's agenda, whatever economic interests are sacrificed."
Those interests are not insignificant. In the 21 years since a Shanghai station showed China's first television commercial, for a Chinese tonic wine, advertising spending in China has soared from zero to more than $7 billion, and by some estimates is as high as $12 billion. The range results from discrepancies between published rates and discounted rates that advertisers are actually charged, coupled with the weakness of China's accounting system.
While that is a fraction of the $165 billion spent on advertising in the United States last year, China is one of the world's fastest-growing markets. It has surpassed South Korea to become Asia's second-largest market behind Japan.
As advertising has mushroomed, so has the government's determination to keep it under control. In a country where the media are monitored carefully for their political and social influence, advertising is considered a privilege bestowed by the government and not a commercial extension of the right of free speech.
In adjusting this privilege, the government has updated its advertising rules more than 30 times in the last six years.
The guidelines range from vague principles, like insisting that advertisements not "jeopardize the social order," to specific prohibitions, like those that forbid the use of state symbols like the flag or national anthem. Companies are also not allowed to use superlative terms like "best" or compare their products with those of competitors.
The prohibitions have scuttled ads for such products as the Bristol-Myers Squibb painkiller Bufferin, which claimed to be "the best," and Colgate's diamond-headed toothbrush, which the company asserted was superior to traditional rectangular toothbrushes. However, Budweiser's slogan that it is "America's favorite beer" was allowed after its brewer, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, provided statistical evidence to support the claim.
While the regulations may seem severe, the government considers them a necessary consumer-protection measure in a country where soaps have claimed to help people lose weight and tonics have promised to make people smarter. In the United States, consumer sophistication backed by government regulations has convinced most advertisers that it is in their own best interest to shun exaggerated claims and outright falsehoods in advertising.
"Self-regulation is the hallmark of maturity in an advertising industry," said Hong Cheng, a professor of communications at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill. "This kind of system is still in the making in China. That is why the government has to act as a Big Brother."
Since the regulations went into effect, the government said it had found 160,000 examples of false or misleading advertisements and had imposed penalties of more than $54 million. The number of "advertising malpractice" cases handled by the authorities rose 36 percent last year, led by ads for drugs, medical services and food.
These included products called Jiannan Capsules (which translates as Healthy Male Capsules) and Alaska Shengmin Lixiong Platinum (Alaska Life Strength Chest Platinum). Several of the cited products trade on the Chinese translation of Viagra, the impotence treatment, which is not trademarked in China. The government did not identify the manufacturers.
"The shadow of the regulations hangs over the advertising creative process from beginning to end," said Louis Wong, president of Beijing-based Megacom Advertising, who estimates that half of his commercials have to be modified during the approval process. "It is annoying, but this is reality."
Television commercials, which receive the greatest scrutiny because of their wide viewership, must be submitted to each regional office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce before being shown. Many companies submit their storyboards and script before filming just as a precaution.
The approval process is subjective and fragmented, with some regional offices approving commercials that other offices reject. A shampoo commercial that showed a glimpse of a bather's shoulder was accepted in cosmopolitan Shanghai, for example, but banned in a conservative neighboring province. Other commercials that received storyboard approval were rejected after the final edit. Some commercials are censored after they go on the air.
Commercials that violate standards can sometimes be salvaged by rewriting the script or making other adjustments, but some are banned.
"Most of our problems are pharmaceuticals and things related to underwear," Mr. Wong said. "The problem is often over-exaggeration of a product, or that it goes against the general moral standards of the Chinese population."
Pharmaceuticals face the strictest regulations. That industry, the largest spender in advertising, faces reviews by public health officials as well as advertising regulators. And, because of a history of exaggerated claims for medicines, advertisers in China are not allowed to show patients, children or symptoms. Nor can they associate products with the names of doctors or hospitals.
Sexual modesty is also emphasized by the government. Models must be covered at least 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) down from their necks and 15 centimeters up from their knees, which can be inconvenient for companies trying to sell shampoo or underwear.
"If you are the marketer for the underwear, you want to demonstrate that a piece of underwear fits well," said Mr. Wong, whose firm is working on an account for Embroform, a Hong Kong underwear company. "But if you just featured a face of a woman up to the shoulders, then what is the point of an underwear commercial?"
His firm is looking into using computer animation for the commercial, hoping in that way to avoid the fate of a previous ad that was censored because authorities thought a model's miniskirt was too short.
Foreign manufacturers are not the only advertisers who have run into trouble. The government itself has on occasion run afoul of the censors. A commercial advocating condom use to avoid AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases was pulled late last year, two days after it first appeared, when the State Administration for Industry and Commerce decided it was too risque
Regulations not only restrict the content of advertisements, but the structure of the industry. China has 50,000 advertising firms employing almost half a million people, an average of just under 10 people a company. To protect domestic agencies from foreign competition and to limit foreign cultural influence, multinational advertising agencies are required to set up joint ventures and are limited in their equity. Foreign advertising executives said they expect China to relax or eliminate that requirement if the country is admitted to the World Trade Organization.
While China's advertising market is experiencing surging revenue growth, creative growth is unremarkable as a consequence of all the restrictions.
"If you look at all the award-winning commercials in the Cannes festivals, I can bet 80 percent could not be in China because of the content," Mr. Wong said. It's frustrating, he said, but he and others knew to expect it when they walked into China.
"If you want fun and creative," Mr. Li concurred, "that's not China."

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Filings Continue to Decline

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Fewer individuals and businesses filed for bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2000, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts reported this week.
The total number of new bankruptcy filings from April 1 through the end of June fell to 321,729, down 7 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier and the lowest number of filings in any second quarter since 1996. 
 Bankruptcies filed for the 12 months that ended on June 30 totaled 1,276,922, an 8.3 percent decrease from the period that ended in June 1999.
Congress is working on an overhaul of the bankruptcy code, motivated by rises in filings to a record high of 1.44 million in 1998. But consumer bankruptcies, the focus of the effort, have recently been declining.
"The continued drop in bankruptcy filings reflects the positive impact that our strong economy has had on household balance sheets," Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, said.
Personal bankruptcy filings totaled 312,486 in the second quarter, down 6.9 percent from the second quarter of last year. For the year to June 30, personal filings fell to 1,240,012, an 8.3 percent decrease compared with the corresponding period in 1999.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Vouchers for summer school could help halt the learning slide.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Four economic analysts -- Professor Krueger, Hal R. Varian, Jeff Madrick and Virginia Postrel -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
A Gallup poll taken in July discovered the obvious: the Harry Potter books are being read by everyone this summer. Well, almost everyone. Children in low-income families are much less likely to read Harry than their counterparts in middle- and upper-income families.
This finding will not surprise education experts or teachers, who have known for decades that economically disadvantaged children fall behind during the summer months compared with their peers. The problem is that children from low-income families are less likely to read Harry Potter or much else during the summer, which causes their skills to atrophy when school is out of session. 
 What might be called the "Harry Potter divide" -- the depressed level of academic engagement in poor households when school is out -- is responsible for a major portion of the gap in achievement between low- and high-income students.
The achievement gap has important economic consequences. Several studies indicate that students who score one standard deviation higher on math and reading tests -- comparing those at the 15th percentile to those at the 50th percentile, say -- earn, on average, 15 to 20 percent more a year as adults. And a new study by Christopher Jencks of Harvard University and Meredith Phillips of the University of California at Los Angeles found that high school is not too late to make a difference: those whose math test scores increased between 10th and 12th grade achieved higher incomes later in life compared with those who started at the same level but did not raise their scores.
Clearly, raising achievement pays off, and it pays off more today than in the past because the information age has increased the demand for skilled workers.
Labor force projections, however, indicate a slowdown in the growth of skilled workers in the next two decades, so the achievement gap between lower-income students and their counterparts from more affluent families could crimp the expansion of the economy. In my view, the summer learning deficit is much more worrisome for economic growth than the trade deficit.
The latest and probably best research on the summer learning gap is in a 1997 book, "Children, Schools and Inequality" (Westview Press) by Doris Entwisle, Karl Alexander and Linda Olson of Johns Hopkins University. The three sociologists have been studying a random sample of 800 Baltimore public school students since they entered first grade in 1982. At the beginning and end of each school year, students took the California Achievement Test.
The researchers examined gains and losses in test scores over the school year and summer break. Students were classified into groups based on their parents' socioeconomic status, which depended on education, occupation and income.
Remarkably, children from families of high and low socioeconomic status made equivalent gains on math and reading exams during the school year. But the achievement level of children from low-income families either fell or stagnated during the summer, while children from higher income families continued to make progress.
The entire achievement gap between children from low- and high-income families arises from periods when school is out and the period before children enroll in school. This pattern, which also holds in other studies, suggests public schools are doing more to help poor children overcome the obstacles they face in their homes and neighborhoods than is commonly appreciated.
While Republicans and Democrats spar over using vouchers to reform public schools, a potential solution to the achievement gap has been overlooked. Why not give low-income parents a scholarship, or voucher, to send their children to some type of a summer learning program?
The idea of school vouchers, which is frequently attributed to Milton Friedman but dates back at least to Thomas Paine, has become "radioactive" among Democrats, as Jonathan Orzsag, a former official for President Clinton's National Economic Council, put it. So call this something else, such as Summer Opportunity Scholarships -- S.O.S. for short.
Only 9 percent of students in the United States attend summer school. Unlike other voucher programs, summer school scholarships would supplement, rather than substitute for, the traditional public school system.
The 180-day school year in the United States -- a legacy of a bygone era when children were needed to work the farm in the summer -- is short by international standards. By the end of high school, children in Japan, for example, have had the equivalent of four more years of schooling than American children. Although it would be desirable to use the 180-day school year more constructively, one thing is clear: more time on task helps students learn.
Summer school bolsters achievement if it is focused on specific academic goals, said Harris Cooper of the University of Missouri. Professor Cooper, who just published a review of 93 evaluations of separate summer school programs, said the effect of summer school on student achievement was "clearly positive" when performance was compared either with participants' pre-summer scores or with a randomly selected control group of nonparticipants.
But summer school runs into a roadblock. Many families and teachers do not want to be in school year round. Mandated summer school attendance also carries a stigma, and such programs typically cater to older children who are already far behind.
Summer scholarships offer a solution. Families could be given a refundable tax credit or cash grant if they sent their children to a competent academic enrichment program during the summer. A range of options already exist, including public school-sponsored summer schools, private tutoring organizations like the Sylvan and Kumon learning centers, and education-oriented camps.
Too many children are forced to endure summers like the mythical Harry Potter of Privet Drive. No books, no trips, no visits to the library; only a television and loyal owl for company. Giving low-income families scholarships to send their children to summer enrichment programs could help narrow the achievement gap and better prepare the work force of tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Pace of Consumer Inflation Registers Only a Slight Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Consumer inflation increased only slightly last month, the Labor Department said yesterday, reassuring analysts that the Federal Reserve would find no need to raise interest rates again when it meets Tuesday.
The Consumer Price Index rose a relatively modest 0.2 percent in July, as oil and other energy prices showed little change after gyrating for most of the year. 
 "This puts the final nail in the coffin of a rate hike next week," said Bill Sharp, senior United States economist at Chase Securities.
Adding to the case for Fed forbearance, the Commerce Department said that builders had broken ground on 3.3 percent fewer new homes last month than in June, the slowest pace since late 1997.
The price report contained few surprises, but allayed lingering fears that the Fed, which has raised rates six times in the last 13 1/2 months, would be forced to keep raising them to prevent an outbreak of inflation. A report of strong retail sales last week had kept such fears alive. Not counting energy and food, the rise was 0.2 percent for the fourth consecutive month.
The July results reduced the 12-month inflation rate to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent.
Nonetheless, economists noted a gradual uptick in the pace of inflation this year that they said would need eventually to be arrested -- even though it largely results from higher prices for a volatile item like gasoline. Inflation increased at a 4 percent pace for the first seven months of the year, compared with a 2.7 percent pace for the 1999 calendar year.
"We are seeing some inflation pressures," said Marilyn Schaja, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "You can't rule out a rate hike in the fall."
Ms. Schaja said the weakness in yesterday's home-building report might have been exaggerated by poor weather. She also noted that the decline in starts -- to an annual rate of 1,512,000 units -- was confined to one region, the South.
The bond market found little comfort in the reports, with traders and investors promptly pushing rates up a bit from Tuesday's levels.
It was the energy component, which accounts for 7 percent of the Consumer Price Index, that accounted for most of the deceleration. After surging 5.6 percent in June, energy edged up 0.1 percent last month as a 2 percent rise for energy services was largely offset by a 1.6 percent decline for petroleum-based energy.
Gasoline fell 2 percent after an 8.8 percent jump in June but is still 18.3 percent higher so far this year after soaring 30.1 percent in 1999. Airline fares, 0.7 percent higher last month, are up 9.7 percent so far this year.
Food prices climbed 0.5 percent after rising just 0.1 percent in June, an acceleration that Patrick C. Jackman, a senior official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said he could not explain in light of an excellent growing season. Perhaps, he speculated, there was some delayed impact from higher costs of transporting food.
Medical care rose 0.3 percent last month and 4.1 percent for the latest 12 months. A subindex dominated by prescription drugs, the cost of which is likely to become an increasingly contentious subject of political debate, has risen 4.2 percent in the last 12 months. This compares with a 6.1 percent increase in the 1999 calendar year.
But hospital costs have accelerated this year, to a 7.2 percent annual pace in the six months through July, compared with 5.3 percent for the six months ended in January.
The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, has now risen at a 2.6 percent rate so far this year compared with 1.9 percent in 1999.
"We've picked up a bit but it's not accelerating," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. But while the current pace "seems to be within the range of Federal Reserve acceptability," Mr. Dederick said, it remains an open question whether the economy will slow enough in coming months to keep inflation in check without further rate increases later this year or early in 2001.
The consumer price report also showed that inflation in the New York metropolitan area ran at a 3.1 percent rate over the last 12 months compared with 3.5 percent for the average of American cities. Dallas-Fort Worth, with 5 percent, was the highest of the seven areas identified by name, with Chicago lowest, at 3 percent.
The purchasing power of the 1982-84 consumer dollar now stands at 57.9 cents, with the 1967 dollar at 19.3 cents.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
With oil prices increasing and the election season at hand, the cry goes up for OPEC to raise output.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
THE price of crude oil increased again yesterday, even after an American Petroleum Institute report the day before said that inventories rose by an unexpected 7.4 million barrels last week and the federal Energy Information Agency cited a smaller, but still strong increase of 3.4 million barrels.
The price jump, with oil for September delivery up 13 cents, to $31.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pretty much sums up the current outlook for oil prices. 
 With inventories in the United States still near 24-year lows, the hope for price relief is in another significant rise in output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And that boils down to OPEC's approving increased production from Saudi Arabia -- or Saudi Arabia going it alone. The group's next meeting begins early next month.
Some analysts think more oil will be pumped because, they say, OPEC and especially the Saudis do not want to threaten economic growth by leaving the price above $30 a barrel for the American crude oil benchmark, West Texas intermediate.
In addition, pressure from the United States on Saudi Arabia and other suppliers, inside OPEC as well as outside, to produce more oil will build quickly if the price does not retreat soon. It is not far from the nine-and-a-half-year high of $34.14 a barrel it touched in March just before OPEC's first production increase.
This week, there have been new rumblings of concern from the Clinton administration, which lobbied hard for increased OPEC production before the supplier nations' meeting in June.
It was reported on Monday that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson had told a group of energy analysts a few days earlier that the administration was re-examining ways to lend oil to refiners from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, presumably lowering prices as the available supplies rose.
Oil would certainly become a presidential campaign issue if the price remained high, especially because of the connections to the oil industry of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
Home heating oil prices are already on the rise again. Heating oil for September delivery rose 0.37 cent a gallon yesterday, to 86.88 cents. It is up 13 percent in the last two and a half weeks and is 26 percent above the average price from October through February.
"I think informally or otherwise, there is likely to be a supply response" from OPEC before the meeting begins, said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch.
But the low inventory situation -- and traders' and speculators' focus on it -- is leaving the oil market far more vulnerable to upward price pressure than it was earlier in the year, when OPEC members debated their first two production increases.
"We have no shock absorbers," said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, "and we are vulnerable to price spikes."
Some analysts think that it will be difficult to quickly rebuild inventories. They say that most OPEC nations cannot increase their overall capacity to produce oil, providing them little interest in higher output quotas that benefit only a few. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only OPEC nations that could produce significantly more oil, the analysts say.
Then last week, the International Energy Agency reported that several OPEC countries, including the Emirates, were in fact producing below their capacity. Mr. Rothman quoted the agency's monthly report for July as saying that the second-quarter inventory buildup in the 29 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's wealthier nations, had been far less than normal for that time of year.
Saudi Arabia seemed to have succeeded in taking the pressure off oil prices -- and the focus off inventory levels -- when it finally convinced traders, analysts and speculators last month that it would produce 500,000 barrels more a day, a promise it first surprised the oil market with on July 3.
After wrangling within OPEC, the Saudi message got though as its extra oil began to move. And with that, the price dropped to $27.43 a barrel on July 31 from $30.93 at the beginning of the month.
But on Aug. 1, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil inventories in the United States had dropped by a surprising nine million barrels in the week ended July 28, leaving inventory more than 40 million barrels below the level a year earlier. The following week, total inventory fell by 2.1 million barrels more, bringing it to a 24-year low of 282.6 million barrels. The price of crude oil was back above $30 the next day.
Tuesday's report from the American Petroleum Institute revised the previous week still lower, so that the 7.4-million-barrel increase brought inventories for the week ended on Aug. 11 to 286.4 million barrels.
The only positive factor in the oil price's remaining above $30 a barrel is that OPEC members have an informal agreement to raise production by 500,000 barrels a day if prices stay above a set level for 20 cnsecutive trading days. That level works out to a bit more than $30 a barrel for West Texas intermediate, and the 20 days would be up just before an OPEC meeting the second week of September.
Of course, the producers' group could choose to ignore this trigger. Or, a little jawboning would be enough to push the price below $30 for a day, starting the 20-day period again. So the upward bias on oil prices would remain until there were clear increases in production.

HEADLINE: Why Blacks Doubt Lieberman

BYLINE: By David A. Bositis; David A. Bositis is senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a group that researches issues involving black Americans.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
At the Democratic convention this week, good manners reign supreme. Despite many doubts, most African-American delegates are supporting Al Gore's choice for a running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman. Even Maxine Waters, the outspoken congresswoman from California, has announced that after talking to Mr. Lieberman about his views on affirmative action, she is now on board.
But outward party unity doesn't mean that internal fissures have disappeared. Indeed, the selection of Mr. Lieberman points to some real differences between Mr. Gore and black Democrats. And these differences are important to his chances in November. 
 There is general agreement among political analysts that the election will be close and that the states between New Jersey and Missouri (plus North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee) are likely to determine the next president.
These states have significant numbers of black voters, who are reliably Democratic, that is, if they go to the polls. To win this election, Mr. Gore will have to ensure that black turnout is high.
The problem? It's hard to imagine that his selection of Mr. Lieberman will galvanize them to vote. As a pollster and researcher who has long followed African-American politics, I know that of all the people mentioned as Mr. Gore's possible running mate, Mr. Lieberman was the one least likely to appeal to African-Americans.
There are political reasons why this is so. Despite his reassurances this week, he was not known as a supporter of affirmative action, especially after his favorable comments about California's proposition that outlawed affirmative action in all state programs. In addition, for four years, he has been chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, which represents moderate and conservative Democrats as a counterweight to liberals like Jesse Jackson.
Some observers have said that anti-Semitism among a minority of the black population could play a role. There have been several surveys, most notably those done for the Anti-Defamation League, that suggest African-Americans are more anti-Semitic than white Americans. I don't entirely buy the results of these surveys, in part because anti-Semitism, like racism, is a difficult thing to assess.
In surveys, for example, I have heard African-Americans refer to Jewish wealth, but many working class and poor African-Americans talk that way about all white people.
In the case of the Democratic ticket, there is more a sense of "why not us?" Many black Americans feel they have been the most loyal Democrats and wonder why a black politician hasn't been selected by now. This feeling is not about anti-Semitism, but about once again being left out.
The root of black ambivalence about Mr. Lieberman, however, could be more specific. The vice president chose the one man who carries with him an implicit, some would say open, repudiation of Bill Clinton.
Mr. Lieberman's speech calling Mr. Clinton's actions immoral in the Monica Lewinsky scandal was widely praised. Indeed, after Mr. Lieberman was selected, this factor was cited favorably, and seen as helping Al Gore distance himself from the president.
Here's a news flash for you: Black Americans want to celebrate Mr. Clinton. They don't care about his personal life. During his administration, African-Americans have prospered as never before. Incomes have risen faster than those of whites. Affirmative action has been protected. Mr. Clinton made Africa part of his foreign policy. The cabinet has been inclusive.
In short, Bill Clinton already has a legacy -- he is the first president to fully embrace black America.
In the last eight years, African-Americans have gotten used to being taken seriously. They want that influence to continue, and are waiting for Mr. Gore to send a signal that it will. Unfortunately, his selection of Mr. Lieberman sends a different signal.
Mr. Gore now finds himself in a position of having to assure black voters that they will have a real voice in his administration, that their concerns will be addressed. The pollsters can talk all they want about reaching out to swing voters. But Al Gore knows he cannot win without his party's most loyal voters.

HEADLINE: Concorde Is Stripped of Certification to Fly

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
British and French aviation regulators withdrew airworthiness certification from the Concorde today, effectively ruling the world's only commercial supersonic airliner unfit to fly until it can be protected against the catastrophic safety flaws behind last month's fatal crash near Paris.
Narrowing their assessment of what caused the crash, investigators said they believed that a tire blowout had sent chunks of rubber flying into a fuel tank, rupturing it and causing it to burst into flames as the plane sped toward takeoff at 195 miles an hour. 
 Previously, French investigators said a 16-inch piece of metal on the runway had burst the tire, setting off the sequence of apparently freakish events that caused the plane to crash within 90 seconds of takeoff.
"What is uniquely different in this case is that tire debris alone is thought to have led to this catastrophic accident," said Sir Malcolm Field, the chairman of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, the regulatory agency that ordered the grounding of British Airways' Concordes today.
Later in the day, the French aviation agency took the same action.
The revocation of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate -- the document that permits airplanes to fly in the airspace of the authority that issues it -- was the first such action since the United States grounded the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 for five weeks in 1979, aviation experts said.
Even if Air France and British Airways -- the only airlines operating the Concorde -- decide that it is technically and economically feasible to modify the aircraft or introduce new safety procedures, the process could take "months rather than weeks," said Mike Bell, a senior official of the British aviation authority.
Echoing the assessment of some aviation industry analysts, Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, an aviation Web site, said that "it will be a finely balanced financial question whether to do these modifications or not."
British Airways said it had canceled Concorde service through early September but would resume it on 24 hours' notice if the airworthiness certification was restored.
Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately after the crash on July 25 of the New York-bound Concorde Flight AF 4590, which killed 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the Concorde. British Airways grounded its fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the airworthiness certificate would be revoked today.
British Airways gave no clear indication whether it believed that the aircraft, which crosses the Atlantic in about three and a half hours at up to twice the speed of sound, would ever return to commercial service.
The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and other charter routes for almost 25 years and came to be seen as an icon of prestigious travel for executives and superstars ready to pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip journey taking half the time of a subsonic flight.
As British Airways' flagship, Concorde was also seen as an important magnet in drawing high-end travelers to the airline.
Sir Malcolm, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, said today, "It is clear to all of us in the C.A.A. that a tire burst alone should never cause the loss of a public transport aircraft."
Sir Malcolm said the authority had asked the Concorde's manufacturers -- BAE Systems, Airbus Industrie and Aerospatiale Matra -- to devise a plan to ensure that accidents could not be caused by burst tires.
Under aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to catastrophic damage from tire debris may not be certified as airworthy.
Concorde's spindly, storklike landing gear is positioned directly below the wings, fuel tanks and engines. But British aviation experts say that the British Concordes were modified to protect the wings from burst tires, but that the Air France Concordes were not modified.
Burst tires have been a worry for Concorde pilots since the plane entered service in early 1976, British aviation experts say.
Since then, there have been seven known tire blowouts in which fragments struck fuel tanks without causing fires, the experts said. The modifications to the British Airways Concordes in 1993 involved changes to a water deflector on the undercarriage to "reduce the energy" from a tire blowout, said Derek Blackhall, the head of the certification section of the Civil Aviation Authority. Air France's Concordes did not have the same modification.
But Mike Bell, a senior official of the aviation authority, told a news conference that it was "quite unique, an unprecedented event" for a burst tire alone to cause an air disaster.
Sir Malcolm rejected the idea that the demand for modifications effectively meant that the Concorde would never fly again. "We would wish Concorde to fly again," he said.
Jean-Claude Gayssot, the French transport minister, said the measures did not necessarily imply the end of supersonic travel. "Anyone who says it's the end for supersonic flights has got it wrong," he told the daily Liberation. "Traveling fast is going to be increasingly in demand."
A British investigator, Ken Smart of Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch, said the precise links between the sequence of events that doomed Flight AF 4590 last month remained to be established in detail.
But he did say the tire blowout had sent debris flying, puncturing one or more fuel tanks and allowing fuel to spill out and catch fire within seconds.
The airplane lost thrust in one engine, then in two, Mr. Smart said. "The crew had no means to make them aware of the nature of the fire nor to take action against it," he said at a news conference.
He said the safety issues relating to the tires would take "some time to resolve."
The head of France's Accident Investigation Bureau, Paul-Louis Arslanian, told reporters in Paris: "I hope the Concorde will fly again, but I am an investigator of accidents, not a witch doctor. I cannot read crystal balls."

HEADLINE: A Metropolis of Poor Children

 BODY:
Every so often during a national convention, a politician says something that shines right through the accumulated oratory hanging like fog above the convention floor, creating an image that requires deeper contemplation. Though hardly known for his speaking skills, former Senator Bill Bradley did just that the other night when he told the Democratic convention that if all the 13.5 million poor children in America were gathered in one place, they would form a city bigger than New York -- and "we would then see child poverty as the slow-motion national disaster that it is."
This Dickensian vision was a wonderfully descriptive way of saying that while Americans can sympathize with individual cases of poverty, and "would never turn their backs on a starving child," it is next to impossible for them to imagine the totality of the problem. Put all these children in one place in the mind's eye, and the reality becomes inescapable. 
 Mr. Bradley's imagery was part of a passionate plea to his party to reaffirm its historic connection to America's underclass. So, too, was his use of another geographical metaphor, in which he noted that the 44 million Americans without health insurance equal all the people living in 12 states between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains. But it was also a reminder to affluent Americans of their moral obligation to do something about America's "ill-fed, ill-housed and ill-educated" children. "If we don't end child poverty in our lifetime," Mr. Bradley said, "shame on me, shame on you, shame on all of us."
As he made clear during his unsuccessful primary run against Al Gore, Mr. Bradley does not think his own party has done enough on this score. But it has at least done and promised more than the Republican opposition. Both sides have pledged to devote substantial resources to early childhood education, an important issue to Mr. Gore and almost a signature issue for George W. Bush. The Democrats have also offered proposals like expanding the earned-income tax credit and raising the minimum wage that would quickly put real dollars in the pockets of the poor.
But Mr. Bradley was talking about more than individual programs, however worthy. What he was talking about was the need for a sustained, systematic effort to reach out to the one-fifth of American children living in families making less than $13,000 a year. These are damning statistics in a nation whose convention orators keep congratulating themselves on America's present prosperity, and where the main political debate involves how to spend the giant surplus generated by that affluence. There is no better place to spend that surplus than on the vast city of poverty that Bill Bradley brought to life on Tuesday night.

Hewlett-Packard Reports A 23% Jump in Earnings
Hewlett-Packard reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' estimates, driven primarily by strong sales of personal computers and printers. Its board also approved a stock split.
Analysts said that a large part of the 23 percent jump in earnings came from higher-than-expected interest income, a more favorable tax rate and other nonoperating contributors. Page C9. 

N.T.T. Unit in Talks on U.S. Venture
The wireless arm of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, the world's biggest communications company, is in preliminary negotiations to acquire a minority stake in the pending wireless joint venture between BellSouth and SBC Communications, two of the Bell local telephone giants. C9.
 
Prices Edged Up 0.2% in July
Consumer inflation increased 0.2 percent in July, the Labor Department said, reassuring analysts that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates on Tuesday. C11.
 
Cheney's Options Limited on Stock
Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, retired from the Halliburton Company with millions of dollars worth of stock options that he cannot cash in until long after a new administration takes office, Halliburton said. The company said Mr. Cheney would not be allowed to sell the options, which he said he would do before taking office, assuming the Republicans win the presidency. Thus, he will have to either abandon the stake or hold it, giving him a large stake in the success of Halliburton while serving as vice president. A1.
 
Major Stock Indexes Stumble Lower
Blue-chip stocks moved lower as worries about a slower pace of consumer spending dogged retailers for a second day and investors continued to lock in profits on recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, slumped 58.61 points, to 11,008.39. The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 4.58 points, to 1,479.85. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.54 points, to 3,861.20. C10.
 
Profit Drops at News Corporation
The News Corporation said after-tax profit for the company's fourth quarter fell 14 percent. The company has just agreed to acquire Chris-Craft Industries, whose television stations carry the UPN network, which is owned by Viacom-CBS. Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corporation, said he was open to negotiating with Viacom regarding the future of the network. C8.
 
Oil Prices Rise 13 Cents a Barrel
The price of crude oil rose to $31.80 a barrel even after the American Petroleum Institute reported that inventories rose an unexpected 7.4 million barrels last week and the Energy Information Agency reported a smaller, but still strong, 3.4 million barrel increase. That price jump pretty much sums up the current outlook for oil prices. Market Place. C9.
 
Delivery Services Expect Expansion
The large international delivery companies like United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL are all expected to play a part in the growth of e-commerce in Latin America because local delivery companies lack the ability to handle an expected expansion. C4.
 
British Telecom to Increase Stake
British Telecommunications is expected to announce today that it will take control of Viag Interkom, a German telephone operator, by doubling its ownership stake to 90 percent in a deal worth about 6 billion euros or $5.46 billion, according to executives close to the deal. C4.
 
Summer Reading, Future Earnings
The depressed level of academic engagement in poor households when school is out is responsible for a major portion of the gap in achievement between low- and high-income students. And that gap has economic consequences in that it affects earnings potential. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene. C2.

HEADLINE: Congressman Squares Off With Brooklyn Challenger

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY: 10th Congressional District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Standing next to the entrance of a Brooklyn subway station on a recent sweltering morning, Representative Edolphus Towns shook hands with the last in a trickling stream of rush hour workers and paused to make an observation about his campaign.
"Last time, I didn't do too much of this," the 66-year-old congressman said of his last primary race, in 1998. "But this time is different. I'm out here, and I'm focused." 
 In that Democratic primary two years ago, he received just 52 percent of the vote, making it the weakest showing of any incumbent member of Congress that year. Now, Mr. Towns, an 18-year incumbent who has been immersed in Brooklyn politics for a generation, is looking for a victory that will be overwhelming.
Unlike that three-way primary in 1998, Mr. Towns this year is facing just one opponent: Barry D. Ford, 37, a lawyer. Mr. Ford came in second to Mr. Towns in that earlier race, with 36 percent of the vote. Virtually since the returns were counted two years ago, Mr. Ford has been working nearly nonstop at a second chance to oppose Mr. Towns.
Mr. Ford, a Harvard graduate who also graduated from the university's law school, says a one-on-one race against the congressman makes his prospects far brighter. He believes Mr. Towns is highly vulnerable.
"This time, I think it is easier for me to win," Mr. Ford said. "But challenging an incumbent is never easy. The fundamental thing I have to do is to become even better known. And I am doing door-to-door and have devised an extensive field operation. This is a ground campaign, and I'm meeting as many people as I can."
While both candidates have put together an army of volunteers and have raised sizable amounts of money, they have each taken to the streets of the 10th Congressional District with a frenzy.
Mr. Ford, in meeting with voters in the heavily Democratic district, lists a battery of complaints against the incumbent congressman. Foremost is highlighting Mr. Towns's 1997 endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican.
"Given the treatment of the mayor to this particular part of New York City, that endorsement is inexplicable," Mr. Ford said. He also accused Mr. Towns of being silent during the highly public accusations of police misconduct against black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
"He did not participate in any of the protests about Diallo, Louima or Dorismond," he said, referring to two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and Patrick M. Dorismond, who were killed by New York City police officers, and to a third black man, Abner Louima, who was tortured in a Brooklyn police station. "And that's because of his cozy relationship with Mayor Giuliani."
Mr. Ford asserts that the congressman's record had been lackluster, complaining that Mr. Towns missed about one in seven votes in his 18 years in Congress. "And in the last 18 years, he has been the prime sponsor of only two bills and two amendments," Mr. Ford said.
He also chastised Mr. Towns for accepting tobacco industry campaign contributions, saying the congressman has voted against restrictions on tobacco use and for federally supported tobacco crop insurance.
Mr. Ford said he would push for more federal money for school construction and teacher training and to begin the process again for an empowerment zone in Brooklyn.
Mr. Towns has acknowledged that his endorsement of Mr. Giuliani has placed him on the defensive in a Congressional district where the mayor received about a third of the vote in the last mayoral election. But he said he was motivated to endorse Mr. Giuliani as a means of gaining his cooperation on securing a federal empowerment zone, where public funds are used to spur commercial redevelopment.
"As it turned out, we didn't get the empowerment zone and so I don't feel good about it," he said of the Giuliani endorsement. "If I had gotten the empowerment zone, it would have been a different story.
Mr. Towns said that at the urging of his staff, he would not accept money from tobacco companies this year. The congressman, a Baptist minister born in North Carolina, said he remained sympathetic to the concerns of the tobacco industry. "When you look at tobacco companies, they are conglomerates that get money from all kinds of businesses," he said. "I have family and friends who are involved in tobacco for their livelihood. It's a complicated issue."
On his work in Congress, Mr. Towns said that he had been an effective congressman and that he had high ratings from labor unions, health care workers and education groups. "I have a 100 percent voting record on every major vote," Mr. Towns said. "Some votes are procedural votes that are less significant. I have an A rating with all of these groups. They must feel that I have the ability to lead."
He added that he was at the forefront on several economic developments in Brooklyn, principally the Metrotech Center, an office complex. Mr. Towns also flashed campaign literature that included an endorsement from Mr. Louima, saying he had been involved in behind-the-scenes meetings with officials at the Justice Department about police abuses.
"That's the way I work," he said. "I don't jump up for the cameras."
Mr. Towns said his 52 percent showing two years ago was largely the result of his having been preoccupied with assisting in the re-election campaign of his son, Darryl C. Towns, a member of the State Assembly. The younger Mr. Towns had faced a bitter campaign against Martin Malave-Dilan, a city councilman and former ally of the Towns family.
While the younger Mr. Towns is once again facing Mr. Malave-Dilan in an Assembly primary, the congressman is not managing that campaign this year. Therefore, he maintained, he will devote more time in the primary against Mr. Ford.
By Mr. Towns's own forecast, he will double what he spent in the 1998 primary, with a plan to spend $600,000 this year. Mr. Ford said he intended to spend about $250,000.
The 10th Congressional District stretches from East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant through Fort Greene into Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. The district is 56 percent black and about 20 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian-American, according to the 1990 census. Non-Hispanic white residents make up 21 percent of the district.
The battle between Mr. Towns and Mr. Ford, unlike high-profile statewide races, will not be waged through television advertising, but by door-to-door campaigning and mailings specifically aimed at voters identified by the candidates as likely supporters. And so it is a typical New York City campaign, almost entirely on the streets.
Mr. Towns said that was the reason he had returned to active campaigning in neighborhoods. "I will meet Barry Ford at every corner, every civic association meeting and every subway stop," the congressman said. "This time, I will be everywhere in this district. And everyone will know it."

HEADLINE: Legal Firms Cutting Back On Free Services for Poor

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Many of the nation's biggest law firms -- inundated with more business than they can often handle and pressing lawyers to raise their billable hours to pay escalating salaries -- have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they fall far below professional guidelines for representing people who cannot afford to pay.
The roughly 50,000 lawyers at the nation's 100 highest-grossing firms spent an average of just eight minutes a day on pro bono cases in 1999, according to a survey last month by American Lawyer magazine. That comes out to about 36 hours a year, down significantly from 56 hours in 1992, when the magazine started tracking firms' volunteer hours. Yet with the economy booming, firms are enjoying record profits, the survey also found. 
 "The phenomenon of being so busy that you don't have as much time for pro bono work is quite real," said Jack Londen, a partner at Morrison & Foerster. The San Francisco firm has a long tradition of taking charitable cases, but since the recession of the early 1990's, its lawyers have cut their average pro bono hours in half, the survey showed.
"When there is more work than lawyers to do it, and there are not enough new lawyers out there to hire, the pro bono gets shelved," Mr. Londen said.
The decline is troubling for many in the legal profession, both because of cuts in government-sponsored legal aid programs and because the American Bar Association urges lawyers to do at least 50 hours of pro bono work each year. Only 18 of the 100 firms surveyed reported that their lawyers averaged that many hours or more in 1999, less than half the number seven years earlier.
Even in cities with strong pro bono legacies, where public service is a particular point of pride, the trend has emerged, leading to concern that a cultural shift may be under way. In February, a committee of the District of Columbia circuit court conducted a survey of 142 private law firms in Washington, a center of pro bono activity. Less than 25 percent of their lawyers spent 50 hours or more representing clients who could not pay, it found.
"What we're seeing is a sea change, rather than just a rogue wave," said Eugene R. Fidell, head of an advisory committee of the Federal District Court in Washington.
Since many large firms raised starting pay for new associates by as much as $25,000 this year, hoping to dissuade them from flocking to Internet start-ups, many worry that the ebb in pro bono work will only accelerate.
"We're under pressure to work hard to pay for these rising salaries," said John Payton, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering and president-elect of the Bar Association of Washington. "I don't think it's going to wipe out the tradition of pro bono, but it's clearly going to have some impact."
Susan Hoffman, the partner in charge of pro bono assignments at Crowell & Moring, has taken to cornering lawyers in hallways at the big Washington firm. Her e-mail pleas go unanswered, memos no longer work and phone calls leave her colleagues unmoved.
"I know there's somebody out here who has time to do it," she said. "I just have to find that person."
The drop-off in pro bono work comes when the legal community can least afford it, many public interest groups say. Since 1996, the Legal Services Corporation, a major source of representation for low-income people in noncriminal cases, has lost a quarter of its financing from the federal government -- the source of the bulk of its budget -- leading to hundreds of layoffs among its legal staff nationwide.
Also in 1996, Congress prohibited lawyers who get legal-services money from engaging in class-action lawsuits or taking cases on a number of issues, including abortion, illegal immigration and welfare revision. To fill the gap, many say private firms need to increase their volunteer efforts, not retreat from them.
"Without a sustained level of pro bono, a lot of people who need legal advice, or who need their rights protected, are not going to have the same access to justice," said Robert Weiner, the pro bono chairman of the American Bar Association.
As practices shy away from pro bono work, many civil rights lawyers say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find volunteers for cases that would have elicited quick responses years ago. Hilary Chiz, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in West Virginia, says she searched for a law firm to represent students who were told to pray in school but had no takers after a year.
"It's a hot issue; it's sexy; it's First Amendment," she said. "I would have thought it would have been easy to place.'
Vera E. Kennedy, 55, is also frustrated by the lack of free legal representation. Ms. Kennedy's apartment is one of about 270 units at Hunter's View, a San Francisco public housing development that the city wants to demolish and rebuild.
When similar buildings were torn down a few years ago, prominent firms made sure residents had adequate interim housing and would be allowed to move back when work was finished. Local public interest lawyers have been scrambling unsuccessfully for months to find a firm to do the same for Ms. Kennedy and the other tenants. "There are mothers with young children here," she said. "They need the protection of having a place to live."
To be sure, civil rights lawyers, advocates and poor people themselves have long lamented the difficulty of finding lawyers with the imposing resources often needed to bring forward big lawsuits. A 1993 study by the American Bar Association showed that less than 30 percent of low-income people who needed a lawyer for a civil matter actually got one -- proof that, even at its best, volunteerism may not solve the legal difficulties of the poor.
"But a problem that was bad in 1993 is only going to be exacerbated by the fact that you have fewer lawyers doing pro bono," said Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has been directed by President Clinton to monitor and promote pro bono work in minority communities.
Not that big firms do all the unpaid work. Small practices and one-lawyer offices take on the bulk of pro bono cases, though their volunteer hours often go uncounted. Many of these lawyers continue to take on a wealth of unpaid assignments, even though they are busy, given recent surges in employment, disability and sexual harassment litigation. But in some rural areas, where small law offices often comprise the entire legal community, many firms have become as preoccupied as have their larger counterparts in cities.
"They can't say yes to everybody," said Angele Court, pro bono coordinator for Vermont's legal services program. "So they say no to the more difficult case."
Representing the poor is an integral part of being a lawyer, ingrained in the profession since its origins in ancient Rome. In the United States, the commitment to pro bono work is in the code of ethics that has governed the profession for nearly a century. For many, the leadership of corporate firms is critical for setting the tone that pro bono work is still more a responsibility than an act of charity.
"The big law firms provide the litmus test for the legal community," said Steven B. Scudder, counsel to American Bar Association's standing committee on public service.
Most firms say it is not their commitment that has waned, just their ability to take on as many cases as in the past. While lawyers typically billed 1,700 hours annually just a few years ago, today they routinely bill 2,200 to 2,300 hours, said Esther F. Lardent, director of the Pro Bono Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center.
The rush of new business has also meant rapid growth within firms, sometimes by as much as 40 percent a year. Practices have sprouted new offices around the country, often in cities where the firms have few community ties. The lawyers hired to run them are so frantically managing busy practices that it will take time before they can branch out and take pro bono cases, firms say.
And it is not as if lawyers are turning their backs on the poor. With more than 150,000 lawyers at their disposal, the top 500 firms still set aside about two million pro bono hours each year, according to the Pro Bono Institute. Some firms are donating more money than ever to legal services organizations to compensate for their declining hours, while 21 of the top 100 firms have stepped up their volunteer efforts, or at least kept them from dwindling.
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which in 1999 became the first law firm to gross more than $1 billion in a year, now flies new associates to its headquarters in New York for a pro bono pep talk, gives public-service awards to high achievers and has expanded its placement of lawyers in community organizations for several months at a time. But the firm only began these initiatives after its pro bono hours started to slip in 1998.
"It wasn't a horrible downturn, but it was enough of one," said Ronald J. Tabak, the firm's pro bono coordinator. In the current climate, Mr. Tabak added, keeping up pro bono hours takes a concerted effort, since the demands of paying clients alone occupy far more than a 40-hour workweek and the competition for new lawyers has greatly intensified.
To pay for rising salaries, most firms have raised the minimum number of hours lawyers are expected to bill clients, yet often do not count pro bono work in the totals.
"We didn't want to be in a position where the associates would decide between doing their fee-paying work or not," said R. Bruce McLean, chairman of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Field in Washington. Last year, the firm decided not to credit pro bono time until lawyers billed at least 2,000 hours in a given year.
Some worry that such changes may chill lawyers' willingness to take pro bono cases. Michael Harris, assistant director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, says that lawyers who would otherwise take cases are unusually tentative this year, waiting to see how pro bono hours will be treated at bonus time. The cases they do take, he says, tend to be short and easy, lest the lawyers become stuck with long-term commitments that may end up counting against them. "If the people who did pro bono work get rewarded at the end of the year," he said, "the people who have been standing on the sidelines will come back."
But even when volunteer hours are, in theory, given equal weight, some associates feel that their careers will be better served by concentrating on paying clients and steering new business to the firm.
"It's a long race going up the partnership track," said Randi L. Strudler, a partner with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in New York. "Rightly or wrongly, not everyone values pro bono work the same as client work."
Since President Clinton asked asked lawyers last year to step up their volunteer service, there have been a number of initiatives to stimulate pro bono work.
One of the leading efforts, called Lawyers for One America, is composed of corporate law firms, law schools and bar associations nationwide. The group, based in San Francisco, seeks to draw from the growing ranks of business lawyers -- the largest segment of many large firms, particularly in Silicon Valley.
Because many corporate lawyers focus solely on transactions and never go to court, they often feel out of place handling the mainstays of pro bono work -- divorces, tenant-landlord disputes or social security cases. Officials at Lawyers for One America and other public interest groups hope to soften that discomfort by matching business lawyers with low-income people looking to start companies of their own.
But they say the concept is only starting to take root at firms, and some question whether the standing of pro bono work has diminished.
"The dollars are so astronomical that they're blinding people to public service," said Teveia R. Barnes, the group's executive director. "It does a disservice to the legal profession and our reputation."

Britain and Norway Rush To Aid Russian Submarine
Russian naval forces failed for a third day to dock a rescue vehicle onto the sunken submarine Kursk, and President Vladimir V. Putin ordered his military to accept Western offers of help. Britain sent a rescue submarine by air to Norway, from where it was to be sent to the rescue site. But hope was dimming for the submarine's 118 crew members. A1 

Reassessing Statehood Plan
Yasir Arafat said the Palestinian leadership was "reassessing" its plan to make a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on Sept. 13. That raised the possibility that the Palestinians would not, after all, take a step that Israel has said will end all prospects for an early peace agreement. A14

Ticket Is Set as Lieberman Sets the Stage for Gore
The Democratic National Convention nominated Al Gore for president, and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced himself to the American voter on prime-time television with a forceful appeal on behalf of his old friend and a muted attack on the Republican nominee, George W. Bush. A1
 
Senator Lieberman continued his efforts to win the full support of the party's liberal wing, and one of its prominent members, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, went before the New York delegation to praise the historic alliance between Jews and blacks. The moves occurred against a backdrop of grumbling by members of the party's traditional base about the centrist ticket and platform. A23
 
Mr. Gore tinkered with his speech, which he and his aides describe as a political self-portrait: heavy on personal biography, policy detail and a vision for the future, composed in his own hand and syntax. A22
 
Street protesters focused on accusations of corruption and brutality in the Los Angeles Police Department; one minor clash was observed. A23
 
Cheney's Potential Dilemma
Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, retired from Halliburton with millions in stock options that he cannot cash until long after the next administration takes office, the company said. Mr. Cheney had said he would sell his stake before he took office. But he will not be allowed to sell the options, leaving him, if elected, either to abandon the stake or hold a sizable interest in Halliburton's future while serving as vice president. A1
 
New Skin Cancer Is Diagnosed
Malignant melanoma, a potentially severe form of skin cancer, has been diagnosed on the left temple and arm of Senator John McCain, aides said. Mr. McCain, 63, was treated for malignant melanoma in 1993, when a mole was removed from his shoulder. A16

Officials Say Queens Clinic Operated Without Licenses
Officials closed a clinic that they said had no license -- nor licensed doctors -- but that claimed to have treated thousands of patients, mostly Chinese immigrants, with services ranging from herbal medicine to surgery. Six people were arrested. The clinic used three names, including the New York Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. B1
 
Findings on Subway Derailment
Investigators say a rusted rail that had cracked caused the No. 5 train derailment on April 12 that stranded 1,800 riders underground for more than two hours north of 59th Street. The rail problem was noticed almost a year earlier, but was never fixed, investigators say in a report. B3

HEADLINE: For Ferry Plans, 1 Nautical Mile Forward, 2 Back

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 16

 BODY:
Every so often a team of market researchers shows up at one or another Metro-North Railroad station to gauge commuters' interest in high-speed ferry service from Connecticut to New York City. And every once in a while, business and community leaders board a boat for a much-publicized test run, like the one in May from Stamford to East 34th Street, to show that the trip can be faster by water than by car or train.
But the vision of a ferry ride from Fairfield County to the financial district, without the clogged traffic on I-95 or a struggle through the harried crowds at Grand Central Terminal, remains unrealized. At least three different companies that are trying to make it a reality have encountered numerous obstacles, from difficulty in raising capital to regulatory bureaucracy to local concerns about parking. 
 One company, SeaConn L.L.C. of New Haven, which initially projected that its planned fleet of super-fast luxury ferries would be launched in the spring of 1999, now says that service will not begin until the end of 2001 or later. Another company, Lighthouse Landings Inc., which currently operates ferries between New York and New Jersey, had hoped to begin Connecticut service this summer but has postponed it until next May or June at the earliest.
And a third company, U.S. Multi-Hull Inc., which had been all set in late 1997 to start fast catamaran service from Norwalk to La Guardia Airport, has dropped that idea, at least for the time being. Instead, the company will focus on a potential ferry run between New Haven and Rye, N.Y., with four stops in between, for commuters who live in one suburb and work in another. But the company's owner, Dale Strand, said he had no idea when that service might begin -- if ever -- and that most likely it would not be profitable without a subsidy from the state.
"We have all been fighting the armies, haven't we," Mr. Strand said of himself and his struggling competitors. "Everybody has a different battlefront I guess." Mr. Strand's effort to start a Norwalk to La Guardia route was stymied by Norwalk officials. Concerned about traffic, parking and environmental problems near the city's Cove Marina, they threatened endless delays for zoning and other approvals.
For the president of SeaConn, Doren Voetch, who has the most ambitious plans, the battle has been raising capital to pay for his vision of a fleet of super-fast "pentamarans," boats built with five hulls for speed and stability. Each boat, with luxurious business class amenities, would cost about $22 million. Mr. Voetch said that he had finally found a backer to finance his first three boats, but that it had taken much longer than he had expected.
The text on the company's jazzy Web site, www.seaconn.com, is overly optimistic: "Coming in the Spring of 2001, the first major advance in transportation in the Connecticut/ Manhattan Corridor in 50 years."
"We're not going to make that," Mr. Voetch conceded. "The Web site has not been updated recently."
Now that the financing is in place, Mr. Voetch faces a barrage of details: legal documents to be drawn up, vendors to hire, bids to consider for building the boats. But the highest hurdle has been cleared, he said. "We have never been more certain that we are going to be in the water and operating."
For cities like Bridgeport and Stamford, the ferries offer easier commuting for residents who work in New York, but they could also make it feasible for residents of New York City or Long Island to take jobs in Connecticut without a miserable commute. And for companies with business relationships on both sides of Long Island Sound, the ferries would allow face-to-face meetings.
"When you look at the rest of the world, if you are in Hong Kong, if you are in Denmark, if you are in many parts of the world, ferry service is part of daily life," said Denis W. Patterson, Stamford's senior executive officer of economic development. "People use it. As a concept, we are very enthusiastic about it and it's been very well received by the business community. There is a tremendous level of excitement here."
Lighthouse Landings Inc. hopes to be the first company to offer Stamford-to-New York service. The company's president, Anthony Cappaze, said it had recently signed a contract with Derecktor Shipyard in Mamaroneck, N.Y., to build the first of three new boats for the Connecticut route.
In addition to the completion of its first new boat, Mr. Cappaze said, Lighthouse Landings was awaiting approval -- another source of potential delay -- from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on numerous issues, including its proposed dock in Stamford.
Mr. Cappaze said that his company's boats, which would hold up to 350 passengers, would travel at speeds of up to 40 knots, or 46 miles an hour. He expected the trip from Stamford to Wall Street would take about an hour, cutting as much as a half-hour off the trip each way for commuters who now take Metro-North and switch to the subway at Grand Central. A ticket for 40 trips would cost about $535, including parking, he estimated.
Mr. Voetch has even grander plans, with even faster boats. SeaConn's pentamarans, with a capacity similar to Lighthouse Landings' boats, have six engines each and are expected to travel at speeds of up to 72 knots, about 83 miles an hour. For a commuter from Fairfield, Conn., who now spends close to two hours getting to Lower Manhattan by train, the trip could be cut to about an hour, Mr. Voetch said; the trip from Stamford would be about 45 minutes.
Mr. Voetch said that a monthly ticket from Stamford would likely cost $637 including parking, but that the ticket would be good for unlimited rides throughout the month. By comparison, a monthly ticket for unlimited rides on Metro-North, for the same route, costs $218.
"We are really developing a whole new culture," Mr. Voetch said. "Our cheap seats are like business class on an airliner. The upper deck, the club deck, is a much higher level of service." He said he believed commuters would pay more to spend less time traveling.
"We're doing something entirely different," he said. "For the first time that I know of anywhere in the world, we are racing the cars and trains in the same direction that they are going and we are winning." Of course, they have to build the boats first.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: MAN IN THE NEWS;
Ever a Student of Politics and Policy; Albert Arnold Gore

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
After Al Gore ran for president in 1988 and lost, just as he turned 40, he organized a series of dinners at which he went around the room asking each person to tell him where he had gone wrong. What hadn't he known? What hadn't he done?
It was excruciating, his friends said, but he insisted on hearing the bad news -- in detail -- about a campaign that had started out as an environmental crusade and ended as a New York food fight between his surrogate, Mayor Edward I. Koch, and his one friend among the other candidates, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
 At dinner, he heard that he had no economic vision and that he had talked about technology and the environment in ways people could not understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton of work.
Mr. Gore responded, as he has at every critical moment of his life, by going back to school. He put together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus and a heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself to the serious study of tax policy and business history. He brought in a mathematician to explain chaos theory. And he hired a speech consultant and a dance coach -- "a ballet type," he told one friend -- to help him move more fluidly.
Politicians often learn from and are even transformed by a good drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued their lessons as aggressively as Mr. Gore. No one can say that the man who will accept the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency tonight has not diligently readied himself.
Yet all this extensive preparation has not always shown in the Gore campaign, which until recently has seemed surprisingly unfocused, at least in part because Mr. Gore has been training to govern from a young age but has always shown mixed feelings about politics.
"I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the campaigning: Vote for me! vote for me!" he says in a Spike Jonze documentary shot on his recent vacation in North Carolina.
He is a student by nature -- even after Vietnam, he treated his moral hangover with a year of divinity school, saying he wanted to impose some structure on the exercise. His extraordinary willingness to learn and change has taught him a lot, but it has also left him open to the rap that he is constantly reinventing himself.
Reinvention isn't all bad. In 1981, when Mr. Gore became concerned about where the cold war was headed, he turned himself into a bona fide arms-control expert in a single year by plunging into the arcana of a subject he had previously known next to nothing about. In the 1990's, he was out front in learning about issues no one else was paying much mind, like information technology and global warming.
"His education is ongoing," said his Harvard friend Tommy Lee Jones. "Where 20 years ago he would have made outlines with Roman numerals, now it would look like rectangles on top of each other, equally well organized but not so linear, and probably three-dimensional."
Yet this quality has been nothing but trouble in the current campaign. Much of the coverage has dwelled on Mr. Gore's small but symbolic personal alterations, like his new Palm Pilot and his switch from dark suits to earth tones. The changes themselves are insignificant, but resonate because they remind many people of his shifts on issues like gun control and abortion.
It is the same story with Mr. Gore's work ethic -- something Americans profess to love. He was so determined to shoehorn extra work into his day as a senator that during weekends of back-to-back town hall meetings he would get himself booked in two places at the same time -- a trick that was possible, barely, because there are two time zones in Tennessee.
He adored the illusion of time-bending, a former aide said. "I'd tell him, 'You just missed 400 people in Knoxville because we crossed back to some backwater county to see three people.' And he'd say, 'Yeah, but we get an extra hour.' "
Mr. Gore is someone who makes all his hard work look like . . . hard work. Lacking the smooth moves of either his boss, Bill Clinton, or his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. Gore is a plodder, who hopes to be a tortoise to Mr. Bush's hare.
But there is more going on than raw effort. Mr. Gore's intellect and the willingness to use it are probably his most important assets. His Harvard mentor, the presidential scholar Richard Neustadt, has said that compared with American presidents in the last century, probably only Theodore Roosevelt had a keener mind. Mr. Gore's friends often see him as a visionary.
His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said, "He likes to ask, 'What's the assumption here? What if we subvert it?' and one of the things he could maybe do well if he wins the job is make new connections, like between the economy and the environment, and ask, 'What if we were the leading exporter of ways to clean up the environment?' "
Those are not the kind of connections that crowds thrill to, though. All Mr. Gore's intelligence and dexterity with facts do not necessarily help him sway the public with feeling -- something he knows all too well.
One senior member of the Clinton administration says that the interesting thing about watching Mr. Gore in a meeting is the way he reasons deductively, rather than inductively, relying less than most other politicians on anecdotes and more on all that is known about a given topic. Again, this is both a strength and a failing. While he is able to analyze options dispassionately, he does not seem to understand fully how important human stories are in communicating about policy with the public.
Mr. Gore is genuinely in love with the world of ideas, loves nothing more than a good back and forth about the multiverse, and apparently sees how fractal geometry might improve our lives.
He is a sucker for fun facts, too -- and always alert for openings to share them. During his campaign visits to schools, he has delivered spontaneous lectures on the ice ages, the industrial revolution and the human genome.
In a recent interview in his car, while heading to a fund-raiser in the Hamptons, he started to explain how Long Island was formed, then stopped himself. At another point in the ride, he cried, "Look at that!" and pointed to a sign about an exhibition called "Black Whalers."
"Do you know about the black whalers?" he asked, very excited, and went on to tell the history of African-Americans in Sag Harbor. "I'm hoping they can find somewhere for me to go to church here tomorrow, but my staff wants me to go to a diner instead," he said, making a face. "Better pictures," he added, and rolled his eyes. (In the end, he went to the church.)
He seems to have quite a rich emotional life -- is clearly still over the moon for Tipper Gore, his wife of 30 years, and enviably close to their four children. By all accounts, he is someone who actually listens to his friends when they have had a bad day or a family problem.
He is also big on small gestures, like having a neatly pressed, beautifully boxed $5 bill delivered to a consultant, Robert Shrum, in his London hotel room last year after losing a bet about whether another top aide, Carter Eskew, was planning to propose to his girlfriend. (Mr. Gore bet against true love and lost.)
Still, he struggles with the kinds of connections that most city council members find effortless.
In a recent stop in New York, where he had just appeared on NBC's "Today" show, he was working one end of a crowd at Rockefeller Center as Al Roker, the weatherman, worked the other. It wasn't a fair matchup, because Mr. Roker had a camera crew in tow, but the crowd did seem more enthusiastic about meeting the other Al.
Except for one middle-aged woman, who was jumping up and down and clearly could not wait to greet the vice president. Yet when he reached her, he not only failed to milk the moment, he raced through it -- his eyes instinctively, and much too quickly, cutting to the next person on the rope line, in search of someone who was not quite as eager to meet him.
 
Complications and Contradictions
At 52, Albert Arnold Gore is without question a complicated man. He is a native of Washington, born there on March 31, 1948. And through his father, he met the men who ran the world. Senator Albert Gore was an up-from-nothing child of the Depression whose stands for civil rights and against the war in Vietnam were out of sync with his Tennessee constituents and lost him his seat in 1970. Yet young Al Gore had something of a double life even in the capital, where he attended elite St. Alban's prep school, but dressed in a cousin's hand-me-downs. He shared a bedroom with his sister, Nancy, who was 10 years older, in a four-room hotel suite because it was owned by a relative who gave his family a break on the rent.
He is also a real Tennessean, who spent summers there, working hard on the family farm, and while there made his closest friends, many of whom remain in his life.
He is someone who prays over meals and quotes the Bible. But he is also devoted to science, and spends the time in the helicopter en route to Air Force Two reading magazines like Nature, Science and Discover.
Some of his most deeply felt positions -- in support of both free trade and the labor unions, for example -- create political contradictions. And sometimes, he seems to be fighting himself as much as he is Mr. Bush.
He can be an incredibly careful man, yet sometimes has been unusually willing to make himself vulnerable, as he did in writing "Earth in the Balance," a confessional manifesto in which he ties man's mistreatment of the environment to a lack of deep connection in dysfunctional families.
One knock against Mr. Gore is that he has not shown himself to be sufficiently human. But it may be that he has shown himself to be all too human, someone who does sweat the small stuff and is cursed with a level of self-awareness that does not appear to trouble Mr. Bush.
Recently, there was a million-dollar party in the Hamptons in his honor.
Fireworks were planned, but they started badly. Mr. Gore had already turned to leave when they suddenly erupted into a splendid celestial spectacle. He wandered out onto the lawn, alone, for a better look.
For much of the show he stood there, his silhouette rigid and even lonely against the blazing sky. Only when the model Christie Brinkley playfully started snapping his picture did he seem to realize he was supposed to look as if he was having a good time.
And from remarks he made later, it was clear that he had been thinking about his quest to become president and whether he was falling short. As he bid farewell to his hosts and guests, who had paid $10,000 each to have dinner with him, he drew a pointed analogy between the initial fizzle of the fireworks and his own trajectory.
"I know that some of you were feeling momentarily disappointed with the fireworks," he said. "Some of you felt let down. Some were even heartbroken. But you believed it was going to happen, and it did. And I know that during this campaign, some of you have felt like there were times when you wondered how it was going to go."
This time, the vice president pulled himself back from the brink of further reflection and promised to do better from then on.
But in a life of constant movement and all-too-brief, good-to-see-you, good-to-see-you encounters, he is unusually reflective, and someone who applies the language of psychology to his understanding of the world.
A decade ago, after his 6-year-old son ran into the street and was hit by a car right in front of him, Mr. Gore did what one friend called "psychotherapy by correspondence course" -- trying to puzzle through his life by reading and listening to personal development tapes.
He passed out copies of psychological texts he had been especially struck by, including "How People Change," by Allen Wheelis.
In it, the author describes how he developed anxiety attacks after his cruelly demanding father made him cut their lawn with a hand razor. It is impossible to read it without thinking of the summer that Mr. Gore's father put him through an equally pointless character-building exercise, making him clear 20 hilly acres with a hand ax.
The job would have taken just a few hours with a bulldozer, as Mr. Gore's high school girlfriend in Tennessee, Donna Armistead, remembers it. "One day I stopped by and he had got in a nest of hornets. The poor guy was eaten up, but it didn't matter," she said bitterly. "His dad said it had to be done."
Even now, amid the craziness of the campaign, Mr. Gore is a highly interior person, who can withdraw deep inside himself quite suddenly. He loved the dark, out-there movie "Being John Malkovich." (Mr. Bush says the last movie he enjoyed in a theater was "Forrest Gump.") One relative describes Mr. Gore as "very edgy" in a business that does not award a lot of points for edge.
Asked if Mr. Gore had seemed happy as a student at Harvard, where he was, after all, facing service in Vietnam, his mentor, Mr. Neustadt, said: "I'd have called him an intellectually interested kid, a questioning, pondering kid. In social situations, he was pleasant and capable of enjoyment, but happy? There were always a lot of issues Al was concerned about morally. I wouldn't have called him happy."
 
Confidence in Leadership
Yet he does not seem to suffer from a lack of confidence; this is a man who applied only to Harvard because it never occurred to him that he would not get in. When he became a reporter, he seems to have assumed he would follow in the footsteps of David Halberstam, a friend of his sister's, who had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Gore ran for Congress at 28 and began mounting his first presidential campaign only 10 years later. Had he been elected, he would have been the youngest American president in history.
It turned out that he wasn't ready, and he ended up an observer in his own campaign, watching it fall apart as Mr. Koch, waged a public feud with Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Gore said in a recent interview about that time in his life: "The statements made by Mayor Koch took me by surprise. I had no advance notice, was not happy about it and didn't handle it very well."
Yet Mr. Gore himself had snidely knocked Mr. Jackson, saying the country was electing a president, not a preacher. Mr. Gore was soon overwhelmed with guilt, horrified in particular by the racial implications of the Koch-Jackson fight, something he should have known about before seeking an alliance with Mr. Koch. In the campaign's final days, Mr. Gore was asking Mr. Jackson's forgiveness almost every night.
Why would anyone have believed he was ready for the White House at such a young age?
Mr. Gore had been a virtual grown-up since he was a child, expected to perform in the company of important adults. He had seen the nation's leaders up close, and had not been daunted.
In his first Senate term, he was already bored. And he simply could not wait to lead, he said, to take the country where he felt it ought to go.
His father was pushing him, even playing on his emotions by saying he wanted to see his boy elected president before he died. But aides say he was at least as influenced by the simple availability of cash from the party's money men, once it became clear that neither Mario M. Cuomo nor Dale Bumpers would make the race. And his head was turned by the media -- Washington reporters who could not get enough of him.
Not quite two years after he was elected to the Senate, the talk show host John McLaughlin said this in an interview: "You've got the magical name -- Al Gore. Your father was in Congress for 32 years. You've got character, you've got no clay feet, no skeletons showing. You're intelligent. You're well-informed. You've got a Vietnam War record. You've been an investigative reporter, and you've got religious coloration, too.
"For one year you were a divinity student, and you're a devout Baptist.
"You're almost too good to be true. Are you too good to be true?"
(Mr. Gore's answer, for the record: "I don't know.")
 
The Clinton Factor
Bill Clinton's impeachment and Mr. Gore's own role in the fund-raising scandals of recent years took care of that perception, of course. Mr. Gore was criticized for the fund-raising phone calls he made from the White House and his attendance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles in 1996.
And he cannot say his mother never warned him about hooking up with Mr. Clinton.
Back in the mid-80's, James Fleming, a Nashville physician who was for a time the family doctor, remembers a conversation at the family farm in Carthage about Mr. Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, who had just visited Nashville.
Mr. Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, who like her husband grew up poor and put herself through law school, has often been considered the political brains in the family. And on this occasion, she was adamant. "She said he had bad moral character," Dr. Fleming said. "She said, 'Bill Clinton is not a nice person. You shouldn't associate too closely with him.' "
Yet Mr. Gore went on the ticket with Mr. Clinton, he says, because he thought he could help: "I thought I could make a difference, and maybe the difference."
And he makes it clear that he listened to his mama, whom he calls every day.
"This guy's done a great job by and large and has strengths I don't," he said in the car the other day. "But then, I have strengths he doesn't."
Recently, he added a line to his stump speech: "I won't let you down." The subtext being, of course, that certain others had.
But the phrase also reflects an important truth about Mr. Gore. He was made responsible for his parents' hopes from an early age, and was raised not to let his family down. He often talks about his work and his life in a way that suggests he defines himself as someone people are depending on.
"He's trying to be a good night watchman," a relative of Mr. Gore's said. "That's the kind of president he would be."
Yet because of his ambivalence about politics, in some past races he has seemed focused only in the final stages of the campaign, on deadline, like the former news reporter he is. There is typically a last-minute flurry of "new Al Gore" stories, detailing his metamorphosis from lackluster to "newly energized" campaigner. And aides certainly hope they see that beginning now, as he bonds with his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
On Long Island the other day, Mr. Gore gave his own theory about the stories that begin, "In yet another attempt to reinvent himself today. . . ." He said reporters sensed that he was discarding the vice presidential voice of nearly eight years, and heard his newly presidential voice "as trying to be something they don't think I am."
"They feel a dissonance that shows up in their interpretation of what I say, how I look, my mannerisms. What they see is very different from what they're certain I am. I'm not being dishonest, though, and neither are they.
"It won't stay that way, though," he predicted. "Whether people who go through it admit it or not, it's a growth experience," he said, referring to the wild ride of a presidential run. "It's a transformative process."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
In Speech, Lieberman Offers a Vision of America Through the Eyes of Others

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
Is America a great country, or what? Yes it is. God bless America, land that we love. 
 Dear friends, 10 days ago, with courage and with friendship, Al Gore asked me to be his running mate. And I don't have to tell you that this has been a most extraordinary week for my family and me. . . .
In my life, I've seen the goodness of this great country through many sets of eyes. I've seen it through the eyes of my grandmother. She was raised in Central Europe, in a village where she was often harassed just because of the way she worshiped God. And then she immigrated to America.
On Saturdays, she used to walk to synagogue and her Christian neighbors would pass her and say, "Good Sabbath, Mrs. Manger."
Well it was a source of endless delight and gratitude for her that here in this country, she was accepted for who she was.
And I've seen America through the eyes of my parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman. My dad lived in an orphanage when he was a child. He went on to work in a bakery truck and then owned a package store in Stamford, Conn. He taught my sisters and me the importance of work and responsibility. With my mother by his side, he saw me become the first person in my family to graduate from college.
My mom is here tonight. Mom is 85 years old but I'll tell you, she never felt younger than she feels today. Mom, thank you, I love you and you and I know how proud Pop would be tonight. Yes we do love you, Mom.
And I've also tried to see America through the eyes of people I've been privileged to know.
In the early 1960's, when I was a college student, I walked with Martin Luther King in the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. That was my honor, that was my opportunity. And later that fall, I went to Mississippi, where we worked to register African-Americans to vote. The people I met never forgot that in America, every time a barrier is broken the doors of open opportunity go wider for every single one of us. And I know that in a very personal way tonight.
And I've tried to see America through the eyes of families who had the deck stacked against them, but fought back.
As Connecticut's attorney general, I worked to be the people's lawyer. I went after polluters who were spoiling our water and our air. I stood with single moms to go after deadbeat dads. And you know what? We even sued oil companies who were trying to gouge consumers at the pump. Yes we did.
We're going to go right to the White House for a better America.
And I've also seen America through the eyes of my wife and her parents. By now, most of you probably know Hadassah's story. Her family was literally saved by the greatest generation of American G.I.'s, who liberated the concentration camps. We could never express our gratitude enough to them. And then her parents escaped Communism and were welcomed as immigrants to America and given a new life.
The fact that a half century later, their daughter would be standing on this stage is a testament to the continuing power of the American Dream.
And in my life I have also tried to see this world through the eyes of those who have suffered discrimination.
And that's why I believe that the time has come to tear down the remaining walls of discrimination in this nation, walls of discrimination based on race and gender and sexual orientation. And we will. Together we will. And that also is why I continue to say, when it comes to affirmative action, mend it but please don't end it.
You know, when we see the world through the other, through the eyes of other people, you understand that the smallest changes can make the biggest differences in all of our lives.
That's something I'm really sorry to say I don't think our Republican friends really understand. You know, they're fond of dismissing the achievements, the extraordinary achievements of the past eight years. But I'll tell you, at the end of the day the people I talk with, the real people on the street, tell me that their lives are a lot better than they were eight years ago. And they want it to continue. They want the prosperity to continue.
Our opponents are decent and they are likable men. I'm proud to call many in their party my friends. But America must understand there are very real differences between us in this election.
Two weeks ago, our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us. Did you notice? Yeah.
But let's be honest about this, we may be near Hollywood but not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia. It's the truth. You bet I'm going to keep going.
Now look, I'm glad that the G.O.P. has changed their rhetoric, but you know what? I wish they would also change their policies.
As my dear friend John McCain might say, and let me say great man John McCain, you are in our prayers here in this hall tonight. You're a great fighter and you're going to win the fight you're waging now. As John McCain might say, let me do a little straight talking right now.
You know, I think it's a good thing that our opponent talks about the environment. But I'm sad to say that in Texas, the quality of the air and water is some of the worst in America.
We see the environment through a different set of eyes. For more than 20 years Al Gore has been a leader in protecting our environment.
And I promise you that we will continue the work that he and I have done together to keep our air, water and land clean. We're going to work to make sure that a child can drink a glass of water, a father can fish in a stream and a family can go to a park without having to worry that their health and safety is at risk. I make you that promise tonight.
And look, it's a good thing that our opponent is talking about health care.
But I'm sad to say that Texas is also falling behind on that. You know, Texas led the nation in the percentage of residents who did not have insurance. And today, it ranks next to last for health insurance for both women and children.
We see health care with a different set of eyes.
We know that health care is one of the most important problems facing America's family today. We believe that medical decisions should be made by doctors, not bureaucrats. We believe that senior citizens should not be stopped from filling a prescription in this great country of ours because they can't afford to pay for it. And I tell you tonight that Al Gore and I are the only candidates in this race who will extend access to health care coverage to every single child in America. Yes we will.
And you know, I think it's a good thing also that our opponent talks about education.
Schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan just doesn't provide the resources our schools need to meet those high standards. You know, sometimes it seems to me like their idea of school modernization means buying a new calendar for every school building.
We see education through a very different set of eyes.
We are committed to making America's public schools the very best in the world. We're committed.
We're going to target more education funding to the schools that need it most, to rebuild and modernize our crumbling classrooms and to provide all of our children, all of God's children with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st Century. And my friends, we're going to do one other thing that our Republican friends will simply not do: we are going to treat the people who teach our children like the professionals that they are. No one does a more important job in our country today than a good teacher of our children.
Now look, in the end this is a question of priorities. This is a question of priorities and choices.
Our opponents want to use America's hard-earned surplus to give a tax break to those who need it least at the expense of all our other needs.
Under their plan, the middle class gets a little and the wealthy get an awful lot.
As a matter of fact, their tax plan operates under that old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse. Think about that.
We see, we see America's hard-earned surplus through a very different set of eyes, the eyes of working middle-class families.
We want to use America's hard-earned success to preserve the future of Social Security and Medicare, to pay off our national debt, to cut the taxes of middle-class families. We want to make the investments that will keep our economy moving forward. My friends, it is this simple: we Democrats will expand the prosperity; they will squander it.
And let me say one other thing about the difference between our parties in this election. This party will reform our campaign finance laws, because it's only Al Gore and not George Bush who will send the McCain-Feingold bill to Congress and sign it when it's passed.
Now let me just speak to those of you at home who have not made up your mind yet about how you're going to vote in this election. And I hope you'll think of it this way: if you want to build on our prosperity, if you want progress not partisanship in Washington, if you want to reform the system and not retreat from the problems, then I respectfully say to you, your choice is clear. Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job. . . .
Al Gore is also a man of courage and conviction. He believes in service to America. He volunteered for Vietnam.
Together, Al and I crossed party lines to support the gulf war.
I was there in the room when I heard him forcefully argue that America's principles and interests were at stake in Bosnia and Kosovo. And that wasn't easy. He had the guts to do it.
Two weeks ago, our opponent claimed that America has a hollow military.
I must tell you that that made me angry.
America, you know better than that. Our fighting men and women are the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful fighting force in the history of the world, and they will stay that way when Al Gore and I are elected. You can count on it.
And Al Gore is also a man of vision and a man of values.
Long before it became popular you know, Al and Tipper led a crusade to renew the moral center of this nation, to call America to its highest ideals.
He knows that many Americans have a swelling sense that our standards of decency and civility have eroded.
And he believes as I do that no parent in America should be forced to compete with popular culture to raise their children.
For his entire career, Al Gore's values have guided the way he meets the challenges that lie ahead.
That's why I hope you will conclude, you at home, as I have, that for his honesty, for his strength, for his integrity and for his character, Al Gore must become the next president of the United States.
It was 40 years ago when we came to this city and together crossed a new frontier with a leader who inspired me and so many in my generation into public service.
Today, we return to this same great city with prosperity at home and freedom throughout the world that John F. Kennedy could have only dreamed about.
We may wonder tonight where the next frontier really is.
Tonight, I believe that the next frontier isn't just in front of us but inside of us. To overcome the differences that are still between us, to break down the barriers that remain and to help every American claim the possibilities of their own God-given lives.
You know, sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from that bakery truck. Right about this time of day, he'd be getting ready for the all-night run.
And I know that somewhere in America right now there's another father loading another bakery truck, or a young woman programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for their daughter or their son.
My friends, if we keep the faith, then 40 years from now, one of their children will stand before a gathering like this as I am tonight with the chance to serve and lead this great country that we love so dearly. That's what America is about.
So, let us work together to make sure that they will be able to look back to this time, and this stage and this place and say of our generation: they kept the faith.
Let them say that we helped them realize their hopes and their dreams.
And let them look around at this great and good nation that we are all so blessed by God to share, and say: Only in America. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE OVERVIEW;
LIEBERMAN SETS STAGE FOR GORE AS DEMOCRATS SEAL THE TICKET

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Albert Arnold Gore Jr., who steadfastly served as vice president through an often tumultuous eight years, was nominated for president tonight after his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced himself to America with a forceful appeal on behalf of Mr. Gore and a muted rebuke of Gov. George W. Bush.
Mr. Lieberman, whose selection as Mr. Gore's running mate made him the first Jew on a major party ticket, delivered a personal testament to the vice president, saying they were so close that they prayed together. 
 "Al Gore is a man of courage and conviction," Mr. Lieberman said. "He believes in service to America. He volunteered for Vietnam. Together, we crossed party lines to support the Gulf war. I was there in the room when I heard him forcefully argue that America's principles and interests were at stake in Bosnia and Kosovo. That wasn't easy. He had the guts to do it." Excerpts, Page A26.
In the ceremonial, but joyous, roll-call of states to ratify Mr. Gore's nomination, Florida put him over the top just before midnight E.D.T., surpassing the 2,170 votes needed for the nomination. The Democrats were signaling their intention to make Florida a battleground in November.
Shortly before the actual vote, the hall exploded in chants of "We want Gore!" when the vice president, unannounced, stepped briskly on stage from a submerged stairway to embrace his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, after she seconded his nomination with a personal testament to her father. After waving to the roars of the more than 4,000 delegates, the Vice President strolled off stage with his daughter.
The address by Mr. Lieberman, who will formally be nominated on Thursday, was one of the most anticipated, and consequential, moments of the four-night convention. The Gore campaign has counted on the senator to electrify the ticket of a standard bearer who has struggled to galvanize even loyal Democratic voters.
Another reason for all the interest in Mr. Lieberman -- who was introduced by his wife, Hadassah, tonight as "just a regular Joe" -- is that when he was plucked by Mr. Gore eight days ago he was virtually unknown beyond his home state of Connecticut.
Though he has been a senator for 12 years, Mr. Lieberman, who is 58, is not nearly as tested on the national stage as Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who had served as a Congressman, White House chief of staff and secretary of defense.
Mr. Lieberman dutifully took on Mr. Bush and the Republicans, but without the hard edge of Mr. Cheney, who in his own acceptance speech two weeks ago at the Republican convention in Philadelphia bitterly ridiculed Mr. Gore and President Clinton.
"It's this simple," Mr. Lieberman said flatly. "We Democrats will expand the prosperity. They will squander it."
Mr. Lieberman's half-hour address was less a traditional attack on the opposition and more an American tale of the senator's life story. As Mr. Lieberman stepped to the rostrum, the hall swelled with music from the film "Chariots of Fire" -- the story of two track stars, a Jew who fought anti-Semitism to win an Olympic medal and a Christian who refused the importunings of the King of England to run on the Sabbath.
While he said he was embarking on "a miraculous journey," Mr. Lieberman first reached back to his own family's odyssey.
Then, Mr. Lieberman remembered his grandmother.
"She was raised in Central Europe," he said, "in a village where she was often harassed because of the way she worshiped God. And then she immigrated to America."
He moved on to his parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman. "My father lived in an orphanage when he was a child," Mr. Lieberman said. "He went on to work in a bakery truck and then owned a package store in Stamford, Conn. He taught my sisters and me the importance of work and responsibility."
Turning to his mother in the audience, he said, "Mom is 85 years old, but I'll tell you, she never felt younger than she feels today."
He progressed to the 1960's, describing himself as an early champion of civil rights. He was seeking to establish his credentials as a champion of minorities because of concerns among some black delegates that he did not adequately support affirmative action.
"In the early 1960's, when I was a college student," he said, "I walked with Martin Luther King in the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. That was my honor. That was my opportunity."
As attorney general of Connecticut, he said, "I worked to be the people's lawyer. I went after polluters who were spoiling our water and our air."
Then he spoke of Hadassah, his wife, whose family, he said, was "literally saved by the greatest generation of American G.I.'s who liberated the concentration camps."
While his delivery was earnest yet unadorned, it drew enthusiastic applause from the delegates. And his effort to reassure African Americans -- he was proceeded on stage by Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero -- seemed to meet with some success.
"He talked about his civil rights record," said Virginia Rollins, a black delegate from Virginia. "If anyone had doubts about where he stood, he took care of that tonight."
Beyond telling his story, Mr. Lieberman drew contrasts between his party and the Republicans. And he skipped over the fact that he is viewed as hewing to more moderate positions on a range of issues than Mr. Gore.
Taking a shot at the Republicans who gathered in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Mr. Lieberman said, "Our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us. But let's be honest. We may be near Hollywood. But not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia."
Mr. Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a likely choice for Mr. Gore still seemed a bit fazed by his newfound celebrity and, perhaps, that Mr. Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it in his opening line, "Is America a great country or what?"
Before the program opened, Mr. Gore arrived here triumphantly, stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with Mr. Lieberman and their families. Only a day after President Clinton embraced Mr. Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.
"In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward to the future," Mr. Gore declared. "Let others argue the case for the old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive change to the United States of America."
Even if manufactured, the suspense today was inside the Staples Center. While Mr. Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over the top five months ago, this remained a night of triumph -- and, at long last, emergence -- for him. He represented Tennessee in the House for nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been best known for his eight years of service to President Clinton.
While his speech was not devoted to critiquing the opposition, as was Mr. Cheney's, Mr. Lieberman did scold Republicans for putting forth what he portrayed as a misleading festival of inclusion at its convention.
"I'm glad that the G.O.P. has changed their rhetoric," he said, "but I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend John McCain might say, let me do a little straight talking" about their record.
"It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education," Mr. Lieberman said. "Schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan just doesn't provide the resources our schools need to meet those high standards."
Despite Mr. Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley and his high-profile assignments from Mr. Clinton, like running a program to streamline the federal government, the vice president remains a bit of a mystery to the electorate.
It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Mr. Gore as remote and hard to warm to. But Ms. Schiff, one of Mr. Gore's closest political advisers, sought to alter that perception by describing a sweet and conscientious Al Gore that the public does not know.
"When my dad was a Congressman, he listed our number in the phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always reach him," Ms. Schiff said, seconding Mr. Gore's nomination. "During my summers on the farm, I would answer the phone, and it would often be a constituent who needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or finding the right health care. I was taught to run -- not walk -- to get my dad so that people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment."
Mr. Gore's name was put in nomination by Tommy Lee Jones, the actor who was one of his roommates at Harvard. Mr. Jones also tried to warm up Mr. Gore's image by attesting to the Gores' relationship, "To this day," he said, "when they come to our house, they sit in each other's laps. They hold hands. They even smooch occasionally -- like the kids they have always been."
Robert Rubin, a treasury secretary under Mr. Clinton, saluted Mr. Gore for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. "I worked with Al Gore for six and a half years," he said. "And he was a powerful and effective force in all of the major economic policy decisions that contributed so critically to this record. I was there."
In the short term, at least, Mr. Lieberman brought the Democrats a wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention. By turning to Mr. Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to aggressively repudiate President Clinton for his affair with a White House intern, Mr. Gore underscored his determination to shed the shadow of Mr. Clinton.
In interviews in the convention hall today, dozens of delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about Mr. Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even thrilled, as they learned more about him.
Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman selection.
"Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in the shop watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being nominated," she said. "The supply man came in and said it was incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of it."
 
TV Coverage Today
Vice President Al Gore will deliver his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention about 10 tonight. It will be carried live on ABC, CBS, CNN, C-Span, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, NBC, NY1 and PBS.

ALBANY: FIRE CLOSES BUILDINGS
Two state office buildings were evacuated yesterday after an electrical fire filled them with smoke. Nine hundred people working for various state agencies have offices in the two 23-story towers across from the Capitol, but it is unclear how many were in the building. Peter Constantakes, a spokesman for the Office of General Services, said the fire started around 2 p.m. in the basement of one tower, as workers carried out routine maintenance on electric cables. He said three people were treated at Albany Medical Center for minor injuries. No time was given for the buildings to reopen. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: VOLPE CHALLENGE DENIED
A federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday rejected the challenge of a former police officer, Justin A. Volpe, left, to his 30-year prison term for assaulting Abner Louima. A court panel said that Mr. Volpe's arguments -- one of which was that he had accepted responsibility for his crime -- had no merit. Marvyn Kornberg, Mr. Volpe's lawyer, said he would ask the full appellate court to reconsider, would appeal to the United States Supreme Court or would return to Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, the trial judge. Alan Feuer (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: 3 INDICTED IN WEB SWINDLE
Three New York men have been indicted on charges that they stole $5.5 million from more than 200 investors who thought they were financing an Internet gem dealership and art gallery, federal authorities said yesterday. The men sent the money to overseas accounts and spent some of it in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, according to a two-count indictment filed by the United States attorney's office and a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ruslan Rapoport will plead not guilty, his lawyer said. Lawyers for the other defendants, Igor and Edward Landenbaum of Brooklyn, who are brothers, declined to comment. Leslie Eaton (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: WOMAN KILLED BY TRUCK
An 80-year-old woman was killed yesterday when a produce truck struck her near 20th Street and Ninth Avenue, the police said. A friend of the family said that the woman, Faye Schreiber, was walking from her apartment on Ninth Avenue to a center for the elderly. The truck, a 1996 Chevrolet van registered to the Geko Corporation, collided with a 1996 Nissan, the police said, then spun around and struck Ms. Schreiber. The two drivers and three passengers from the car were taken to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition. Elissa Gootman (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: H.M.O. SUIT DISMISSED
A federal judge has dismissed the state's lawsuit against Physicians Health Services. The lawsuit, filed in December, asserted that Physicians Health Services, Connecticut's largest H.M.O., pressured patients to use company-preferred drugs instead of doctor-prescribed medication that could be more effective. The lawsuit also charged that in determining which drugs to cover, the company judged by price instead of quality. The suit raised "legitimate and serious" concerns, Judge Stefan R. Underhill said, but a federal statute prohibits Connecticut from suing H.M.O.'s. An appeal is planned. (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: 911 CENTER INVESTIGATED
The arrest of a Hartford police dispatcher charged with releasing secret computer data to her imprisoned husband has prompted a complete review of the operations of the state's busiest municipal 911 center. Hartford's acting police chief, Robert S. Rudewicz, said that an inspection of the dispatch center had already been planned, but that accusations charging the dispatcher, Arlene Davila, with conveyig information while on duty to her husband, Jose Davila, a convicted drug dealer, had accelerated that plan. (NYT)
 
ELLINGTON: TORNADO HITS, BUT NO ONE IS HURT
A tornado touched down in Ellington early yesterday afternoon, lifting trailers and damaging a cow barn, but injuring no one. The tornado was classified as an F1, or a moderate tornado, said Dave Henry, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. Winds were between 72 and 112 miles per hour, he said. Mr. Henry said the tornado's path was 1 1/2 miles long and 40 yards wide. It started in a field and moved across a road and into a grassy lot filled with show trailers. Witnesses reported hearing loud noises and feeling strong winds. Some said they saw a funnel cloud. The winds were strong enough to lift a 1,300-pound trailer 30 feet in the air and drop it back on the ground.

NEWARK: AIRPORT CRIME DOWN
Crime at Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports dropped 13 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. Crimes like luggage theft and auto theft dropped 31.4 percent at Newark, 8.7 percent at La Guardia, and 4.2 percent at Kennedy. The chief of the Port Authority police, Fred V. Morrone, attributed the declines to the effectiveness of the security force as well as to the strong economy and high employment rates, which experts cite for a decline in crime nationally. Ronald Smothers (NYT)
 
NEWARK: LENDING PRACTICES CRITICIZED
New Jersey residents are complaining of being lured into costly financing arrangements by unscrupulous contractors, and of being required by lenders to pay higher interest rates than originally promised, according to testimony at public hearings arranged by the State Banking and Insurance Department. Consumer advocates, like New Jersey Citizen Action, called on the department to support legislation to crack down on such practices. Banks and other lenders said that more regulation was unnecessary.

SADDLE RIVER: RAPPER'S FATHER FOUND
Two days after he was reported missing, the father of the hip-hop performer Wyclef Jean, left, reappeared, but without a public explanation for his absence. The Rev. Gesner Jean, 59, pastor of the Good Shepherd Church of the Nazarene, failed to return home on Sunday, and on Tuesday a relative called the police. Mr. Gesner was found at the family's home and taken to Valley Hospital in Ridgewood. Investigators do not suspect foul play, Police Chief Robert Re said. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)

HEADLINE: Differences Found in Care With Stepmothers

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Children raised in families with stepmothers are likely to have less health care, less education and less money spent on their food than children raised by their biological mothers, three studies by a Princeton economist have found.
The studies examined the care and resources that parents said they gave to children and did not assess the quality of the relationships or the parents' feelings and motives. 
 But experts said that while the findings did not establish the image of the wicked stepmother as true, they supported the conclusion that, for complex reasons, stepmothers do invest less in children than biological mothers do, with fathers, to a large extent, leaving to women the responsibility for the family's welfare.
"Being raised by the biological mother gives children a lot of protection," said the chief researcher on the studies, Anne Case, a professor of economics at Princeton. "It's a very big thing to ask someone to care for children instead of the birth mother, who, as the sociobiologists tell us, invests so heavily in carrying the child, nursing the child."
The studies took their data from two of the broadest, most respected surveys of Americans' households, income, spending and health habits. While those surveys were not created to analyze stepfamilies, their information is detailed enough to allow comparisons between different kinds of families.
Among children over a year old, living with both biological parents, the health study found that 61 percent have had a medical checkup within the last year. But among those living with a stepmother and birth father, that number dropped to 46 percent -- and of those whose biological mother was dead, only 35 percent had seen a doctor.
Of the children living with their biological parents, 74 percent wear seat belts almost all the time, compared with 63 percent of those living with a stepfather and biological mother and 52 percent of those living with a biological father and stepmother.
Families with a stepmother reported overall household food spending that was about 5 percent lower for each stepchild than in families in which both biological parents were present, the food study found.
In families in which women care for both their stepchildren and biological children, the biological child, on average, went to college for a year, while the average stepchild did not go to college.
Children reared by a stepfather also have lower educational achievement than those reared by both biological parents, although, as in most other measures, the negative effect is only about half as much as with stepmothers.
Prof. Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist of the family at the University of Pennsylvania, said that he did not question the findings and believed that the studies raised important questions, but he noted that stepfamilies vary widely.
For example, women who take on a 2-year-old child step into a role very different from that of women who care for a 12-year-old stepchild, and for all stepmothers the relationships evolve as the family becomes better established.
"I don't think most stepmothers are evil," Professor Furstenberg said. "If they're less involved, if they take a step back, it may be for the most noble motives, to give the parent more room, to decrease the tension. They may be relying on the child's father when perhaps their trust is unwarranted."
With more than half the nation's children living apart from at least one biological parent by the time they reach 18, the functioning of stepfamilies has become increasingly important. Most stepfamilies involve stepfathers, rather than stepmothers, and compared with families in which a single mother is rearing a child alone, the presence of the stepfather and his income help raise the family's standard of living.
Still, previous research has shown that children who did not live with both of their parents had bleaker futures: among other things, they were more likely to drop out of school, become delinquents or engage in early sexual activity and drug abuse than children raised by both parents.
But while those outcomes are well known, there has been almost no research on the care, attention and resources such children receive -- and therefore, no way to know whether the damaging effects reflect poor parenting, family instability, lack of money or other factors.
"What seemed important to us was looking at the input, which hasn't really been done," Professor Case said. "For example, on the lower educational achievement, there was always the question about whether it was because stepmothers were less-able parents or the household was unstable. But now that we know it's not that, since the biological children of those same women, living in the same house, are more likely to go on to college."
Many stepmothers are quick to acknowledge that being a stepparent is complicated, particularly when they take on older children and that it is unrealistic to imagine that the new bonds will be the same as those between a biological parent and child.
"I think it's very important, going into a stepfamily, to understand that family integration is a process that takes four to seven years," said Carol Albano-Lutz, a stepmother and psychoanalyst in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., who treats mostly children and adults in stepfamilies.
And, Ms. Albano-Lutz said, in part because society generally holds women responsible for family welfare, the most difficult process of family integration involves the stepmother.
Susan Sasse of Chesapeake City, Md., vice president of the International Stepfamily Association, a nonprofit group, said: "What I hear from new stepmoms all the time, especially with older kids, is, 'They just hate me. They don't want to give me a chance. They think I'm taking their dad.' "
Ms. Sasse is no longer in touch with her own stepmother, from whom, she said, she "learned everything a stepmother shouldn't do," a lesson that became valuable three years ago when she married a man with a 2-year-old daughter.
"We have custody of all the kids," she said. "I have a wonderful relationship with my stepdaughter. But it does make a difference that she has a biological mom out there. I'm a female influence, but I'm not her mother. You have to respect that a stepchild has that other parent."
Just what effect that other biological parent has, at least in terms of health care, was one of the surprise findings of the Princeton research.
"We expected that children living with stepmoms would have less health care if they were still in contact with the birth mother," Professor Case said, "because the stepmom might not know if the birth mother was taking care of it, or might be getting some message from the birth mother like, 'No, you're not going to take my child to the dentist.' "
"But we found just the opposite," she said. "Where stepchildren had contact with their biological mother at least two or three times a month, they had the same health care status as children who lived with both biological parents. Having a birth mother hovering was protective."
Professor Case said she initially expected that having a stepmother would be better for children than having no mother at all, but her findings showed that children reared solely by their biological fathers did as well on health measures as children with stepmothers.
The research also looked at adopted and foster children, but the samples of those families are small, and the results less conclusive and more complicated. For example, if adopted children were the only children in the family, they were even more likely than biological children to attend college, but if the family included biological and adopted children, the adopted siblings were likely to get a year less schooling than the biological children.
The education and food studies are based on data from the University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the health data from the Child Health Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey, both nationally representative surveys of thousands of Americans.
In addition to Professor Case, the authors of the education and food studies were I-Fen Lin of Bowling Green State University in Ohio and Sara McLanahan of Princeton. Professor Case conducted the health study with Christina Paxson of Princeton.

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES;
A 1960's Story, Via Hoffman

BYLINE: By Rick Lyman 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Robert Greenwald said the idea for making his new film, "Steal This Movie!," about the life of the 1960's radical-prankster Abbie Hoffman, began when he was talking to his daughters.
"They're in their 20's, college-educated young women who had great interest and excitement about the 60's," he said. "You know, the tie-dyed clothes, the music. They even heard rumors there were drugs back then. But they didn't know much more about it than that." 
 A short while later, while at a Los Angeles bookstore, he came across an old copy of "Letters From the Underground," the book of correspondence between Hoffman, who died in 1989, and his wife, Anita, during the years that Hoffman was living on the run from the law. "It was a wonderful love story," Mr. Greenwald said. "A bell went off. This would make a wonderful movie."
If anything, he said, the sudden re-emergence of mass street protests -- at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last year, at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and, again this week, at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles -- has only made the story of Hoffman's emergence at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and his subsequent trial, flight and descent into manic-depression more relevant.
"Originally, when we finished the movie and delivered it to Lions Gate Films to be distributed, the thinking was that it would appeal mostly to people who were there back then, to baby boomers and others interested in the nostalgia factor," Mr. Greenwald said. "Then, after the W.T.O. demonstrations, it was like an alarm clock went off. We started getting letters from youth groups all around the country who wanted to screen the film.
"You know, there's a scene in the film where the protesters are trying to get a permit, and they keep getting the runaround, and it's the same sort of thing that happened to the protesters in Philadelphia and Los Angeles this year. It's eerie, like history repeating itself."
After he read the book, he said, he tracked down Anita Hoffman in California and got to know her. "We played volleyball together in Venice, like all good radicals," he said. He told her how he had discussed the 60's with his daughters, found her book and now wanted to make it into a movie. "She said: 'Absolutely not. It's Hollywood and they'll just screw it up.' "
Mr. Greenwald said he had promised to make the movie independent of any studio -- "there wasn't any studio that was going to make a movie on this subject, anyway" -- and to show her every draft of the screenplay. He also sent her some of the television movies he had made in the past, like "Forgotten Prisoners" in 1990 (about a crusading lawyer for Amnesty International) and "The Burning Bed" in 1984 (about spousal abuse), and finally Mrs. Hoffman said he could go ahead.
That was three and a half years ago, Mr. Greenwald said. He commissioned a screenplay, began to interview people about Hoffman's life and started to think about casting and raising production money. "We got very lucky," he said. "There was something called a hedge fund. I'll never understand what it is, but they had the money and wanted to invest it." In the end, Vincent D'Onofrio was cast as Abbie and Janeane Garofalo as Anita, who died in late 1998.
Two screenings were arranged this week in Los Angeles for some of the people who were in town to protest at the convention. And the film's limited release begins today in New York and a few other cities (review, Weekend, Page 1).
Now, Mr. Greenwald said, he hopes his daughters will have at least a little better understanding of what the 60's were about. "This movie is about that period of time," he said. "And Abbie is the tour guide."
 
Ramblin' Jack Revisited
Aiyana Elliott said she "did not intend to make a personal film when I set out to make this movie; I wanted to make as objective a film about my dad as I could." But in the making, "The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack," a documentary about her father, the folk singer Jack Elliott, turned into a far more personal film than she had anticipated.
"I think it was this interview I did with my mother," Ms. Elliott said. "She was just talking to me, her daughter, and talking about what it had been like for me to grow up with my dad on the road all the time. And when we brought the footage back to New York, our editor looked at it and said that it was really interesting. It changed the whole direction of the picture."
Her film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January with her father in the audience to see it for the first time. He had resisted making the film, she said, and was not at all comfortable with some of the more personal material about their family life. "But I think it helped for him to see it with an audience," she said, "to hear them laugh and to applaud and to see how people were reacting to his story."
Mr. Elliott is a contemporary of such legendary folk artists as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and in the critically acclaimed film, which opened in New York on Wednesday, their stories intertwine with his.
"I started out thinking it would be a more traditional verite film, following my dad around with the camera, listening to his stories," she said. "It would be a natural. But then the movie changed, and it was very difficult to tell such a personal story, sometimes very painful. I often wondered if it wasn't just creating more tension and problems for me and my dad, but in the end, I think we have gotten closer because of it."
 
The Men of Summer
Michael Dinner said he hadn't seen Clint Eastwood's "Space Cowboys" yet, and it's just a coincidence that he, too, had a summer movie coming out in which older actors played the central roles. "It's kind of nice to be able to see these actors in a summer movie," he said.
Mr. Dinner's film is "The Crew," opening next Friday, a comedy about a foursome of aging gangsters in a Miami Beach hotel who inadvertently find themselves in a dangerous duel with a South American drug lord. Burt Reynolds, Richard Dreyfuss, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassell play the old wise guys.
"Maybe the audience is used to the big extravaganzas, and now it's August and maybe it's time for some older actors and some smaller movies that aren't all about special effects," Mr. Dinner said. "There's always the conventional wisdom that in the summer the kids are out of school, so all the movies have to be geared to kids. Maybe the success of a 'Space Cowboys' can show that it doesn't always have to be like that. Besides, I grew up watching all of these actors. It's fun to see them working in a summer movie again."

HEADLINE: With the Slowdown Ending, Can the Fed Stay Friendly?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IT is the summer of our content.
The widely heralded and eagerly welcomed economic slowdown that arrived this spring has reassured investors. The Nasdaq meltdown was followed by summer stabilization. Volatility is down, and so are long-term interest rates. Initial public offerings are again soaring; four have tripled in the last month. 
 To Wall Street, all this is wonderful news. The slowdown has sent Alan Greenspan back to his office, and the consensus is that he won't raise interest rates again for a long time. Investment banks are preparing road shows to push a new wave of technology stocks after Labor Day.
And the slowdown is vanishing.
"If the past year's Fed tightening was enough to slow the economy, we wouldn't be seeing a steady upward march in manufacturing output and capacity utilization, a resumption of retail sales growth and a bounce in housing," says Bob Prince, the research director of Bridgewater Associates, a money manager in Westport, Conn.
The signs that growth is again on the rise are still limited, but it increasingly appears that the Fed's efforts to apply the brakes gently have only slowed the economic engine a bit, and that the engine's built-in momentum is again accelerating. Mr. Prince thinks the economy is now growing at an annual rate of about 4 percent, down from last winter but still above the gains in productivity.
The dot-com panic of the spring has gone, and though you won't see any new offerings that rely on selling something to consumers through the Internet, investors seem eager to buy companies that say they are part of the Internet infrastructure. The success of such stocks has helped to start retail sales moving again in a continuation of the strong correlation between growth in retail sales and the rise of the Nasdaq market.
As the economy resumes its brisk growth, the first stock market reaction is likely to be positive because strong business helps corporate profits. But at some point, concerns about inflation will begin to arise. That will be particularly true if the rest of the world continues to grow. The overall rate of consumer price inflation has been held down by cheap imported goods, whose low prices reflected weak economies overseas. (In other words, if you're a bull on American stocks, you should be rooting for a new Japanese recession, or at least a European slowdown.)
Already, the inflation rate on services, which are less prone to competition from overseas, has been edging up steadily. If that continues, the Fed is likely to take notice. It won't do anything at the meeting next week, and it probably won't act on Oct. 3, only five weeks before the presidential election. But its meeting on Nov. 15, a week after the vote, could bring the start of a new set of rate increases.
Mr. Prince says there have been three big sources of economic stimulus from 1996 to 1999. The Fed was one, but it was the least important. The others were the big increase in capital gains in stocks and the similar increase in such gains from rising house prices. Some of those capital gains are spent, expanding the economy for everyone.
Eventually, he thinks, if the Fed wants to slow the economy, it will have to "take away some of those capital gains in housing and stocks."
To fight inflation, the Fed will have to slow the economy. And the lesson of 2000 may be that to do that it will have to apply far more pain than it already has. Next winter may not be as happy as this summer has been.

Shares Up, Led by Semiconductors and Other Technology

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, led by semiconductor makers and other computer-related issues, as investors bet that technology shares would weather a slowing economy.
Wall Street was in a buying mood after a rise in weekly jobless claims indicated that the red-hot economy was cooling. This bolstered hopes the Federal Reserve would stand pat on interest rates at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting. 
 "People are less concerned about interest rates going up and thus have greater confidence to buy into the market," said Rick Meckler, senior managing director at Liberty View. "In that current context, people's first choice remains technology issues."
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended up 79.67 points, or 2.06 percent, at 3,940.87, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average gained 47.25 points, or 0.43 percent, to 11,055.64.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 16.22 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,496.07.
Semiconductor stocks led the way.
Intel, the largest producer of semiconductors, gained 2 to 70 1/16, while Applied Materials advanced 3 1/16, to 84.
Amtech Systems, a semiconductor equipment maker, jumped 4 5/8, to 14 5/8, after saying it had secured a $6.4 million equipment order, signaling its entry into the fiber optic telecommunications equipment market.
Semiconductor stocks have been energized by the view that the rapid development in high-speed Internet and wireless communications will keep their outlook bright, despite signs that the economy is cooling.
"More and more, the market is embracing the belief that earnings in the second half of the year will maintain a low double-digit growth rate," said David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles in Detroit. "Stocks with good earnings and with good fundamentals will go up across the board."
The Dow's rise came despite a drop in Hewlett-Packard, after it reported lackluster sales of servers. Hewlett-Packard finished down 12 at 108.
Hewlett-Packard's report of booming printer sales, however, helped to lift other computer companies, like Lexmark International, which rose 4 1/8, to 55 1/8.
Countering the slide in Hewlett-Packard were the Dow's financial services components, with J. P. Morgan up 2 9/16 at 145 and American Express up 1 3/16 at 58 1/2. They bounced back after two days of declines.
Exxon Mobil rose 15/128, to 83 13/16, amid a run-up in energy stocks as crude oil prices continued to rise.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices rose yesterday for the first time in three days as traders snapped up longer-term debt before the Treasury Department repurchased $1.5 billion of bonds.
"People are trying to get in on the buyback," said Brad Adams, who expects to buy Treasuries at the end of the month for the $13 billion in indexed bond portfolios he helps manage at Northern Trust in Chicago.
The 30-year bond rose 1 7/32, to 1072 5/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.70 percent from 5.74 percent. The 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 21/32, as its yield fell to 5.80 percent from 5.83 percent.
The gains in government debt snapped a two-day decline that came as investors adjusted for the risk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again later this year to cool growth.
The government has used its growing budget surplus to buy back $19 billion in bonds since the repurchases began in March, and plans to buy back a total of $30 billion this year.

HEADLINE: More Home Refinancers Opt for Extra Cash

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
An increasing number of Americans who refinance their homes are taking extra cash rather than a lower rate, says Freddie Mac, the nation's No. 2 buyer of mortgages.
In the second quarter, 83 percent of homeowners who refinanced ended up with a loan at least 5 percent larger than the original, the study said. In the corresponding period last year, that figure was 58 percent. 
 Even so, refinancing slipped to 15 percent of the overall market from 34 percent in the second quarter of 1999, the study said. Mortgage rates rose to a five-year high in May.
The United States housing market has set a blistering pace over the last four years, with records in home sales and amounts of mortgage loans. At the same time, house prices have risen 27 percent, judging from the loans that were refinanced in the second quarter, Freddie Mac said.
"The percentage of homeowners taking out some equity in their homes rose to rival that of 1988-1990, also a period of low refinancing activity and a strong housing market," said Vassilis Lekkas, an economist at Freddie Mac, in McLean, Va.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
A Computer Program for Apartment Managers

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
John Nisi, a tenant at Trump Place, a luxury rental building on the West Side of Manhattan, notices the difference. His packages are rarely lost, and a leaky kitchen sink in his 15th-floor apartment that was causing water damage to a downstairs unit was repaired readily -- although he was out of town at the time.
What Mr. Nisi, 24, does not see is what is helping his superintendent and property manager run the 511-apartment building at 180 Riverside Boulevard more efficiently. It is a computerized information system that tracks more than 200 building activities and procedures. They include tenants' repair requests and data on shipping and receiving of packages and building supplies. The system also enables managers to maintain lists of current and former tenants and of who is permitted to enter the building. 
 The residential services and management software, called Building Assistant Manager, was introduced in June by Advanced Digital Internet of Manhattan, which provides high-speed Internet access to residential properties. Beyond 180 Riverside Boulevard, the system so far is being used at Tracy Towers, a 165-unit co-op at 245 East 24th Street. And it is being evaluated by managers and owners of other buildings.
In contrast with online systems that tenants use for a variety of purposes -- like staying in touch with building management -- the management software is specifically intended for building superintendents and managements and is not linked to the Internet. The building staff can obtain information from a computer screen rather than relying on handwritten notes or the memories of doormen or concierges.
Among the systems that Manhattan tenants are using are those of EdificeRex.com Inc., of Manhattan, which is linked to the Internet and allows tenants to obtain local services as well as to get management service. Another system, produced by Yardi Systems, of Santa Barbara, Calif., is intended mainly for management but is more comprehensive, ranging from leasing to financial record-keeping.
The Building Assistant Manager system is building-specific. "Our system was developed by a building superintendent specifically to help manage the building," said Thomas Josephson, the vice president at ADI. "This software runs locally. It is a one-stop system that is also safe and secure."
The superintendent who developed the concept behind the system was Alfred Neese, of Trump Place. The idea, he said, was "to streamline paperwork, increase productivity, keep everyone on the same page and respond more quickly to residents' needs." The system, he said, is simple, quick and, unlike some others, "focused just on taking care of the business of managing buildings."
That appealed to Advanced Digital Internet, which seven months ago bought the program from Mr. Neese. "We enhanced the number of functions, made it more generic and saw it as a commercially viable product," Mr. Josephson said, adding that it was flexible so that users could tailor it to their needs. It is also "a way to leverage our Internet service," he said.
Since the company's founding in 1998, it has wired 30 residential apartment buildings, most of them in Manhattan. It also operates in Atlanta and Philadelphia and over the next year will expand into a dozen more markets, where it will also promote the program. Though it initially geared the system to buildings with 100 apartments or more, there has been interest from smaller buildings, Mr. Josephson said.
Mr. Neese said Building Assistant Manager had enabled him to run his building at or below its budget. But Mr. Josephson said managers would see other benefits. They can more easily determine not only which apartments put in repeat maintenance requests but also which appliances need regular repair. And from a security standpoint, they can "have a history of everyone who enters and leaves the building and each apartment," he said
It takes 45 minutes on average to install the system, he said. He added that it also was meant to be "pretty economical."
The cost to buy the software for two computers is $1,000, and $500 for any additional computer. There are optional installation and training costs of $125 and $295, respectively. After the first year, there will be an estimated $200 annual fee, also optional, for maintenance and upgrades to the program. Mr. Josephson said the company was working on adding features to handle a portfolio of buildings via the Internet as well as local building code issues.
At 180 Riverside, said Andrew Weiss, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, "the system is working well and, once perfected, we are considering expanding its use into other buildings. Anything that helps us run the buildings more smoothly and provide more services to tenants, we see as an amenity."

HEADLINE: Bankruptices Defy Growth In Furniture

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Two recent failures by furniture sellers show that the furniture business is joining the retail clothing business in a much more competitive arena where poor execution is increasingly fatal.
On Wednesday, the Heilig-Meyers Company, the largest furniture retailer in the country, with $2.3 billion in annual sales, announced that it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and that it would close 302 stores, most in rural areas in the Southeast and California. 
 The news came the same day that Living.com, an Internet retailer with losses but glamorous partners like Starbucks and Amazon.com, said that it had filed for bankruptcy protection.
Despite those announcements, the furniture industry is not moribund. Thanks to a strong economy that is driving home sales and a Martha Stewart-like national obsession with renovations, sales have been growing at more than 5 percent a year since 1992 and now stand at $61 billion.
With consumer spending starting to ease, growth in furniture sales is expected to slow to 2 percent to 3 percent this year, but analysts contend the bankruptcies speak more to heightened competition than to overall weakness in the industry.
"What happened at Heilig-Meyers is extremely unfortunate, because it didn't have to be," said Jerry Epperson, a furniture industry analyst and a managing director of Mann, Armistad & Epperson, an investment banking firm in Richmond, Va. "The industry is having the best of times."
Living.com's was the less significant of the two bankruptcy filings because selling furniture over the Internet is an experiment that many feel will not pan out soon.
"The need for the consumer to touch and feel and sit and judge comfort cannot be addressed over the Web," said Jeff Butler, a principal at the retail consulting firm of Kurt Salmon Associates.
While Heilig-Meyers faced numerous problems, including a lack of cash flow caused by an unwieldy string of acquisitions, the merchant was struggling because it still hewed to the old school of furniture retailing. Traditionally, furniture stores were more banks than merchants. That is, they made money not so much by selling sofas and chairs but by offering credit to low-income people to buy merchandise and then making a profit on the terms of the loan. This focus on financing as opposed to product explains why many older furniture chains were grim places with ugly stock and dim lighting.
Such operations have been hit hard by credit card companies that lowered income requirements, allowing even relatively poor customers to shop wherever they liked, and by a huge increase in competition.
For starters, there has been an explosion of rent-to-buy retailers. Such retailers offer higher prices, but if customers fail to make a payment for a large-screen TV or recliner, it does not hurt their credit record -- the companies simply repossess the rental item.
The low- to mid-price category, meanwhile, is also undergoing startling change. Rooms to Go, a chain of furniture stores founded in 1990 that offers discounts to buyers willing to pay for a package of merchandise for one room, is already the third-largest furniture seller in the country, with $720 million in annual sales. In addition, nonfurniture retailers like Costco, Sam's Club, and Lowe's sell some furniture, much of it at competitive prices.
The competition in the mid- and upper-price range has also increased with chain stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, which sell lifestyle and ambience with their leather club chairs and pewter picture frames.
"The customer wants to buy in a place that makes them feel good and comfortable," said Gerald Birnbach, chairman of the Rowe Companies, which supplies to those chains and others like J. C. Penney and Jordan's in Massachusetts. "They are talking about value, but not prices."
"This industry is retarded when it comes to change," he added. "That is why the young aggressive ones are catching the upswing. The ones doing it the same old way are going dead."

The Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law and have imposed strict controls on women since capturing the capital, Kabul, in 1996. (AP) 

IRAQ: READY FOR BUSINESS -- Baghdad's Saddam International Airport officially reopened, 10 years after it was closed because of sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the only traffic the airport will have for the foreseeable future is likely to be limited to the arrival of private flights from abroad, which are not specifically banned by the embargo.

LATVIA: DOWNTOWN BLASTS -- Two bombs exploded in a shopping center in downtown Riga, wounding 21 people, the police said. No one claimed responsibility, but Riga has had scores of bombings since Latvia regained independence in 1991, and the police have attributed most to gang activity. (AP)
 
BRITAIN: ROYAL PASSAGE -- Prince William, second in line to the British throne after his father, Prince Charles, has passed his final-year exams and will be attending St. Andrews, Scotland's oldest university. He plans to begin a four-year degree course in art history next year, after a year off. He is currently in Belize taking part in exercises with the Welsh Guards. (AP)

COLOMBIA: POLICEMEN SLAIN -- The bodies of three policemen who had been taken prisoner by rebels 18 months ago were found with their throats slit after a clash between the army and rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. They were among more than 350 security force members the guerrilla group has captured over the last two years to try to pressure the government to release some 450 jailed rebels. (Reuters)
 
MEXICO: BORDER CZAR -- President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada said that after he takes office in December, he will appoint a "czar" to help resolve border issues that have long strained relations between the United States and Mexico. A chief duty, he said, would be to promote greater cooperation between local governments on both sides of the border. Ginger Thompson (NYT)
 
CANADA: BOLSTERING THE RIGHT -- The new right-wing party, the Canadian Alliance, won another defection from its shrinking rival, the Progressive Conservative Party, as Brian Pallister, a former Manitoba cabinet minister, left the ranks of the old party, known as the Tories. Mr. Pallister, a former national Tory leadership candidate, said he would run for Parliament from Manitoba in elections expected next spring.

JAPAN: WOMEN AT THE WHEEL -- Two women have became the first female drivers of the super-fast Shinkansen "bullet" trains. A spokesman for the JR West rail system said Rumi Yamashita, 27, and Miyuki Fukuzawa, 29, benefited from a 1997 revision of Japan's equal opportunity law, which banned sexual discrimination in recruiting, appointing and promoting workers. (Agence France-Presse)
 
JAPAN: SUICIDE RISE -- The number of suicides hit a record 33,048 in the year ending in March, with the nation's prolonged economic slump taking its toll, the police said. Health problems accounted for half of all suicide cases while economic hardship was blamed for another fifth, an 11.5 percent jump from the previous year's survey. Ninety-two percent of the economy-related suicides involved men, as companies abandon their tradition of employment for life. (Agence France-Presse)
 
INDIA: GANDHI TOUR -- The Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, left, will make her first trip abroad as leader of the opposition for a conference of presiding officers of parliaments in New York that begins on Aug. 31. The delegation will also include the Bharatiya Janata Party's Pramod Mahajan, the Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Nationalist Congress Party chief, Sharad Pawar.

INDIA: ANTI-CHRISTIAN SUSPECT -- Police in the southern state of Karnataka said they had arrested a junior air force officer, Syed Hasan Ur Zama, as a suspect in the bombings of Christian churches this summer. They said Mr. Zama, a member of a Muslim organization called Deendar Anjuman, admitted passing information about the location of railway bridges and defense posts to Pakistan. Most attacks on Christians have been blamed on Hindu groups. Celia Dugger (NYT)
 
HONG KONG: HAVEN FOR ACTIVIST -- Hong Kong granted the right of permanent residence to one of Beijing's most vocal critics, Frank Lu Siqing, who runs the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. Mr. Lu entered Hong Kong illegally in 1993 and started the center, which disseminates news about Chinese dissidents, in 1996. Hong Kong residents normally can receive permanent "right of abode" after seven years, but his illegal entry and the hostility of China, which regained control over Hong Kong in 1997, had raised doubts about his chances. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
IVORY COAST: ANTI-JUNTA PROTESTS -- Thousands of youths chanting anti-government slogans marched through Abidjan, the commercial capital, in the first major public protest since the military coup in December. They demanded that the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, step down rather than run for president in Sept. 17 elections to restore civilian rule.

HEADLINE: Peres Praises China After Visit to Bolster Ties With Ex-Critic

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Shimon Peres lavishly praised China today as he finished a two-day visit intended to bolster Israel's ties with this onetime adversary and shore up global support for continued peace talks.
"I feel China is a very friendly country with a very profound understanding of events in the Middle East," Mr. Peres, a former prime minister who is now Israel's minister for regional cooperation, told reporters. 
 "I have great respect for President Jiang Zemin's call for patience," he added, alluding to remarks by the Chinese leader on Monday, after a meeting with Yasir Arafat, and repeated to Mr. Peres by officials during his visit.
China's call for the Israelis and Palestinians to persist in a search for peace despite the breakdown of the Camp David talks last month, diplomats here said, was intended to dissuade Mr. Arafat from declaring a Palestinian state on Sept. 13, as he had said he would do. Such an act would be likely to provoke a strong reaction from Israel, hurting the chances for peace.
On Wednesday in Jakarta, Mr. Arafat said he was reconsidering the timing of declaring statehood after China and then Indonesia joined a long list of nations urging him to back off.
Today, Mr. Peres praised Mr. Arafat for his apparent caution, calling it "a wise step."
Israel has been delighted with China's moderate stance, which in Israeli eyes validates the courting of a country that until the late 1980's had championed Arab radicals.
For the record, Israeli officials said Mr. Peres's visit, part of a quick Asian tour that also included Tokyo and Jakarta, was simply intended to inform leaders about the status of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
But for Israel, the visit also offered a vital chance to shore up the budding friendship with China. Relations were jolted last month when Israel reneged on a $250 million contract to sell China's military an advanced airborne radar system after protests by the United States.
Chinese officials welcomed Mr. Peres's offer on Wednesday to promote new Israeli investment and agricultural aid in China's underdeveloped hinterlands. And most important for Israel, China took a temperate line on the peace talks in successive meetings this week with Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres, even as it reaffirmed support for eventual Palestinian statehood.
Especially since 1992, when China gave Israel formal diplomatic recognition, Israel has cultivated ties with China, secretly selling weapons and offering agricultural and other aid.
"The Israelis see enormous significance in their relations with China," said Michael Yahuda, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. For one thing, he said, Israel sees friendly ties with this largest developing country as blunting the often hostile stance of much of the third world.
In the past, China has been known to sell arms to archenemies of Israel, like Iraq and Iran. China has halted most such sales, but according to American intelligence agencies, it has continued to provide missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.
Mr. Peres said he had raised the missile issue with China's foreign minister and had been assured that China would abide by international agreements to bar transfers of long-range missile technology and nuclear arms. China has given similar ambiguous assurances in the past.

HEADLINE: Lazio Urges Tax Cuts to Add Jobs Upstate

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ENDICOTT, N.Y., Aug. 17

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, toured two high-tech businesses today to underscore what he said were bright spots in the upstate economy and to counter what he said were Hillary Rodham Clinton's portrayals of the region as an "economic wasteland."
Mr. Lazio, on the second day of a bus tour across the state, watched machinery spool cable wire at a plant in Cortland and then donned a white protective coat and blue ducks as he inspected components for motion sensors at a company in Ithaca. 
 Afterward, he called the companies examples of an economic rebound and models of the future in a region that he said had got a negative reputation. Although upstate has lagged the rest of the state in job growth, it is now catching up, he said.
"We don't think we are in an economic wasteland, like the other side likes us to believe," Mr. Lazio said.
To keep things moving, Mr. Lazio said, he would work for tax relief for businesses, including cutting the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent, and encourage technology businesses to move upstate, perhaps linking with local colleges and universities, as the Kionix Technology Company in Ithaca did with nearby Cornell University.
The state's chief economist, Stephen Kagann, reported last month that private-sector employment increased and unemployment rates fell over the last year, both downstate and upstate. Private employment in June rose 2.3 percent over June 1999, with a 2.5 percent increase in New York City and its suburbs and 1.8 percent upstate. The national growth rate was 2.2 percent.
Independent analysts, however, have said that much of the growth occurred in low-paying retail jobs. The statewide unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in June from 5.3 percent a year earlier but still remained higher than the national average of 4 percent.
Both candidates view the upstate region as a pivotal trough of votes and have mounted remarkably similar swings through the area. Just last month, Mrs. Clinton, too, visited electronics and technology companies, advocating those sectors as potential areas of growth and promising tax breaks and other incentives. Her aides said she has never called the region a wasteland but, like Mr. Lazio, has talked of young people leaving the area for higher-paying jobs and the need to explore other areas like technology to stimulate growth.
"Apparently, Hillary is the only candidate in this race who knows upstate needs more jobs and has a plan to create them,' said Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, referring to a plan the first lady unveiled in February.
While Mr. Lazio sought to keep his day focused on the economy, he was distracted by the tactics of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which has a young worker following the congressman with a video camera for prospective advertising footage, and the Democratic Party, which has sent a young man dressed as Uncle Sam pursuing Mr. Lazio and demanding he release his income tax returns. Mr. Lazio, for the third straight day, said he would release the returns this month.
Mr. Lazio's aides, after nearly three months of tolerating the young man's videotaping, turned angry today and began holding signs in front of the man's camera. One aide stuck his face right up against the lens, with a hard stare.
At a stop in Owego, Mr. Lazio ended his remarks to a gathering of party loyalists by introducing the young man who was taping him. "So let's all say hello to Hillary Clinton and the whole Clinton camp," Mr. Lazio said. "We don't have to resort to that stuff, do we?" A chorus of no's then rose up.
Mr. Lazio had arrived in Owego somewhat self-consciously since his staff had misspelled it in a news advisory as Oswego -- which is on Lake Ontario about 300 miles away. The gaffe was noted by local newspapers today. The campaigns have seized on each other's geographical blunders as evidence of a lack of familiarity with the state.

MANHATTAN: CHARGES DROPPED IN CONCRETE ATTACK
A Manhattan judge yesterday formally dropped charges against Bently Louis Grant, 35, a homeless man charged with attacking a woman last month with a chunk of concrete. The police had said that Mr. Grant confessed. Security videotapes, however, showed that he was at a Manhattan record store at the time of the attack. On Wednesday, Mr. Grant, who has been treated for mental illness, was moved to an apartment with the help of psychiatric social workers at Elmhurst Medical Center, where he received care after being released from jail. Katherine E. Finkelstein (NYT) 

UNIONDALE: UTILITY TO EXPAND POWER DISTRIBUTION
The Long Island Power Authority asked for proposals from potential suppliers yesterday for one or more cables beneath Long Island Sound, each capable of carrying 200 to 600 megawatts of electricity to Long Island by as early as May 2003. The authority chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said the power would meet rising demand from 1.1 million customers on Long Island and the Rockaway Peninsula. John Rather (NYT)
 
MINEOLA: PROPERTY TAX STUDY
The Nassau County Board of Assessors unanimously selected a firm yesterday to reassess the value of every property in the county. The firm, Cole-Layer-Trumble Company of Dayton, Ohio, must be approved by the County Legislature before it can start work. Critics have said that the Nassau property tax system uses construction prices from 1938 and that land values are based on prices from 1964. Poor communities are typically overtaxed under this system, critics say. The cash-strapped county has paid millions of dollars to taxpayers who have successfully challenged their tax assessments. Charlie LeDuff (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: HUMAN REMAINS FOUND
A blue Samsonite suitcase packed with human body parts was found floating in the Hudson River near Battery Park yesterday afternoon, about 13 hours after a plastic bag containing human limbs was caught on the hull of a Consolidated Edison barge in the East River near 14th Street, the police said. Both sets of body parts appeared to be from the same black or Hispanic woman, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner said. Elissa Gootman (NYT)
 
ALBANY: PATAKI SIGNS CIGARETTE BILL
A measure that could make New York the first state to require that all cigarettes be self-extinguishing was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday. The legislation is intended to reduce the number of fires that occur when smokers fall asleep or otherwise handle a cigarette carelessly. By mid-2003, all cigarettes sold in New York must be made to go out if no puffs are taken for a while. The governor said the law would prevent needless tragedies. (AP)
 
ALBANY: UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN
The jobless rate in New York City edged down last month to 5.5 percent, from 5.6 in June and 6.8 percent a year ago, according to the New York State Department of Labor. For the state as a whole, unemployment fell to 4.2 percent, the lowest since 1988. Both state and local unemployment rates remain above the national level of 4 percent; upstate, the rate has fallen to 3.5 percent, from 3.7 last month and 4.2 percent a year ago. Leslie Eaton (NYT)
 
WHITE PLAINS: PRISON GUARD RECRUITMENT
The New York Department of Correctional Services is recruiting prison guards, in part because of prison expansion but also because of the possibility of a larger than average number of retirements in the near future. There are currently 20,500 guards, who oversee 71,000 inmates and earn an average salary of $35,000 a year. A new maximum security prison, the Five Points Correctional Facility, is to open this month in Romulus, N.Y., and other prisons are being expanded. No specific number of new hires has been given. Al Baker (NYT)
 
QUEENS: DRUG RING ARRESTS
Authorities said yesterday that they had arrested the leader and other members of a marijuana smuggling ring that used exotic dancers as couriers to move as much as 400 pounds of marijuana through Kennedy International Airport each week. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said the dancers and others were given round-trip airline tickets and $1,000 each to fly to California and smuggle the marijuana into New York in their suitcases. Six people were arrested between Wednesday night and yesterday morning, with other members of the ring arrested over the last few months, Mr. Brown said. Sarah Kershaw (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: TAX-FREE WEEK
Connecticut's first week without the 6 percent sales tax for clothing and shoes costing less than $300 is to begin on Sunday. State Representative Robert M. Ward, who lobbied the General Assembly for a no-tax week, modeled on the one in New York, said the program would save consumers about $3 million. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: PLOT AGAINST PROSECUTOR
An imprisoned sex offender and his brother were charged in connection with a plot to kill a Windham state's attorney. The prisoner, Richard Straub, 64, is serving a 15-year term for using his position as a probation officer to force young men in his custody to have sex with him. He was arraigned Wednesday on charges of attempted murder, bribery, and conspiracy to escape from the Cheshire Correctional Center. The police had discovered he twice tried to hire someone to murder the lawyer, Mark Solak, who prosecuted his case in 1999. Roland Straub, 60, was charged with bribery and helping his brother try to escape. (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
LAKEHURST: CRASH MEMORIAL
More than 2,000 people gathered in the gymnasium of the Naval Air Engineering Station yesterday for a memorial for the 11 people who died Aug. 9 when two small planes collided over a subdivision in Burlington County. Six victims worked at the base and were taking a shuttle flight to headquarters in Maryland when it crashed into a plane carrying an aviation instructor and his student. As mourners sang "Amazing Grace" and placed carnations in front of photographs of the dead, a naval brigade fired a 21-gun salute, and a bugler played "Taps." Andrew Jacobs (NYT)

To the Editor:
Re "Legal Firms Cutting Back on Free Services for Poor" (front page, Aug. 17):
A decrease in pro bono work by big law firms is a loss not only for clients with unmet legal needs but also for lawyers seeking to practice a profession and for a society increasingly challenged to provide justice for all. 
 Here at Southern Methodist University Law School, where 30 hours of public service is a graduation requirement, many students put in far more, resulting in 46,564 hours of free legal services over the last seven years.
It will be a major opportunity lost when these students go to work at law firms only to find their profession's commitment to service on the wane because business is booming, salaries are high and economic times are too good to find room for unpaid legal services.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS: THE MONEY;
Corporations Underwrite The Democrats' Convention

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Barely an hour after Vice President Al Gore issued a call for reforming the ways political campaigns are paid for, he headed back to the fund-raising circuit for a concert that raised $5.2 million for the Democratic Party.
In his acceptance speech tonight, Mr. Gore vowed to "get all the special-interest money -- all of it -- out of our democracy" and promised to make legislation to reform campaign financing the first bill he would send to Congress as president. 
 Democratic officials were quick to note that the sold-out fund-raising concert at the Shrine Auditorium tonight featuring Barbra Streisand continued a tradition of celebrating the party's nominee at an event after the convention.
And they noted that the concert tonight, also starring Whoopi Goldberg and Enrique Iglesias, raised only "hard" dollars, money collected in amounts from $150 to $20,000 that the party can use directly on Mr. Gore's candidacy -- as opposed to the large, unrestricted contributions known as soft money that are the focus of most reform measures.
"The Democratic National Committee has always held a gala at the end of the convention to raise money and excitement for the ticket," said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the party.
Ms. Backus said the event was consistent with the party's support for campaign finance reform because it collected only hard money. The $5.2 million raised tonight was the largest hard-money event in Democratic Party history, she said.
Still, Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, a Democratic co-sponsor of a measure to ban soft money in politics, was critical of the concert.
"I would prefer there be no such events at our convention," Mr. Feingold said. "It doesn't add to our message to have these events going on in Los Angeles."
The concert was the only fund-raiser that the Democratic National Committee held this week. But Democratic candidates and congressional fund-raising committees courted contributors ceaselessly all week in a soft-money extravaganza, underwritten by scores of corporations that have already contributed millions of dollars to Democratic committees and from which the party hopes to reap millions more.
At a luncheon at the home of the children's entertainment executive Haim Saban, the most generous donors to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sipped lemonade and picked at a luncheon of chicken salad with the Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle of South Dakota; Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the committee's chairman; Senator Dianne Feinstein of California; Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia, and others.
After playing a prominent role at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, telecommunications companies were big underwriters of events for the Democrats. Corporate giants like AT&T, BellSouth, Verizon, SBC Communications, Sprint Telecommunications and Teligent sponsored more than a dozen costly receptions for top lawmakers this week.
They entertained members of the House and Senate commerce committees, their legislative overseers, at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday evening. Among the sponsors of Dodger Day 2000 was the United States Telecom Association, a trade group whose president, Roy Neel, is a former chief of staff for Mr. Gore.
They also helped underwrite a "Mardi Gras" party for Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, and a nightclub show featuring the singer Sheryl Crow.
Peter Knight, another former chief of staff for Mr. Gore and now deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has lobbied on behalf of two telecommunications companies, Bell Atlantic and Leap Wireless.
Communications companies rented out Spago restaurant in Beverly Hills for Senator Torricelli on Tuesday and for House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt on Sunday.
Global Crossing, which donated $250,000 to both Republican and Democratic conventions, also paid for a dinner to honor Mr. Daschle on Wednesday. The company seeks federal approval to lay a telecommunications cable across the Pacific.
AT&T, which has the most prominent presence here of any telecommunications company, gave $1 million in goods and services to each party for their conventions. The long-distance giant is the largest contributor to the Republican Party, having given $1.4 million since January 1999, and the fourth-largest to the Democrats, who received $993,000 over the same period.
"These firms are the driving engine of the new economy and are in the process of becoming the driving force in political finance," said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform. "They have a huge stake in government decisions, more so than almost any other sector of the economy."
Telecommunications companies rely on Congress and the executive branch for approvals of mergers, for access to the airwaves, for permission to offer local or long-distance telephone service.
The explosion of telecommunications technology has made these companies enormously wealthy and they are spreading that wealth around elected officials without regard to party affiliation, Mr. Wert heimer said.
Lonnie Taylor, the chief lobbyist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that communications companies support members of both parties because issues that concern them, including visas for foreign workers and privacy protection on the Internet, are generally not ideological and require bipartisan majorities for passage.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS: IN HIS OWN WORDS;
Gore to Delegates and Nation: 'My Focus Will Be on Working Families'

 BODY:
Following is the acceptance speech prepared for delivery last night by Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles:
I speak tonight of gratitude, achievement, and high hopes for our country. 
 Tonight, I think first of those who helped get me here, starting with the people of Tennessee. Then, those who braved the first snows of Iowa and New Hampshire, and all of you here, from all over this country, who have come with me into the warm sunlight of this great city.
While I can't thank each of you individually in words, I do so in my heart.
And I know you won't mind if I single out someone who has just spoken so eloquently, someone I've loved with my whole heart since the night of my high school senior prom, my wife, Tipper. We've been lucky enough to find each other all over again at each new stage of our lives, and we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary.
I want to acknowledge with great pride our four children: Kristin, Sarah, and Albert; Our oldest daughter Karenna and her husband Drew; And the youngest member of our family, who a little over a year ago was born on the Fourth of July, our grandson Wyatt.
I'm honored tonight by the support of a leader of high ideals and fundamental decency, who will be an important part of our country's future, Senator Bill Bradley.
There's someone else who will shape that future, a leader of character and courage, a defender of the environment and working families, the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Lieberman.
I picked him for one simple reason: He's the best person for the job.
For almost eight years now, I've been the partner of a leader who moved us out of the valley of recession and into the longest period of prosperity in American history. I say to you tonight: millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton.
Instead of the biggest deficits in history, we now have the biggest surpluses. The highest home ownership ever. The lowest inflation in a generation. Instead of losing jobs, we have 22 million new jobs.
Above all, our success comes from you, the people who have worked hard for your families.
Let's not forget that a few years ago, you were also working hard. But your hard work was undone by a government that didn't work, didn't put people first, and wasn't on your side.
Together, we changed things, to help unleash your potential, and innovation and investment in the private sector, the engine that drives our economic growth.
And our progress on the economy is a good chapter in our history. But now we turn the page and write a new chapter. And that's what I want to speak about tonight.
This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have.
Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.
Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few, but all working families. Let's invest in health care, education, a secure retirement and middle-class tax cuts.
I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many businesses and new enterprises have done well. This country is richer and stronger.
But my focus is on working families: people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by their kids. Whether you're in a suburb, or an inner-city, whether you raise crops or drive hogs and cattle on a farm, drive a big rig on the interstate or drive e-commerce on the Internet, whether you're starting out to raise your own family or getting ready to retire after a lifetime of hard work.
So often, powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your way, and the odds seemed stacked against you, even as you do what's right for you and your family.
How and what we do for all of you -- the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens, and live the American dream -- that is the standard by which we should be judged.
And for all of our good times, I am not satisfied.
To all the families in America who have to struggle to afford the right education and the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, I want you to know this: I've taken on the powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll stand up for you.
To all the families who are struggling with things that money can't measure, like trying to find a little more time to spend with your children, or protecting your children from entertainment that you think glorifies violence and indecency, I want you to know: I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning.
And as president, I will stand with you for a goal that we share: to give more power back to the parents, to choose what your own children are exposed to, so you can pass on your family's basic lessons of responsibility and decency.
The power should be in your hands. The future should belong to everyone in this land. We could squander this moment, but our country would be the poorer for it. Instead, let's lift our eyes, and see how wide the American horizon has become.
We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president. And I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am.
I grew up in a wonderful family. I have a lot to be thankful for. And the greatest gift my parents gave me was love. When I was a child, it never once occurred to me that the foundation upon which my security depended would ever shake.
And of all the lessons my parents taught me, the most powerful one was unspoken, the way they loved one another.
My father respected my mother as an equal, if not more. She was his best friend, and in many ways, his conscience. And I learned from them the value of a true, loving partnership that lasts for life.
They simply couldn't imagine being without each other. And for 61 years, they were by each other's side.
My parents taught me that the real values in life aren't material but spiritual. They include faith and family, duty and honor, and trying to make the world a better place.
I finished college at a time when all that seemed to be in doubt, and our nation's spirit was being depleted. We saw the assassination of our best leaders. Appeals to racial backlash. And the first warning signs of Watergate.
I remember the conversations I had with Tipper back then and the doubts we had about the Vietnam War.
But I enlisted in the Army because I knew if I didn't go, someone else in the small town of Carthage, Tenn., would have to go in my place.
I was an Army reporter in Vietnam. When I was there, I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform.
When I came home, running for office was the very last thing I ever thought I would do. I studied religion at Vanderbilt, and worked nights as a police reporter at the Nashville Tennessean. And I saw more of what could go wrong in America, not only on the police beat, but as an investigative reporter covering local government.
I also saw so much of what could go right: citizens lifting up local communities, family by family, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, in churches and charities, on school boards and city councils.
And then, Tipper and I started our own family. And when our first daughter Karenna was born, I began to see the future through a fresh set of eyes. I know a lot of you have had that feeling, too.
And I decided that I could not turn away from service at home, any more than I could have turned away from service in Vietnam.
That's why I ran for Congress. In my first term, a family in Hardeman County, Tenn., wrote a letter and told how worried they were about toxic waste that had been dumped near their home. I held some of the first hearings on the issue. And ever since, I've been there in the fight against the big polluters.
Our children should not have to draw the breath of life in cities awash in pollution. When they come in from playing on a hot summer afternoon, every child in America, anywhere in America, ought to be able to turn on the faucet and get a glass of safe, clean drinking water.
On the issue of the environment, I've never given up, I've never backed down and I never will.
And I say it again tonight: We must reverse the silent, rising tide of global warming.
In the Senate and as vice president, I fought for welfare reform. Over and over again, I talked to folks who told me how they were trapped in the old welfare system. I saw what it did to families. So I fought to end welfare as we then knew it, to help those in trouble, but to insist on work and responsibility.
Others talked about welfare reform. We actually reformed welfare and set time limits. Instead of hand-outs, we gave people training to go from welfare to work. And we have cut the welfare rolls in half and moved millions into good jobs.
For almost 25 years now, I've been fighting for people. And for all that time, I've been listening to people, holding open meetings, in the places where they live and work.
And you know what? I've learned a lot. And if I'm your president, I'm going to keep on having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, every-day heroism of hard-working Americans.
And because I've learned that the issues before us, the problems and the policies, all have names. And I don't mean the big fancy names that we put on programs and legislation. I'm talking about family names like Nystel, Johnson, Gutierrez, and Malone, people and families I've met in the last year, all across this country. And here's what they've told me:
I met Mildred Nystel in Waterloo, Iowa. Because of our welfare reform, she's left welfare and found a good job training electricians and she's become a proud member of I.B.E.W. Local 288. Now she dreams of sending her daughter Irene to college.
Mildred Nystel is here with us tonight. And I say to her: I will fight for a targeted, affordable tax cut to help working families save and pay for college.
I met Jacqueline Johnson in St. Louis, Miss. She worked for 35 years as a medical assistant, caring for others. Now she's 72 years old and needs prescription medicines to care for herself. She spends over half of her Social Security check, her only source of income, on her pills. So she either skips meals or shops for bargains at a wholesale food store and buys macaroni and cheese dinners in bulk, and then has them at every meal.
I invited her here tonight. And Mrs. Johnson, I promise you once again: I will fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors under Medicare.
It's just wrong for seniors to have to choose between food and medicine while the big drug companies run up record profits.
I met George and Juanita Gutierrez in San Antonio, Tex. Their daughter Caterina has just started the fourth grade at Davy Crockett Elementary School. The school building is crumbling and overcrowded, with cracked walls and peeling plaster. Trailers cover the playground where the kids used to spend recess.
The Gutierrez family is here tonight. And I tell them again: I will fight to rebuild and modernize our crumbling schools, and reduce class size. We need to put safety, discipline, and character first in every classroom.
You know, education may be a local responsibility. But I believe it also has to be our number one national priority. We can't stop until every school in America is a good place to get a good education.
And I will never forget a little boy named Ian Malone, who suffered from a medical mistake during childbirth, and needs full-time nursing care for several years. I met him and his parents in Seattle, near their home in Everett, Wash. Their H.M.O. had told the Malones it would no longer pay for the nurse they needed, and then, told them they should consider giving Ian up for adoption.
That's when his mom and dad got really mad. They told their story in public, and the H.M.O. was embarrassed. Because they fought for their baby , today Ian has the care he needs to stay alive. But no family in America should have to go on national television to save their child's life.
Dylan and Christine Malone are here with us tonight. Ian's here, too. And I say to them, and to all the families of America: I will fight for a real, enforceable ptients' bill of rights.
It's just wrong to have life and death medical decisions made by bean-counters at H.M.O.'s who don't have a license to practice medicine, and don't have a right to play God. It's time to take the medical decisions away from the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies and give them back to the doctors, the nurses, and the health care professionals.
So this is not just an election between my opponent and me. It's about our people, our families, and our future and whether forces standing in your way will keep you from having a better life.
To me, this election is about Mildred Nystel, Jacqueline Johnson, Caterina Gutierrez, Ian Malone.
It's about millions of Americans whose names we may never know, but whose needs and dreams must always be our calling.
And so here tonight, in the name of all the working families who are the strength and soul of America, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.
I'm here to talk seriously about the issues. I believe people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do. I intend to tell you tonight. You ought to be able to know, and then judge for yourself.
If you entrust me with the presidency, I will put our democracy back in your hands, and get all the special-interest money -- all of it -- out of our democracy, by enacting campaign finance reform. I feel so strongly about this, I promise you that campaign finance reform will be the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I send to Congress.
Let others try to restore the old guard. We come to this convention as the change we wish to see in America.
And what are those changes?
At a time when most Americans will live to know even their great-grandchildren, we will save and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, not only for this generation, but for generations to come.
At a time of almost unimaginable medical breakthroughs, we will fight for affordable health care for all, so patients and ordinary people are not left powerless and broke. We will move toward universal health coverage, step by step, starting with all children. Let's get all children covered by the year 2004.
And let's move to the day when we end the stigma of mental illness, and treat it like every other illness, everywhere in this nation.
Within the next few years, scientists will identify the genes that cause every type of cancer. We need a national commitment equal to the promise of this unequalled moment. So we will double the federal investment in medical research. We will find new medicines and new cures, not just for cancer, but for everything from diabetes to HIV/AIDS.
At a time when there is more computer power in a Palm Pilot than in the spaceship that took Neil Armstrong to the moon, we will offer all our people lifelong learning and new skills for the higher-paying jobs of the future.
At a time when the amount of human knowledge is doubling every five years, we will do bold things to make our schools the best in the world. I will fight for the single greatest commitment to education since the G.I. Bill.
For revolutionary improvements in our schools. For higher standards and more accountability. To put a fully qualified teacher in every classroom, test all new teachers and give teachers the training and professional development they deserve. It's time to treat and reward teachers like the professionals they are.
It's not just about more money. It's about higher standards, accountability, new ideas. But we can't do it without new resources. And that's why I will invest far more in our schools; in the long-run, a second-class education always costs more than a first-class education.
And I will not go along with any plan that would drain taxpayer money away from our public schools and give it to private schools in the form of vouchers.
This nation was a pioneer of universal public education. Now let's set a specific new goal for the first decade of the 21st century: high-quality universal pre-school - available to every child, in every family, all across this country.
We also have to give middle-class families help in paying for college with tax-free college savings, and by making most college tuition tax-deductible. Open the doors of learning to all.
And all of this, all of this, is the change we wish to see in America.
Not so long ago, a balanced budget seemed impossible. Now our budget surpluses make it possible to give a full range of targeted tax cuts to working families. Not just to help you save for college, but to pay for health insurance or child care. To reform the estate tax, so people can pass on a small business or a family farm. And to end the marriage penalty, the right way, the fair way, because we shouldn't force couples to pay more in income taxes just because they're married.
But let me say it plainly: I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.
Under the tax plan the other side has proposed, for every $10 that goes to the wealthiest one percent, middle-class families would get one dime. And lower-income families would get one penny.
In fact, if you add it up, the average family would get about enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a day.
About 62 cents in change. Let me tell you: that's not the kind of change I'm working for.
I'll fight for tax cuts that go to the right people, to the working families who have the toughest time paying taxes and saving for the future.
I'll fight for a new, tax-free way to help you save and build a bigger nest egg for your retirement. I'm talking about something extra that you can save and invest for yourself. Something that will supplement Social Security, not be subtracted from it.
But I will not go along with any proposal to strip one out of every six dollars from the Social Security trust fund and privatize the Social Security that you're counting on. That's Social Security minus. Our plan is Social Security plus.
We will balance the budget every year, and dedicate the budget surplus first to saving Social Security.
In the next four years, we will pay off all the national debt this nation accumulated in our first 200 years. This will put us on the path to completely eliminating the debt by 2012, keeping America prosperous far into the future.
But there's something at stake in this election that's even more important than economic progress. Simply put, it's our values; it's our responsibility to our loved ones, to our families.
And to me, family values means honoring our fathers and mothers, teaching our children well, caring for the sick, respecting one another, giving people the power to achieve what they want for their families.
Putting both Social Security and Medicare in an iron-clad lock box where the politicians can't touch them, to me, that kind of common sense is a family value.
Getting cigarettes out of the hands of kids before they get hooked is a family value. I will crack down on the marketing of tobacco to our children, no matter how hard the tobacco companies lobby, no matter how much they spend.
A new prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all our seniors, that's a family value. And let me tell you: I will fight for it, and the other side will not. They give in to the big drug companies. Their plan tells seniors to beg the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for prescription drug coverage.
And that's the difference in this election. They're for the powerful, and we're for the people.
Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the H.M.O.'s -- sometimes you have to be willing to stand up and say no, so families can have a better life.
I know one thing about the job of the president. It is the only job in the Constitution that is charged with the responsibility of fighting for all the people. Not just the people of one state or one district; not just the wealthy or the powerful, all the people. Especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up, so they are never left behind.
So I say to you tonight: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will fight for you.
There's one other word we've heard a lot of in this campaign, and that word is honor.
To me, honor is not just a word, but an obligation.
And you have my word: We will honor hard work by raising the minimum wage so that work always pays more than welfare.
We will honor families by expanding child care and after-school care and family and medical leave, so working parents have the help they need to care for their children, because one of the most important jobs of all is raising our children.
And we'll support the right of parents to decide that one of them will stay home longer with their babies if that's what they believe is best for their families.
We will honor the ideal of equality by standing up for civil rights and defending affirmative action.
We will honor equal rights and fight for an equal day's pay for an equal day's work.
And let there be no doubt: I will protect and defend a woman's right to choose. The last thing this country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade.
We will remove all the old barriers, so that those who are called disabled can develop all their abilities.
And we will also widen the circle of opportunity for all Americans, renew the Voting Rights Act, and enforce all our civil rights laws.
We will pass the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.
And we will honor the memory of Matthew Shepard, Joseph Ileto, and James Byrd, whose families all joined us this week, by passing a law against hate crimes.
We will honor the hard work of raising a family, by doing all we can to help parents protect their children. Parents deserve the simple security of knowing that their children are safe whether they're walking down the street, surfing the World Wide Web, or sitting behind a desk in school.
To make families safer, we passed the toughest crime bill in history, and we're putting 100,000 new community police on our streets. Crime has fallen in every major category for seven years in a row. But there's still too much danger and there's still too much fear.
So tonight I want to set another new, specific goal: to cut the crime rate year after year, every single year throughout this decade.
That's why I'll fight to add another 50,000 new police, community police who help prevent crime by establishing real relationships between law enforcement and neighborhood residents, which, incidentally, is the opposite of racial profiling, which must be brought to an end.
I will fight for a crime victims' bill of rights, including a constitutional amendment to make sure that victims, and not just criminals, are guaranteed rights in our justice system.
I'll fight to toughen penalties on those who misuse the Internet to prey on our children and violate our privacy. And I'll fight to make every school in this nation drug-free and gun-free.
I believe in the right of sportsmen and hunters and law-abiding citizens to own firearms. But I want mandatory background checks to keep guns away from criminals, and mandatory child safety locks to protect our children.
Tipper and I went out to Columbine High School after the tragedy there, and we embraced the families of the children who were lost. And I will never forget the words of the father who whispered into my ear, "Promise me that these children will not have died in vain."
All of us must join together to make that promise come true. Laws and programs by themselves will never be enough. All of us, and especially all parents need to take more responsibility. We need to change our hearts and make a commitment to our children and to one another.
I'm excited about America's prospects and full of hope for America's future. Our country has come a long way, and I've come a long way since that long ago time when I went to Vietnam.
I've never forgotten what I saw there and the bravery of so many young Americans.
The price of freedom is sometimes high, but I never believed that America should turn inward.
As a senator, I broke with many in our party and voted to support the Gulf War when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, because I believed America's vital interests were at stake.
Early in my public service, I took up the issue of nuclear arms control and nuclear weapons, because nothing is more fundamental than protecting our national security.
Now I want to lead America because I love America. I will keep America's defenses strong. I will make sure our armed forces continue to be the best-equipped, best-trained, and best-led in the entire world.
In the last century, this nation more than any other freed the world from fascism and communism. But a newly free world still has dangers and challenges, both old and new. We must always have the will to defend our enduring interests, from Europe, to the Middle East, to Japan and Korea. We must strengthen our partnerships with Africa, Latin America, and the rest of the developing world.
We must welcome and promote truly free trade. But I say to you: it must be fair trade. We must set standards to end child labor, to prevent the exploitation of workers and the poisoning of the environment. Free trade can and must be, and if I'm President, will be a way to lift everyone up, not bring anyone down to the lowest common denominator.
So those are the issues, and that's where I stand. But I also want to tell you just a little more about two of my greatest heroes, my father and my mother.
They did give me a good life. But like so many in America, they started out with almost nothing.
My father grew up in a small community named Possum Hollow in Middle Tennessee. When he was just 18, he went to work as a teacher in a one-room school.
Then the Great Depression came along and taught him a lesson that couldn't be found in any classroom. He told me and my sister often how he watched grown men, with wives and children they could neither feed nor clothe, on farms they could no longer pay for.
My father didn't know whether he could help those families, but he believed he had to try. And never in the years to come -- in Congress, and in the United States Senate -- did he lose sight of the reason he entered public service: to fight for the people, not the powerful.
My mother grew up in a poor farming community in northwest Tennessee. Her family ran a small country store in Cold Corner. A store that went bust during the Great Depression.
She worked her way through college, then got a room in Nashville at the Y.W.C.A. and waited tables at an all-night coffee shop for 25-cent tips. She then went on to become one of the first women in history to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.
As Tipper told you tonight, we lost my dad a year and a half ago. But we're so lucky that my mother Pauline continues to be part of our lives, every single day. She's here tonight.
Sometimes in this campaign, when I visit a school and see a hard-working teacher trying to change the world one child at a time, I see the face of my father.
And I know that teaching our children well is not just the teacher's job; it's everyone's job. And it has to be our national mission.
I've shaken hands in diners and coffee shops all across this country. And sometimes, when I see a waitress working hard and thanking someone for a tip, I see the face of my mother. And I know: For that waitress carrying trays, or a construction worker in the winter cold, I will never agree to raise the retirement age to 70 or threaten the promise of Social Security.
I say to you tonight: We've got to win this election, because every hard-working American family deserves to open the door to their dream.
In our democracy, the future is not something that just happens to us; it is something we make for ourselves, together.
So to the young people watching tonight, I say: This is your time to make new the life of our world. We need your help to rekindle the spirit of America.
And I ask all of you, my fellow citizens: from this city that marked both the end of America's journey westward and the beginning of the New Frontier, let us set out on a new journey to the best America. A new journey on which we advance not by the turning of wheels, but by the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision, the daring grace of the human spirit.
Yes, we have our problems. But the United States of America is the best country ever created, and still, as ever, the hope of humankind.
Yes, we're all imperfect. But as Americans we all share in the privilege and challenge of building a more perfect union.
I know my own imperfections. I know that sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight.
But the presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to choose to do what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes, you have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.
There are big choices ahead, and our whole future is at stake. And I do have strong beliefs about it.
If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician.
But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you down.
If we allow ourselves to believe, without reservation, that we can do what's right and be the better for it, then the best America will become our America.
In this City of Angels, we can summon the better angels of our nature.
Do not rest where we are, or retreat. Do all we can to make America all it can become.
Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.

HEADLINE: Mr. Gore Steps Forward

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore accepted the Democratic presidential nomination last night with a forceful address designed to humanize him to the voters and to accelerate his drive to free himself from the understudy's role. Imploring Americans to take a fresh look at his life experiences and values, Mr. Gore issued a calculated declaration of independence from President Clinton. "We're electing a new president, and I stand here tonight as my own man," he asserted, promising to fight against "powerful forces" on behalf of working Americans. And in a striking, unmistakable reference to the scandals of recent years, he drew a thunderous ovation by promising, "I will work for you every day and I will never let you down."
Yet the center of Mr. Gore's sales pitch invoked the Clinton administration's economic record and laid out a budgetary approach that will clearly be a main theme of his campaign against Gov. George W. Bush. The vice president repeatedly hammered Mr. Bush as someone who would squander the surplus on "a huge tax cut for the wealthy." Just as ardently he portrayed himself, over and over, as someone who would "fight for working families." 
 He argued that the current economic abundance had brought an extraordinary opportunity to address the ills of American society.
Racing through his speech and sometimes even stepping on his own applause lines, he offered an unusually detailed outline of the case for using the budget surplus to save Social Security and Medicare, provide prescription drugs to the elderly and offer limited tax cuts to help the middle class pay for college and health care. In a sense it was like a State of the Union address, but with an almost bellicose declaration that "for all our good times, I am not satisfied."
Mr. Gore did not enter the Staples Center in Los Angeles with Mr. Clinton's gladiatorial dash through the corridors. Instead he came down an aisle as a determined underdog with a clear tactical mission. His campaign hopes the traditional convention "bounce" will put him within a few points of Governor Bush just as voters start to focus on the issues. The paradox is that voters do side with Mr. Gore on many issues he emphasized last night, particularly the economy and social concerns like gun control, abortion rights and protecting the environment. But to the dismay of Democrats, their agreement has not translated into political dominance or public acclaim for him.
The twin goals of Mr. Gore's acceptance speech were clear. He was inviting listeners to look beyond the candidates' personalities to the issues that would make them very different presidents. He also hopes that the voters will rethink the stereotype of him as an automaton more comfortable with abstractions than with the everyday worries that Mr. Clinton empathized with, almost to the point of self-parody. Trying to turn his political defects into virtues, the vice president acknowledged that "sometimes people say I'm too serious." But one of his biggest ovations came when he declared: "The presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people." In a kind of homage to his father's New Deal economic populism, Mr. Gore introduced members of the audience who he said deserved fairer, more caring treatment from a government that should not bestow undeserved tax-cut windfalls on the wealthy.
After a week of the Democrats' hanging out at movie studios, it was striking how Mr. Gore tried to appeal to Americans alienated from the content of popular entertainment. Echoing the longstanding campaign of both his wife, Tipper, and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, he declared that "we must challenge a culture with too much meanness, and not enough meaning."
It was said by Mr. Gore's staff that the vice president, a former newspaper reporter, had written his speech himself, and the address seemed to galvanize him. It drew waves of ovations from an audience that sometimes appeared impressed that he was trying -- often successfully -- to rise above his usual plodding delivery. Mr. Gore clearly did what he needed to do and impressed and perhaps surprised his audience in the process. He moved his party to full-throated support, and he sharply defined the battle lines for what could now turn into a close race over real policy differences.

A Man of Many Tasks

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Al Gore tried to accomplish a political feat so daunting tonight that even the maestro himself, President Clinton, might have had trouble pulling it off.
Mr. Gore presented himself as his own man and virtually skated over his service as vice president as he sought to persuade the nation that he is more than the dutiful lieutenant. But he also tried to take credit for helping to bring about "the biggest surpluses" ever -- the grandest achievement of the Clinton era. 
 He tried to shake the impressions of Americans who, in the words of his campaign chairman, think he is "boring, stiff" and "unable to speak." But he also asserted that he would build a campaign based on the dry timber of issues rather than on the flash and dazzle of personality.
He tried to embolden and excite liberals whose turnout are essential to his victory. But he also tried, though less aggressively, to embolden and excite moderate voters who are crucial to a victory in November -- and have shown an interest in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has alarmed Democrats.
Mr. Gore's elaborate -- and often conflicting -- objectives tonight, and throughout this convention week, reflect the trying challenges he and the Democrats confront as they emerge from this convention. Forget the confetti and mirthful talk of harmony from the rostrum. For the Democrats, happy days are certainly not here again. They may not be panicked, but they are jittery about their standard-bearer. And they are jittery about November.
"It will be a difficult campaign," said James Patrick Leahy, a delegate from Ohio, even after four days of enforced partisan cheerleading. "Gore has one of those personalities you have to develop a relationship with."
The polls showing Mr. Gore behind, Mr. Leahy said, have dampened his enthusiasm. "The polling has a psychological effect," he said. "It's like when you go to the race track and look at the racing form and see your horse isn't supposed to do well."
There were no such worries when the Republicans concluded their political production in Philadelphia two weeks ago. At that convention, Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee, did not have to scurry from constituent group to constituent group with words of appeasement -- as Senator Joseph I. Lieberman did today, and the two days before.
After eight years on the outside, even Republican delegates who were not pleased with the inclusive tone of their program were so desperate to return to power that it took little, if any, prodding to corral them behind Mr. Bush. Eight years ago, Democrats were also willing to put aside their differences in the name of the greater goal of helping Bill Clinton bring them back to power. Now, they are less accommodating.
So the party tried to fire up the rank and file by jamming the stage this week with liberal icons like Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and leaders of labor, abortion rights and gay rights groups. Even Mr. Lieberman, in his speech, retreated from his usual condemnation of the collapsed culture of Hollywood and instead played the partisan. And tonight, Mr. Gore aimed his message squarely at the party base -- and away from the broader messages of Mr. Clinton's two acceptance speeches -- by sounding traditional Democratic themes of abortion, affirmative action and government spending.
More than one Democratic offical complained that the campaign this week seemed more focused on winning over the liberals who might back Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, than the bigger threat, Mr. Bush.
"The Republicans played to the country -- the Democrats played to the hall," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "Voters saw through the big tent Republican convention. They know it was staged. But they were thankful that somebody cared."
Mr. Gore's address was carefully calibrated to offer a nod to the man with whom he has such a complicated relationship -- and to move on swiftly. In the 5,100-word text, the vice president mentioned Mr. Clinton only once, declaring, "Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton."
He also, subtly, sought to put some distance between himself and a leader who had disappointed, if not embarrassed, the nation. "I will never let you down," he said.
The unknowing listener would not have a clue of what arguably makes Mr. Gore best prepared to be president: that he has served the past eight years as vice president. The thinking of Mr. Gore's campaign is that no matter how active a political partner he was, voters will never give a vice president credit.
Part of the problem is Al Gore. Whether it is his link to the scandals of Mr. Clinton, the unfavorable comparisons to the more politically adroit president -- or simply his personality -- Democrats here are just not as enamored of their new nominee. On this day four years ago, even the bombshell that Mr. Clinton's top strategist was having an affair with a call girl did nothing to disrupt -- and maybe added a little spice -- to the week of lock-step partisan harmony behind the president.
Hours before his boss was to deliver the most consequential speech of his political career, one of Mr. Gore's top aides confessed that he was worried because the campaign was still roiled by squabbling factions. "Bill Daley has not gotten the warlords under control yet," this campaign official said, referring to William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman.
It was no accident, certainly, that Mr. Gore spewed out lots of policy tonight. He was trying to make the case that "people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do."
Mindful of polls showing that the public gives Democrats higher marks than Republicans on a range of issues, Mr. Gore's aides said they hope the campaign can be fought on that terrain.
Before he can do that, Mr. Gore wants to neutralize Governor Bush's biggest advantage -- his appealing personality. That explains that footage in a film tonight lauding Mr. Gore for his Frankenstein disguise during a Halloween party. That is why all week Democrats, and the candidate himself, offered testaments to the fuzzy and decidedly un-vice presidential side of Mr. Gore.
Mr. Gore made only glancing blows at the Republicans and he did not directly cite his opponent by name even once. But clearly acknowleding that Mr. Bush had the edge on charm, Mr. Gore said, "The presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to chose to do what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong."
Even then-Vice President George Bush, in his acceptance speech in New Orleans in 1988, did not face the difficulties of Mr. Gore. He, too, had the unfortunate fate of having to stand on his own after eight years in the shadow of a far more dexterous political performer. But Mr. Bush never had such trouble untangling himself from Ronald Reagan.
The symbolic transfer of political power was far smoother in 1988 when Mr. Reagan put forth a dignified and full-throated pitch for his No. 2. This week, Mr. Clinton was criticized for not making more of an energetic case for Mr. Gore in his speech here on Monday -- or in their joint appearance in Michigan the next day. The rub is that had he been more generous in his praise, Mr. Clinton might have been accused of injecting himself too much into the role of star performer giving an assist to his understudy.
In his speech tonight, Mr. Gore seemed to borrow a bit from the playbook of the man whose son is standing in his way to the White House. He addressed the personality issue head on, saying, "If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician." But in what could be interpreted as a dig at Mr. Bush -- who is known as less engaged on the issues than Mr. Gore -- he pledged, "I will work for you every day."
Here's what Mr. Bush said in 1988: "I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned that eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of country."And, as Mr. Bush did 12 years ago, Mr. Gore sought to fasten himself to the economic successes of his administration.
It could be that the appeal will work and, as happened with Mr. Bush, that people will entrust Mr. Gore to continue bringing the nation down the path of prosperity.
But in a telling acknowledgment that the campaign ahead will not be easy, Mr. Gore's aides were already playing down the import of tonight.
"This is an important moment, a crescendo," said Tad Devine, one of Mr. Gore's top strategists. " But there will be other big moments in this campaign, including the presidential debates."
Sooner or later, though, Mr. Gore will run out of big moments. And tonight may have been his best opportunity to accomplish what he has tried again and again in this race for president: to reintroduce himself to the people.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS: THE OVERVIEW;
GORE, IN DEBUT AS A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, SAYS 'I STAND HERE TONIGHT AS MY OWN MAN'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his debut as the Democratic presidential nominee tonight with a vow to work for all Americans, "especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind."
Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Mr. Gore said, "I stand here tonight as my own man" -- a clear rejoinder to the Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of President Clinton. Transcript, Page A21-22. 
 The vice president told a whooping crowd at the Staples Center on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles that he would give working families "a full range of targeted tax cuts," including an early end to the so-called marriage penalty and a reform of the federal estate tax. But his proposals stopped well short of those made by his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
In a pointed reference to Mr. Bush's promise to cut federal income taxes by more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Mr. Gore said, "I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process."
In what sounded like a subtle attempt to distance himself from Mr. Clinton, he promised, "I will never let you down." And he was careful to confine his criticism of the opposition to policies rather than personalities.
Trailing Mr. Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the outcome, Mr. Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a fall campaign in which he would identify himself as the friend of the little guy and Mr. Bush as the candidate of the rich, powerful and influential.
"Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few, but all working families," the vice president declared.
Again and again, he spoke of unspecified "powerful forces" and "powerful interests," which he implicitly identified with the Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of "the malefactors of great wealth" in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's castigation of "economic royalists" during the New Deal.
"I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many businesses and new enterprises have done well," Mr. Gore said. "This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on working families -- people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by their kids."
The economy is in many ways Mr. Gore's greatest asset on the stump. Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in no foreign war.
But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of electricity that follows Mr. Clinton everywhere. And Mr. Clinton's speech on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. "All he did was, he made a good case for Clinton," said Gerald Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's image-maker.
Even in this most important hour of Mr. Gore's career, the shadow of Mr. Clinton fell across his path. It was disclosed in Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.
Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign, defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective conventions.
Mr. Bush, Professor Popkin said, needed to show some gravitas, while Mr. Gore needed to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he was not a lightweight, the other to lighten up.
By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was less clear how much the Democrat had improved on his image as a plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.
Mr. Gore's speech had few rhetorical flourishes or unexpected policy departures and fewer flashes of humor. Speaking more quickly than usual, Mr. Gore poured out a flood of words; sometimes he sounded like a man with his car double-parked. But he gestured more than Mr. Bush had, and was altogether more animated.
The speech, which lasted for 52 minutes, was a shopping list, and Mr. Gore acknowledged he may have sounded like a policy wonk. He even admitted, "I won't always be the most exciting politician."
Still, he hit hard on key points, sometimes almost shouting to drive home his message. And the crowd cheered wildly when he promised to preserve abortion rights, to oppose school vouchers and to support affirmative action.
One of the biggest cheers came when he promised that a comprehensive campaign spending reform bill would be the first he sent to Congress if he was elected. But he did not commit himself to the most stringent such measure -- the one sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.
"Go, Al, go!" the crowd chanted, waving blue-and-white "Gore" signs.
Mr. Gore, continuing his string of promises, said that as president he would provide universal child health insurance by 2004, universal preschool education of a high quality by 2010 and use federal funds to put 50,000 more police officers on the streets of American cities.
Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention "bounce" in opinion polls about Mr. Gore's candidacy, but their ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Mr. Bush. The Texas governor agreed today to three debates with the vice president, starting in early October, as well as two between the vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement as to the debates' length or format.
Mr. Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers, including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.
Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend, and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Mr. Gore while both were stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in the Army.
Mr. Gore served in Vietnam while Mr. Bush did not, a point Mr. Gore emphasized in his speech as he has done on the stump throughout the campaign.
"I was an Army reporter in Vietnam," he said. "When I was there, I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform."
Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to introduce him. An amateur photographer, she called her husband "a decisive leader with strong values" and showed a series of shots from what she described as "the family photo album."
Mr. Gore entered through the crowd, high-fiving several delegates, then ascended the stage to give Mrs. Gore, dressed in a sky-blue silk dress and coat, a robust bearhug. There was in Mr. Gore's speech, much of which he wrote himself, an echo of Mrs. Gore's past attacks on popular music that features explicit sexual content.
"I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning," he said. "And as president I will stand with you for a goal we all share: to give more power back to the parents, to choose what your own children are exposed to, so you can pass on your family's basic lessons of responsibility and decency."
Among Mr. Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.
"If I'm your president," he declared, "I'm going to keep on having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, everyday heroism of working families."
The vice president underlined that point by introducing people in the audience who, he said, had taught him about key issues when he met them during the campaign -- an Iowa woman who needed a tax cut to help pay for her daughter's college education, for example, and a Hispanic family from Texas who long for a less crowded, better-built school for their children.
Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a national journey to a New Frontier when nominated here in Los Angeles 40 years ago, Mr. Gore urged his listeners tonight to "set out on a new journey to the best America."
He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used tonight, a journey "on which we advance not by the turning of wheels, but by the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision and the daring grace of the human spirit."

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS: THE SPEECH;
Gore, the Contender at Last, Proves to Be a Crowd Pleaser

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
If Bill Clinton's backstage walk to valediction on Monday was a heavyweight champion's last indulgent moment in the sun, Al Gore's arrival in the Staples Center tonight was a dogged contender's first chance to enter the arena alone. He strode through a sea of pennants down a side aisle with a posse of seconds trailing humbly in his wake.
By the time Mr. Gore had climbed the gray-carpeted steps of the podium and wrapped his wife, Tipper, in a sweeping embrace and a long kiss, the giant arena was shaking as if struck by a California earthquake, strobe lights were flickering, tears were streaking delegates' faces, and the crowd was utterly his. 
 Speaking unusually quickly, confidently, even ebulliently at times, Mr. Gore seemed determined to shake the plodding pace and the tone of condescension that often mark his formal speeches. He virtually raced through a litany of causes and issues dear to core Democratic constituencies, from health care to civil rights, affirmative action, public education, and abortion rights, with perhaps the biggest applause line of all that "the last thing this country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade."
After eight years of loyal service to a consummate, intuitive political performer, Mr. Gore left no doubt from the start tonight that he was determined to present himself without Mr. Clinton's shadow darkening his center stage. When he said, "I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am," his young speechwriter, Eli Attie, and his image-meister, Carter Eskew, watching from just below the podium, slapped a high-five in satisfaction.
Nearly 50 minutes later, at the end of his speech, Mr. Gore even found his own formulation of Mr. Clinton's 1992 pledge to stay with the voters of New Hampshire until the "last dog dies," by vowing: "If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day, and I will never let you down."
The contrast with the disappointment that Mr. Clinton's personal conduct has caused Democrats was unspoken but perfectly clear.
As they climbed the aisles to the press section afterward, Mr. Gore's aides took particular satisfaction at the way he had defined himself and made his argument for election, as when he said: "This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have. Tonight I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, more prosperous America we can build together."
The vice president's aides also expressed surprise that Mr. Gore had finished his speech far faster than in any of his repeated rehearsals with a teleprompter.
Notably, for a candidate with proven skill at cut-and-thrust, Mr. Gore made not a single direct mention of his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and very few indirect ones.
About the closest he came to a direct attack was his vow to fight against tax cuts for the wealthy, and fight for prescription drug benefits for the elderly. "And that's the difference in this election," he said. "They're for the powerful, and we're for the people."
This was a convention week in which conventional wisdom held that Mr. Gore needed to knock one out of the park tonight. Only time will tell how he touched the television audience, which matters most, but many delegates here, perhaps in reflection of the glittery, giddy high of the moment, said he had done just that.
"Oh, my gosh, I was moved to tears -- I'm so proud of him," said Dianna Johnson, a delegate from Virginia who grew up in Tennessee.
Kevin Whalen, a Massachusetts delegate, said: "He kept right on the issues, and the issues are what will help him win in November. His style was great. He absolutely was not wooden. As Tiger Woods would say, he brought his A game."
Marcia Hale, a longtime Clinton aide who came back this season to help manage the convention for Mr. Gore, flashed a thumbs-up sign as she passed journalists on deadline. "I think he showed his own persona," she said, "and he told his own story and he said it clearly and with emotion."
Afterward, as star-shaped mylar balloons, and red, white and blue rubber ones, and gold and silver confetti fired from air cannons filled the air, the newly minted nominee was joined on stage by a pantheon of the Democratic family, winners and losers, past and present alike, from his primary rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, to John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. When Mr. Gore finally made his way through the tunnel off the speaker's platform, delegates were straining to shake his hand or snap his picture, and a new aura surrounded him.
From late afternoon on, the energy in the hall had built steadily. Souvenir stands that were all but deserted on Wednesday suddenly had long lines. Aisles that had been passable were filled to overflowing. Air-conditioning that had been icy seemed just a bit less cold. By 5:30 p.m., the stage was groaning with a gaggle of party leaders and dignitaries.
By the time Mr. Gore's wife was introduced by their daughter Kristin an hour later, there was pandemonium. Mickey Hart, the old Grateful Dead drummer, beat a tom-tom on stage, and Mrs. Gore, radiant in powder blue, shook and boogied, clapped and high-fived. What seemed like an ocean of round red, white and blue signs reading "Tipper Rocks" bobbed in the hall.
Mrs. Gore, an accomplished amateur photographer, narrated pictures from a family album interspersed in a video that paid tribute to Mr. Gore's service in Vietnam, his journalism career and his virtues as a family man. She concluded over stirring music, "To me, for all the past accomplishments and future promises, he's still the man I fell in love with in high school."

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS: THE RUNNING MATE;
To Both the Left and the Center, Lieberman Revels in a 'Love Fest'

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Demonstrating some of the political dexterity that has kept him in public office for 30 years, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman tried today to rally support from leaders of his party's liberal wing and then a few hours later had lunch with fellow members of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.
 
 Each group greeted him with hugs and kisses all around.
"A love-fest" is how Mr. Lieberman's campaign manager, Thomas R. Nides, described the sessions, shaking his head in wonderment at Mr. Lieberman's appeal.
 Thus, in only a few hours, Mr. Lieberman gave a glimpse of what will be one of his major goals in the critical weeks of campaigning to come: reassuring the party's liberal base while keeping faith with his moderate allies in the Democratic Leadership Council, of which he is the chairman.
 Mr. Lieberman began his day by meeting with leaders of labor groups, teachers unions and women's groups. In the morning sessions, he spoke of fighting for working families, of breaking down econcomic barriers for all groups. At lunch, he spoke the language of the centrist New Democrats, talking about the virtues of personal responsibility, for example, and describing government as a catalyst for social improvement, but no more.
 With his willingness to tailor his political messages to different audiences, Mr. Leiberman displayed a competitive streak somewhat at odds with his reputation as the conscience of the United States Senate, as a politician who speaks his mind without regard to the consequences.
 "We didn't come to play, we came to win," Mr. Lieberman told the Democratic Leadership Coucnil, adding, "I'm from the Vinnie Lombardi school. Winning is the whole deal."
 In his morning meetings, Mr. Lieberman continued what has been a weeklong effort to persuade the party's liberal base that he will be a loyal soldier to Al Gore, who is markedly left of Mr. Lieberman on several issues that are of deep importance to the liberal wing.
 For example, in meeting with education leaders, including representatives from the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, Mr. Lieberman made clear that he continued to support experimental programs of providing low-income parents with vouchers to help pay for their children to attend private schools.
 Many education leaders bitterly oppose vouchers, and Mr. Gore himself has called them a threat to the nation's system of public schools. Mr. Lieberman told the leaders that while he would not hesitate to share his views with Mr. Gore in private, he would firmly support Mr. Gore's ultimate policy positions.
 And so, as he has all week, Mr. Lieberman focused this morning on areas of agreement while playing down some of his more conservative views.

HEADLINE: Orthodontics Via Silicon Valley;
A Start-Up Uses Computer Modeling And Venture Capital to Reach Patients

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The business of straightening teeth has always been a small-scale, fairly low-tech affair -- a one-on-one interaction between orthodontist and patient, usually an adolescent.
Colored "designer" bands and clear ceramic brackets held in place by a wire may have supplanted the tortured metal-mouth look, but this has been a world of incremental change mostly beyond the reach of computers, Wall Street and the other trappings of the new economy. 
 Until now. It seems a stretch that a classic Silicon Valley start-up could create a role for itself in this highly local profession, but that is exactly what seems to be happening with Align Technology, a manufacturer of a clear-plastic alternative to braces aimed at appearance-conscious adults.
Zia Chishti and Kelsey Wirth, the young co-founders of Align, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., drew the attention of many orthodontists with their claim that computers could be used to design and make a customized series of plastic retainers for each patient that would gradually move their teeth as prescribed by the orthodontist.
"Believe me, this is the last thing I ever thought I'd do," said Ms. Wirth, Align's 30-year-old president, recalling how she hated her braces in high school. But, she said, Mr. Chishti's vision of the technology seemed to fit her search for an opportunity to "build a company and revolutionize an industry."
Unlike braces advertised as invisible but held in place by a wire, Align's product is transparent. Instead of visiting the orthodontist to have braces adjusted, patients would simply switch to the next retainer in the series every two weeks.
Align claims that roughly half the nation's 8,500 orthodontists have attended a seminar and invested in the equipment necessary to offer its product, an astonishingly rapid technology deployment for such a conservative industry.
Now, armed with promising early results and backed by venture capital on a scale that has stunned the industry, Align is unrolling the most aggressive consumer advertising plan the dental profession has ever seen. "It has to be 10 times more than anyone else has ever done," said Charles Schultz, general manager of GAC International, a leading supplier of braces and other orthodontic supplies.
The Align system, marketed under the Invisalign brand, is already inspiring competitors. For instance, GAC recently began offering an all-plastic device designed by Dr. Keith Hilliard, a Florida orthodontist. That device, formed in the orthodontist's office by drawing a vacuum seal over a model of the mouth, can be adjusted by the orthodontist to push teeth in a desired direction using pliers.
Align's ambitious plans are based on research gathered by the American Association of Orthodontists concluding that although fewer than 1 percent of American adults have severe orthodontic problems, more than 100 million adults with lesser dental irregularities are potential candidates for orthodontics. Only 400,000, or one-half of one percent of adults, get braces each year, so Align believes there is a huge untapped market.
"Some people don't care about their appearance, and others do but can't tolerate the burdens of correcting it," said Mr. Chishti, Align's 29-year-old chief executive. "We are going to attack both groups with marketing, and it will be a huge market-expansion opportunity for everyone."
Competitors in the $450 million orthodontics supply industry are hoping so. They are eagerly awaiting the biggest step yet in Align's marketing program -- a $31 million campaign starting in September that will be the first effort by an orthodontics products company to appeal directly to consumers through television.
The expectation is that many consumers responding to the ads will instead end up persuaded to try more standard treatments. Some will discover that they have more severe problems than Align is willing to tackle, and others are likely to balk at the 50 percent premium over braces that many orthodontists charge for Invisalign.
Invisalign starts with an orthodontist making an imprint of the patient's teeth in a plastic material that is sent to Align along with the orthodontist's prescription of how the teeth should be moved to attain a desired final appearance.
Patients with severe overbites, underbites and other serious problems are excluded, as are all children because growing jaws and erupting teeth are too complicated for Align's computer to model. But if the adult's deformities are mild enough to fall within Align's specification, Align develops an animated computer program -- a process that takes three weeks to a month and is handled by computer technicians in Pakistan -- that can be downloaded over the Internet and will show how the teeth will move.
Once the treatment plan depicted by the animation is approved by the patient's orthodontist, the specifications are transmitted to Align's manufacturing plant in Mexico. The patient gets the first aligner six weeks after the initial visit. Most treatments require 20 to 60 aligners, which are worn approximately two weeks each. If the patient is following directions, they are taken off only for eating and tooth-brushing.
Orthodontists have mixed feelings about Align. Jennifer Salzer, whose practice is on Park Avenue in New York, is in the fifth month of wearing the aligners. She and her partners have more than 40 patients using them. "People who don't get involved are going to be left behind," she told 135 orthodontists and assistants who attended a one-day course Align offered in New York recently.
The New York audience included plenty of skeptics who said that Invisalign would make sense for only a small percentage of their patients, many of whom might fare just as well with a retainer, which is far cheaper. A treatment that might cost several thousand dollars with Invisalign might be done for several hundred dollars with a retainer, they say. Others said that treatment with the aligners, like all removable dental appliances, is prone to failure if patients do not wear them around the clock.
Align asserts that orthodontists using Invisalign have increased profits on the order of 30 percent because, without the need to adjust braces, they need less "chair time" for each patient. But some said that orthodontists who work mostly with children could find productivity going down if Invisalign brings in more adults, because adults always take up more time with questions than children.
Whatever their doubts, orthodontists who delay preparing to offer Invisalign risk being viewed as behind the times once the television advertising campaign takes off, said Dr. George W. Scott, an orthodontist in Middletown, N.J., and former president of the New Jersey Orthodontists Association. "I'm here only because I'm afraid," he said with a laugh at the end of the New York meeting.
Many other orthodontists say their biggest fear is that Align's drive to grow will eventually lead it to offer its system through general dentists, thus eating into their practices.
Ms. Wirth said that Invisalign does nothing to simplify orthodontics and that the company could not rely on dentists to use it appropriately.
New technology has traditionally crept slowly into the market, with practitioners developing devices they eventually sold to companies like GAC International; the Ormco subsidiary of Sybron; or 3M Unitek, a subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. Some misunderstandings and suspicion seem inevitable given that Mr. Chishti and Ms. Wirth come out of the hothouse of Silicon Valley with no background in dentistry.
The two entrepreneurs met as classmates at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Mr. Chishti, a native of Pakistan who had been a consultant at McKinsey & Company and a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley, became intrigued at how his teeth, which had been straightened by braces, would drift out of position when he neglected to wear his plastic retainer and how the retainer moved them back to the proper place. It did not take much research to learn that orthodontists had been talking as far back as 1945 about the possibility of using a sequence of removable plastic appliances instead of braces to move teeth toward a predetermined end point. Many had used simple plastic devices fashioned in their offices for minor adjustments.
But no one could figure out how to make wider use of plastic aligners practical until Mr. Chishti and Ms. Wirth, a former environmental consultant and investment banker, set up Align in 1997 to apply computers to the problem. Not only could computers be used to design the sequence of aligners, they realized, but stereo lithography, a computer-driven process widely used by design engineers in industry for building plastic models layer by layer, could be the key to inexpensive automated production.
The first venture capitalists they approached did not share the vision. Some laughed at the idea of putting money into unfashionable orthodontic supplies, Ms. Wirth recalled. The industry leaders were equally unimpressed. GAC declined to invest because Align could not show them any results with patients, Mr. Schultz said.
But after Joseph S. Lacob, a general partner at Silicon Valley's most famous venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, became enthusiastic in 1997 just 15 minutes into Mr. Chishti's presentation, doors began to swing open.
The company recently collected $100 million from institutions and wealthy individuals in its fourth round of financing. It was managed by Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco-based investment bank where Ms. Wirth worked before heading for Stanford.
The company had offers for an additional $100 million to $200 million that it turned away, Ms. Wirth said. The next step is likely to be a public offering, possibly before the end of the year. Some orthodontists, like Dr. Michael Steinberg, of Millburn, N.J., say such a step would be encouraging because they want to be sure the company has the resources to stay in business if they are going to start many of their patients on treatments that can easily last more than a year.
Mr. Chishti is certainly prepared for a road show. He likes to drive home the point that the devices are next to invisible by nonchalantly popping out his current aligner, which invariably has gone unnoticed until that moment.
"It gets a good reaction," he said.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I was surprised by your Aug. 16 editorial suggesting that Rupert Murdoch, who owns The New York Post, should be barred from buying WWOR Channel 9. In 1993, I worked to help save the struggling newspaper. Mr. Murdoch was trying to buy it but needed a Federal Communications Commission waiver.
Frankly, the paper's demise would have been a benefit to me politically because it sharply disputed my positions for 12 years. But I believed then, as I do now, that its loss would be a tragedy, putting thousands of people out of work and striking a blow to journalistic diversity. The F.C.C. agreed and granted the waiver. 
 Not a lot has changed since 1993, except that media diversity here has increased. Also, The Post got its wish, and I'm now in the private sector. The Post has been very much a fiscal adventure for Mr. Murdoch, and I hope he does not change his mind about his investment; the purchase of Channel 9 may help assure that he doesn't.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Set a Record During June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened to a record $30.6 billion in June as the appetite for foreign crude oil increased even as prices were the highest in nearly 10 years.
The trade gap was far smaller than many experts had expected, however, and that contributes to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates for now. 
 The deficit expanded from $30.3 billion in May, which was revised down from the government's previous estimate of $31 billion, the Commerce Department reported today.
While the June trade gap was a record, it was slimmer than the $31.7 billion many economists had forecast.
"It seems to have stabilized," said Gerald Cohen, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
Total imports of goods and services were up $4.3 billion, to $121.2 billion in June, a record. Exports increased $4 billion, to a record $90.6 billion.
The increase in imports mostly reflected a jump in shipments of crude oil -- which rose $1.6 billion, to a record $8 billion -- automobiles, parts and engines, and consumer goods like televisions, videocassette recorders, stereos and toys. And imports of capital goods, including computer accessories and semiconductors, rose $800 million.
On the export side, the increase came from stronger demand for capital goods, which jumped $2.1 billion, to a record $31.2 billion, and industrial supplies, up $0.7 billion.
For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit averaged $177.6 billion, surpassing $116 billion for the period a year earlier.
Exports rose to $518.7 billion during the first six months of the year from $465 billion in the period a year earlier.
Economists say the wide deficits reflect the gap between America's remarkably strong economic performance and slower growth overseas.
But critics of the Clinton administration's say the imbalance reflects a failure of trade policies, which they contend have left American workers at the mercy of foreign nations with lower labor costs and lax environmental standards.
The trade deficit is the sole blot on an otherwise vibrant American economy, now in its longeststreak of uninterrupted growth.
In June, the amount of crude oil imported into the United States, 300.9 million barrels, was the highest since August 1998, when 300 million barrels were imported. The price of crude oil jumped from $24.16 a barrel in May to $26.65 in June, its highest level since November 1990, and is far above the June 1999 level of $14.52 a barrel.
Output limits by oil-producing nations have pushed crude oil prices up over the last year. But many analysts say prices will ease in the coming months on the expectation that production will eventually be increased.
The United States deficit with oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, jumped to $4.6 billion in June, a record, from $4.1 billion in May.

HEADLINE: Study Proposes New Strategy to Stem Global Warming

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
An influential expert on global warming who for nearly 20 years has pressed countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases now says the emphasis on carbon dioxide may be misplaced. Instead, he and a team of scientists have concluded that the quickest way to slow warming is to cut other such greenhouse gases first.
This strategy could help policy makers overcome a fundamental conflict in the debate over global warming: carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas in the air, is an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil -- and combustion of fossil fuels is the foundation of industrial societies. 
 The expert, Dr. James E. Hansen, and his colleagues conclude in a new analysis that the warming seen in recent decades has been caused mainly by other heat-trapping emissions -- methane, chlorofluorocarbons, black particles of diesel and coal soot and compounds that create the ozone in smog -- which are easier to control than carbon dioxide, with many of them already on the decline.
The team, which reported its findings this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the burning of fossil fuels, although substantially raising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, also produces a pall of particle haze that reflects as much of the sun's energy back into space as the release of carbon dioxide has trapped in the air, Dr. Hansen said.
The haze from combustion is likely to be cleaned up in coming years, removing its cooling sun-blocking effect, said Dr. Hansen, who is director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. And over the course of the century, he added, carbon dioxide levels will still have to be reduced to prevent further warming. Meanwhile, emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities may be decreasing; he said they shrank slightly in 1998 and 1999, even as the global economy grew.
As a result, he said, the world may find it easier and less costly to slow climate change than he and other scientists had thought, at least in the short term.
"The prospects for having a modest climate impact instead of a disastrous one are quite good, I think," Dr. Hansen said in an interview.
Some climatologists greeted Dr. Hansen's new paper with dismay, saying they feared it would be misused by skeptics about global warming or by critics of a proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which would commit industrialized nations to big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
Representatives of industries most vulnerable to restrictions on carbon dioxide welcomed the findings, saying they raised provocative questions about the need for vigorous action on the climate.
The strong reaction is largely a function of the major role that Dr. Hansen has played in propelling the greenhouse debate onto the public stage. In 1981, he was a principal author of one of the first papers spelling out the links between rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures.
In 1988, when a scorching American heat wave was at its peak and fires were consuming the Amazon, he testified before a Senate committee that human activities were changing the climate.
In the analysis, Dr. Hansen and his colleagues culled data and scientific papers on topics from rice production, which releases methane, to urban pollution, a source of ozone and sooty particles, to obtain detailed estimates of the rate of change in different greenhouse emissions. He then used established formulas for calculating how different amounts of the gases in the future would affect the inflow of energy from the sun and escape of heat from the earth.
Carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. But the other gases Dr. Hansen and his team cite are more prodigious trappers of heat. Moreover, Dr. Hansen said, in contrast to the difficulties of controlling carbon dioxide, technologies already exist for capturing or eliminating many of the other kinds of emissions.
"These are much more tractable," Dr. Hansen said, citing as an example existing systems for capturing methane produced by decomposing organic material in landfills.
Also, because many of these gases cause serious, costly health problems or can harm agriculture, there are "strong economic reasons for wanting to eliminate them," he said.
Some scientists criticized aspects of the new study, but agreed that an initial focus on the other greenhouse gases could achieve significant slowing of climate warming, as long as carbon dioxide cuts were also made.
Dr. John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental science and public policy at Harvard University, said any focus on cutting just one set of gases now would be a mistake. "This is not an either-or problem," Dr. Holdren said. "It's a both-and problem. We're going to need all the cuts we can get."
The paper has prompted a significant amount of scrambling by scientists and lobbyists who are trying to shape the response to global warming. Several hundred scientists in dozens of countries are working on final revisions to the latest installment of a United Nations assessment of climate change.
It also comes as the presidential candidates are being pressed by private environmental groups to add more detail to their positions on global warming.
Vice President Al Gore has frequently cited Dr. Hansen's work. In 1997, Mr. Gore played a major role in negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on the proposed treaty.
The White House said yesterday that the Kyoto plan was the best approach to slowing warming, adding that it placed equal emphasis on reducing all of the greenhouse gases largely because of insistence by American negotiators, including the vice president.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has said the Kyoto proposals were "inadequate and unfair to the United States." A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, yesterday called the new Hansen paper intriguing, adding that there were still questions to be answered.
Dr. Robert T. Watson, the chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said he had received a flurry of phone calls from other scientists in the last few days expressing worries that Dr. Hansen's study could be misportrayed.
"They said this could easily be interpreted as the guy who got Vice President Gore all excited about global warming now saying everything's fine," Dr. Watson said, adding: "If this paper is viewed that way, it'd be a horrible distortion. If anything, our projections for warming are higher than they used to be, and we're seeing discernible changes in ecosystems that we can link back to climate."
Representatives of industries that have sought to limit restrictions on fossil fuels said the paper poked provocative holes in the science behind the Kyoto plan and other proposals to stem warming.
Dr. Hansen stressed that he is still convinced that global warming is under way, that people are a significant cause, and that work should be done to cut the rate of change -- perhaps not quite as much work as researchers thought.

HEADLINE: A Smuggling Operation With a Russian Twist

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Over the last two years, a federal investigation into Russian and Italian organized crime in the ports of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., turned up the expected mix of mundane mob staples: extortion, cigarette smuggling, money laundering.
But federal agents said they also came across a bit of criminal enterprise that for pure creative corruption struck them as remarkable: a loose-knit web of companies was smuggling tens of millions of gallons of American-made grain alcohol -- including some from one of the country's oldest distilleries -- to Eastern Europe to slake a seemingly boundless thirst for that most Russian of spirits, vodka. 
 The smuggling genius, such as it was, lay in the fact that the 192-proof alcohol from America's heartland was disguised with dye and shipped in giant containers marked as windshield-wiper fluid, cologne, mouthwash and cleaning solvent.
Once in Russia, the smugglers, using a chemical formula provided in some cases by an American distiller, removed the coloring, diluted the grain alcohol with water and sometimes added what the federal authorities said was vodka flavoring. The product, which was then distributed by groups controlled by the Russian mob, thus evaded millions of dollars in import taxes and tariffs.
The reconstituted mouthwash and cleaning solvents -- investigators said that when the dye was effectively removed, it was, all things Russian considered, not half bad -- found a welcome and lucrative place in the black market.
As part of the case, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are investigating as many as six distillers around the United States, and nearly a dozen brokers and freight forwarders, several law enforcement officials said.
Investigators suspect that the shippers have ties to some of the most powerful mob clans in Russia, and that the organizations, including the Solintsevskaya and Ismailovskaya groups, control the distribution of the alcohol there and in some countries in Eastern Europe, the officials said.
"It takes a lot of organization to get millions of gallons from the distilleries in the U.S. to the streets of Moscow," Edgar A. Domenech, the special agent in charge of the A.T.F.'s New York office, said recently. The agency, which in addition to investigating firearms and explosives trafficking regulates the alcohol industry, is handling that part of the joint investigation, while the F.B.I. is overseeing other aspects of the case, including those involving Russian organized crime.
Since the days of the czars, when half of Russia's state revenues came from government-controlled vodka sales, the drink has played an outsize role in the nation's life and politics.
It accounted for 35 percent of the Soviet Union's income until oil and gas became big money makers in the 1980's. But that number plunged to roughly 4 percent in Russia after President Boris N. Yeltsin liquidated the state monopoly in 1992. And with the collapse of the economy, many local producers failed and foreign distillers began to export vast quantities of grain alcohol to Russia and neighboring countries.
But when the Russian government slapped heavier tariffs on imported alcohol in the mid-1990's, the black market exploded, opening up more opportunities in the trade for the ubiquitous Russian mob. Now, untaxed, smuggled and home-brewed vodkas -- known as samogon -- are believed to account for more than half of the estimated 568 million gallons consumed in Russia annually.
The economics of the smuggling scheme are straightforward: the alcohol can be bought in the United States and shipped to Russia for far less than it would cost a Russian company to produce it legally or illegally in that nation, law enforcement officials said.
"Organized crime realized you can buy grain alcohol for dirt cheap in the United States and export it for free," said Bruce Gourlie, an F.B.I. special agent in Newark who has traveled to Eastern Europe in connection with the case. "By smuggling, you can make a tremendous amount of money, because the tariffs are so high because they're trying to protect the domestic alcohol industry."
As a result, over the last few years a new class of bootleggers developed, riding shotgun on convoys of huge tanker trucks hauling illegal alcohol across the borders of Georgia and other countries into Russia. Enormous seizures became commonplace, and in at least one case, according to government news agency reports, smugglers with guided antitank missiles clashed with the border police, who halted their convoy of 550 tanker trucks.
About the same time, another class of lower-level bootlegger was shipping grain alcohol to Russia and Ukraine by sea, disguising it as cleaning products. Now, a federal grand jury in Newark is hearing evidence in the case, several officials said.
Court papers show that one Russian immigrant involved in the scheme pleaded guilty in April to a single count of conspiracy and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in Newark. Also cooperating in the case, according to the court papers, is a Missouri distillery founded in 1856 that made its name selling rye whiskey in Wild West saloons and recently got caught disguising its grain alcohol for shipment to the wild East.
The company, McCormick Distilling of Weston, Mo., north of Kansas City, provided nearly five million gallons of disguised grain alcohol to a freight forwarder operated by the Russian immigrant, the papers said. The freight forwarder shipped the alcohol to Russia and the Ukraine from 1996 to 1999, according to the papers, filed in Federal District Court in Newark by Mark W. Rufolo, the assistant United States attorney who is overseeing the investigation.
McCormick, which boasts on its Web site that it is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites because it is the oldest distillery in the United States operating at its original site, dyed the alcohol and provided the shipper with a chemical formula to later remove the coloring, other court papers said.
Earlier this year, McCormick pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of making a false entry in regulatory documents, in which it identified the alcohol as nonpotable products including Rainbow Cleaning Solution and Cleansol. The company agreed in June to pay $2 million in penalties, with $1 million in reparations going to the government of Ukraine, and accepted a one-week suspension of its license, documents show. It was one of the largest such settlements in the history of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, officials said.
In a written statement released by its lawyer, Christopher Lee Milner, McCormick said that no one at the company "knowingly conspired with organized crime elements to smuggle alcohol into Eastern Europe." The statement also said that no one at McCormick profited individually from the alcohol deals, that the company was never fully paid for the alcohol and that it was continuing to cooperate with federal investigators.
The Russian immigrant who is cooperating with prosecutors -- officials fear his life is in danger -- admitted that his company shipped the alcohol in seagoing containers that each held 148 55-gallon drums, according to the court papers.
He said his company shipped 600 such containers -- about 4.9 million gallons -- from May 1996 to January 1999, generating $40 million, according to a criminal information, a document detailing the charges to which he pleaded guilty.
The millions of gallons smuggled out is not a huge amount in the domestic distillery business. In 1996 alone, companies in the United States legitimately exported more than 100 million gallons of distilled spirits, much of it in the form of pure grain alcohol. And Americans consume about 350 million gallons of distilled spirits a year, according to industry estimates. In 1999, roughly 700 million gallons of grain alcohol was produced in the United States and reported to the A.T.F., the federal agency said.
Investigators nonetheless believe that the illegal shipments were just part of a much broader pattern of smuggling and other crimes by Russian mob groups.
"The money made by these illegal operations is funneled back into other illegal activities such as money laundering, firearms and narcotics trafficking," said Jeffrey A. Cohen, the A.T.F.'s assistant chief counsel.
And while federal authorities here pursue their investigation, the government in Russia has begun an effort to stanch the hemorrhage in tax income there caused by vodka smuggling, which some estimates put at more than $400 million a year.
To consolidate state control over the industry, President Vladimir V. Putin has created a state-owned conglomerate to act as a holding company for the distilleries in which the Russian government has a stake.

HEADLINE: Cyclists Take to the Roads, and Mass Transit, in New Jersey

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: WESTFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
The bicycle lockers at the New Jersey Transit station here have gotten Jim Barrett out of his car. He pedals his old balloon-tire Schwinn the mile from his home to the station, and wasting no time searching for a scarce parking spot, he stores the bike safely and continues his daily commute by train.
The transit agency's new friendliness to bicycles transcends mere convenience for John Madera, an avid cyclist from southern New Jersey who works in Philadelphia. Before he leaves work he dons a spandex riding outfit, buckles on his helmet and straps his 12-speed Fuji onto a specially designed rack mounted on the front of a New Jersey Transit bus. When he debarks with his bicycle in the New Jersey countryside, the grace note to his day is an intense 20-mile ride to his home in Pennsauken. 
 "It's good to have these options because it takes cars off the road," said Mr. Madera, 43, a transportation planner with the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. "And for bicyclers like me it gets me to what I enjoy the most: fast rides in the countryside at the end of the day."
Both Mr. Barrett and Mr. Madera are beneficiaries of a sea change in state transportation policy. First, New Jersey lifted a permit requirement that made bringing a bicycle on a bus or train a hassle. Then, 296 bicycle lockers were installed at 23 train stations in the central part of the state. And all 262 buses on 47 routes in southern New Jersey have been fitted with racks that accommodate two bicycles.
These bicycle-friendly changes all were made within the past year and were intended to attract more riders to trains and buses. They are part of the vision of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, an avid off-road bicyclist, to create more than 2,000 miles of bike trails in the state by 2008, said Jeffrey Warsh, the executive director of New Jersey Transit.
New Jersey is not the first public transit agency to put racks on buses or outfit stations with lockers. Phoenix and San Diego, among major cities, are credited by most bicycle advocates and alternative transportation groups with leading the way. Phoenix first installed bus racks in 1990 and now has them on all 600 of its buses, which carried about 608,000 bicycles last year, said Mike Nevarez, the operations manager of the city's Valley Metro Transportation Authority.
New Jersey has not reached that level, said Susan Boyle, the bicycle program director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group based in New York. But the program here is the most extensive in the region and a "remarkable service that is off to a fast start," she said. (The only New York City buses with racks are those that travel a route over the Whitestone Bridge between the Bronx and Queens.)
Use of the racks on the buses in southern New Jersey has grown since their installation in April to an average of 100 cyclists a day, said Mr. Warsh of New Jersey Transit. As for the bike lockers, almost half are rented at $7.50 a month. But at one station, Princeton Junction, there is a 25-person waiting list for lockers, reflecting the popularity of commuting by bicycle in college towns across the nation.
Mr. Warsh said the agency tried the bus program, called Rack 'n' Roll, in the southern part of the state because it is served by a single bus garage, making the program easy and economical. Studies elsewhere have shown that it is unwise to install the racks on some buses but not others in the same area. Potential bicyclists are likely to drive rather than wait for a bus that may or may not have a rack.
Officials in the central and northern parts of the state already have asked for racks, Mr. Warsh said. But they are costly to install and they compete with other, more compelling transit needs, like new train cars.
"We will roll it out little by little, bus garage by bus garage, considering the competing needs of mass transit," Mr. Warsh said.
Bus drivers in the southern part of the state initially were wary of fitting their buses with the racks, which add three feet on the front of the bus. They feared that the change would increase accidents, affect their turning radius and delay routes as bicyclists secured their cargo. But John Sims, a bus operator in the Camden area, said it had created no new hazards and the spring-loaded mechanism that secures the bicycles had taken only seconds to master.
Steven Spindler and John Boyle maintain a Web site for cyclists, bikemap.com, that maps out interesting and challenging bike routes and their connections to public transportation. The two men see the New Jersey Transit programs as part of a larger evolution of attitudes toward bicycles. From bans on buses and trains, to permit requirements, to the installation of bus racks and bicycle lockers: this progress is a journey of light-years, Mr. Spindler said.
A Philadelphia-based cartographer, Mr. Spindler said this has made getting around easier for him -- he has not owned a car since 1991. But more important, it has extended public transportation by encouraging those who live within a few miles of a bus route to bicycle there and catch the bus rather than drive all the way to work.
"The bicycle has limitations like bad weather and steep hills that make a trip less pleasant," Mr. Spindler said. "But transit is sometimes a problem because the routes are linear and not directly at the place you start from or at your destination. Either of these problems would cause a person to drive, but by mixing and matching the two you solve the problem."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: For Defectors from Cuba, Rough Political Waters;
Cuba's Objections May Keep Kayaker and Others Out of Games

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
When Angel Perez sneaked away with two friends from an altitude training center in Mexico City seven years ago, catching a bus to the Texas border, swimming across the Rio Grande and taking a waiting car to Miami, he thought he was free forever of the control of Cuban sports officials.
Competing for Cuba, Perez was a gold medalist in kayaking at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana. He also represented Cuba in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. But, dispirited about his personal future after athletics, he defected to the United States a year later, arriving in Miami with $60 in savings and no immediate hope of continuing his kayaking career. Instead, he took a job installing security alarms. 
 After several years away from serious competition, Perez returned to his sport and rose through the American ranks. He became a United States citizen on Sept. 25, 1999, shortly after qualifying in a four-man kayak for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia. He hoped his boat would contend for a medal.
As it turns out, however, Cuba still has a strong and unyielding grip on his athletic career.
Having suffered the defection or departure of an estimated 100 athletes in recent years, outraged Cuban sports officials are reacting against what they consider to be the theft of runners, jumpers and boxers they have trained. The Cuban Olympic Committee has refused to let Perez compete for the United States in Sydney and has similarly refused to allow the world-champion long jumper Niurka Montalvo to compete in the Summer Games for Spain, her adopted country.
This week the contentiousness reached a new level when Cuba removed a group of 30 of its athletes who were training under a reciprocal agreement in Spain. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, said that only diplomats, not sportsmen, could resolve the heated matter between the two countries. The United States Olympic Committee said yesterday that it would petition the I.O.C. for relief from its eligibility rules so that Perez could compete in Sydney, even over Cuba's objections.
Cuba's refusal in the two high-profile cases falls within the rules governing the I.O.C., whose charter states that an athlete who switches nationalities must wait three years to compete for the new country. Neither Perez nor Montalvo, who became a Spanish citizen last year, meet that requirement. The rule is meant to prevent athletes from changing nationalities for convenience. Frequently, waivers are granted in the spirit of international cooperation. Last week China waived the rule so that Yueling Chen, a former Olympic champion race walker, could compete in Sydney for the United States.
Cuba, however, remains adamant in its refusal. "It is absolutely unfair that the rich countries -- based on their economic capacity, offers of scholarships or gifts, conditions of life and other elements -- take away the sporting talents of the poor nations, just as they rob the scientific brains," Jose Ramon Fernandez, the president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, said in remarks carried last week in the state-controlled newspaper Granma.
In a letter sent last March to the U.S.O.C. declining Perez's request to compete for the United States, Fernandez wrote, "Taking into consideration the rejection of our athletics, and also the fact that the people of Cuba generate the funds and other resources for the preparation of our athletes and provide training facilities, education, medical services and meals at no charge, it was unseemly for Mr. Perez to have abandoned our delegation in the surreptitious manner in which he did, after having reached a high level of ability in his sport."
At a news conference Thursday in Madrid, Alberto Juantorena, the head of Cuba's track and field federation, accused Montalvo of "abandoning" her homeland to marry a Spaniard. Montalvo competed in the long jump for Cuba in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but has lived in Spain the last three years. She won the 1999 world championship for Spain. Her absence in Sydney could remove a hurdle from Marion Jones's attempt to win five gold medals.
"How are the Cuban people supposed to feel?" said Juantorena, who won the 400- and 800-meter races at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. "They have supported her training for 16 years so she can compete under another flag."
He added: "Cuba develops talent. It doesn't rob talent. This is a trafficking of people. Of skin, of muscle, of bone."
Last month Bill Hybl, the president of the U.S.O.C., traveled to Havana to plead Perez's case. The Cubans were cordial, Hybl said, but they declined to grant the kayaker a waiver. On Aug. 28, Hybl said yesterday, the U.S.O.C. will petition the I.O.C.'s executive board, arguing that Perez's self-determination should prevail. The case could also be brought before the International Court of Arbitration for Sport in Sydney, Hybl said.
"We didn't recruit him," Hybl said of Perez. "He came to this country on his own volition, trained on his own, married on his own, had a child on his own."
The I.O.C. has been reluctant to intervene in such cases. Unless the U.S.O.C. can show that the rule does not apply to Perez, "the I.O.C. will not get involved," said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, an I.O.C. spokesman.
Meanwhile, Perez, who is 29, continues to train with his teammates in Mammoth, Calif., hoping that somehow his participation in Sydney will be approved. In a telephone interview, Perez said the Cubans were using Montalvo and himself for propaganda purposes, trying to send a threatening signal to those who might be considering defection. He also said that American kayaking officials never alerted him to the Olympic eligibility rules until Cuba denied him in March.
"They are playing a political game," Perez said. "They like to be in the news of the world. It makes them feel they are in control of something. They are trying to make an example of me. It's amazing. Seven years I have been out of Cuba, but they still have control of me."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Will Issues Be Answer?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
When he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas skipped lightly over a few issues -- taxes, Social Security, education, nuclear weapons -- and then got to his topic sentence: "We must usher in an era of responsibility."
In Los Angeles on Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore took the opposite approach. Declaring that "the presidency is more than a popularity contest," he said, "I am here to talk seriously about the issues." 
 And that he did, one issue after another, as if he were delivering a State of the Union address and not speaking to a political convention, so that by the time he finished, there could be no doubt where he stood on virtually every important matter before the federal government.
He favors abortion and homosexual rights, affirmative action, gun control, a higher minimum wage and restrictions on marketing tobacco products. He opposes tuition vouchers for private school students and diverting Social Security taxes into private retirement accounts.
On each of these issues, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are on opposite sides.
And, as Mr. Gore pointed out, there is also a stark contrast in what may be the most important issue decided by this year's presidential election: how the government will use the budget surplus, projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.
Both candidates have agreed to earmark the $2.4 trillion in the surplus that will come from Social Security taxes to bolster the Social Security system. But they would do this in different ways.
Mr. Gore would use all this money to pay down the national debt, the theory being that this would improve the economy and make it easier to pay Social Security benefits after the baby boomers retire. Mr. Bush would use a big chunk of the Social Security surplus to cover the cost of creating private retirement accounts that would be invested in the financial markets.
As for the rest of the surplus, Mr. Gore would spend most of it, and he described how in his acceptance speech: for universal health insurance for children, for prescription drug coverage under Medicare, for medical research, for hiring and training teachers and for environmental protection.
He would also use a relatively small bit for specific tax cuts, mostly to make college tuition tax deductible, to modify the estate tax and to eliminate the tax penalty paid by some married couples.
Mr. Bush, by contrast, would use most of the money not set aside for Social Security for across-the-board tax cuts: lower tax rates for taxpayers at every income level, tax breaks for all married couples regardless of whether they now owe a penalty and a complete elimination of the estate tax, which is owed only on estates worth more than $675,000.
Mr. Bush says he also favors prescription drug coverage for those on Medicare. But he has set no money aside for this initiative, which could cost $250 billion or more between now and 2010, depending on how generous the benefit is.
In his speech, Mr. Gore derided the Bush tax plan. "For every $10 that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent," the vice president asserted, "middle-class families would get one dime. And lower-income families would get one penny."
"In fact," Mr. Gore went on, "if you add it up, the average family would get about enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a week, about 62 cents and change." (The text Mr. Gore was reading from said "a Diet Coke a day.")
Those figures were developed by Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research organization. In 1999, the richest 1 percent of Americans were taxpayers with incomes over $319,000. The average income in this segment was $915,000, and the average tax cut under the Bush plan would be $46,072.
Taxpayers with incomes in the middle 20 percent of all taxpayers (40 percent had higher incomes and 40 percent lower) had an average income of $31,100, and their average tax cut would be $453 (less than 10 cents for every $10 saved by the wealthy). By this reckoning, the daily tax cut would be $1.24 -- twice what Mr. Gore suggested, perhaps enough for a bag of chips with the Diet Coke.
The poorest 20 percent of the population, those with incomes below $13,600 would get an average annual tax cut of $42.
The Bush campaign accused Mr. Gore of missing the point. Under the tax plan, said Dan Bartlett, a campaign spokesman, a family of four making $35,000 would have its entire $1,500 tax bill wiped out. A family of four making $50,000 would have a tax bill of about $4,000 cut to about $2,000. And a family of four with an income of $75,000 would have a 25 percent cut, to about $7,500 from about $10,000.
The Gore and Bush calculations are both accurate. The reason for the different emphases is that the Gore figures counted all taxpayers at particular income levels, single people as well as families. At middle-income levels, families would fare better under the Bush plan than individuals.
Still, there is no dispute that the giant share of the tax cuts under the Republican proposal would go to the wealthy. The question is whether that is fair. Republicans say it is, since the wealthy are the ones who pay most of the taxes to start with. Democrats say it is not, since people that rich can afford what they are paying.
For people who plan to vote for president in November on the basis of where the candidates stand on the issues, the choice will be a clear one. That is true not just on issues like abortion and gun control but also on the economy.
Those who believe that the government should spend most of the surplus to provide better health and education programs will vote for Mr. Gore. And those who want to give the money back in tax cuts will vote for Mr. Bush.
Over the last eight years, Democrats have succeeded when they have been able to reduce the political debate to this binary choice between tax cuts and spending for popular programs. That is exactly what Mr. Gore was trying to do in his acceptance speech, and what Mr. Bush was trying to avoid in his.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE IMPRESSIONS -- WASHINGTON STATE;
In the Northwest, Still Undecided

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 18

 BODY:
In one obvious sense, it would be hard to consider Martine Dedek or John Roderick "swing voters" in the coming presidential election. Young, unabashedly liberal, both proud participants in last fall's demonstrations here against the World Trade Organization, they both roll their eyes and offer a vigorous "no way" when asked if they would consider voting for the Republican candidate, George W. Bush.
And yet, they will definitely go to the polls in November, they are still undecided, and they could be part of a hugely influential group in this election, especially in West Coast states where some polls suggest that as many as 10 percent of voters express a preference for Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee. They are among the voters who are still making up their mind between Al Gore and Mr. Nader. 
 So as they followed the Democratic convention this week, gathering at a friend's house Thursday night to watch Mr. Gore accept the party nomination, they were willing to listen intently to the vice president's speech. They came away ambivalent -- suggesting that while Mr. Gore failed to dazzle or even much impress them with his speech in Los Angeles, he may have drawn enough of a distinction between himself and Mr. Bush to get their vote if the election seems close in November.
The Gore speech left all the friends grumbling that only Mr. Nader was still bringing up the issues they considered central in this election: corporate power, the forces of globalization, the widening divide between the rich and the poor, here in this country and around the world. They scoffed at many parts, and Ms. Dedek, 28, who has worked as an advocate for battered women and for welfare recipients, at one point pronounced the whole speech "so orchestrated, so predictable, so scripted."
She nearly rose out of her chair at one point when Mr. Gore pledged to bring down the rising cost of prescription drugs. "I mean, he's still not getting at any of the larger issues here," Ms. Dedek said. "Why are prescription drugs so expensive?"
Mr. Roderick, a singer-songwriter and the piano player in a Seattle rock band, nodded in agreement, and worried aloud that a Gore victory might bring four more years of complacency.
"I'm not horrified about the idea of Bush winning this election," said Mr. Roderick, 31, who is about to graduate from the University of Washington with a degree in the comparative history of ideas. "It could be the thing that reunites liberals around a common enemy, I guess, for lack of a better word. It could force liberals to see what their principles are."
Another friend, Phil Campbell, a reporter for The Stranger, an alternative weekly newspaper in Seattle, said Mr. Gore still left him feeling uncomfortable.
"There's this obsession he has with his imperfections," said Mr. Campbell, 27, who covers criminal-justice issues, breaking into an imitation of Mr. Gore's voice as he watched the speech. "I'm not popular; I'm not at ease with myself,' " he intoned, as his friends laughed. "It's weird. A little self-deprecation's fine, but this is ridiculous."
If the election looks like a rout for either candidate of the two main parties, there was general agreement that a vote for Mr. Nader would be in order. But if the election looks close, the friends said, it could be a very different matter -- and here, their words may offer some salve to the Gore campaign, which has always insisted that in the end, many people will not want to "throw away" their vote on Mr. Nader.
"If it looks like Gore is clearly winning on Election Day, then you can send a vote for Nader, especially with the time difference" on the West Coast, Mr. Campbell explained. "If you know Gore's going to win, you can vote for Nader and contribute to that message being sent." But if it looks like a tight contest, he said, he will probably vote for Mr. Gore.
Ms. Dedek, who has a job in public relations, reluctantly agreed, explaining that on one core issue raised by Mr. Gore, she thought there was a critical difference between him and Mr. Bush -- abortion rights.
"To me, knowing that Bush is so pro-life, that's just really scary," she said. "Knowing that he could appoint all those Supreme Court justices. That is something that strikes me as a big difference" between the two major-party candidates, she added.
Ariella Robison, 26, a technical publisher for a software company, nodded in vigorous agreement. Mr. Bush, she said, gave her a "serious case of the willies," with, among other things, his stated opposition to abortion. For that reason alone, she said, she was likely to wind up voting for Mr. Gore.
Mr. Roderick, like the others watching with him, said he would wait to learn more from the debates, and said he would be outraged if Mr. Nader was excluded. "I did come into this situation feeling the only responsible vote was a vote for Nader," he said. Still, he said, the acceptance speech by Mr. Gore had "put my vote back in play," because the vice president touched on important themes. "I'm susceptible to that kind of Democratic rhetoric -- talking about the poor, about schools, about paying teachers what they're worth. As much as I believe those are the first things that always go out the window, he was talking about them."
"And yet" -- and here Mr. Roderick smiled at himself for trawling back and forth again with his thoughts -- "everyone seems to want to reduce this whole thing to Bush against Gore. And that's a condensation I don't want to participate in."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE IMPRESSIONS;
Finding Some Words to Ponder While Listening for a President

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The speech, confident and powerful, rang through the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and, far across the country in South Florida, made Darren Gentry reconsider voting for George W. Bush.
But that speech was President Clinton's address on Monday night, three days before Vice President Al Gore took the microphone. 
 Mr. Gentry, a registered independent who works as a fitness manager in Coral Springs, was leaning toward Mr. Bush when Mr. Clinton took that podium. As the president spoke of the prosperity the nation enjoyed during his presidency, Mr. Gentry, watching on television, began to doubt the wisdom of change.
"I think it turned me around," he said.
It was Mr. Gore's vote to lose, as he took his turn on stage on Thursday night. He did not lose it. He did not win it, either. His speech lacked real passion, Mr. Gentry said, repeating the criticism that has long dogged Mr. Gore.
"A lot of words," Mr. Gentry said, as he watched. "It doesn't seem like he's conveying his emotions."
And, he said, Mr. Gore had made promises without saying how he would deliver. In other words, Mr. Gentry said, the speech lacked style and substance.
As for Mr. Gentry, he is back where he started, in the middle. At least for Mr. Gore's sake, he no longer is leaning the other way.
Mr. Gentry is not alone in his ambivalence, judging from conversations this week with a handful of voters across the country. The interviews, conducted here and in Denver, Seattle, Maplewood, N.J., and with convention delegates in Los Angeles, evoked a wide range of opinions. But if one theme predominated, it was this: that while Mr. Gore did not by any means clinch the race with his appearance at the convention, his speech was better than many unconvinced voters had expected -- good enough, at least, for them now to consider what he had to say.
In vote-rich Florida, which has elected Mr. Bush's brother Jeb as its governor, the vast majority of Republicans have refused to even think about jumping across the party line and joining Mr. Gore. This convention seemed the vice president's best opportunity to cement his base with unexcited Democrats and, maybe, to sway independent voters here.
Mr. Gentry, 25, liked what he saw in Mr. Bush's campaign coming out of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
"I like what he's doing with Social Security," allowing people to invest a percentage of it, Mr. Gentry said. "I believe he's building a strong nucleus of people who support him, people like John McCain and Colin Powell."
Mr. Gore, going into his own convention, just seemed bland, Mr. Gentry said. But Mr. Gentry began to waver as he listened to Mr. Clinton.
"Clinton made a great speech," he said. "He nailed it. I think it was the best speech of his entire presidency. Why change things? When was the economy this good? And the Republican Party keeps saying that we need this massive change? Obviously that's not true."
Though Mr. Gentry said he would have to listen to more campaigning before he firmly made up his mind, Mr. Gore had a chance at the convention at least to continue his advantage going into the speech. But Mr. Gentry said he did not do that.
"He is saying, 'I will, I will,' but he is not saying how," Mr. Gentry said of Mr. Gore's speech. "I'd like him to tell me how he plans to implement his ideas."
He did find some reasons for preferring the Democratic platform, after watching both conventions.
Several voters interviewed this week said that the two conventions seemed programmed, almost too smooth, but Mr. Gentry was pricked by one thing about the Republican convention. The Republicans spoke a lot about their diversity, he said, but did not back up their claims with real proof.
"What Clinton kept saying about diversity is true," he said. "Look at the people in his administration. That's diversity."
While Mr. Clinton's speech inspired traditional Democrats, Mr. Gore's speech seemed to comfort them.
Adele Yuckman, 82, of Key Biscayne, watched Mr. Gore from bed. "Of course he's dull," Mrs. Yuckman said, watching his speech, propped up on pillows, a book close by. "But he isn't as dull as he usually is."
She will vote for him.
"Personality isn't everything," she said.
Among Miami's Cuban-Americans, there seemed little Mr. Gore could say to win over a voting bloc that lands solidly, election after election, on the Republican side.
The Elian Gonzalez case turned many here even more solidly against the Clinton administration. Mr. Gore's split with his party -- he said that family court should decide the custody -- has been dismissed by many voters here as a weak gesture, politically motivated.
But in the slivers of that community where people have voted Democrat -- or at least considered it -- it was Mr. Clinton's speech, again, that made voters consider Mr. Gore.
Raul Serrano, 58, a mortgage broker, watched the convention with his brother, Ruben Serrano, 56. They are both registered Republicans. "The speech," Raul Serrano said of Mr. Clinton, "reminded me of the good things the Democrats have done. I don't think it will be that bad with Gore, after all."
His brother, a real estate agent, said he would have a hard time voting for Mr. Gore, but was also undecided. "These conventions are just all-night parties that are not helping me at all," he grumbled.
Mr. Gore's speech, to Ruben Serrano, was more of the same. "A big show," he said.
But Raul Serrano warmed to Mr. Gore during his speech. "I think the guy needs to be given a chance," he said. "I think he strengthened his position."
And, he said, "he seems to be loosening up."
The convention was far from a fixation for many people here in South Florida. But, because the Florida Marlins were off, the patrons at Nippers Bar in Boca Raton tuned a television to Mr. Gore's speech.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it," said Geoff Klein, a 25-year-old stockbroker from Boca Raton who has made up his mind to vote for Mr. Gore.
A few tables away, a group of men stared at another television with excitement. They seemed impressed by what they saw.
But they were watching wrestling.

 AMERICA REBORN
 A Twentieth-Century Narrative
 in Twenty-six Lives.
 By Martin Walker.
 Illustrated. 393 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $29.95. 
 Historians, who write about the past, and journalists, who write about the present, are usually completely different species. But not so in Britain. John Keegan, perhaps the greatest military historian alive, is also defense editor of The Daily Telegraph. Jan (formerly James) Morris spent years reporting for The Guardian and still writes travel pieces, but is also the author of a three-volume history of the British Empire. Even without going as far as Morris, who changed genders as well as genres, few Americans feel at home on the pages of both history book and newspaper. Most American newspapers prefer to hire someone with a graduate degree in journalism rather than history, and our press is the poorer for it.
Martin Walker is in the tradition of literate Britons who didn't stop thinking about history when they took up daily journalism. A former bureau chief for The Guardian in Washington, he has written books on the cold war, Bill Clinton and other subjects. His new book, "America Reborn: A Twentieth-Century Narrative in Twenty-six Lives," reviews 100 years of American history by way of essays on some of the era's key figures, from Frank Lloyd Wright and Duke Ellington to Woodrow Wilson and George Marshall.
Walker's 26 chapters are only in part capsule biographies; they also use someone's life as a springboard to comment on a larger trend or idea. The chapter on Albert Einstein, for example, talks less about him than about the tremendous boost to American intellectual life given by refugees from Nazism -- not just by scientists, but by the Frankfurt school sociologists, the Bauhaus architects and film directors like Fritz Lang and Billy Wilder. The chapter on "Winston Churchill and the American Diaspora" takes a man about whom one would think it impossible to say anything new and points out that he was a product of a late 19th- and early 20th-century fashion: marriages between American robber-baron wealth and British titles. There were over 100 of these alliances, including one between Consuelo Vanderbilt and the Duke of Marlborough, whose final price tag came to $20 million and financed the rebuilding of Blenheim Palace. Walker uses these marriages to reflect on how 20th-century superpower status shifted from Britain to the United States.
A very different kind of archetype is found in Walker's appreciative essay on Emma Goldman. "She became the model for the emerging complicity between the state and the media, which demonstrated the American ability to demonize and thus marginalize its more dangerous dissidents. The judicial authorities named her as a witness, or as a suspect, or as a conspirator in various cases, and the popular press then made her into a symbol of menace to the American way of life. Once the media had made her sufficiently infamous, with her politics and her free love and her defiance of laws against promoting birth control combining into a heady stew of Red lust, further judicial action was made both easier and inevitable. . . . The pattern was to be repeated throughout the 20th century, against militant labor leaders, against Communists and their sympathizers, against civil rights activists and against the antiwar protesters of the Vietnam era." Ironically, it made no difference to Goldman's persecutor, F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover, that radicals hated her outspoken, prescient denunciations of Soviet Russia.
Walker looks at his other subjects with a similar eye for the larger pattern -- and for the British comparison. He sees Henry Ford, for example, not as an auto manufacturer but as a systems engineer who refined into a more compact, modern form the first great manufacturing system, the "18th-century British Royal Navy, with its mass-produced ships and cannon, its factories for ropes and sails and barrels." Walker sees the automobile itself as affecting far more than roads and the oil industry: "The automobile transformed the face of the American countryside, making the horse redundant and forcing farmers to grow new crops to replace the hay the horses used to eat. It force-fed a financial revolution to provide the decentralized credit system that allowed customers to buy them." And, as he points out in a later chapter on Katharine Hepburn and Hollywood, Ford's vertical control of manufacturing provided the model for the big studios, which controlled the movie industry assembly line from stars to theaters.
There is no grand theme to this book, which some readers may consider a flaw. But there is a shrewd eye for the significance of people and events we otherwise take for granted, and a consistent undertone of gentle demythologizing. In his chapter on William Boeing, for example, Walker shows that the most important advances in American aviation came not from the lone pioneering inventors celebrated on postage stamps, but from massive government spending during World War II and the cold war. In his chapter on Betty Friedan, he points out that "the real sexual revolution" of the 1960's and 70's was not the erotic one the news media fixated on, but the steady movement of women into the workplace. And writing of Martin Luther King Jr., he shows that King in his last years spoke forcefully against the war in Vietnam and for economic justice, only to be posthumously sanctified by those who represented everything he had fought against. He fell victim, Walker writes, to America's "sublime selectiveness of memory."
Walker's last essay is on Bill Clinton. The 42nd president will be remembered, he says, not for Monica Lewinsky or impeachment, but for his single-minded pursuit of free trade. True enough, although it's a pity the book did not go to press late enough for Walker to comment on the wide discrepancy in recent months between Clinton's public statements about environmental and human rights safeguards, and his private lobbying for trade deals that largely ignore these.
Something else missing from Walker's book is any serious consideration of television and the Internet, which these days are surely as important as arms and diplomacy, if not more so, in spreading American influence abroad. Walker has two generals but no computer industry person, five presidents but no television mogul. But, these quibbles aside, "America Reborn" is a quirky, readable and thoughtful look at the American century by an outsider who knows us very well indeed.

 THE LEAP
 A Memoir of Love and Madness
 in the Internet Gold Rush.
 By Tom Ashbrook.
 295 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $25. 
 Who among us has not at least daydreamed about chucking that ho-hum desk job and heading off to join an Internet start-up? It all sounds so adventuresome, so new frontier, so, well, so tantalizingly lucrative.
Few of us, of course, have the nerve to make the jump. But for those who want to experience vicariously the vicissitudes of starting an e-business, there is Tom Ashbrook's alternately informative and overwrought chronicle of his own exploits in the new economy.
The story opens as Ashbrook, a former foreign correspondent who seems to relish danger, is being tempted from his secure but unchallenging job as an editor with The Boston Globe. The bait: a chance to join an old Yale pal in developing a home-design CD-ROM that eventually becomes a Web-site business called HomePortfolio.com.
Almost half the book is taken up by Ashbrook's tortured soul-searching over whether to join the start-up, forcing the reader to plow through the same soliloquy more than once. From Chapter 1: "I had played out the better part of a first career and found some of its limits -- and some of my own. It was time to make the leap." Then three chapters later: "It was time to wade in, I thought. I needed to wade in all the way over my head and come out fresh, come out new." And, again, 60 pages down the road: "So I had a choice. I could stay where I was, hoping the old world would see me through. Or I could jump. I could make the leap to the new world, a new economy." For God's sake, man, just do it already!
When Ashbrook finally commits to his new venture, the book picks up. At its best, it guides us step by step along the rocky path from brainstorming on the back porch to creating a real, live business. Time after time, our novice entrepreneurs are forced to amend and simplify their vision to make it workable. They travel endlessly to persuade skeptical manufacturers to come on board. And they seek help -- advice, solace, cash -- from just about everyone they encounter, from next-door neighbors to Harvard Business School professors.
It is the search for capital to keep the enterprise afloat that forms the leitmotif of the book. Indeed, the hunt for money is all-absorbing -- and often humiliating. Just to meet their meager payroll, our dreamers must prostrate themselves repeatedly before those with fat bank accounts. At one point they call on a former college friend, a television news anchor, who tells them he is eager to help. He never calls back. And so it goes.
The pressure to raise money also takes a personal toll. Ashbrook runs up his credit cards to the maximum and pushes his family's finances to near ruin. His wife -- who makes this adventure possible by providing a regular income, caring for their three children and making ends meet out of dwindling savings -- tolerates his 18-hour days, but she, too, falls prey to anxiety. Once she sends him an e-mail message to explain that the stress has become so overwhelming that she vomited at work. Our hero, who seems to believe that his own selfishness is somehow negated by his candor in acknowledging it, feels her pain -- and then barrels ahead anyway.
Yet despite the ups and downs of the money hunt and the other insights Ashbrook offers into how single-minded one must be to succeed as an entrepreneur, there is still not enough material in "The Leap" to sustain a 300-page book.
Ashbrook seems aware of this, which may explain why he frequently resorts to melodrama. There can be little doubt, for example, that Ashbrook's business dealings were tough on his family. But do we really need to know how, after a fight, his wife tore up the little paper hearts with which she had covered the bathroom mirror for Valentine's Day?
Perhaps the most disappointing thing about "The Leap" is that it is not really about the Internet, as its subtitle suggests. All the difficulties Ashbrook tackles would be familiar to anyone who built a business before the new technology. His narrative ends abruptly just at the moment we might learn about the peculiar problems of running an e-business -- when the money arrives.
In an epilogue, Ashbrook informs us that the company was blessed with $25 million in capital and quickly took on nearly 100 employees. So the Web site will live! But to find out how such a business overcomes obstacles like establishing a customer base, designing an attractive, workable Web site and responding to a flood of new competitors, we will have to wait for someone else's memoir.

 "This is a terrific country," Bill Bryson says to a park ranger in a moment of frank bliss midway through his new book about Australia. (The title is an ironic spin on a line in a patriotic jingle, "I love a sunburnt country.") Such moments of pure compatibility bubble up throughout his travels, which take him by rail from Sydney across to Perth, then to Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne in the south and Cairns and Darwin in the north. From there he drives cross-country to Uluru (the former Ayers Rock) in the country's desert center. Having imagined Australia from afar as "a sort of 'Baywatch' with cricket" -- which already had its charms -- he fell for the real place on his first visit in 1992: "I liked it, straight off, without quibble or doubt, in a way I had never expected to. Something about it just agreed with me." As a result, the book exudes Bryson's sheer pleasure in the untapped narrative possibilities of this vast island continent.
In return, Australia serves Bryson brilliantly. It is, for a start, a statistician's paradise, and one of Bryson's talents is his way with numbers. Australia is, he reminds us, above all empty: its population of 18 million is less than the annual population growth in China. And while the average world population density is 117 people per square mile, that of the United States 76 and that of Macao a claustrophobic's nightmare of 69,000, Australia's is only 6 -- and even that is skewed because 86 percent of the population bunch together along the coast.
For each man or woman in Australia there are two sheep and over 16 rabbits, the latter introduced in 1859 by one enterprising man who brought 24 wild rabbits from England in an effort to ginger up the landscape and remind him of home. This is only one of the madcap introductions of species that have been effected, like the activities of some demented dating agency, to bring in everything from rampant blackberries to giraffes and camels -- all of which stand as symbols for the way Australia has been plagued throughout its 200-odd-year settlement by weird projections of what kind of a country it actually was and what it should be. And natural things aren't all that run wild, once introduced here. Consider, for example, the "pokies," the hugely popular slot machines. With less than 1 percent of the world's population, Australia has more than 20 percent of its slot machines. That's some statistic.
What appeals most to Bryson, though, is the way that Australia is a genuine, admirable model of normalcy -- the Norway of the Southern Hemisphere" -- played out against a fantasmagorically surreal backdrop that most Australians blithely ignore or play down. The ritual incantation "no worries" has particular charm when set against a background of man-eating crocodiles, ferocious sea rips that "pass you round like an unwanted parcel" and creatures that "seemed to have evolved as if they had misread the manual" -- all of them nicely suited to Bryson's mock-heroic travel writing.
Australia is also home to the oldest continuous culture in the world, one that was probably the first to depict itself, to fish and to make boats and yet whose literally aboriginal significance no one much notices, least of all the Australians themselves. It is a country so vast that a Japanese doomsday sect could mount a dry-run nuclear explosion in the wilderness and nobody twigged until years later. (I have an Australian postcard that vividly shows the sheer size of the place, superimposing a map of Australia over Europe. It stretches from Ireland right over to Moscow, the Black Sea and Turkey.) Australia is a country where a prime minister, Harold Holt, could simply disappear into the ocean, in what Bryson calls the "Swim That Needs No Towel," and hardly be missed.
It was on his quest to find the beach Holt disappeared from that Bryson met that park ranger on a magnificent headland and exclaimed his praise. But it wasn't the splendor of the view that prompted this bliss, it was the utter compatibility of his sense of humor with Australia's. The ranger told Bryson that a memorial had been built in Melbourne to honor the departed prime minister: " 'Know what it was? . . . He grinned very slightly. 'A municipal swimming pool.' 'Seriously?' His grin broadened, but the nod was sincere. 'This is a terrific country,' I said." The thing that Bryson most loves about Australia -- its "effortlessly dry, direct way of viewing the world" -- is, in fact, his own. They're a perfect fit.
Yet underlying the appealing side of the "no worries" Australia is something much darker, which Bryson also anatomizes. He characteristically warms to the fact that "outside the cities it is still 1958" -- which means there are "gas stations with old-fashioned pumps and no canopies over the forecourt, so that you pumped your gas in full sun, as I am sure God intended it." However, keeping the 1950's also means keeping its underside, repression. This has been the bane of Australia since 1787, when Capt. Arthur Phillip loaded up his cargo of petty British convicts and dumped them on the other side of the world. "Never before had so many people been moved such a great distance at such expense -- and all to be incarcerated," says Bryson, moved to Churchillian cadence.
Convict ancestry was until recently a source of unmentionable shame -- called "the Stain." Another aspect of Australia's repression was that the very existence of the Aborigines was blocked off: until 1967 they weren't even counted in the census, and, notoriously, their culture and spirit came close to obliteration. Also on the minus side is the fact that a surprisingly large chunk of English-language literature was banned right up to the 1960's -- and the list of banned books was itself banned, so you couldn't even find out what you weren't allowed to read. Clearly, Australia has had some serious amnesia zones to explore, and this it has been doing over the past generation. In these circumstances, books like Bryson's and that of another "foreigner," the eminent and versatile British travel writer Geoffrey Moorhouse, aren't just tie-ins to the 2000 Olympic Games. They are part of the uncovering of Australia's hidden past.
In "Sydney: The Story of a City," Moorhouse's long opening description of an imaginary mariner -- our sea captain" -- approaching the fabled harbor does have unfortunate colonial echoes, and a rather distancing effect. However, the body of the book is a virtuoso exposition of the gritty layers of social history that have formed Sydney -- the first place where Europeans settled and so, to some extent, a paradigm for the rest of the country.
With a wealth of narrative detail, Moorhouse shows how Sydney has always been, above all, a workingman's town, as cities like London and New York no longer are: "This truth includes all the bloody-minded camaraderie, all the bitterly unforgiven memories, all the crude defensiveness, all the fundamental decency and all the occasional cruelty that goes with the working man's territory. Here is a place where such people fight for what they've got and never, never back down, even though they risk being broken and cast aside. No one can really understand Sydney unless he grasps this fact." Knowing this, we understand why, for example, the first performance at the Sydney Opera House was given for construction workers. Or why, while the government supported America in the Vietnam War with troops, "wharfies" in Melbourne and Sydney occasionally refused to load ships bound for South Vietnam.
Woven into the dense narrative are other telling historical details: how four merino sheep imported from San Francisco in 1793 were the making of Australia's economy; how the gold rushes of the 1850's first attracted the Chinese to Sydney; how it was only in 1975 that Aborigines were legally entitled to own land. (It took 17 more years for the Australian High Court to formally repudiate the concept of "terra nullius," that the Europeans had arrived to colonize an empty land.) Moorhouse also shows how multicultural Sydney -- part of the "last great social melting pot on earth" -- has been layered by immigrants from every one of the countries it engulfs on that postcard map of Europe, and then some. One of the consequences, he writes, is that "for a swelling proportion of citizens, the names of Luting, Dien Bien Phu and My Lai will always be much more evocative than those of Kokoda, Tobruk and Gallipoli." Another of the consequences is that, come September, no team in the Olympics will be short of home support in this most ravishing of cities, whose population already includes almost every nationality under the sun.

 THAT FATEFUL LIGHTNING
 A Novel of Ulysses S. Grant.
 By Richard Parry.
 355 pp. New York:
 Ballantine Books. $24.95. 
 Ulysses S. Grant could have ended up a nobody, but he didn't. A West Point graduate, he served with distinction in the Mexican War but quit the Army in 1854 -- or was drummed out for drunkenness, depending on whom you believe. Afterward, he failed spectacularly as a farmer, as a businessman and as a bill collector. When South Carolina became the first state to secede in 1860, the future general and president was a 38-year-old clerk in his father's leather-goods store in Galena, Ill. In other words, he was a ruined man. And then he led the Union to victory.
Or so goes the upbeat version of Grant's life. During his lifetime and ever since, critics have cited the carnage at Shiloh in 1862 and pronounced the general a butcher; they've argued that it was almost inevitable that the industrialized North would defeat the sparsely populated South, no matter who was in charge of the Army; and they've viewed Grant's presidency and subsequent financial troubles as evidence of incompetence and navete.
But a backlash against the backlash is well under way. Recent biographies have shown Grant in a more flattering light. Last year, the Modern Library published a new edition of the "Personal Memoirs" Grant wrote near the end of his life to save his wife from penury. There's even a recent business book -- Cigars, Whiskey & Winning: Leadership Lessons from Ulysses S. Grant" -- that praises his management skills. And now three novels have arrived that depict Grant as an exemplar of timeless values like honor, commitment and diligence.
Three novels about Ulysses S. Grant? Why the sudden fuss? Well, it may simply be that the public's interest in the Civil War is once again on the rise, to judge from the resurgent debate on the use of the Confederate battle flag. What's more, Grant's presidency bears a passing resemblance to Bill Clinton's; like Clinton, Grant endured a series of scandals during his two terms. And perhaps at the turn of the millennium it's only natural to reflect on a leader whose career spanned an era that was, in some ways, more tumultuous than our own.
The simplest of these novels is "That Fateful Lightning," a dramatization of Grant's progress in the field during the Civil War and, later, his struggle to complete his memoirs as his throat cancer worsened. Richard Parry does a credible job of depicting the complex tactical decisions that confronted the general, and here and there you sense the anguish that the historical Grant must have felt about what he put his family through. As Grant fights his cancer, he asks his wife, "Where did our life go, Julia? I seem to have frittered it away." But that's about as poignant as it gets. Parry has also written three novels about Wyatt Earp, and perhaps his style wears better in a western; most of the dialogue here sounds stilted, and the characters are cardboard. Parry has obviously done his research for this novel, and too much of it shows. Little factoids about Grant pop up at all the wrong times.
By contrast, Ev Ehrlich gives himself more room to tinker with the facts, to clown around. His "Grant Speaks" pretends to be a first draft of Grant's memoirs, and it does follow the basic outlines of the historical record. There's one big gimmick, however. In reality, the general was born Hiram Ulysses Grant and acquired the nickname "Useless"; he became Ulysses Simpson Grant (Simpson was his mother's maiden name) through a bureaucratic error. In his novel, Ehrlich stirs things up by inventing a real Ulysses Grant, nicknamed "Useful," who lives in the same Ohio town as the awkward Hiram.
Polished and privileged, Useful wins a spot at West Point but runs away after losing his memory in an accident. So Hiram takes over where the amnesiac leaves off. As a young soldier in Mexico, Grant comes face to face with destiny while tripped out on peyote. A robed horseman named Mescalito appears and prophesies, "Ulysses Grant will lead great masses of men in the glorious cause of their human redemption." But Grant spends the rest of his life wondering whom Mescalito meant, because Useful, who never regains his memory, keeps showing up to remind Useless of his shortcomings. Grant's Civil War victories reassure him that Mescalito's prophecy was meant for him, but the economic crises and corruption scandals that plagued his presidency only amplify his doubts. Ehrlich is an economist by training, and he spent four years as undersecretary of commerce in the Clinton administration. But there's nothing bureaucratic about his populist streak or his prose style, which is breezy and almost effortless. Ehrlich writes about his subject with affection and admiration, and he gives his imagination free rein.
Max Byrd's "Grant," by contrast, is a much more serious, intricate novel. Apart from the numerous flashbacks to the Civil War, nearly all the action happens in the 1880's, when the effects of the war are finally starting to come into focus. "There was a great story waiting for someone to tell it," Byrd writes, "not about the war, but about the reborn nation, on the other side of the war."
Byrd tells that story not through Grant's eyes but through those of Sylvanus Cadwallader, an actual friend of Grant's during the Civil War, and those of an invented journalist named Nicholas Trist, a Union veteran who lost an arm while fighting under Grant's command. (Trist has returned from France to cover Grant's campaign for a third presidential term.) These days, it's hard to conceive of a party convention where the final result is uncertain, but Byrd offers a gripping account of one where it was. In the end, Grant's old slogans -- He hails from Appomattox" -- turn out not to work anymore, and he can't get enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination. For the first half of the novel Byrd leaves the impression that Grant's best days are long past. But naturally, the general turns out to have some fight left in him. His investment firm goes bankrupt because of a partner's treachery, and his fortune disappears with it. So Grant begins writing to earn a living for his family. He secures a book contract for his memoirs with Mark Twain's publishing company. And even as his health deteriorates, Grant will not be dissuaded from his work. "I mean you shall have this book," Grant tells Twain. The general is earnest and determined to the end.
Of course, novels usually turn on impulses that are far more baroque than these, and Byrd adroitly deploys a small ensemble of Washington socialites, journalists and politicians to provide the sins and petty cruelties that push "Grant" along. Henry Adams, who in real life viewed Grant as "pre-intellectual" and "simple-minded," appears here as "a little engine of patrician self-amusement" who is all but blind to his wife's artistic talents. Byrd builds his characters with a remarkable accretion of details -- down to the speed of Clover Adams's hands as they sweep along crowded bookshelves, the quality of her handwriting, the white tissue paper she uses to wrap each of her photographs. The author of novels about Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Byrd is an expert at linking the products of his own imagination with historical facts. The fictitious Trist has an affair with a real Pennsylvania senator's wife who was known to get around. All these machinations produce a couple of different results: They make an appealing tale about love and death in late 19th-century America, and they flatter the sturdy, homely general by comparison.
For somebody who grew up with the nickname "Useless," Grant was astonishingly successful. In Byrd's book, the Twain character holds Grant up as an example of "what he called the 'self-invented' man, that strange American ability to be two completely different people in one lifetime." Twain adds that "in the fiery crucible of battle Grant had actually created a whole new self -- a second nature." In an author's note, Ehrlich describes his novel as an attempt to understand "what it means to have a destiny and to be an American." What it means, these three books suggest, is that you can remake and redeem yourself again and again. As you read these novels, you can't help marveling at how a single life can accommodate such extremes of accomplishment and failure -- and how suddenly one turns into the other.

 BODY:

LONG REMEMBER, by MacKinlay Kantor. (Forge/Tom Doherty, $14.95.) In this Civil War novel, Kantor (at right) tells the story of a man who tries to live as a pacifist in, of all places, Gettysburg, Pa., but is inexorably drawn into the fighting. This is "a very fine book," Peter Monro Jack wrote here in 1934, "a novel that tastes and smells of war." The war's Washington front is examined in ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A Press Portrait, edited by Herbert Mitgang (Fordham University, $19.95). The anthology, with a new introduction, draws on more than 100 newspapers and periodicals from the United States and Europe. Lincoln was a devoted reader of newspapers at a time when they had little pretense of objectivity. The passages "illuminate as only contemporary writings can," Gerald Carson said in these pages in 1971.
 
HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, by Stephen King. (Pocket Books, $7.99.) This sprawling work -- two novellas, two stories and an epilogue -- is permeated by Vietnam and the survivor guilt among those who did not go. "We know now what Stephen King, the master of horror, is afraid of," Caleb Crain wrote here last year, even though, he added, the war itself "remains offstage."
 
TIME, LOVE, MEMORY: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior, by Jonathan Weiner. (Vintage, $14.) From his study of the humble fruit fly, Seymour Benzer has achieved great insights into the connections between DNA and behavior, both insect and human. This is "a lovely book about a lovely scientist" and "a wonderful description of biologists at work together," Lewis Wolpert said in the Book Review last year.
 
EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad, by David Haward Bain. (Penguin, $18.) The legendary golden spike was an ordinary iron one, according to this definitive history. From the drawing rooms of magnates like Leland Stanford to the "hell on wheels" where laborers binged, Bain brings an epic project to life. "The building of the Pacific railroad," Robert M. Utley said here last year, has never been recounted "so thoroughly, authoritatively and engagingly."
 
NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT, by Bill Pronzini. (Walker, $8.95.) In this noir suspense thriller set in Northern California, two men are caught together in raging flood waters. One is a vintner tormented by a childhood horror; the other is a trucker obsessed with finding the hit-and-run driver who left his wife in a coma. "It's a dark and twisty road to the big smashup," Marilyn Stasio wrote in these pages in 1999, "but these characters travel well."
 
SISTER WOLF, by Ann Arensberg. (Ballantine, $14.) A daughter of a noble Hungarian family lives alone on 1,000 acres in the Berkshires, which she has turned into a sanctuary for wild animals. "This is a first novel of striking originality," Ella Leffland wrote in the Book Review in 1980, calling it "crisp, urbane, alive with wit."
 
THE PRODUCTIVE EDGE: A New Strategy for Economic Growth, by Richard K. Lester. (Norton, $16.95.) America's standard of living depends on authentic gains in productivity, and the nation has much more to do to get its economy back on track, according to this analysis by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The book is "a necessary corrective to all this economic triumphalism," Jeff Madrick said here in 1998, praising its "cogent ideas."
 
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES: Sojourns in the Land of Memory, by Patricia Hampl. (Norton, $13.) This collection of essays explores the art of memoir, as the author moves back and forth between a series of recollections and accounts of reading others' memoirs. Writing in the Book Review in 1999, Linda Simon called Hampl's prose "rich and idiosyncratic."
 
BOY IN THE WATER, by Stephen Dobyns. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) In Dobyns's 20th novel, the headmaster of a failing New Hampshire boarding school investigates a murder on campus. "His prose is fluent and the plot races along like clockwork," Erik Burns said in these pages last year.
 
LIFE THE MOVIE: How Entertainment Conquered Reality, by Neal Gabler. (Vintage, $14.) A cultural critic sees events like the O. J. Simpson trial and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, as national obsessions that overshadow ideas and ideology. Gabler "has a fine old time showing how entertainment values have come to permeate every nook and cranny of American life," Peter Biskind said here last year. "It is impossible to put down this book unconvinced of the cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of American life." Michael Molyneux

HEADLINE: Austin, We Have a Problem

BYLINE: By Helen Thorpe; Helen Thorpe last wrote for the magazine about Salon.com.

 BODY:
Earlier this summer, I went for a swim at Barton Springs, a freshwater pool that lies at the geographical and spiritual center of Austin. Under an oak tree, I found Stuart Stevens of the Bush campaign, typing on a Dell laptop. He was writing the script for the video that would be shown at the Republican National Convention. All around him, half-naked kids with ornate tattoos lolled on the grass, working on nothing except their tans.
Austin has always been a city of distinct worlds -- a college town, a state capital and a live-music center all in one. But lately the number of worlds that Austin contains has been multiplying, and now, everywhere you look, there is the spectacle of worldviews clashing. 
 Over the last century, the population of Austin has doubled every 20 years, and in the metropolitan area there are now more than one million residents. Thirty-five thousand people, the equivalent of a fair-sized town, moved here last year alone. And in the last five years, Austin has produced or acquired 17,000 new millionaires. Now an upper class of tech barons lord it over a middle class of state government and university workers; a national Republican campaign machine whirs above a local Democratic power structure; yuppies infiltrate the habitat of punk rockers. It's as if every Austin stereotype has spawned its opposite: easy-going Slackers live beside hard-driving Techies, and old-school liberals drink at the same bars as new-school conservatives.
The magnitude of this transformation was not wholly apparent to me until I spoke with John Thornton in mid-April. Thornton is a general partner at Austin Ventures, the most powerful venture capital firm in town. That puts him at the epicenter of the New Economy. "The rate of change in activity in venture capital has been larger in Austin than probably anywhere else in the country," Thornton told me. "In 1996, venture capitalists spent $67 million in Austin. In 1999, we told people that we thought, Gee golly, $700 million would be spent. The actual number ended up being about $1.1 billion."
The impact of all this new money on Austin is debated endlessly over breakfast tacos and barbecue dinners. Is the laid-back hipster's paradise doomed to become another mess of a big city? People talk a lot about it, but few end up doing anything. An exception, Thornton told me, is a guy named Ross Garber, one of the city's freshly minted tech millionaires. After Thornton introduced us via e-mail, Garber and I arranged to meet at a Starbucks in his neighborhood southwest of downtown. Garber's mild-mannered looks disguise an intense personality. He began his career in the tech corridor along Route 128 in Boston, he told me, and moved with his wife to Austin in 1994. Their reasons for coming, I learned, were remarkably similar to those of most Austin newcomers. Jobs, yes, but also that amorphous allure known as "quality of life." With its bars, bands and barbecue joints, its lakes, parks, low crime and temperate winters, Austin is a lifestyle mecca that attracts all kinds.
Garber and I took a driving tour of Austin when we met for the second time. As we nosed under an elevated highway, we came face to face with a modern-looking fortress of red brick and glass. "That's Vignette," he said, tapping on the window. He helped start Vignette four and a half years ago; today it is the largest e-business software firm in the world. "Vignette has created about $3 billion worth of employee wealth," he noted with pride. Garber himself is 33, and his net worth is somewhere upward of $200 million. On Garber's side of town, brand-new mansions have spread as rapidly as cedar trees across the rolling limestone hills. The recent history of Austin is written on those hills. For a generation, the definition of a political fight was a developer wrestling with environmentalists over how fast the city should grow. Those fights seem almost quaint compared with what's on the horizon.
Because of all the new people, Austin now suffers from world-class traffic jams, polluted air, a serious lack of affordable housing and a school system in disarray. Eager to become part of the solution, Garber recently formed a coalition of tech leaders to hustle a light-rail project through the city's cumbersome political process. "We're like Dorothy, you know?" Garber told me. "We've left Kansas, we're walking down the Yellow Brick Road and we're going to end up somewhere. I'll tell you where it's not going to be -- Kansas. 'Cause we ain't going back. We're either going to the Emerald City, or we're going to the witch's castle to fly around on green brooms." The Oz rhetoric may be overblown, but Garber's perspective on Austin -- that its extreme rate of growth threatens to wipe out the very qualities that attracted people in the first place -- may be the one notion that finds support across the city's disparate worlds.
Of all the pretty state capitals, of all the funky university towns, only Austin also plays the role of Nashville's little sister. Music, not high tech or politics, put this town on the map. Barbara MacDonald, better known as Barbara K, is a central figure in local music circles, and I caught up with her one night in May at a club called the Speakeasy. She had a black guitar slung at hip level, and was jamming on a song from her solo debut. Barbara K used to be in a band called Timbuk3, which had a hit called "The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades."
That was in 1986, four years before the movie "Slacker" came out, and Austin was in the grip of a profound economic malaise. Rent "Slacker" today, and it's like flipping through a scrapbook of how much has been eradicated in one busy, busy decade. Gone are the vacant lots, the Quack's coffee shop near campus, the bookstore staffed by J.F.K. conspiracy nuts. Gone is Les Amis restaurant, where one character snapped: "To hell with the kind of work you have to do to earn a living!" Today the local paper publishes breathless stories about $500 bottles of wine.
On the surface, it would seem as if the boom has been kind to people like Barbara K. She lives in a large, rambling house, bought with money from recording deals. The place is now worth almost three times what she paid for it. Most days, she considers herself lucky, but not when she gets her new property tax statement. "Oh, man, I got slammed so hard," she told me. Next year, she will owe $800 per month in property taxes alone. And though Austin still brags that it is "the Live Music Capital of the World," for most musicians, acquiring property in town has become impossible. Bukka Allen, who plays accordion on Barbara K's latest CD, recently bought a house in Buda, 13 miles south of Austin. He's part of a silent diaspora, one of countless musicians who have been forced out by the boom.
Meanwhile, the maker of "Slacker," Richard Linklater, has appropriated technology for his own ends. He is working on an animated feature called "Waking Life." When I visited him at Detour Filmproduction, every room was filled with artists sitting in front of Macintosh computers, transforming film footage into animated action. "It's very human," said Linklater of the results. "It's a great marriage of film and computer. I think Austin is the kind of place where that cross-pollination can happen." On the other hand, Linklater doesn't think he could start out here today. "I came to Austin 16 years ago. My rent was $133 a month, all bills paid, and I could live on $3,500 a year. So I spent all my time watching movies, editing, shooting. Film students are like, How do you do it? I don't know. If you have to work all day just to pay your rent, I don't know. If I was just starting out now? Might go to San Antonio."
People moving here today come for different reasons. In June, I drove out to a fancy subdivision named Rob Roy, up in the hills. It was a bone-dry, brilliant day. In almost every vast and perfectly manicured front yard, brown-skinned men clipped and trimmed and dug. The houses were ridiculously large, like caricatures of houses. Parked in the driveways were Porsches, Jaguars, Mercedeses and all manner of S.U.V.'s. Within minutes, a green Audi was tailing me. Security. The driver snapped photographs with a little digital camera. I don't know what he saw; what I saw was the balance of things shifting.
Unlike the rest of Texas, Austin has always been a place where what mattered most -- music, film, education, public policy -- was supposedly motivated by concerns that were not entirely commercial. Now Austin has developed an indigenous business scene. First came Dell, later Tivoli, Trilogy and Vignette. These days Austin has a 1.9 percent unemployment rate and has been named the best city in the country for doing business by Fortune and Forbes.
Day-to-day living, however, has become harder for a lot of people. The public schools, for example, used to be considered pretty solid; now the Austin Independent School District struggles to keep up with the profound population shifts. For every new computer programmer who arrives in town, a gardener, a housecleaner and a couple of construction laborers follow. In recent years, the greatest job growth has been not in the software industry but in the restaurant sector: busboys, dishwashers, short-order cooks, waitresses. These service workers are generally poor -- their incomes have not kept pace with the rising cost of living -- and the school system struggles to find a place for their children. One thousand new kids converge on schools in the southern part of the district every year.
One bright spot is Travis High School, which, by all rights, should be a catastrophe. Travis is a hodgepodge of yellow brick buildings that stand alongside I-35, on the edge of East Austin, which is the poor side of town. The student body is 90 percent minority, 80 percent low-income. So many students get pregnant that there is a waiting list for their infants to get into the nursery that Principal Nelda Howton set up. I met with Howton in May. She has a blond bob and was wearing a lemon-colored linen dress, but she's a lot tougher than she looks. Her job includes figuring out whether her students have a place to sleep, food to eat, responsible parents to watch over them. "We had a kid who had been receiving assistance for diabetes," she told me. "Turns 18 and it's cut off. Well, the kid kept not coming to school, and we find out it's nothing except he can't get out of bed because he's in a comatose state. Then we had to get him back on insulin."
Four years ago, Howton was working as a principal of a middle school in Temple, about 60 miles away, when she heard that Austin was looking for a high school principal -- a step up, she thought. "I didn't know that I was coming to this school," she sighed. "I cried when I saw it. There was graffiti everywhere; we had two kids shot outside; lots of gangs, lots of gangs." Howton took the job anyway; after studying what 21st-century high schools were supposed to look like, she realized that she couldn't possibly afford to create such a place on her budget and set up a foundation to accept donations of money and equipment. Howton is good at marketing. She says what she thinks, uses plain English and tells stories that deliver an emotional wallop. So when she set up meetings with executives at companies in town, they responded generously -- particularly hardware companies like AMD and 3M.
Howton looked at what was happening in Austin and decided to start classes in C++ and Java computer languages, and set up a multimedia lab where students build Web sites. (They were doing one for the L.B.J. ranch when I visited.) She filled classrooms with orange and aqua i-Macs, got every kid an e-mail address and wired up the shabby brick building with fiber-optic lines. She marched me down the hallway to show me the black Novell servers stacked in an old janitor's closet. It's a blinking, glowing declaration of progress where you'd least expect to find it. Since the servers were installed, there have been no gang problems at Travis. "A lot of it was consistent discipline, but the other thing was getting the kids to believe they can do something," Howton said. In the multimedia lab, Howton introduced me to Sylvia, who moved to Austin from Nicaragua at age 4. Her mother cleans houses for a living. This year, Sylvia won first prize in the South by South West contest for student-designed Web sites. Another student finished school and got a job making $65,000 a year at a local software firm.
Howton's work is inspirational, but it hardly seems like a replicable model -- based as it is on the extraordinary force of her personality. And money's getting tighter. This year, for the first time, Austin has been declared a "property rich" district, which means it has to give away $26 million in revenues to poorer districts in the state, and to forgo $22 million in financing that it formerly received. The law is intended to take money away from affluent students and give to students of need, but that's not the effect it's having in Austin.
Superintendent Pat Forgione arrived in town 11 months ago and can't believe his lot. When I met with him in June, he jumped up off a couch in his office and grabbed a binder of statistics to illustrate the differences between Austin and other "property rich" districts. "If you take the percent that are considered 'disadvantaged,' in the typical district, it's a quarter of their kids," Forgione said. "We're double that. Notice 'at risk.' That means truant, absent, bringing guns, don't have parents, those issues. The average is 24 percent -- we're 42 percent. The average property-rich district has one out of six students for whom English is not the first language. We're one out of four!" This is the paradox of the boom: people like Ross Garber build luxury homes on one side of town, while the other fills up with poor kids and suddenly there's $48 million less to spend on education.
Austin's politics have been changing right along with the economy. Mayor Kirk Watson represents a fusion of old and new priorities and has earned a reputation as perhaps the most effective mayor in memory. Early in May, Watson wooed the New Economy crowd at a mixer to raise money for his re-election. Watson wore a white ruffled shirt, charcoal bow tie and gray tuxedo pants as he stood on the steps of a limestone mansion that belonged to Jeff Garvey, chief administrative partner of Austin Ventures. Venture capitalists and software C.E.O.'s lined up to shake Watson's hand, then write him a check. It has been a difficult constituency to seduce. Many hardware companies have a long tradition of civic engagement. But the software types are younger, more arrogant, less responsible. Their start-ups also have no tradition of corporate philanthropy, and few, if any, local clients.
National politics has a certain luster to it, and many of Austin's tech lords have gotten swept up in George W. Bush's bid for the White House. Two local tech stars, the hardware king Michael Dell and the software guru Steve Papermaster, have formed a team of high-tech executives to advise the campaign; I spotted both of them at a recent gathering of the team at the Dell Jewish Community Center. Back in 1998, Papermaster gave a party for 500 at his mansion in Rob Roy to introduce Bush to the local tech crowd. Later, Papermaster squired Bush around Silicon Valley, helping make connections and raise money. "Directly and indirectly, it's certainly been in the millions -- many millions," said Papermaster of the sums he has delivered to the Bush campaign. Papermaster went to U.T. and used to hang out at the Armadillo World Headquarters. Doesn't he think it's weird that this liberal enclave should become the launching pad for a possible Republican presidency? "Austin has changed from being a purely liberal city into being more centered, though still with a liberal bent," asserted Papermaster. "It's a place that has aggressively embraced growth. And that reasonably approximates the governor's philosophy. It's not a clash. It's closer to a parallel, and perhaps even a convergence."
Stuart Stevens agrees that the mellow gestalt of Austin has influenced the Bush camp. "Being in Austin creates a nonhierarchical campaign," he said. "There's a certain lack of self-importance. Nobody at the Bush campaign cares about wearing ties. Nobody worries about getting in the gossip columns, because there aren't any gossip columns."
As for local affairs, the various tasks of making a city function, well, that just isn't as sexy, compared with national politics. Earlier this year, at a gathering of local software C.E.O.'s called the Austin 360 Summit (which Papermaster helped start), Mayor Watson delivered an impassioned speech about the challenges facing the city. While the mayor was talking, a baby-faced C.E.O. raised his hand. "Why are you looking at us to help with these community issues?" asked the software C.E.O. "That's your job."
Just when it seemed as if the tech barons deserved to be cast as villains, matters took an unexpected turn. Last year, after Vignette went public, Ross Garber sold a large amount of stock, turned down a bunch of job offers and spent nine months wondering what to do with his time. "I always thought if I won the lottery I would retire and go to the beach for the rest of my life," he said. "But you find out that it's really hard, because it's isolating, and you can't retire at 33. Retire is a word for when you're like 65 and you go to Miami to play mah-jongg."
In March, Garber was sitting in traffic when his cell phone rang. It was Lee Walker, whom he knew from the 360 Summit. Walker is Old Austin (he has shoulder-length white hair and wears a suede hat) but possesses a New Austin resume (he was the first president of Dell). He's now the volunteer chairman of Capital Metro, the city's public transportation system.
Walker approached Garber with a small request. In November, the city was going to vote on whether to build a light-rail system. By law, Capital Metro could not campaign for the ballot initiative. And the idea faced stiff opposition from people like Gerald Daugherty, a conservative figure in Old Austin circles who had formed an antirail group called Reclaim Our Allocated Dollars, or ROADS.
"I need a high-tech poster boy," Walker told Garber.
In Texas, light rail is a deeply countercultural idea. Natives consider the pickup truck roughly equivalent to the American flag in symbolic value, and public transportation a Kremlinesque conspiracy to undermine their way of life. But Dallas, of all places, built a light-rail line that has proved surprisingly popular, and now Austin's leaders were convinced that they could, too.
Garber had his doubts about working with Old Austin. "The pace thing is hard, it's very frustrating," Garber told me. "Most of the tech guys are working with huge Wall Street pressure. They're not going to come to a four-hour meeting once a week for nine months and finally decide who's going to get to make a decision." But he had more time now, and he'd been looking for a cause. Garber formed a team of techies to consider light rail. John Thornton joined it, and so did Steve Papermaster, among others. Light rail was imperative, the group determined; the city's air was becoming so dirty that it would soon violate federal health standards. Garber got all fired up. "I'm not a train hugger," he vowed. "But this place is exploding."
Garber then embarked on something that might be called a 21st-century political campaign. Early in May, we drove past rainbow-colored bungalows smoldering in the heat in search of Garber's billboards. Downtown, Garber spotted one: MORE TRAFFIC AHEAD. PERIOD. The black letters leapt from a green metallic background, and a small oval depicted train tracks receding into the distance. We headed over to I-35, a main north-south artery. A yellow billboard announced: FREE PARKING AVAILABLE ON I-35. Then we drove west. Metallic blue, same train logo. TRAFFIC BITES. BITE BACK.
Garber liked his handiwork. "Aren't the colors great?" he asked.
The colors were great, the look was clean, the lines were snappy. But what really got my attention was this imported fondness for rail. By choosing mass transit as their cause, the techies were picking a fight with Austin's traditional business groups, the real estate developers, car dealers, and oilmen who have always loved highways. Garber himself went through culture shock. "Different language, different pace," he reported. "With Old Austin, the art is the process -- the listening, the communicating, the cajoling, the time it takes. In tech, you just don't work that way."
It had been clear what would happen if the tech people had remained secluded in their parallel universe. This dusty Eden would turn into another Silicon Valley, then everybody who could afford to would move on to the next paradise. But what if Old and New Austin learned to work together instead? This was what was so promising about the rail project: maybe someday Austin could become the kind of place where the private sector gets involved and stays involved, instead of just sitting idly by while the public sector falls apart. A school like Travis might become the rule, not the exception.
But as time passes, the balance of things keeps tilting the other way. In July, Nelda Howton gave up. The buzz around Austin was that she wasn't appreciated sufficiently. Howton said that wasn't true. "I couldn't get to work!" she told me. She lives in a town called Salado, and she used to be able to get to work in 45 minutes. But as Austin kept expanding, her commute did, too, until it swelled to two hours. "I was spending 20 hours a week on the road," she said. There was a lightness in her voice, as if some great frustration had eased. She was going to open a brand-new school in Killeen, about 60 miles from Austin, and now it would be somebody else's job to worry about whether the children of Austin's housekeepers and gardeners and short-order cooks had food, or beds, or access to modern marvels like the i-Mac.

Luxury Rentals Rising on North Bergen Shoreline

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: NORTH BERGEN

 BODY:
WHILE much of the land along the 18-mile Hudson River shoreline has sprouted housing in the last few years, a 10-acre slice of waterfront in this Hudson County township has long sat dormant except for a stand of cattails that swayed to the river breezes.
Now the site, which juts out to the river across from the West 70's in Manhattan, is filling with the first of two planned luxury rental buildings that will contain 507 one- to three-bedroom apartments, some with terraces. Each of the 12-story beige-brick buildings will have a health club and parking garage. 
 The project is called Half Moon Harbour, a name that refers both to the shape of part of the site and to Henry Hudson's sailing ship. The developer, the Barrett Companies of Fort Lee, is proceeding after six and a half years of debate and legal haggling over neighbors' concerns about the project's density and its impact on traffic and Manhattan skyline views, among other issues. An out-of-court settlement ended the debate in 1998.
The total development cost of the project is estimated at more than $20 million. The architect is the Edgewater firm of Cybul & Cybul. Construction of the first building is nearing completion and leasing of its 176 apartments is to start this fall.
Though projects in other Hudson County riverfront towns, like Jersey City or Hoboken, as well as Edgewater in neighboring Bergen County, have attracted more attention, Half Moon Harbour will be only the second housing development to rise on North Bergen's quarter-mile waterfront. It will also occupy one of the last large tracts at the river's edge there.
During the 1980's building boom, the site was owned by another developer, who hoped to put up a various types of housing on it, including three 17-story buildings. But only 70 town houses were built on an adjacent riverfront parcel before the developer ran into financial difficulties and lost the property through tax and mortgage foreclosures.
Twenty-eight unsold town houses in that 70-unit development, called Roc Harbor, were eventually sold by the lender to investors. By late 1994, the Barrett Companies had bought or contracted to buy the four individual parcels that make up the 10-acre Half Moon Harbour site for what Thomas Barrett, the company's president, would only say was a reasonable price.
Of the ensuing legal wrangling, he said, given the site's location and potential, "it was worth fighting for." This is the first riverfront housing project for the company, which has built residential and commercial developments in New Jersey and New York.
For North Bergen, an ethnically diverse community of 55,000 people with an annual median income of $33,000, the Half Moon Harbour project is part of a delayed economic turnaround. With limited waterfront land, the 5.5-square-mile township -- which, like Union City, its neighbor, was noted more as a center for embroidery than shipping -- missed out on the mid-80's construction boom. As other riverfront towns gentrified, North Bergen's chances to boost its declining economic base were stymied by an inadequate road and transportation system. By 1985, the township was basically bankrupt and the state took over its finances.
BUT since then, North Bergen, which has both modest single-family houses and high-rise towers on the Palisade cliffs, has been trying to turn around its image, both as a place to live and to do business. In the last several years, it has made some strides.
"It was time for the township to change and to take advantage of the strong economy," said Mayor Nicholas J. Sacco, who is also a state senator. But the goal, he said, is that the community rebound in a way that benefits its residents and builds on the distinct character of each of its neighborhoods.
In the last few years, North Bergen has received $100 million in public money to improve its roads, primarily three overpasses on which work has begun or will begin soon. Projects, representing $200 million in private investment, are also in various stages of development throughout the township that will produce some 800 residences and 500,000 square feet of commercial space, said Joseph R. Auriemma, the township's administrator.
One completed project is Columbia Park, a 350,000-square-foot retail center that includes a Shop Rite supermarket and a movie theater on 17 acres on Kennedy Boulevard. It replaced a small supermarket, a billiards parlor and the remnants of a failed housing project.
Plans are advancing for several other projects, including a 300-unit rental complex, which will rise on a full block where an old warehouse now stands. Developers also want to replace a hodgepodge of industrial and commercial uses along a 10-block stretch of Tonnelle Avenue, a main commercial thoroughfare, with big-box retailers such as Lowe's, the hardware chain. And beyond Half Moon Harbour, an assisted-living development for the elderly is being planned for 2.5 acres on the waterfront.
"Something had to be done on the waterfront," Mr. Auriemma said, noting estimates that the Half Moon Harbour project, when completed, will generate slightly more than $1 million in new tax revenue to the township a year.
Even before Barrett bought the site, there had been opposition to the earlier developer's plan for it, particularly putting up the three 17-story buildings. which objectors said would shrunk the views of Manhattan for people living on the Palisade cliffs. So when his company became interested in the site in 1992, Mr. Barrett said he negotiated with the key objector, the North Bergen Action Group, for the project's current scale. And the township preserved land on the top of the cliffs for a public park.
But in 1994, neighboring property owners -- the 70-unit Roc Harbor condominium and the smaller Evelyn Estates condominium -- objected to the Barrett plan. The condominiums in several lawsuits contended among other things that the buildings blocked views and would worsen traffic and that Barrett should meet certain obligation unfulfilled by the earlier developer, including providing amenities. They also contested the township's 1997 rezoning of the site. Barrett countersued.
After four years of litigation the parties hammered out what Joseph Ferriero, a lawyer who represented the condominiums, called a "good settlement."
Mr. Barrett said while the litigation cost his company time and money, the delay could work to the benefit of the project because the waterfront has progressed. As proof he pointed to the thousands of square feet of retail space that has gone up in neighboring Edgewater.
THE project's first building is nearing completion when, despite a slowing in the state's housing market, there continues to be a demand for waterfront rentals. Lennard Schwartz, who owns Smart Realty in Edgewater, said the demand was coming mainly from young professionals "who want views, access to ferry service to Manhattan and new product."
But rents "are starting to stabilize until everyone gets a handle on the impact of the new inventory," which will take time to absorb, he said. On average, a typical one-bedroom, 850-square-foot apartment rents for $2,000 a month, he said.
Mr. Barrett said, and Mr. Schwartz agreed, that Half Moon Harbour was distinct from the mostly low- and mid-rise riverfront projects now leasing from Weehawken north to Fort Lee and therefore "not in direct competition."
The one- to three-bedroom apartments in the first building will have 750 to 1,500 square feet of space. There will be 15 different apartment layouts available. To start, rents will range from $1,600 to $4,700 a month. The first building, like the second, which will have 331 apartments, will be placed at an angle to lessen their impact on neighbors' views from the Palisades and maximize those of tenants.
Each building will be connected by a causeway to a three-story parking garage. Atop each garage will be the amenities planned for the buildings, including a health club with a swimming pool and one or two tennis courts. There will also be a riverfront walkway, which is a state requirement for all projects within 500 feet of the water's edge.
Mr. Barrett said the first building would be completed in December. He will start the second building once the first is half rented.

Discount Houses For Teachers

 BODY:
The federal government has come forward with a way to enable schoolteachers to buy a house at a bargain price -- if it's in the right place.
The place has to a neighborhood that the government defines as economically distressed. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has no shortage of houses that it has acquired in those areas through mortgage defaults. Through its Teacher Next Door program, it is now offering them to teachers through a bidding process at 50 percent of the appraised value. 
 If the buyer chooses to obtain financing through HUD, only $100 in cash is needed for the down payment, and closing costs are paid through the mortgage. Teachers normally have to work in the school district where the house is purchased, but New York City is an exception. Under the program it is considered one school district.
The HUD regional office said that there are 53 qualifying areas in New York City, and about 50 in surrounding counties. The sales in these communities came to about 45 houses over the last eight months.
The program is similar to another called Officer Next Door, which does for police officers what HUD is now trying to do for teachers.
For more information, call (800) 217-6970, or go to the Web sites www.hud.gov/teacher or www.firstpreston.com, where information about the houses is available.

HEADLINE: A Senate Candidate in a New Spotlight

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL

 BODY:
WHEN Waterbury's Mayor, Philip A. Giordano, announced earlier this year that he would run against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, state Republican party leaders and Gov. John G. Rowland tried to talk him out of it.
They advised Mr. Giordano that Mr. Lieberman was a formidable foe for an obscure mayor of a moderate-sized Connecticut city who had no hope of raising anything close to the millions that were already in the Senator's campaign chest. 
 But in Connecticut there was no one else willing to take on Mr. Lieberman, a two-term incumbent with a 74 percent approval rating in most polls and a reputation as a centrist Democrat with a moderate image that had attracted Republican and independent voters.
And that was before Vice President Al Gore picked Mr. Lieberman as his running mate for the November presidential election.
When Mr. Lieberman was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, so was his little-known opponent in the Senate race. Mr. Giordano gained prime media coverage and at the same time picked up an obvious campaign issue -- why is Mr. Lieberman running for both vice president and re-election to the Senate at the same time? And what kind of message does that send to Connecticut voters?
"I'll tell you what kind of message it sends: by running in both races he's making Connecticut a consolation prize and telling voters how little confidence he has in the Gore-Lieberman ticket," said Mr. Giordano, a 37-year-old lawyer serving his third two-year term as mayor of Waterbury, a city of 104,000 that is the fourth largest in the state.
Describing himself as a "true conservative" driven to win a race he is still told is not winnable, Mr. Giordano said, "I love the state of Connecticut and would never use it as a consolation prize the way Mr. Lieberman is in this race."
Mr. Giordano, who was born in Caracas, Venezuela, came to the United States with his family at the age of 5. He grew up in Waterbury, attended the city's schools and, after spending four years in the Marine Corps, graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in political science and history.
After earning a law degree at the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Michigan, Mr. Giordano returned to Waterbury where he worked as a legal assistant for the corporation counsel's office in the early 90's, and was soon promoted to assistant to the corporation counsel. He also opened his own law practice in 1992.
In January 1995 Mr. Giordano was elected as state representative from the 71st General Assembly District and shortly afterward, at the age of 32, was elected mayor of Waterbury. He has been twice re-elected since then.
Before the two-race issue landed in his lap, Mr. Giordano concentrated on trying to make the case that Mr. Lieberman was much more liberal than voters had been led to believe.
"For 12 years he has gone unchallenged, and we want to expose his liberal voting record for what it truly is," said Mr. Giordano. "He can't go around saying he's a moderate and against things like partial-birth abortions and then vote against a bill that would ban them."
Dan Gerstein, communications director for Mr. Lieberman, dismissed Mr. Giordano's comments as "pure hogwash." "When you're 55 points behind in the race I guess you having nothing left but meaningless personal attacks," said Mr. Gerstein.
Addressing the question of why Mr. Lieberman was running two races, Mr. Gerstein said: "To withdraw from the Senate race at this late juncture would create tremendous chaos in the party and lead to an un-democratic democratic process of selecting another candidate. We believe very much that the Gore-Lieberman ticket will win in November, and then a special election can be scheduled for selection of a permanent replacement in the Senate."
The State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, has ruled that under Connecticut law candidates can run for both vice president and the United States Senate, just as two former Texas senators did while running for vice president -- Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 and Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.
But Mr. Lieberman would not be allowed to serve in both capacities. If he is elected vice president, Governor Rowland, a Republican, would be able to appoint a member of his party temporarily to the vacant Senate seat until a special election could be held.
Governor Rowland has refused to speculate on who he would appoint to replace Mr. Lieberman, insisting it will be a "non-issue" because he expects George W. Bush to win the November election.
Governor Rowland's press secretary, Dean Pagani, said that while the Governor was initially skeptical about Mr. Giordano's bid to unseat Mr. Lieberman, "he now fully supports him" and has made appearances with him around the state.
While it is unclear whether a special election could be scheduled early in 2001 in the event Mr. Lieberman is elected vice president, the Secretary of State, Susan Bysiewicz, has indicated that the state's Democratic controlled legislature could pass a bill to allow a special United States Senate election in November 2001.
Connecticut Democratic party leaders, including the state chairman, Edward L. Marcus, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, have encouraged Mr. Lieberman to run in both races for two reasons: if he and Mr. Gore lose he obviously still provides the Democrats their best chance at retaining the Senate seat, and if he wins he gives his party more time to find a suitable candidate.
"None of us can say with absolute certainty what's going to happen in 12 weeks," Mr. Dodd recently told The Hartford Courant. "And I think the people of Connecticut would like to have the option of having Joe as their senator if the ticket doesn't prevail, and would be thrilled if he were elected vice president and had to then choose another candidate for the Senate.'
That view is not shared by Mr. Giordano and his staff, who are nonetheless happy to take advantage of an issue they believe they can use relentlessly throughout a campaign they insist they can win.
"I think the voters of Connecticut would prefer to have Mr. Lieberman here at home defending his record of flip-flopping and trying to pass himself off as a moderate while his voting record is clearly liberal," said Mr. Giordano's campaign manager, Tim Longino. "He can't be running around the country telling people he's a moderate while voting for the country's largest tax increase ever in 1993 that included a gas tax that is coming back to haunt us now."
Mr. Giordano said another key campaign issue would that while Connecticut ranks first out of the 50 states in providing per capita tax revenue to Washington, it is last in what it receives in federal dollars.
"I think as one of the Connecticut's United States senators, serving for 12 years now, that Mr. Lieberman has to accept some responsibility for the dismal fact that Connecticut has placed 50th, that's dead last, in federal tax ratio," said Mr. Giordano, who likes to take credit for "making the tough decisions" that he says have started to turn around the faltering economy of his city.
He says he is most proud of having produced three consecutive balanced budgets in Waterbury without raising taxes, and of cutting crime by 25 percent by increasing the police force.
Those who know Mr. Giordano best say it would be a mistake for his opponent -- even a vice-presidential candidate with national stature -- to underestimate him the way former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. underestimated Mr. Lieberman in 1988. That's when Mr. Lieberman stunned the three-term incumbent despite polls at one time showing him more than 20 points behind.
"I've known Phil for more than a decade and when he decides he wants something and that it's important he usually gets it," said Angela Juliani, a partner in his Waterbury law firm. "When he announced he would run for mayor in 1995 few people gave him any chance to win. I'm hearing the same thing now about this race and I know better than to ever say Phil Giordano can't do something, no matter how long the odds."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Windsor Locks, Conn.;
Bradley Airport Is Getting $200 Million Expansion

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN Robert F. Juliano arrived at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks was a single terminal surrounded by tobacco fields. There were no security fences or checkpoints and only a few domestic carriers servicing the field, which is about 20 minutes north of Hartford.
"At that time, we were hoping to get up to a million and a half passengers," said Mr. Juliano, who is now the chief of the department's Bureau of Aviation and Ports. "Now, we're probably going to break seven million this year." In June, almost 646,000 passengers arrived at or departed from Bradley, up 26.5 percent from a year earlier. 
 Airport and business officials hope that a $200 million expansion under way that will add a terminal, concourse and parking garage will not only accommodate the airport's double-digit growth but also make Bradley International Airport, as it is now known, a portal to more international destinations. The airport now has regular flights to Canada and charters to the Caribbean.
"If Bradley could draw the same percentage of international travel as it does domestic travel in its market area, it would have 600,000 passengers a year going to Europe; that would be enough for four flights a day," said Dean B. Hill, executive vice president of Campbell Hill Aviation Group in Alexandria, Va., a consulting firm. "Bradley's share of domestic flights is already growing far beyond national average. That shows Bradley is attractive when the services are there. We'll use that when we talk to international carriers."
Local officials, meanwhile, say that Bradley has become the driver of the economy in the former farming communities that surround it and they are hopeful that the expansion will bring more development.
Edward A. Ferrari, a Windsor Locks first selectman, said that since the 1960's the airport had attracted chain restaurants, hotels, parking services, gas stations and other services. But two years ago, Federal Express opened a large operation there, and the town is talking with a large trucking company that wants to put in a terminal and a developer who has proposed a conference center.
"It's going to have a gigantic spinoff effect for the town," Mr. Ferrari said. "We're constantly looking and talking. Those are the kind of projects that we're trying to woo into town."
Peter M. Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said that the economic impact from Bradley's expansion reached throughout Connecticut. One study, by the University of Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, found that for every million passengers, Bradley generated $100 million in economic activity for the state and created 2,500 jobs.
"If I were to create a list of things that have a significant potential economic upside for Connecticut, Bradley is going to be right at the top," Mr. Gioia said.
Bradley, which opened during World War II as a military airfield, is named for Lt. Eugene Morris Bradley, who died in a training accident there on Aug. 21, 1941. The first commercial flight was in 1947, and the airport came under state control in 1948.
The last major modernization project was in 1982, when the state spent $100 million to add a new terminal and concourse and other improvements. Since then, airport use has grown considerably -- to five million passengers in 1995 and this year's expected seven million.
MUCH of that has been due to what the Federal Aviation Administration has called the Southwest effect. Southwest Airlines began offering service from Bradley last October, bringing its no-hassle low-fare philosophy to a market that was previously known for high prices. Since then, the airport estimates that the average unrestricted air fare has dropped 32 percent, as other carriers have scrambled to compete.
"Hartford has met all of our projections and is growing," said Whitney Brewer, a Southwest spokeswoman. Southwest is now operating 12 daily nonstop flights to Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Orlando.
A new terminal complex will be 521,000 square feet with 34 gates, compared with 24 gates in slightly less than 446,000 square feet of terminal space now. There will also be a dedicated two-gate international section. Most of the new and renovated space will be completed in 2002, Mr. Juliano said.
A new garage will provide 3,453 new parking spaces, with 1,655 spaces set for completion next May and the rest a year later.
Mr. Juliano said the expansion was needed just to accommodate the growth that has already taken place. Since 1995, 8 new carriers have come into Bradley, and the number of nonstop destinations has increased to 41 from 27 -- more than 300 nonstop flights a day leave Bradley now. Seasonal slowdowns have disappeared: passenger traffic has grown for 27 straight months.
"People talk about Bradley getting to the next level," Mr. Juliano said. "Well, it is at the next level. You have just about every domestic service you can ask for, and the frequency of flights has gone up dramatically."
When the project is completed, Bradley will be able to handle 12 million passengers a year. Andre J. Libert, director of marketing for the airport, said he expected the expanded and improved airport to draw from as far as mid-Vermont to the north and to make inroads even into New York City.
"We're seeing Westchester County traffic in numbers we've never seen before, Stamford and Greenwich in numbers that we have never seen before," Mr. Libert said.
A decade ago, Fairfield County travelers represented about 2.5 percent of the business at Bradley. "It's now pushing 10 percent, and growing very quickly," Mr. Libert said. "We don't know where it might cap out at."
But Bradley intends to push it along, with a major marketing drive in Fairfield County on billboards, in newspapers, on radio and cable television.
Joseph McGee, vice president for public policy and programs at the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, said Bradley could capture more of the southwestern Connecticut business and leisure travel market.
Mr. Gioia of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association said that with the airport promotional campaign, and some growth that will likely come from other sources, Bradley might soon outgrow its expanded quarters.
Both Logan Airport to the north and Kennedy International Airport to the south are getting more crowded, and crowded highways make them difficult to reach during business hours, he said. And Connecticut is seeing significant growth in high-technology companies and exporters, two industries that rely heavily on air travel.
W E'RE seeing double-digit growth rates in both transportation of individuals and transport of cargo, and that hasn't even taken into account that there may be a lot more overflow from Logan or Kennedy that could be coming down the line, and the growth in industries that are going to put a lot more pressure on our transportation resources," Mr. Gioia said. "I think everyone realizes the expansion that's going on at Bradley right now is only stopgap."
But there are some concerns that the management structure at Bradley might limit its development. It is one of only four major airports that is owned by a state government and by statute must be self-sustaining. That means certain limits on its rate of growth and in the kind of risks it might take. The Legislature's Programs Review and Investigations Committee is reviewing the management situation at Bradley to determine whether changes are needed.
"The department has been very competent and effective over the years at managing Bradley, but their mission has been very limited, which is to do the maintenance and don't spend too much money," Mr. Gioia said. "That doesn't leave them much room to be innovative. I think it's time for them to get some new instructions.
Daniel J. Carstens, who owns CargoZone-BDL, a Bradley-based cargo operation, and the publisher of Airport News, which covers Bradley, said Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland had a marketing staff of 14 people and an annual budget of $3 million; Bradley has a marketing staff of three, and a budget of less than $500,000, which must also cover five smaller state airports, two ferries and a state port operation.
"I think they've done a very good job marketing, as evidenced by their growth," Mr. Carstens said. But that comparison raises questions about whether Bradley is reaching its full potential, he said.
"On the other hand, you don't want to overexpand -- can you imagine the outcry if they built twice what they needed, and five years from now people are asking why we built such a big airport if no one is using it?" Mr. Carstens asked.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Mother Fixation and Other Issues

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
THOSE doomsayers who have been forecasting the death of musicals are in a New York state of mind. All they have to do is get out of town. The myth of Broadway as the center of theater persists because myths are needed, more so by tourists from distant lands and the status-starved who are nearer, moneyed or just pretending.
At Goodspeed Opera's developmental theater, the Norma Terris in Chester, a musical adaptation of the popular movie "Summer of '42" is running through Sept. 10, while the East Haddam home theater goes on bringing back oldies, currently "George M!". Even the Westport Country Playhouse is to present a musical premiere, the 12th-century French fable "Nicolette and Aucassin" starting tomorrow. 
 At the National Music Theater Conference of the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, which ended last Sunday, the search for and development of new musicals has been going on for 23 years. And it was Paulette Haupt, the conference's artistic director, who paired Wally Harper and Sherman Yellin for a new collaboration, "Say Yes!", which opened Wednesday at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.
In the Berkshires, new spins on old and new (but not so new) musicals have been thriving this summer. A beguiling example of that second category, "No Way to Treat a Lady," with book, music and lyrics by Douglas J. Cohen, is resurfacing at Barrington Stage Company in Sheffield.
Here is a musical (first a novel by William Goldman) that has been around since 1987 Off Off Broadway. And the musical version of the 1968 movie (with Lee Remick, Eileen Heckart, Rod Steiger and George Segal) was briefly seen Off Broadway nine years later. Audiences at Coconut Grove in Florida, in London and in Germany, saw it.
Mr. Cohen's score is a reassuring fusion, a mastery of traditional musical comedy style adorning and informing an offbeat story. The songs, merrily and provocatively, take on a romantic lilt when the subject is pathological and macabre. Sample: An ostensibly grown-up son, never allowed the space to please his abusive mother, sings to her, for approval and repentance, now that she is dead. But she will never be successfully dead. In the song ("What Shall I Sing for You?") the son sings of Shakespeare and Shaw, of Porter and Gershwin.
The son is named Kit, an actor and the musical's serial killer who phones in reports of his conquests (read corpses) to Moe, a detective who is really just a cop, his horrid mother laughingly reminds him.
Both Kit and Moe have very severe mother fixations, which enables Moe's actual inamorata to say that she is jealous of a killer, not just because Moe obsesses about catching the creep. It is eerily clear that the killer is playing disapproving mother to the cop, calling him a middle-aged mama's boy, demanding his gratitude for the fame this front-page case is affording him.
Well, what else is an unemployed actor to do but act out -- and kill? The quest for celebrity, in whatever form, is just one of the themes of a musical that is to be taken seriously, if only because it does not take itself seriously.
Mr. Cohen (whose very good musical, "The Gig," evolved from Waterford to Chester, then to regional theaters) is not concerned about stretching the boundaries of musicals through reinvention and all those other trendy terms. Nor is he formulaic or derivative, no matter the familiar echoes.
The dread meeting between inamorata and horrid mother, Sarah and Flora, is transformed into a funny song ("So Much in Common") and it all begins with each man's plea: "I Need a Life."
The ingenuity of the musical's staging by Rob Ruggiero, associate artistic director of Theater Works in Hartford, takes multiple casting to an audience-astonishing level. "No Way to Treat a Lady" is to be the Hartford theater's first musical production next year.
In addition to Karen Murphy taking on five roles, unrecognizably and disparately, Bradley Dean as Kit kills suavely and scarily in such guises as the kindly Father Fitzgerald; a flamenco dancer named Ramon and Tony, who bakes "the pizza you die for."
Sandy Binion as Sarah, "one of the beautiful people," gives a performance that really travels. She is lonely. She is assertive. She is funny. She is level-headed and she is hot-headed. And she scores a home run with every song.
Which leaves Adam Heller, a fine schlumpy and touching Moe, and now you can count the actors, but not the roles.
Mr. Cohen's homicidal musical comedy keeps going around, and he keeps writing more.
"No Way to Treat a Lady," Barrington Stage Company, Consolati Performing Arts Center, Sheffield, Mass. (413) 528-8888. Performances through next Sunday.

HEADLINE: Is It a House or a Synagogue?;
And Other Questions That Have Jewish Tempers Flaring in the Five Towns

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

DATELINE: LAWRENCE

 BODY:
ALMOST any non-Orthodox Jew in the Five Towns can tell you about the boycott threats that their Orthodox brethren have made to shopkeepers who dare to open on the Sabbath.
Some say the threats started 20 years ago with the initial growth of the modern Orthodox community, which observes the Sabbath closely but which also mixes freely with the modern world. Others say the intimidation of business owners didn't start until about five years ago, with the influx of more strictly Orthodox families who are a little more insular. 
 But trying to find a shopkeeper who has actually been pressured to close on Saturdays by the Orthodox is like trying to find the alligator that swims in New York City's sewer system. Everyone's heard about it, but the evidence is lacking.
"The stories about boycotts and threats are all apocryphal," said Jay Todtman, owner of Toddy's Appetizers, a deli that has been in the heart of Cedarhurst's downtown since 1946. "Everyone wants to paint the Orthodox as this evil cancer that's infesting the Five Towns, but I've found nothing of the sort."
Toddy's began closing on Saturdays and came under strict kosher supervision back in 1987, but Mr. Todtman insists the decision had nothing to do with the Orthodox community. Instead, he said, it was because many of the non-Orthodox synagogues that Toddy's catered to had started using kosher caterers. "We did it not to go after the Orthodox community, but we got it anyway," he said. Go figure.
Still, the fact that the rumors have persisted is a clear sign of the misperceptions and mistrust that exists in the Five Towns, an area that has been a stronghold of Jewish suburbia for generations and that has more recently become an Orthodox destination of choice.
A more tangible source of tension between the Orthodox and their more secular neighbors is the growing number of shtiebels, private houses that serve as synagogues. As the congregations grow and seek building permits to expand, the complaints about zoning and parking violations mount.
For many of these Orthodox congregations, zoning appeals boards and the Nassau County Supreme Court have become familiar battlegrounds. The Orthodox go to these sites to fight for their constitutional right to worship. Their neighbors go to enforce the zoning ordinances underpinning a tranquil suburban life where the streets seem immune to large crowds and parking problems.
In many cases, compromises have been made and congregations have continued to worship in their converted homes. But there are at least three active lawsuits connected to Orthodox synagogues or shtiebels, one in Cedarhurst and two in Lawrence.
The Orthodox have, in many ways, come to define the Five Towns even though they only make up about 30 percent of the total population. Certain neighborhoods, particularly in Woodmere, Cedarhurst and Lawrence, have become almost exclusively Orthodox. Even though some neighbors might believe otherwise, the Orthodox have moved into these areas in large numbers not with any intent to conquer, but out of religious necessity, because they must be able to walk to a synagogue on the Sabbath. And the non-Orthodox families they have replaced haven't so much fled the Orthodox, who tend to be young professionals with large families, as they have aged out of their empty-nest homes.
Many business owners say that while the growing Orthodox community has changed the complexion of Central Avenue, the shopping street that runs through Cedarhurst and Lawrence, it has also helped revive a once-sagging retail district. But there are those who long for the days when Central Avenue was not home to quite so many kosher food stores and Judaica shops and was more like the Rodeo Drive of Long Island, overflowing with boutiques and fancy dress shops.
For years, the Orthodox of the Five Towns coexisted easily with the non-Orthodox because they were predominantly modern Orthodox Jews. Like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, they studiously observed the Sabbath and kept kosher, but the men did not always wear yarmulkes and the women did not always cover their hair.
But as more observant Orthodox families started moving in about 10 years ago, unease that sprouted from their different rituals began to surface, according to William B. Helmreich, a professor of sociology and Judaic studies at the City College of New York. "The arrival in the Five Towns of so many Jews who are more right-wing Orthodox has exacerbated tensions," he said.
The practices of the more observant Orthodox fall somewhere between those of modern Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox groups. They don't wear the characteristic long black coats and beards of the ultra-Orthodox, but the women tend to wear wigs and dress conservatively and the men always wear hats or skullcaps. Parts of Lawrence are known as "black hat" neighborhoods, Dr. Helmreich said.
"In many ways, the stricter Orthodox are more allied with the Hasidim than with the modern Orthodox," he said. "They believe in compromising with outside society only when necessary, whereas the modern Orthodox believe in compromising whenever possible."
Many non-Orthodox feel as though the very public practices of the Orthodox are an open rebuke of their choice not to be as religious. For example, if clusters of Orthodox leaving a Sabbath service happen to linger around the driveway of a non-Orthodox resident to chat, the non-Orthodox person may think he is being given a message not to drive, Dr. Helmreich said.
Orthodox leaders, for their part, don't see what the fuss is all about.
"Some of our traditions may be different," said Jacob Mordechai, president of the Sephardic Congregation of the Five Towns in Cedarhurst. "But that doesn't mean better or worse, just different. If anything, we see one of the most beautiful coexistence of all levels of Orthodox, whether more or less Orthodox, we can visit one another's synagogues and feel very close to one another."
Many of the stricter Orthodox families moved to the Five Towns from neighborhoods in Brooklyn where kosher food stores and yeshivas were plentiful. And over the years, the same infrastructure has developed in the Five Towns.
They have a choice of kosher supermarkets and delis, as well as kosher restaurants, pizza parlors and a kosher Dunkin' Donuts. Both the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach and the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway have recently built new schools. The first Orthodox university in the area, Sh'or Yoshuv, is under construction in Lawrence. The Postal Service has even expanded its hours to accommodate the Orthodox, keeping its Lawrence office open on Sundays.
Jerry Cohen, the owner of Trees Accessories and Handbags shop, which his father opened in Cedarhurst in 1946, said the downtown area had gone through booms and busts over the years. The five-block area, encompassing about 250 stores, rode high in the 1960's and 70's when it attracted shoppers from far and wide. But the advent of malls and shopping centers sent the downtown, like so many others across Long Island, into decline.
The 1990's have seen a revival, with the opening of at least 12 major chain stores, including the Gap, Victoria's Secret and, most recently, an Omaha Steaks -- a non-kosher business that felt the Five Towns would be a strong market despite the heavy Orthodox influence.
"The Orthodox community is one of the best things that has happened to us since we've been in business," Mr. Cohen said. "It's given us a whole new audience, and the bonus for us is, it's one of the most affluent Orthodox communities in the country."
Ivan Greenberg, who runs the Davey Shop, a lingerie shop that has been in his family since 1946, said he became frustrated when people complain that the business district has changed. "I say to them, 'Look in the mirror, haven't you changed?' " he said. "Why shouldn't the town change?"
On Saturday the downtown may not bustle as much as it once did, because about a third of the stores are closed either in deference to the Orthodox or because they are owned by Orthodox, but Sundays often more than make up for that, Mr. Greenberg said.
But Mr. Cohen said the perception that the Five Towns have become predominantly Orthodox has hurt business. "A lot of people just assume we're closed on Saturdays and they don't come out," he said. "But there are a lot of misperceptions out there."
Mimi Bernstein, the owner of Mieka Ltd., a women's clothing shop that has been a staple along Central Avenue for 18 years, rankles a little at the talk that the Orthodox have forced stores to close on the Sabbath. "That's a myth, an old wive's tale," she said. "I'm open seven days a week and if anything, the Orthodox walk by on Saturdays and we smile and say 'Good Sabbath.' "
Relationships in residential neighborhoods are sometimes a little less cordial. Neighbors complain that even though the Orthodox do not drive on the Sabbath, parking problems arise when members drive to the synagogues for weekday services or when they drive to the synagogue before sundown on Friday and then leave the car parked on the street until after sundown on Saturday.
In the Lawrence Bay Park subdivision, where neighbors tried unsuccessfully to stop Congregation Bais Medrash from building an extension on a home that had been converted to a synagogue, many of the neighbors say they feel intimidated by the Orthodox congregation.
One homeowner who asked that she not be identified said that on one Sabbath, four Orthodox couples were walking side by side in the street as she drove toward home. "Instead of walking behind one another when they saw me or moving to the curb, they stayed right in the middle of the street," she said. "And they yelled at me when I finally honked at them. They didn't want me to drive, but you don't have to have this arrogance."
Despite the neighbors' opposition, Lawrence officials approved Bais Medrash's expansion plan, and an extension big enough to seat 122 members was completed in early 1999. The neighbors sued in state Supreme Court and a judge ruled in their favor last June, annulling the village's approval of the extension. But the congregation and village officials appealed, and are awaiting the higher court's opinion.
Thomas Pantelis, the attorney for the synagogue, said the neighbors' negative perceptions of the congregation were based in misunderstanding. He said he is hopeful that Bais Medrash's right to worship where it wants ultimately will be upheld by the appeals court.
"There's no reason why we can't strike a balance between the right of religious exercise versus the concerns of neighbors with respect to parking, traffic and quality of life issues," he said.
In the case of Congregation Bais Yakov, which is also in Lawrence, a neighbor, Howard Legum, has sued the village for allowing the synagogue, which seats 105, to operate with only four parking spaces. Steven Legum, who represents his parents in the case, said that parking is not a problem on the Sabbath, but up to 20 cars are routinely parked along the streets near the synagogue each morning during daily services.
"This is not a religious issue," Mr. Legum said, noting that his family has long been part of Congregation Beth Shalom, one of the oldest modern Orthodox synagogues in the Five Towns. "We have had commercial operations closed down in the area for similar reasons."
He said he was appalled that the village would allow someone to build an addition on a personal residence to create a synagogue and then take the structure off of the tax rolls even though it is also still being used as a home. "My personal opinion is that village officials are pandering to certain parts of the community when they let this kind of thing go on," he said.
Mayor Lawrence A. Blatte took exception to that charge. "Pandering is an unattractive word and it's extremely unfair," he said. "To the extent we have a large and growing Orthodox community with needs, we're trying to accommodate their needs."
Lawrence, like the other Five Towns, has gone through demographic changes, Mayor Blatte said, moving from a largely gentile population to a more Jewish one and now to Orthodox Jewish. "We have always invited people to come into the community and we have always been successful in managing the change," he said. "That's been the source of renewal for the village, and that won't change."
Cedarhurst, on the other hand, has been accused of the opposite, of unfairly trying to keep Orthodox shtiebels and synagogues out.
The Sephardic Congregation of the Five Towns has sued the village, claiming that an ordinance that would require the synagogue to pay the village $180,000 to waive parking requirements is unconstitutional. The local law requires one parking spot for every four occupants and requires a fee of $5,000 for each waived parking spot to help the village create or improve public parking nearby. The 176-seat synagogue has provided a plan for 8 parking spots, but is required to have 44.
"They call it a tax on religion, but we charge it to any commercial applicant," said Jerry Levenberg, village attorney for Cedarhurst. "Like any community, the Orthodox are in most ways a positive element in the village, but some groups are more cooperative when it comes to opening these facilities than others and are more attuned to what secular law requires."
Mr. Levenberg said he understands the religious imperative that has prompted the growing number of shtiebels -- officials estimate about 10 have opened throughout the Five Towns in the last few years.
"As a resident, what I don't understand is people have moved out here because of the aesthetics of the suburban village and yet they're bringing these very urban type of practices here," he said. "Nobody is saying we don't want you here, we just want something reasonable for everyone."
Mr. Mordechai, the synagogue's president, said the congregation had already modified its plans to meet the concerns of its neighbors. He maintained that the parking fee was unfair because parking is an issue only on rare occasions because the congregation is Orthodox and because the synagogue is a nonprofit organization.
Samuel G. Freedman, a journalism professor at Columbia University whose book "Jew vs. Jew" will be published this month, said the shtiebel conflicts were "a classic example of the culture of orthodoxy running headlong into suburban zoning laws."
Shtiebels have a long history in America, going back to prayer groups that met in Lower East Side tenement apartments at the turn of the century. "In cities they existed without running afoul of zoning and building-code violations," Mr. Freedman said. "But in the suburbs the sanctity of private property is a major part of life, so naturally they are an irritant."
But even as these individual cases work their way through the system, the Orthodox community in the Five Towns continues to grow and thrive. And that, Mr. Freedman said, in many ways defines the American experience of Jewry.
"It's a sign that the modern Orthodox have made it economically in America, just like the non-Orthodox did a few generations before them," he said. "That's really a barometer of American Jewry at large because the feeling a generation ago was that the Orthodox would wither away or they would just be the poor economic relations. Hardly any experts foresaw 25 years ago that they would make it to suburbia."

Ready or Not, Welcome to the 401(k) Plan

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
MARGARET FULLER, manager of profit sharing at 7-Eleven Inc., is proud that three-quarters of the company's nearly 15,000 eligible employees now participate in its 401(k) retirement savings plan. Three years ago, only half had signed up.
The big increase wasn't caused by a surge in the company's matching contribution or a change in the plan's investment offerings. All it took was a bow to human nature. 
 Instead of leaving it up to employees to complete enrollment forms and return them -- and having many of them procrastinate or shy away -- 7-Eleven started enrolling employees automatically on the first anniversary of their hiring; only those who want to opt out of participation needed to lift a finger.
The company, based in Dallas, is one of about 50 large corporations that have begun automatic enrollment in recent years, as many other employers waited for the federal government to take a stand on the practice. Last month, however, regulators in two federal departments gave it a solid go-ahead, and the Internal Revenue Service announced several rulings clarifying the automatic-enrollment ground rules for businesses, nonprofit organizations and school systems.
In a joint statement, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman and Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said they saw automatic enrollment as a "promising method of encouraging participation by those who disproportionately have been missing the benefits of a regular, disciplined approach to retirement saving," meaning the many younger and lower-paid workers who put off saving for retirement because they feel they cannot spare any of their pay.
In fact, experts say, most people cannot afford not to contribute to the plans. Even if the current Social Security system is maintained indefinitely, the dwindling of traditional, defined-benefit pension plans means that few workers can count on a financially secure retirement without putting aside money of their own.
Hewitt Associates, a benefits research firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., estimates that three-fourths of eligible American workers are enrolled in 401(k) plans. But that still leaves millions of Americans without any retirement savings program.
David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America in Chicago, said he expected the number of companies using automatic enrollment to double annually for the next five years, and that more than half of all plans would use the method by 2005. In addition, the new I.R.S. rulings make it possible to automatically enroll all workers, not just new hires, in 401(k) plans and their close cousins, 403(b)'s (for public schools and charities) and 457(b)'s (for state and local government workers).
In automatic enrollment, the initial percentage of pay to be set aside is left to the employer's discretion. (7-Eleven's plan sets aside 3 percent of gross pay, a typical rate, and the company matches employee contributions at 36 cents on the dollar.)
Employers also decide how the money will initially be invested. According to Mark Iwry, the benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department, employers are encouraged to put savings of automatic enrollees into a balanced fund, rather than a more risky stock fund or a low-return money market fund. "The plans are typically very careful in the investments they select for employees," he said.
Once enrolled, employees are generally free to select different rates and investment vehicles according to plan rules.
The experience of 7-Eleven shows that automatic sign-up can go a long way toward closing the enrollment gap for lower-paid employees -- an important issue for all participants, because federal rules sharply restrict benefits for top earners if too few of their lower-paid co-workers take part.
Still, some critics wonder whether herding uninterested workers into the plans accomplishes much in the long run. "The government is leading the horse to water, but they haven't focused on teaching them to want to drink," said Ric Edelman, an author and financial planner in Fairfax, Va. He cited Hewitt statistics showing that fewer than one-third of people who leave jobs with 401(k)'s roll over the money into individual retirement accounts; the remainder simply pocket -- and pay taxes on -- the cash payout from the plans.
Other analysts worry that automatic enrollees will be too passive as savers. In a study of one company's workers, the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., found that most left their starting contribution rates unchanged and never moved out of the low-yielding money market fund in which the company put them.
But Leslie Kramerich, an acting assistant labor secretary, said it was most important that the workers become savers in the first place. "Once they get started, then we can tackle whether they're too conservative or too cautious," she said.
Getting more workers involved in 401(k)'s makes the plans more effective as morale builders, employers say. Ben Goldstein, director of strategic human resource planning for Primex Technologies, an aerospace company in St. Petersburg, Fla., said that when his company's workers receive their quarterly 401(k) statements and see the 50 percent matching contribution from the company, they are more motivated to stay on. "It's like free money," he said.
Two years ago, before Primex started using automatic enrollment, about 35 percent of workers took part in the plan; now four-fifths do, Mr. Goldstein said.
STILL, some workers who are automatically enrolled in 401(k) plans ought to opt out, because even plans with generous matching rates are not the best choice for everyone, experts say. Lower-paid people in their 20's and 30's may be better off putting their limited resources toward a down payment on a first home or paying off debts like college loans, said Robert Clark, professor of business and economics at North Carolina State University. And union officials say that however advantageous the plans might be, some of their members genuinely cannot spare the money.
If workers decide to leave automatic-enrollment plans after the deductions have already begun from their paychecks, they face the same early-withdrawal penalties that other 401(k) members do: 10 percent of the balance, plus income tax. But Ms. Fuller of 7-Eleven said few workers had complained about being unwittingly swept into the company's plan. "When they get the statement at the end of the quarter," she said, "they're usually very happy."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
They Know How Your Garden Grows

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
HALF a century ago, Beverley Nichols, an English journalist, defied common sense and the advice of friends and bought himself a small country estate. Upon inspection he found that the property came with several fixtures, the most permanent of which was Oldfield, the gardener, who had worked on the place for more than 40 years, and outlasted the two previous owners.
Although the relationship began with caution and a degree of skepticism on both sides, Mr. Nichols gradually realized that the old gardener was invaluable. Together they created a showplace, a process that Mr. Nichols described in three books, "Merry Hall," "Sunlight on the Lawn" and "Laughter on the Stairs." 
 Times have changed, but the need for professional gardeners has not. With the economy growing like chickweed in the spring, more and more people have both the desire and the means for significant gardens. A well-designed planting design can be a work of art, with the power to elevate a brand-new faux chateau to a higher aesthetic realm. But a garden, unlike a painting or a piece of sculpture, needs constant care and maintenance. Most landscapers and lawn care crews don't have the necessary expertise, and these days, people like Oldfield are hard to come by.
They do exist, however. Kathy Parsons is one of them. For the past 20 years, she has spent a good portion of her professional time caring for other people's gardens in Essex and Bergen Counties. Working mostly by herself, Ms. Parsons waters, feeds, weeds, deadheads and monitors annual and perennial plants for diseases and pests. She also stakes, thins, prunes and divides -- tasks that often intimidate gardeners.
Not all of her clients have extensive property. "I've done everything from a golf club to a small suburban home," she said.
Ms. Parsons characterized her average client as a "relatively wealthy and independent" person who loves his or her garden, but is simply too busy with career, family or community service to look after the plants without help.
Those crowded schedules and demanding lives mean that often the professional gardener can use a certain amount of latitude when it comes to plant choice and installation.
"I don't get specifics," said Ms. Parsons, who added that the ability to do "a lot of mind reading" is as important as knowing when to apply the rose food.
If Beverley Nichols's Oldfield had a spiritual descendant, he would be Andy Durbridge, a professional gardener, designer and estate manager on Long Island's North Shore. In the business for 10 years, the English-born Mr. Durbridge has spent the last four working for his current employers and living on their estate. His job combines hands-on tasks like planning for planting, tending the estate rose garden and monitoring for pests and diseases, and administrative responsibilities like supervising arborists and other ground-care professionals.
Mr. Durbridgealso does design work and maintenance planning for other clients. "Maintenance is the first thing you address when you design," he said. "Any designer who doesn't talk about maintenance will probably make mistakes."
Fanny Clark, who is soon to retire after many years as a professional gardener in the Montclair area, values the personal relationships that she has cultivated along with her clients' plants and shrubs. Those relationships begin with lots of questions.
"I want to know what colors they like, which windows they look out of in their homes," she said. "I find out how much they will be outside and when, and whether they go away in the summer.
"Clients know the look and feel they want," she added. "I translate that into what's doable."
Like Ms. Parsons, Mrs. Clark cares for a variety of gardens. She has often been called on to tame a neglected estate garden. Her favorite gardens are those laid out during the 1920's and 30's, an era she refers to as the golden age of American garden design.
According to Mrs. Clark, these older gardens benefit from having great "bones," defining structures like walls, terraces and walkways, as well as mature trees.
Once a garden is under control, Mrs. Clark maintains it weekly. Both she and Ms. Parsons are also frequently called on to spruce up clients' gardens before parties and other events.
Over the years, Ms. Parsons and Mrs. Clark have noticed a demographic shift among their clients.
"Economics has changed the face of gardening," said Mrs. Clark. "Clients have gotten younger, and are now often two-income couples in their 30's." These people, she said, frequently reject traditional workhorse plants like impatiens and hostas in favor of newer and more exotic materials.
Some of the professional gardeners have clients who like to get out and do some work in their own gardens. For them, Fanny Clark maintains the beds to make the prospect of that work a pleasure rather than a burden.
"A garden should be a place that people can fuss in a little bit when they come home at the end of the day," she said.
Jody Staunton of New Canaan, Conn., is a garden designer whose work leads her to garden maintenance.
"I only maintain the gardens I design," said Ms. Staunton, who cares for gardens in New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut. "Maintenance is so important in keeping the shape and form of the garden, that maintenance and design are really one and the same."
Some of her clients are interested in new plant colors and varieties, and she travels around the United States and Europe to find them.
Each gardener arrived at the vocation by a different route. Andy Durbridge said he came from a family of green thumbs and he did "many things aside from horticulture" before settling into gardening.
Mrs. Clark grew up on a farm and attended a school run by Quakers, a group with a traditional interest in horticulture. By the time her children no longer needed constant supervision, she had become an avid gardener.
A serendipitous meeting with Montclair's celebrated landscape designer and gardener, Avis Campbell, led to a job offer. When Miss Campbell died she left Mrs. Clark "her clients and her library." Fanny Clark hung out her own shingle. Working alone, she had, at the peak of her career, 13 regular clients, whose gardens she visited once a week. During the gardening season she worked from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. every day. "By the end of each day I was absolutely dead," she said.
Ms. Parsons began her professional career by working for a commercial nursery and also worked for a time for Avis Campbell. Eventually she went into business for herself. Now she maintains gardens of her own design, as well as some designed by others.
Ms. Staunton has worked in the landscape design and garden maintenance business for 15 years. After studying at Radcliff, worked at a Boston company that specializes in indoor landscape design, wholesale nurseries and a landscape designer, and seven years ago went into business for herself.
Mrs. Clark has always worked alone, preferring to maintain an intensely personal relationship with her clients and their gardens. Ms. Staunton and Ms. Parsons would like to hire gardeners to help with maintenance, but the supply of knowledgeable people is limited.
"There is such a shortage of talented gardeners who know what they are doing," said Ms. Staunton, who added that many people seem more attracted to design than maintenance. This, she said, may be partly because of the "physical challenges" in maintenance.
Each of the four gardeners stressed that in horticulture the learning never stops. Mr. Durbridge, for example, maintains trial beds in his personal garden on the estate where he works.
On the verge of retirement, Mrs. Clark remains philosophical. "Just when you think you have a handle on shade gardening," she said, "you get a client who has nothing but full sun. It's the most humbling profession in the world."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IT is just a short walk from the Staples Center, where the Democrats, the news media and assorted demonstrators spent the week playing out the politics of the information age. But the thriving Los Angeles fashion district has more in common with 12th-century Baghdad than the California of the new millennium.
The 80-block jumble of prewar commercial buildings, hastily constructed low-rise arcades commingled with a few modern towers, is home to 5,000 companies employing 50,000 people and taking in $8 billion a year in wholesale and retail sales. And it epitomizes raw capitalism in both its glory and its shame. 
 The district has a reputation for paying its lowest rung of workers brutally low wages -- which drew the ire of demonstrators last week -- and for having too little respect for trademark laws and tax codes. But for many of those who work here, including some who have made fortunes, the district also reflects the essence of the American dream. It is a place where recent immigrants can build successful businesses and new lives in an environment not dissimilar to those found in many developing countries.
"What we have here is a souk," said Uri Harkham, one of the major property owners in the district. "It's open to everyone, and it's the kind of place you can go to buy something for $3 or $300."
MR. HARKHAM, who was born in Iraq and is chief executive of Jonathan Martin, one of the area's leading garment manufacturers with more than $100 million in annual sales, is reluctant to talk specifically about the extent of his holdings in the district. But they are big and growing. One new building that he is constructing with his Moroccan-born partner, Moshe Aflalo, has space for 13 retail stores and more than 60 companies clamoring to fill them.
The district, just southeast of the center of downtown Los Angeles, was widely perceived as dirty and dangerous five years ago, but it has since blossomed. Property values have more than doubled and vacancies, particularly for ground-floor properties, are almost impossible to find in much of the area, said Ed Zoraster, a vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a real estate broker. The city has issued more than 650 building permits for renovations or new construction in the district since 1995.
Mr. Zoraster gives some credit for the revival to a business improvement district, organized that year, that has improved the neighborhood's appearance and security. But the most important factor, he said, has been the drive of immigrants like Mr. Harkham, 52, who came to Los Angeles in 1975 after living in Israel and Australia.
Like many of his peers, Mr. Harkham brought with him the bazaar culture of his native land, with its love of bargaining, jostling and quick, seat-of-the-pants decision-making. "At the end of the day, the Middle Easterners are all traders at heart -- Arab, Jew and Persian, Christian, Muslim, it doesn't matter," he said. "We have the ambition and the drive others don't. The fashion business is so fast you have to be willing to be a gambler, and live on the edge."
Jerry Sullivan, the editor of California Apparel News, a trade paper, said newcomers from the Middle East and North Africa had largely replaced the American-born Jewish entrepreneurs, many transplanted from New York, who helped establish Los Angeles as a leading center for sportswear and women's garment manufacturing in the 1950's. Though Middle Easterners own only 7 percent of the district's apparel manufacturers and account for a negligible part of the factory work force, they own most of the area's premier brands, including Guess, Hot Kiss, Bissou Bissou and BCBG, and control much of the region's textile trade.
"These guys are better at developing brands and styles than anyone else who has been here," Mr. Sullivan said. "They are more aggressive than the native-born. They know what sexy is. They are willing to strike their own path and offer no apologies."
The restaurant scene in the district has come to reflect the new ethnic order. Many Israeli, Persian and North African establishments have opened, and many get the bulk of their sales from meals they deliver to their perpetually harried customers. Korean eateries are also popping up, reflecting Korean immigrants' emergence as the second powerful ethnic influence in the increasingly polyglot district.
UNLIKE those from the Middle East, who dominate the local industry's high-fashion end, the Korean entrepreneurs tend to make their presence felt in the lower price ranges and in manufacturing. Victor C. Kim, owner of Cherish International, a consulting firm in the district, said people of Korean background own at least 600 wholesale and retail operations, as many as 1,000 contractors -- the companies who actually do the sewing under contract from marketers and design houses -- and hundreds of knitting and other manufacturing operations.
Mr. Kim said many business people of Korean descent in the district felt unfairly tarred with negative stereotypes -- that Koreans rely on knockoffs of styles developed by others; that the worst wages and most abusive labor practices are found in their factories; that they dodge paying taxes. In fact, he said, Koreans are more likely than other groups to be victims of unfair business practices, like landlords' demands for astronomical rents and "key money," an upfront payment to obtain a lease that can run as high as $200,000. Protests by Korean groups against this practice have been laced with talk about "Merchant of Venice" figures, a none-too-subtle stereotyping of the landlords, many of whom are Jewish, Mr. Sullivan said.
The tensions may ease as the Korean segment of the district becomes more self-sufficient, Mr. Kim said, with Korean-owned banks and real estate companies coming to the fore and with Korean-owned garment companies like Koo's Manufacturing, Bubblegum USA and Impression developing their own fashion sensibility, often by hiring recent Korean-American graduates of the nearby Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and other local design schools.
Latinos constitute the third major ethnic element in the district, accounting for the majority of the work force, including 85 percent of factory workers; most retail shoppers in the district are Hispanic as well. Spanish-speaking immigrants have only begun to be a business force in the district, through the rise of locally trained designers of Latin background and through ownership of sewing shops.
Sewing is proving to be the part of the industry most vulnerable to overseas competition, said Joe Rodriguez, the executive director of the Garment Contractors Association of Southern California. The number of production jobs has fallen by 10,000 since the peak in 1997, and low unemployment has made the remaining jobs harder to fill with legal workers.
Ordinarily, Mr. Rodriguez said, such conditions might lead to higher wages. But most shops cannot afford to go much above the $7-an-hour average paid by most contractors, because of intense price pressures from retail customers and the ease with which production can be moved outside the country, especially to Mexico.
THOSE pressures have also hampered union organizers, who, after decades of trying, have yet to penetrate virtually any of the district's small factories, most employing 50 or fewer workers. Goetz Wolff, research director for the County Federation of Labor, cited overseas competition, fragmentation and the ready supply of illegal workers available to less scrupulous operators.
"There are still lots of illegal shops," said Mr. Wolff, an economist who has studied the garment industry for years. "Everyone says they don't know about it, or someone else is doing it. But somebody is buying the product."
Still, Mr. Wolff and other economists predict that the district will continue to thrive, partly because of the fashion world's rapid pace of change and the resulting need for quick turnaround by manufacturers. They also point to the growing influence of Los Angeles as a design center and to the region's huge and highly diverse consumer base.
"This kind of thing can't be stopped," said Mr. Harkham at his real estate office in the heart of the district. "It's a very unique place, and it serves the region's melting pot. There's a comfort level to being here. You have the good, bad and the ugly, but it works."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
The Whole of Volatility Is Less Than Its Parts

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week.
E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT may be difficult to imagine that any decade in American stock market history saw the magnitude or number of violent swings witnessed in the 1990's.
Believe it or not, however, the market volatility of the last 10 years was no higher than the average of the last seven decades. In fact, there was less volatility in the 1990's than in either of the two previous decades -- 21 percent less than the 1970's and 31 percent less than the 1980's. 
 Those are among the more startling conclusions of a new stock volatility study by Prof. John Campbell of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Martin Lettau, senior economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank; Prof. Burton Malkiel of Princeton; and Prof. Yexiao Xu of the University of Texas at Dallas.
Why, then, do the recent gyrations seem so severe? One possible explanation is in another of the researchers' findings: that even though the overall market may be no more volatile than in the past, the average stock is much more so. In fact, the volatility of the typical stock in the 1990's was about twice as high as in the early 1960's. That is because the correlation between individual stocks' gyrations has fallen -- in other words, more stocks are rising sharply at the same time that other stocks plunge.
So on a day when an Internet retailer misses earnings expectations and immediately sheds a third of its market value, the stock of another company is skyrocketing because it has just reported unexpectedly good news. The extent of the volatility for any given company is indeed a modern phenomenon. But across the entire stock market of more than 7,000 companies, these gyrations largely cancel one another out, leaving the overall market no more volatile than it was in previous decades.
This combination of higher volatility and reduced correlation has profound implications for how many stocks an investor needs in a portfolio in order to achieve adequate diversification. For years, statisticians have argued that a portfolio of about 20 stocks, in a variety of industries, is large enough to diversify away 90 percent of the volatility associated with owning a single stock. According to the new study, however, given that the average stock's volatility is twice as high as it was during the 1960's and 1970's, the number of stocks needed to achieve such diversification is now closer to 50.
If your portfolio does not have that many stocks, chances are that you will have more sleepless nights and yet no greater returns to show for it, than you would with a larger portfolio. Your greater suffering will be in vain.
That melancholy conclusion comes from the market's structure. In a stock market as efficient as ours, investors are for the most part rewarded only for taking unavoidable risks. But the volatility and risk associated with smaller portfolios are entirely avoidable -- and thus you shouldn't expect higher returns for incurring them.
What accounts for the average stock's much-increased volatility? Answering with any certainty will require additional research, but the authors of the new study point to two contributing factors. The first is the trend over the last decade away from conglomerates and toward companies whose businesses are more focused. In a conglomerate, poor earnings from a single division have a relatively small impact on the price of the company's stock. If that division is spun off and becomes publicly traded on its own, a similarly poor earnings report will have a much greater impact.
A RELATED factor is that a greater number of younger and smaller companies are publicly traded today. Because investors feel far less certain about the long-term prospects of these companies, their stock prices are much more sensitive to good or bad news than are those of larger, more established concerns.
Regardless of the reasons, the wider gyrations of individual stocks teach a broad lesson: Diversification, which has always been an important way to gain immunity from volatility, is now more crucial than ever.

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE;
At Hotels, the Butlers Are Doing It

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel

 BODY:
WHEN I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel a few years ago, I opened the door to a young woman dressed in white tie and tails who identified herself as the butler. Since I had no idea what to do with her, I sent her on her way. A female butler. What a funny idea.
During my fifth hour of butler training last week, I was no longer amused. Maybe it was having to wear the white tie and tails in 80-degree heat. Or maybe it was that the butlers who were training me had a quality -- a stillness, a patience, an obedience of sorts -- that I will never have in this lifetime. If I could have gotten my hands on the guest who left her underwear piled in the bathtub and her shirt draped over a bedroom lamp, she would not be alive today. 
 Though I was clearly a bust at butling, St. Regis Hotels and Resorts has had no trouble finding more appropriate candidates since it started the training program in 1991. While initially, most guests were as puzzled as I was by the notion of a butler, in the last two years the service has taken off, increasing occupancy rates and customer loyalty. Other luxury hotels have started imitating it, especially as the economy booms and people have more money than time.
Richard Cotter, a vice president and managing director of St. Regis, said that before joining the hotel he worked at the Waldorf-Astoria and New York Palace, where "we put butlers in the towers of both hotels in imitation of the St. Regis." Under his watch, the St. Regis has recently expanded its butler services to its hotels in Houston and Washington. This winter, ski butlers will arrive at the St. Regis in Aspen, "which will extend our service right to the slopes, so no one has to worry about their gear," Mr. Cotter said.
Off the slopes, the St. Regis butlers -- there is one on each floor -- are considered the primary contact for guests, who can channel all requests through them, without ever calling the concierge or housekeeping. "We live at such a frantic pace, and having the butler, someone whom you trust, is important," Sharon Telesca, the director of sales and marketing for the St. Regis New York, said. "Sixty-five percent of our business is repeat, and these people have come to consider the butler their personal assistant at the hotel."
Wendy Reisman, director of public relations for the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia, which uses the term "club concierge" for many of the tasks that fall under the butler's purview at the St. Regis, said: "The term butler, in America, anyway, gives the connotation of luxury and a higher level of service, even though that service has always been available by another name."
Yet, Ritz-Carlton has recently added a technology butler, who fixes computers, beepers and cell phones, and a bath butler, who will draw a guest's bath from a menu of options.
Ms. Telesca conceded, "People have said it's a marketing gimmick, and it is, but it is also a service people are looking for."
Some guests like the service so much, they have hired the butlers away for their very own. The St. Regis recruits graduates from butler and hotel schools, but unlike the loyal family retainer in England who will carry the tray forever, here the butler is on a management track. In addition to providing guest services, each butler manages the 20 rooms on each floor and deals with all the other departments in the hotel. One former St. Regis butler now manages the Carlyle Hotel; another manages a chain of hotels in Holland.
Benjamin Lau, also a former butler, is now the training manager for the program at all St. Regis properties, including the branch that is to open in Los Angeles next month, and the St. Regis Club, 105 rooms that will be managed by St. Regis at the Essex House in New York, also opening next month.
"Our first generation of butlers were trained by Ivor Spencer," Mr. Lau said, referring to the premier butler trainer in England. "We took the master skills from a private house and used them in a hotel setting for our guests, who are C.E.O.'s, celebrities and royalty. The butler is the nerve center of the hotel for the guest."
The usual training period for a St. Regis butler is 30 days, during which time trainees trail a butler, learning everything from cutting a cigar to opening a bottle of Champagne. Mr. Lau said trainees also "do a lot of role-playing, trying to anticipate the guest's needs."
Mr. Lau showed me to the presidential suite, where the nightly fee is $11,500. As we settled at the dining room table, he surveyed it sideways. "This needs polishing," he noted. He also had the unsettling habit of running his hands along the walls or on moldings in the hallways, checking for dust, and more than once, he bent over to remove a small speck of something from the floor or a table, tucking it into his pocket.
"You're trained to pay attention to detail," he said, enumerating the butler's myriad duties, including my personal favorite, packing and unpacking. Do people really want a stranger going through their things?
Mr. Lau nodded. "We never unpack toiletries unless requested," he said, "but guests often send their luggage ahead and have the butler unpack, using his or her judgment about what needs to be pressed.
"We are often asked to hang the clothes by color, which is how some people organize their closets," he continued. "But if you don't like us to unpack, we will include it in your guest history and won't offer the service again. A lot of people love it."
He told of one guest who travels with an enormous assortment of vitamins; the butler must arrange them from Vitamin A onward, but never on a surface where the guest has to bend down.
He's kidding, right? Mr. Lau shook his head seriously. "When I was a butler, I found this to be very interesting about other people's lifestyles," he said. "It's something for your life library."
Other selections might include the night that the guest in the presidential suite requested Mr. Lau and two other butlers to stand along the wall like movie extras, while a party of 10 was served dinner. Then, there was the morning a C.E.O.'s shined shoes disappeared; it seemed another guest found the sight of them in the hallway aesthetically unpleasing and threw them away. The hotel, needless to say, replaced them. Did they kick out that guest?
Mr. Lau looked surprised. "No," he said. "He comes back often, and when he does, we are very careful to keep all the shined shoes in the pantry until the wake-up calls."
With these kinds of considerations, don't the butlers ever feel like slaves? "No," Mr. Lau said firmly. "They are managing the lifestyle of the guest. And it is a stepping stone for their careers."
It certainly is for Keiley Rea, the 16th-floor butler to whom I was assigned. A 24-year-old native of Northampton, England, she has been at the St. Regis for five months and is already, Mr. Lau said, quite promising.
Ms. Rea familiarized me with the large board in the butler's pantry, where the status of every room and its guests is updated hourly -- vacant or occupied, clean or dirty, inspected or not. When she brings anything to a room, she does not use a cart, since the hotel's idea of the butler is to remind a guest of home. Or the home they wished they lived in.
I looked through some guest histories. One "loves Grgich Hills white wine as amenity upon arrival," and another "waited too long for breakfast" in March of 1998. That incident remains listed as a reminder not to do it again.
I accompanied Ms. Rea on inspections of cleaned rooms, and Mr. Lau came along, to check on his charge. She put on one white glove to check dust on the moldings and the headboard, then got down on her hands and knees behind the desk. She opened each drawer and swept her hand underneath the paper liners. She looked beneath the sofa cushions for crumbs and arranged the chocolates, so that all the St. Regis logos faced up. She held the bar glasses up to the light to see if they were clean and double-checked the expiration dates on items in the mini bar.
In the bathroom, she ran her gloveless hand over the insides of the bathtub, checking for stray hairs (yuck!), and when she checked the bathrobes, she rearranged a satin hanger, so its bow faced forward.
The entire process took 15 minutes. Mr. Lau then pointed out that one bathroom sconce had a light bulb with the wrong wattage. Except for the tips of her ears turning red, she remained composed. "Yes, thank you," she said evenly. I would have smacked him.
As we moved on to the occupied rooms, she was distressed to find an ash in an ashtray, but went into the bathroom and emerged, relieved. "The guest has been back," she said. "There is a used washcloth as well." She put it on her silver tray and made a note to have it replaced. She also refolded the toilet paper.
"It's nice for the guest to see that the butler's been in," she said comfortably, heading back to the pantry for the umpteenth time. I nodded. And I couldn't help but think that it was ever so much nicer to have a butler, than to be one.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Automakers Paying The Price of Higher Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
WHEN automakers brought out their 2000 models last fall, executives were jubilant. Their companies were enjoying record sales, and the Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases seemed to be having little effect; the manufacturers simply offset them by subsidizing their discounted auto loans more heavily.
Auto sales remain strong, but the optimism has faded. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has pushed up short-term interest rates four more times since last autumn. Trying to avoid raising interest rates for their discounted loans, automakers stepped up the subsidies even further, but the mounting costs crimped profit margins. They wound up having to raise rates anyway on their lowest-rate loans this summer. 
 "Greenspan was trying to slow it down and we didn't believe it -- we thought it was just a bump; we'll eat it," said Tom McAlear, the chief operating officer of DaimlerChrysler Financial Services, the North American lending unit of the German automaker. "Finally, we said, 'Alan, you're serious, we believe you.' "
Economists are fond of repeating the adage that monetary policy affects the real economy with long and variable lags. The lag has seemed longer than usual for the current round of rate increases. The continued strength of the stock market has played a role, but so has the remarkable stamina of auto sales even as rates have risen.
When the Fed raised interest rates in 1994 in leaps of half a point and even three-quarters of a point at a time, the automakers' finance subsidiaries reacted with alarm, swiftly passing on matching rate increases to their loan customers. The automakers, particularly General Motors, were still reeling from the 1991 recession and in no mood then for a war of discounts.
But the current round of Fed increases crept up on an industry that has been very profitable since the mid-1990's. All but one of the increases came in just a quarter-point increment, and most have been hailed on Wall Street as the last. One result has been a gradual ratcheting up of incentive costs, escalating into a discounting war that no automaker is willing to lose, even as everyone in the industry hopes that the Fed will not act again.
"There's a little heat on -- we're hoping for no more increases," said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s chief executive.
While Internet and computer companies now rule Wall Street, the auto industry remains a cornerstone of the real economy. Autos still account for about 4 percent of the nation's economy, a percentage that has barely budged in decades. General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are each eight times the size of Microsoft in sales, and economic output is measured by final sales of goods and services, not by stock prices. Yet G.M.'s market value is now just a tenth of Microsoft's, one reason that Carl Icahn bought a big stake in G.M. last week.
Consumer interest rates are the crucial economic factor in auto sales. Four-fifths of all vehicle buyers finance their cars, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles through loans or leases. They closely study monthly payments, which depend on interest rates. By contrast, the price of filling up the tank, high this summer, has rarely had much impact on auto sales over the years, except when the overall economy was weak.
Banks raised their auto loan rates repeatedly over the last year in response to Fed actions. The average bank rate for four-year auto loans is now just over 10 percent, compared with 8.3 percent in the spring of last year, said David L. Littmann, the senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit.
After the recent increases, automakers' finance subsidiaries are now charging an average of about 7 percent. Their average for the second quarter, 6.48 percent, was actually a few hundredths of a point lower than a year earlier. Automakers tried to raise their finance subsidiaries' rates last winter, but they retreated rather than lose market share to rivals.
Not surprisingly, the manufacturers have been financing a growing number of their customers' purchases, and the subsidies to keep rates so low have pushed automakers' marketing costs to as much as $2,300 a vehicle. Sales continue to roll along at a very strong pace of 17.5 million cars and light trucks a year, a little slower than last winter on a seasonally adjusted basis but still ahead of last year.
The question is how much longer it will be before the auto industry gives in and raises or restricts its subsidized rates, at the risk of losing sales. James P. Holden, the chief executive of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, says this has begun to happen, but slowly. "We have stopped matching every Fed increase and holding flat payments," he said. "Payments have gone up."

The Pocketbook Issues In the Future of Coach

BYLINE: By KATE BERRY

 BODY:
INVESTORS who are awaiting the initial public offering of Coach Inc., the luxury leather goods maker, are likely to be disappointed, analysts warn, because Coach's parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, might well do better if it sells the unit than if it takes it public.
Sara Lee reached a similar conclusion last week when it agreed to sell its PYA/Monarch food service unit to Koninklijke Ahold N.V., the Dutch supermarket giant, for $1.57 billion. In June, PYA/Monarch filed with the Securities and Exchange Corporation to raise $160 million in an initial offering to be managed by Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barney. 
 In each case, Sara Lee intended initially to keep 80 percent of the company and offer 20 percent to the public.
"With the direct sale of PYA/Monarch to Ahold, Sara Lee obtains cash now, eliminates market uncertainty and secures a multiyear supply contract, creating significant value for Sara Lee shareholders," said C. Steven McMillan, chief executive of Sara Lee.
Mr. McMillan was the architect of the company's plan to sell some assets and focus on its core businesses. Though it is best known for its baked goods, Sara Lee also owns brands including Ball Park franks, L'eggs hosiery, Hanes underwear, Wonderbra, Endust furniture cleaner and Kiwi shoe polish.
A Sara Lee spokeswoman, Julie Ketay, said after the PYA/Monarch deal that the $140 million Coach offering, to be managed by Goldman Sachs, was still on track to be completed by the end of the year, but some fund managers and analysts are not convinced.
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods group, is among the many names being tossed up as potential buyers of Coach. Last year LVMH teamed up with its archrival Prada S.p.A. to win a bidding war with the Gucci Group for another high-class brand, Fendi, the Italian apparel and accessories group. They paid one trillion lire, or $483.6 million, for a 51 percent stake in Fendi.
"For some reason, the market will put a higher multiple on the same business with the same earnings if Bernard Arnault owned this company," said Greg Fontana, vice president and co-manager for the John Hancock funds in Boston, referring to the LVMH chairman.
PEDRO BERNAL, an analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said: "The most likely choice is for it to be sold than to do an I.P.O. Just about everybody has been mentioned, so it's not a question of who, but what price."
To be sure, some fashion stocks have performed poorly, like Donna Karan International and Tommy Hilfiger. But those with expanded product lines like jewelry, shoes and handbags, have proved that pricey baubles have a place on Wall Street. Coach, with sales of $507 million in the fiscal year ended July 3, 1999, according to its prospectus, may be aiming for a valuation akin to that of Kenneth Cole, the shoe designer that also makes handbags and accessories, analysts say. Kenneth Cole, which has seen its shares jump to $45.3125, from below $10 a share in 1998, has a market capitalization of $925.05 million.
Jeffrey Kanter, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said Coach had plenty of momentum behind it. "It's bouncing back from a difficult environment over the past few years where Asia reduced their purchasing power," he said.
Sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 32 percent a year, to $540.4 million in 1997, from $19 million in 1985 when Sara Lee acquired the family-owned business, only to slide as a result of Asia's financial crisis. Sales dipped 3.4 percent in 1998 and 2.8 percent in 1999 but are now starting to recover.
The company, which has 106 American retail stores, hopes to rebound with an ambitious plan to open 50 new stores in the next three years, remodel existing ones and expand its international presence. Similar strategies helped fatten revenue for Tiffany, Gucci , and LVMH, all of which have expanded their product lines to attract upper middle-class shoppers -- those that have fared so well in today's economy.
Coach, which also sells through several catalogs and 63 factory outlets, sees big growth opportunities in Japan, where consumers spend substantially more for handbags than in the United States. The company has a fashionably modern Web site and is branching into products for the home, like leather director's chairs, and even into pet supplies, from collars to beds. But analysts caution that fashion trends change quickly in high-end luxury goods.
If there is an initial offering, Coach could gain points because, unlike many others going public, it is profitable. In the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2000, Coach's net income jumped 67 percent, to $32.3 million, as sales rose 9.7 percent, to $427.2 million, according to its S.E.C. filing.
Proceeds from the initial offering would be used to repay a portion of debt to Sara Lee. Coach also plans to enter into a revolving credit facility with Sara Lee under which it may borrow up to $75 million. (It expects to borrow about $50 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.)
Within 18 months of the initial offering, Sara Lee plans to sell its 80.1 percent stake in Coach. Sara Lee also plans to shed Champion sportswear, with $500 million in annual sales, and its recently acquired International Fabrics division of the British retailer Courtaulds Textiles, with $400 million in sales.
In announcing the divestiture plans, Mr. McMillan said that the sales would bring in at least $2.5 billion, giving the company enough cash to buy other companies that fit better with the brands it is keeping.
"Steve McMillan will spend the peak of his career disassembling the conglomerate that he built," said Mr. Fontana, at John Hancock funds. "I don't believe conglomerates make sense unless you're Jack Welch."

HEADLINE: Health Care Bonds Pass a Credit Test

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH still under the shadows of a government investigation into its billing practices, HCA-The Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest hospital chain, made a successful foray into the debt markets on Friday.
Strong investor demand allowed HCA, formerly called the Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corporation, to increase the size of its issue by 50 percent, to $750 million. 
 The debt offering was a key test of whether HCA had regained the trust of investors, and apparently it had: they placed more than $2 billion in orders for the 10-year notes. It was also a test of whether the for-profit health care industry was recovering after years in critical care.
The reception that investors gave the HCA issue added to evidence from the stock market that it is. Shares of publicly traded hospital companies have soared this year, even as the overall stock market has stumbled on concerns about rising interest rates and slowing corporate growth.
Kathleen F. Lamb, a high-yield health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, called the market hot for hospital credit issues. "Issuers not taking advantage of this are asleep at the wheel," she said.
Through underwriters led by Chase Securities and Goldman, Sachs, HCA priced 10-year senior unsecured notes at 99.53 to yield 8.821 percent, or about 305 basis points more than a 10-year Treasury note with a comparable maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Price talk ahead of the sale was of a spread over Treasuries of 312.5 to 325 basis points. The notes, which were given an 8.75 percent coupon, have a maturity date of Sept. 1, 2010.
HCA, based in Nashville, is considered a bellwether in the hospital industry. It initially planned to issue two maturities but settled on one. Moody's Investors Services rated the 10-year note Ba-2, its second-highest junk grade. The Standard & Poor's Corporation gave it a low investment grade, BB+.
Stephen Carter, senior market analyst at MCM CorporateWatch, a research firm, said the deal included a make-whole call provision. "In effect what this means is that the issue is essentially noncallable because the price is so high and will only be called if Treasury yields move significantly lower and it makes economic sense to do so," he said. "This is a regular feature on many investment grade and upper-level-rated high-yield bond issues."
HCA said the proceeds from the financing would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of bank debt. In May, the company agreed to pay $745 million in civil penalties to settle part of a broad government inquiry into whether its success was achieved in part by cheating federal health programs.
Still, criminal and other civil investigations that have long been at the heart of the case remain unresolved. They concern whether the company's hospitals fraudulently overstated expenses to increase reimbursement from Medicare and other federal health programs and engaged in illegal financial relationships with doctors. Under the terms of the partial settlement, both Columbia and the government are under pressure to resolve the entire case before the end of this year.
THE debt sale last week represented the company's first trip to the bond market since 1997, when government agents raided the company's offices and hospitals in seven states, seizing documents. Last year, under the old corporate name, HCA tried to sell $250 million of shorter-maturity securities, but withdrew before they could sell, citing market conditions.
Amid the government's investigation, the hospital chain has changed its name and installed a strong new management team to the delight of some portfolio managers. It has also improved its balance sheet by shedding 140 hospitals from a peak of 340 in 1997 and reduced its debt by about $2.4 billion, to just a little less than $7 billion, trimmed costs and bargained for better terms with private insurers who pay patient bills.
In addition to HCA, a large number of other companies issued debt last week, selling over $12 billion in investment grade securities, according to MCM CorporateWatch.

HEADLINE: The Powers Behind the Auctions

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY

 BODY:
WHEN people think of online auctions, they probably envision retirees selling bean bags from their basements and collectors trading baseball cards or limited-edition lunch boxes. After all, the founder of eBay, Pierre M. Omidyar, and its chief executive, Meg Whitman, are considered ingenious precisely because they created the first efficient global marketplace where consumers could sell directly to one another.
But occasional sellers are hardly what have made eBay, with more than $87.9 million in online revenue in the second quarter, one of the most successful Internet businesses to date. Log on to eBay and you can easily find brand-new air-conditioners, boxes of unused printer cartridges and cases of 7-inch zippers, all nylon, all black. Rather than just items destined for garage sales, plenty of new merchandise is available. "This is not just mom and pop cleaning out their attics," said Evie Black Dykema, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. "There is this whole subeconomy of small businesses who use eBay." 
 The real powers behind eBay's success are those small operators -- the liquidators, wholesalers, small retail shops and stay-at-home entrepreneurs -- that offer the bulk of goods for sale on eBay, underpinning its entire business.
Call them power sellers -- eBay does. By putting dozens of new items up for sale every day, these sellers keep buyers coming back to bid and bid again. Of the four million items listed on the site on any given day, the top 20 sellers are responsible for 72,000 listings, and the top 38,000 sellers account for 2.7 million items, according to AuctionWatch.com, an online auction services company. At last count, eBay had 15.8 million registered users, or Internet names for people who use the site to buy or sell or both.
And because power sellers, like all other sellers, pay eBay listing fees and commissions ranging from 1.25 to 5 percent of the value of each item sold, they contribute a huge proportion of the company's revenues.
Some sellers list goods on other auction sites, either as an alternative or supplement to eBay. Yahoo Auctions, the biggest of those rivals, has 2.5 million listings. But as the first company to exploit the online auction model, eBay dominates, holding nearly 90 percent of the online auction market, measured by sales. That sheer volume, said Steven Johnson, director of the e-commerce program at Andersen Consulting, drives more buyers to eBay, which in turn attracts even more high-volume sellers.
Who are these overachievers? A power seller, by eBay's definition, has met at least one of three levels of standards in volume and customer service -- designated as bronze, silver and gold. To earn the bronze label, a seller must have minimum monthly sales of $2,000; for silver, $10,000 a month; for gold, at least $25,000 a month -- more than many small businesses ever achieve, online or off. Would-be power sellers must also have received at least 100 comments from buyers in the feedback forum, where buyers and sellers rate each others' performance, and 98 percent of their ratings must be positive.
EBay says it has 20,000 to 25,000 power sellers, though it will not disclose how many have hit any particular level. But those numbers do not include people who may be meeting the power-seller standards but have not had the time or the inclination to join eBay's program, which offers them perks like full-time customer service support and permission to display an official power-seller logo.
EBay declined to disclose financial details about the sellers who make its business hum. But Andale Inc., an auction management company in Mountain View, Calif. that provides e-mail tools and database services to online sellers, has pored over eBay's listings and determined that 10 percent of eBay's sellers are responsible for 80 percent of its sales. That 10 percent thus sold about $1 billion of the $1.3 billion worth of toys, jewelry, computers, sporting goods, real estate and other merchandise that changed hands on eBay in the last quarter.
And they may be making hefty profits. Again, eBay would not give details of its users' businesses, but a survey conducted by Andale in March found that sellers made a 40 percent profit margin, on average. By contrast, many online retailers are not yet in the black, according to Forrester. According to a report that Forrester released in April, and based in part on interviews with 50 companies, less than 40 percent of the e-tailers expected to make money before 2002.
"Online auctions are a seriously lucrative way to sell," said Munjal Shah, chief executive of Andale. "There are a whole troop of merchants that have grown up around that realization."
For these sellers, there are obvious advantages, mainly that they can attract buyers without spending money on marketing and that commissions are low. By contrast, Amazon.com spent about 25 percent of its sales on marketing last year -- and that proportion is "significantly lower than everyone else's online," according to Mike May, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications.
EBay's role as an inexpensive marketing channel, however, may also make it a breeding ground for fraud. The company does not attempt to police transactions, enabling it to keep its own costs low. But that raises the possibility that sellers may be hawking stolen, counterfeit, damaged or fake merchandise on its site. One dissatisfied buyer is trying to organize a class action suit by customers who believe they were defrauded by big sellers.
And while some buyers, in comments left on feedback forums, rave about individual power sellers, others complain that eBay coddles its power sellers at the expense of buyers.
But as long as eBay thrives, power sellers appear to be here to stay, and their numbers will probably grow. In recent months, a new category of businesses has emerged that is dedicated to helping them. These companies, like Andale, AuctionWorks and AuctionWatch.com, provide billing and shipping services and software to track and respond to hundreds of auction listings simultaneously. "This has become a real business," said Ms. Dykema of Forrester, "and there are now real tools to manage it."
So exactly who are these small businesses that use eBay as a staging ground for e-commerce? Here are four whose revenues meet power-seller standards.
 
The Retailer
A Small Business Triples Its Volume
On a Sunday night a year and a half ago, Nang Nguyen was sitting at his computer, looking at jewelry listings on eBay. He had decided to bid on a diamond ring in a platinum setting; it would be a present for his wife, Kim. The ring was listed by a store he had never heard of -- Sun Jewelry, a tiny shop in a Los Angeles shopping mall, thousands of miles from his home in Hershey, Pa.
When he won the bidding, he and his wife were thrilled. "The price was incredible," remembered Mr. Nguyen (pronounced "win"). He immediately called Los Angeles to talk with the shop's owner, Abit Uygan. They hit it off.
Mr. Uygan said he was a new seller on eBay. Mr. Nguyen responded that he was a rookie buyer. Mr. Uygan described the bad luck he had experienced with other forms of online sales, including several failed attempts to run a Web site. Mr. Nguyen, who was working in his father's shoe store in Hershey, offered to help Mr. Uygan sell other pieces of jewelry on eBay.
Their partnership, Mr. Nguyen said, has thrived. Since last year, the two men have owned Sun Jewelry together. While Mr. Uygan continues to oversee the production of the jewelry, which he and a few employees make by hand in the back room of the Los Angeles shop, Mr. Nguyen runs the administrative side, including the eBay listings, from an office next door to his father's shoe store in Hershey.
Sun's sales have tripled in the last year and a half, Mr. Nguyen said. They sell up to 800 pieces of jewelry a month, about 90 percent online. The two men are now considering taking the company public.
"Without the online auction, I don't think it would be possible to be where we are today, thinking about an I.P.O.," Mr. Nguyen said.
But at the beginning, he was not sure that eBay was the answer. Sun Jewelry already had its own Web site (www.sunjewelry.com) and Mr. Nguyen had decided to try several Internet marketing avenues at once. Those included banner and classified advertising, links with other Web sites and requests for listing on search engines.
"Listing your Web site -- trust me, it doesn't work," he said. Selling items through eBay was the only thing that did. "It has put us in an area where everyone can see us," he added. "Before, we were just a small store, tucked away." Now Mr. Nguyen does not even try to advertise the Sun Jewelry Web site, although it still attracts customers who remember seeing it on eBay.
Mr. Nguyen has also started using eBay as a test bed for pricing. He will list a ring on eBay and watch how many bids it gets, and how many people click through to see the photograph and the closing price. If the ring sells well, he may offer a few more of a similar design on eBay or decide to showcase it on his Web site at a set price.
Of course, the surge in business has brought trials. During the holiday season last year, the company had a three-week backup in orders. And maintaining friendly and accessible customer service has been a challenge. Mr. Nguyen said he calls almost every one of his customers himself. His phone bill, he said, runs from $800 to $1,000 a month.
In the last few months, he has bought services from Andale, the auction-management company that automates his listings, allows for different forms of payment and reminds him to send feedback to each buyer.
Amid all the activity, in fact, he still has not yet visited the Sun Jewelry store in Los Angeles, or even met his partner face to face. "I have no idea what he looks like," Mr. Nguyen said. "But I'm going out to his wedding next year, so I'll finally see him there."
 
The Home Business
Clearing Out Closets And Making Money
Three years ago, Kimberly Crockett was working for a regional investment company, selling mutual funds from her home in Panama City Beach, Fla. Still in her 20's, she had already built a fine life, with a three-bedroom house within walking distance of the beach on the Gulf of Mexico.
But these days, Ms. Crockett does not have much time to get to the beach, and her fund work is on the back burner. Since the spring of 1998, she has built a booming business from her home, selling collectible toys on eBay.
Always enchanted by "The Wizard of Oz," Ms. Crockett had secretly hoped she might be able to make money by collecting television and movie memorabilia. In 1989, she decided on a whim to buy two shopping carts full of Pee Wee Herman toys that were on sale in a store for a few dollars apiece. It was a smart gamble: several pieces now sell for more than $200 each.
But until the Web came along, she never imagined being able to make a good living from her hobby. Today, she sells 1,000 to 2,000 toys a month on eBay, and has just hired her first employee. She declined to divulge details of her profits, but said she was having no trouble making money.
"I always double my money," Ms. Crockett said in a phone interview from her home, barely distracted by her light-brown cat, Panama, which sat beside her crouched on a Three Stooges mouse pad.
Ms. Crockett, who goes by the name SillyOzibul on eBay, started collecting toys with a fervor about three years ago, after helping a "Star Wars" fan find a rare Princess Leia figurine. After a few months of scouring toy shows, garage sales and collectors' conventions, she realized that she had developed a sizable collection without any plan for what to do with it.
"One day I opened one of the bedroom doors, and there were just bags and bags of stuff," she said. "I couldn't even walk in. And I said: 'What are you doing, Kim? You just can't horde this stuff.' "
Ms. Crockett decided to try eBay. The first item, one of those Pee Wee Herman dolls, sold for $18, and within a few months she had built a company called Oz Wars Toys, a title that blends "Wizard of Oz" and "Star Wars." Two of the three bedrooms in her house are now storage areas, and the living room is a packaging site, strewn with boxes and bubble wrap. The kitchen is the only area that is devoid of collectibles -- except for the Oz plates that hang above the cabinets.
Her house is so full of toys, Ms. Crockett said, that she is looking to rent about 1,000 square feet of space nearby where she can operate the online business and sell a few items to local residents who stop by.
As the business grows, it is becoming more professional. She has bought services from AuctionWorks to help manage the business; the move saved her the 30 hours a week she had spent writing e-mail messages to customers and filling out feedback forms rating her buyers.
But regardless of how much her business grows, Ms. Crockett said, she is not ready to part with all of her collectibles, especially those related to Dorothy and the Yellow Brick Road. "I've just sold a bunch of 'Wizard of Oz' flags for $50 apiece," she said. "They are really nice ruby-slippers flags, with slippers that sparkle and a sign that says, 'No Place Like Home.' "
"Several bidders fought over them on eBay," she said, "but I've got to keep one for me."
 
The Liquidator
A Hot Market For Unsold Clothes
Andrew J. Waites, a tall, tan, well-dressed man with a thick Southern accent, jumped into e-commerce last year. But he has no intention of moving his liquidating business to Silicon Valley from West Front Street in Hattiesburg, Miss.
For starters, he would not fit in, he declared in a recent interview. "In south Mississippi," he said with a playful smile, "we're not smart enough to figure out how to make money by selling merchandise and losing money on each item."
Instead, he has turned to eBay, which he will use as the infrastructure for a new site, eValueville.com. His company, Inventory Procurement Services, specializes in selling the shirts, coats, jeans and dresses that retail shops want to get rid of, usually because they want to make room for new styles and more seasonable clothing.
Previously, he distributed those goods to small retail shops that have closeouts. Then, last summer, he received a box of Kenneth Cole leather coats of different shapes and sizes. "We said, 'How are we going to sell these in the summer in Hattiesburg, Mississippi?' " he recalled. "We put them on eBay, and we were amazed at the final sales price." As a result, something that would have been almost impossible to sell at $69 in his hometown became a hot $200 item.
But one real advantage of the online auction sites, he said, is the ability to reduce expenses, especially for marketing. Sometimes, he said, he does not bother paying eBay's $2 fee for putting a listing in bold type, yet he has sold 100 percent of the clothing that he has tried to sell and has made a profit on each item.
Mr. Waites also uses eBay as a hook. He sometimes starts items at $1 each, regardless of what they must sell for to recover costs, to draw just-lookers -- in hopes that they will go to the Evalueville site. By mid-September, he added, he will be listing 5,000 items a week on eBay.
He has also been visiting department stores and manufacturers, trying to sell them on his new business plan. He is betting that he will be able to get them better prices than they might through conventional liquidation channels. "I think we can improve their recovery by 2 to 3 percentage points," he said. "We think eBay will be for us the biggest outlet mall in the world."
 
The Wholesaler
Giving the Consumer Economies of Scale
For more than 20 years, Larry Bence has been supplying retail stores with collectible cards and coins. And he has been using computers for 15 years -- he was part of a proprietary network of dealers who were sending messages back and forth in the very early days of the Internet. So in the mid-1990's, when everyone started talking about expanding commerce on the Web, he was all for it.
But after setting up a Web site, he found that the effort was not worth it. He and his staff, including his daughter, Julie, would spend hours listing the prices of sports cards, posters, toy cars, and dinnerware with football logos. Then something in the news would bump the prices up or down, and the site would have to be updated.
"It's just impossible to maintain that many different pricing ranges," said Mr. Bence, whose company is called Abon Cards and Coins Ltd. After trying six times with different Web site designs, he gave up.
"The only people that I've seen who make money on Web sites," he said, "are the people who design them." Mr. Bence still has a Web site, but it is just a few pages.
As a wholesaler with more than 100,000 square feet of warehouse space in Ohio, Mr. Bence did not have to worry about finding a place for inventory to feed his online business. And he could have settled for a continuation of his conventional business, selling pallets of cards and memorabilia to retailers. But he wanted to tap into the consumer market, too, without doing any advertising.
That is why he turned to eBay, he said. He now assigns about a dozen of his 22 staff members to manage his eBay listings of cards, coins and related items. His eBay business is now large enough that he has chosen to become an eBay gold power seller. He has developed software to help his company manage all of the accounts; one of his homemade software packages runs checks on credit card numbers and addresses to make sure that a buyer is not using a stolen card. "It's hairy," he said. "We are gritting our teeth. That's the one area that is very vulnerable."
The venture has turned his business into a blend of wholesale and retail, a mix that he said is becoming increasingly common on the Internet. Ultimately, he is able to sell small quantities of goods to consumers at wholesale prices, while still selling pallets of merchandise to retailers.
Mr. Bence said his presence on eBay had also built his contact base, enabling him find more items to sell: "There are people who see us on eBay who contact us and say, 'I wonder if he'll want to buy stuff.' " he added. "I just bought a bunch of collegiate dinnerware -- Michigan State dinnerware. In Ohio, not many people may want Michigan State dinnerware. But on the Internet, there are probably plenty of Michigan State fans who will have no problem paying up."

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Wave;
The Conventions Are Over. The Party's Just Starting.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR all the talk about the great race to the center this year, nobody who watched the two conventions, skimmed the parties' platforms or scrutinized the candidates' stands would mistake the Democrat for the Republican.
Yes, much of the time a certain rhetorical sameness wafted from the main stages of the convention halls, and there was little of the partisan bite of yesteryear. But political passions kept bubbling up, just offstage. And even among the voters at large, at a time of peace and prosperity, with few great burning issues pushing people in one direction or another, two-thirds of Americans still consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. 
 Party, in other words, still matters.
Party attachment is still considered one of the best predictors of how people will vote -- if they vote. But appealing to those loyalties, while still wooing the Independents who decide elections, is a complicated challenge these days. Particularly for Vice President Al Gore, many analysts say.
The New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the Democrats have a slight edge when it comes to party affiliation: Asked in four national polls this year how they identify themselves, an average of 35 percent of Americans said they were Democrats, 30 percent Republicans, 28 percent Independents and 7 percent (probably the least likely to vote) said they had no opinions.
In a Times/CBS poll conducted last month, the Democratic Party was still considered the party that would do a better job on health care, education and "making the right decisions" on Social Security -- all issues high on the voters' agenda.
The Republican Party was given the edge on upholding traditional family values, making sure the military stays strong and ensuring a healthy economy. Each party, in other words, brings its nominee certain strengths this fall.
But until last week, Democratic voters have not embraced Mr. Gore's candidacy with the enthusiasm Republicans have brought to Gov. George W. Bush; the last pre-convention Times/CBS poll showed Mr. Gore drawing 75 percent of the Democrats, while Mr. Bush got 86 percent of the Republicans. "I think they wasted half their convention just trying to get strong Democrats and soft Democrats home," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. (Post-convention polls will tell how successful they were.)
There are obvious reasons why Mr. Gore has had to work harder for voters who should be rightfully his: The Democratic Party has held the presidency for eight years. The strains are showing between liberals and "New Democrats" who want to keep the party in the center. And the Gore candidacy has had its fits and starts.
This was the landscape for Mr. Gore's acceptance speech Thursday night: He needed to energize his base, but he was also keenly aware of the swing voters turned off by partisan appeals. On one level, his speech was profoundly Democratic. He offered himself as a populist crusader willing to fight "powerful forces" -- like big H.M.O.'s and profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies -- on behalf of "working families."
But in sharp contrast to convention speeches of yesteryear, Mr. Gore's never mentioned the words Democrat or Republican, noted Martin Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of California-Irvine.
"It's populist, but it's a broad populism," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Gore's pollster. "It's saying, let's make sure the whole society is able to do well."
To galvanize his party, and to pull back many of the Independents who lean their way, Mr. Gore needs to draw sharp contrasts with the Republicans, many Democratic strategists agree, particularly on basic issues like tax cuts and health care.
But Republicans have not made it easy.
Frustrated Democrats say Mr. Bush is preaching a message -- that he is a different kind of Republican, more sensitive and moderate -- that is distinctly at odds with his basic conservatism.
"Part of the task that Gore and the Democrats face in the fall is to tell voters that George W. Bush really is an old-style Republican," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. In other words, to block Mr. Bush's move to the center, now that he has consolidated his own party.
Many Democrats are eager to make that case and highlight the stakes: What kind of Supreme Court justices would a Bush administration, operating with a Republican Senate, appoint?
Who would most profit from his tax cuts?
What would his budget proposals mean for Medicare?
How does Mr. Bush's health care record in Texas, which ranks high among states in the percentage of uninsured, gibe with his promise to provide health coverage nationwide?
But the Gore campaign is in something of a strategic box, one Republican strategist argued, speaking on condition that he not be identified. While the Democrats need to highlight the differences between the parties, overt partisanship gives the Bush campaign the higher moral ground.
Day after day, the Bush campaign chastised the Democrats for any hint of partisan attacks at their convention. In fact, party strategists say, Mr. Bush is convinced that the voters are weary of such fights.
"Bush has seriously studied what has happened since Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994," said Linda DiVall, a Republican poll taker. "Frankly, Republicans don't do well when we get into a fight with Clinton or a fight among ourselves."
Mr. Bush, of course, has the luxury of denouncing partisanship and muting the differences. Eight years in the wilderness, and a profound disdain for the Clinton administration, go a long way toward keeping Republican voters unified and motivated.
Moreover, Mr. Bush has ably capitalized on his party's traditional strengths -- most notably, in the aftermath of the Clinton scandals, the notion that Republicans have stronger moral values. And he has dealt with his party's vulnerabilities, presenting a multi-ethnic, family-friendly convention program.
WITH all his "rhetorical convergence," as the political scientist Thomas Mann puts it, some voters might well ask just whether there's much difference between the parties -- an argument at the heart of Ralph Nader's third-party campaign.
But, of course, in their attitudes toward government, their approach to social issues like abortion and gay rights, their economic philosophy and their approach to restructuring Medicare and Social Security, the differences are large and enduring.
And each party's reliable supporters are quite distinctive, too.
Party affiliation is still, quite often, passed down from parent to child, some political scientists say.
Economic status is still strongly linked with party attachment, although Republicans have attracted more lower-income members through the party's embrace of social conservatives, while Democrats have drawn more white-collar voters.
Larry Bartels, a professor of politics at Princeton University, maintains that party loyalty was a greater factor in presidential voting in the 1990's than at any time since the 1950's.
And Mr. McInturff notes that, if anything, partisan voters have become even more so thanks to the polarizing figures of President Clinton and former Speaker Newt Gingrich -- but for the same reason people in the middle may have become even more turned off by partisanship.
All of which suggests the complicated politics that awaits the voters this fall: a fierce, nonpartisan partisan struggle. For Mr. Gore, the campaign will be about "fighting for working families," and for Mr. Bush, "compassionate conservatism." In other words, the parties are dead, long live the parties.

Why Foresters Prefer to Fight Fire With Fire

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
NINETY years ago today, in the choking heat of a summer without rain in the northern Rockies, the sun disappeared from the sky and a sound not unlike cannon fire began rattling throughout Montana and Idaho. The Big Burn, as the three-million-acre firestorm of 1910 was called, eventually consumed entire towns, killed 87 people and burned a lesson into the fledgling United States Forest Service.
Thereafter, the service vowed, it would snuff out every fire, at one point swearing to do so by 10 a.m. on the day after the fire started. The best-known forester of that time, Gifford Pinchot, equated wildfire with slavery as a historic scourge of the nation. Another, Bernhard Fernow, blamed "bad habits and loose morals" for the fires. 
 Now, in the midst of the worst wildfire year in nearly half a century, a new round of finger-pointing is under way. Touring Montana last week, J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, blamed the Clinton administration for not logging the tinder-dry forests. Environmentalists pointed at the timber industry and development for altering forest ecology and creating an artificial landscape ripe for catastrophe.
But the Forest Service remains focused on its own primary culprit: the symbol of fire eradication, Smokey Bear.
The era of prevention and suppression represented by Smokey and his shovel may have been good for safety, but it was not the best thing for forests. The agency had reached that conclusion even before the additional evidence foresters drew from the fires that tore through almost half of Yellowstone National Park in 1988.
Fire is as much a part of nature as creeks and wildflowers. Most forests have a natural cycle, in which a purging burn comes through every 10, 20, 50 or 100 years. The cycle may be suppressed, foresters say, but only at the cost of more powerful fires when it re-emerges.
"We have a problem when people say these fires are destroying all these areas," said Mr. Wiebe, the former Smokejumper. "It's just not correct to say a forest is destroyed by fire."
During the decades when fires were routinely suppressed, forests choked themselves with excess growth, creating better habitats for tree-killing insects. The dying trees became tinder.
"These forests are long overdue," said Mick Harrington, a research fire ecologist with the Forest Service in Montana, a state that has just been declared a disaster area. "They were just ready to go."
The fires that have already run through five million acres this year are hotter, faster-burning, more ferocious than any burns of modern times, the people battling them say. And a number of reports say future fire seasons may be worse, identifying about 40 million acres of public land as being at risk of catastrophic fire.
Fire suppression is only part of the problem. In some forests, experts say, logging has removed the biggest and most fire-resistant trees. Their replacements -- some planted, some natural -- are crowded stands of young and disease-prone trees, with 500 or more to the acre, where there used to be 50. Foresters also point to other elements -- excessive grazing by cattle and sheep, diversion of rivers to newly developing areas -- that have contributed to what some call ghost forests, spectral stands of diseased and dying timber now baking, if not yet burning, in the August sun.
In addition, there are many new areas demanding fire protection. Homes and vacation cottages that have sprung up at the edge of national forest boundaries have become firefighters' front lines.
"We've become so good at putting out fires because that's what the public wants," said Lindon Wiebe, a fire ecology specialist with the Forest Service in Washington, and a former Smokejumper, as the service's firefighters are called. "But what we can do is pretty small compared to what Mother Nature wants to do."
Just as people have gradually learned not to build homes in areas prone to flooding, they need to understand the danger of erecting structures in fire zones, says Dr. Phil Omi, a professor of forest fire science at Colorado State University and director of the Western Forest Fire Research Center.
"Somebody has got to get the message to these people that they are putting themselves at risk, whether it's the insurance industry or the government," Dr. Omi said. But he said he could not blame the Forest Service, or homeowners, for being slow to understand the nature of wild fire in the West. "Our understanding of forest fire ecology is relatively new," he said.
Those trying to address the future fire threat are focusing on two solutions: taking out more trees by logging or thinning, and deliberately setting fires.
Under Mr. Clinton, logging in national forests has declined by nearly 75 percent, and some critics blame this decline for the explosive fires. A number of Western senators back the idea of allowing the timber industry to remove more trees.
However, environmental groups point out that the biggest fires in Montana and Idaho are burning not in wilderness areas, but in land that has been developed or logged. Such areas also account for 90 percent of the acreage identified as most vulnerable to wildfire, the Forest Service says.
"Commercial logging is not a prescription for forest health -- it is one of the major causes of unhealthy forest conditions," said Thomas Powers, chairman of the economics department at the University of Montana, whose specialty is natural resource issues.
The other solution -- planned fire -- has become a public relations debacle. Last year, a record 1.4 million acres of Forest Service land was deliberately burned. Most prescribed burns go off without trouble. But it only takes one to stir public ire. And this year, the one that got away, a 43,000-acre blaze set by the National Park Service near Los Alamos, N.M., destroyed more than 200 homes.
And no matter how convinced the experts are that Los Alamos was an exception, the fires now raging in every state of the West look horrific on television, blackening national treasures like Mesa Verde National Park and raining embers on popular campgrounds.

Chart: "A Century Of Fanning Flames"
Contrary to the wisdom that dominated the past hundred years, wildfires are native to the ecological rhythm of the forest, purging the underbrush of debris, enriching the soil, and contributing to the stability of robust, old-growth trees. But decades of development and a steady practice of stifling flames at all costs have changed the character of forest fires for the worse. A look at some of the biggest missteps:
 
HAZARDOUS HOMES
Building a home in or near the edge of forest land brings the risk of fire, but many homeowners and builders fail to take simple precautions that could reduce damage.
 
LOGGING AND CLEAR-CUTTING
In many areas, logging removed the oldest, most fire-resistant trees. The smaller, denser tree stands that grew in their absence burn more easily. Logging can also leave behind debris that acts as kindling for wildfires.
 
WATER DIVERSION
Diverting the natural waterways to serve growing communities can also change the ecology of surrounding forests, leaving them dry and undernourished. Also, rivers that once served as natural barriers to fast-moving wildfires have been narrowed, enabling flames to leap to neighboring groups of trees easily.
 
GRAZING
The growth of cattle raising throughout the 19th and 20th centuries reduced grasslands, which fuel natural forest fires and keep the flames low to the ground.
 
FIRE SUPPRESSION
Development in general led to a consistent policy of stifling fires, but this inhibited the natural process of burning and allowed stands of fire-prone trees to grow.
 
ROOFING
Metal, tile and fiberglass are best; common materials like asphalt shingles and tar paper are more flammable.
 
OUTER WALLS
Although it seems natural to build a forest home of wood, the danger is obvious. Stone, brick and metal are best.
 
AIR POCKETS
An open foundation and raised decks can stoke flames as they pass through. Storing fuel tanks in these areas is particularly dangerous.
 
BUILDING ON SLOPES
Although a hillside may offer the best views, slopes create a natural chimney for advancing flames.
 
Thicker Is Not Better
Under normal old-growth conditions, cyclical ground fires burn low through the underbrush and leave the tree stand intact.
 
When natural fires are prevented, new trees and forest debris proliferate, providing more fuel for fires when they start.
 
In the worst cases, natural burning has been prevented for decades, creating enough fuel to drive flames into the forest canopy.
 
Current Danger Zones

HEADLINE: The Populist Al Gore

BYLINE: By John B. Judis; John B. Judis is senior editor of The New Republic and author of "The Paradox of American Democracy."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Does a populist appeal have resonance in prosperous times? In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Al Gore defined the difference between Republicans and Democrats in strict populist terms. "They're for the powerful, we're for the people," he declared.
This appeal, if updated, can be effective, even when people are doing well economically. One commentator compared Mr. Gore to William Jennings Bryan, the firebrand of 1896, but the proper comparison is with Franklin Roosevelt. Bryan's populism was the politics of an embattled minority, the last cry of Western small farmers. 
 In the 1930's, Roosevelt revived populism as a majority politics of the new urban working class. By identifying Democrats with the common man and Republicans with the "economic royalists," Roosevelt and his successors controlled Congress for 44 of the next 48 years and won eight of 12 presidential elections.
The constituency for Roosevelt's populism has not disappeared, but it became bitterly divided after 1964, largely as a result of civil rights struggles and the birth of the new left.
Under Ronald Reagan, Republicans were able to create a new conservative majority by combining their well-to-do base with disenchanted white Democrats in the South and Midwest who blamed Democrats for their falling incomes and for rising crime rates.
Bill Clinton's political achievement has been to revive the perception that Democrats represent the people while the Republicans represent special interests and the wealthy. Mr. Clinton did this by forcing Democrats to abandon the post-1960's attitude on crime and welfare that had turned off these swing voters in the first place.
Al Gore now has an opportunity to build on what Mr. Clinton has achieved -- to restore in full the older populist majority, but not on exactly the same terms as Roosevelt did.
America's "common man" has changed: he -- and she -- are more likely white-collar than blue-collar and more likely to live in suburbs than cities. And this populist majority, for the most part, doesn't want government expansion. These voters want to preserve existing social programs like Social Security and Medicare, and they want new, but modest, programs to help their families thrive in the new economy. But they are skeptical of large-scale programs that could lead to higher taxes.
What they fear is that government will become more responsive to the powerful rather than to them -- a fear evidenced in the popularity of maverick politicians like Ross Perot and John McCain and in the continuing support for campaign finance reform. Mr. Gore seems to understand this. His acceptance speech was long on defending his own modest initiatives against the threat of "big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the H.M.O.'s."
His populism could also help where he needs it most, in energizing the Democratic base and attracting swing voters in battleground states of the Midwest.
As Ruy Teixeira and Joel Rogers demonstrate in their book, "America's Forgotten Majority," these swing voters don't live in Cleveland's upscale Shaker Heights, but in neighboring Lorain County. They are middle-income whites, most of whom have not graduated from college. Once Democrats, they backed Mr. Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but gravitated to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot in 1992 and 1996. They have proved responsive to a populism directed at special interests.
For instance, in the Lorain County district now represented by the Democrat Sherrod Brown, Mr. Reagan won by 19 percent in 1984. But in 1992, Mr. Clinton won 38 percent of the vote; Mr. Bush, 35 percent; and Mr. Perot, 27 percent. In 1996, Mr. Clinton won 46 percent; Bob Dole, 39 percent; and Mr. Perot, 14 percent.
It was because of the shift away from the G.O.P. among these voters that Mr. Clinton took Ohio and Michigan, as well as Missouri and Pennsylvania, in the last two elections.
Mr. Gore begins at a certain disadvantage with these voters, who may be put off by his sometimes aloof manner. But a populist approach could help him overcome his lack of personal appeal. He might not convince these voters that he is a more relaxed guy than his opponent, but if he can convince them that he is on their side and that Mr. Bush is not, he may well be the next president.

Dot-Com Wariness Found in Survey

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The new what? Most Americans have heard of the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq index, but surprisingly few have heard or read about the new economy, according to a recent survey by Scudder Kemper Investments.
Among people who said they knew what the phrase "new economy" meant, only 28 percent cited the "high-tech economy" or "high-tech stocks." A majority (61 percent) said that they found talk of dot-com companies to be confusing. The crankiest ones (38 percent) reported being fed up with hearing about technology and Internet companies. 
 "The dot-com revolution has inevitably led to more content and commentary about investing, and at increasing levels of detail and sophistication," said Joan Cannon Wood, senior vice president for Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston. "But the majority of Americans said that there's too much hype coming at them about the new economy, and many people are confused."
Indeed, the survey results show conflicting attitudes. While respondents expressed an overall cautious optimism about the economy as a whole and confidence in the long-term prospects of Internet companies and the "dot-com revolution," they were generally reluctant to invest in those companies.
Even so, the dot-com hype has created sky-high expectations among the respondents as to what returns can reasonably be expected on investments. The average return considered reasonable today is 21.7 percent. That is slightly more than the 20 percent return of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last seven years, but nearly double the annual average return on equities of 12.1 percent from 1926 to 1990, according to Ibbotson Associates in Chicago.
The survey, conducted from April 18 through May 1, was based on 1,300 telephone interviews of randomly selected people over the age of 18. Carole Gould

HEADLINE: U.N. Reform Group Assesses U.S. Candidates

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore would give more unqualified support to the United Nations and be more willing to sign international treaties than his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, an independent United Nations watchdog organization said this week.
But Mr. Gore is still hedging his support for some important international initiatives, as President Clinton did when he met stiff resistance from Republicans in Congress. 
 The group, the Campaign for United Nations Reform, which is based in Washington, sent both major candidates in this year's race a comprehensive questionnaire on topics involving United States participation in international affairs. Congressional candidates were also polled.
Mr. Bush replied in a brief letter to Don Kraus, executive director of the Campaign for United Nations Reform, saying that while he believed that international organizations can serve the cause of peace, he would never place American troops under United Nations command. He would pay United States debts to the organization, he said, only when its bureaucracy has been reformed and American dues lowered. He also said that he wanted reforms at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, but he did not elaborate.
Mr. Gore responded to more than a dozen questions, often at some length. He said that it was time the United States paid its dues to the United Nations "in full, on time and without conditions." He added that there had already been substantial reforms in the United Nations system. He said that agencies of the United Nations "offer the U.S. an effective means of doing our fair share to alleviate suffering in some of the most miserable corners of the globe."
On outstanding treaties not signed by the United States, Mr. Gore gave unequivocal support to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Law of the Sea Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to stop the testing of nuclear arms.
But Mr. Gore continued to call for changes in an international agreement banning land mines, reflecting longstanding objections from the Pentagon. And he declined to endorse the International Criminal Court, now taking shape without American support. His said in his reply that the court's treaty still had "significant flaws."
The Campaign for United Nations Reform is a 25-year-old organization that advocates stronger American support for the United Nations.
Among Congressional responses to the organization's questionnaire, attitudes to the United Nations ranged very widely, said Jennifer Taylor, program director for the campaign. Some members of Congress were very supportive of the United Nations adherence to international treaties. But others, a small minority, responded by advocating that the United States quit the organization, which they said did not serve American interests.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Finds Source of Wealth Is Also a Curse

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
Like motorists everywhere, Venezuelans love to complain about the price of gasoline, and they have been doing a lot of that lately. But one thing sets them apart from almost everyone else in the world: at less than 40 cents a gallon, gas is cheaper than bottled water here.
To Americans who are now paying nearly $2 a gallon for gas, such carping may seem absurd. But the constant griping about gasoline prices among Venezuelans is emblematic of their complicated and conflicted relationship with a commodity that so dominates their national life that it accounts for half of all government revenues and four-fifths of this country's exports. 
 This nation of 23 million people has the greatest petroleum reserves outside the Middle East. Venezuela has also been the largest oil supplier to the United States in recent years and, with prices now at their highest level in a decade, it is looking forward to record oil revenues of $21 billion this year. Yet oil has come to be regarded here not as a blessing but as a curse.
When petroleum first emerged as the core of the economy back in the 1930's, governments were urged to follow a policy of "sowing the oil," in the famous phrase of the writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, to encourage investment instead of mindless consumption. But the reality turned out to be different, and a saying often heard here in recent years cynically summarizes Venezuelan history this way: "Columbus discovered us, Bolivar liberated us, and oil ruined us."
"This is a sick society, and it is sick as a result of an illness called oil," said Anibal Romero, a professor of political science at Simon Bolivar University here. "Oil is easy to produce, it can be done by others with imported equipment, and it always sells. As a result, it has asphyxiated the rest of the economy and led the majority of Venezuelans to believe that if they are not rich, it is because someone has stolen what belongs to them."
Indeed, in poll after poll conducted over the past decade, Alfredo Keller and Associates, a leading public opinion research firm here, has found that 80 percent of Venezuelans believe that theirs is "one of the richest countries in the world" because of its oil reserves.
Roughly the same percentage believe that the main function of government is "to share this wealth among all" but also complain that they themselves "have not benefited from these riches."
But rather than point their fingers at an economic model that favors oil over all other activities, thus engendering a bonanza mentality and discouraging individual initiative, Venezuelans prefer to blame their leaders. Up to 80 percent believe, Mr. Keller said, that the responsibility for their own poverty "lies with government and politicians," and that it is "because of corruption" that the state has failed to serve them.
"People here have never thought of this country's problem as economic," said Carlos Sabino, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela who has written extensively about oil's impact on Venezuelan society. "They have always considered it a moral and political problem."
It was exactly that sense of resentment and moral outrage that President Hugo Chavez rode to power in the December 1998 presidential election, in which he won 58 percent of the vote. But with the price of Venezuelan crude having quadrupled in the 18 months since he was sworn in, he too is facing pressure to deliver the "golden age" of prosperity and social justice that Venezuelans expect and that he promised as a candidate.
Mr. Chavez, 46, a former army colonel who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup, has stoked such expectations by claiming to have almost singlehandedly engineered the worldwide rise in oil prices. During his successful campaign for re-election last month to a new six year term, he reminded voters that it was his decision to cut back production that has given a new vigor to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
As a result, the current boom in oil prices may have reawakened memories of the 1970's and expectations that a new round of spending and subsidies will follow. The 1970's, after all, were an era in which oil revenues were so plentiful and Venezuelans so affluent that other Latin Americans referred to them as "los damedos," or "the gimme twos," a reference to their lavish spending habits.
"To get out of the mess we put ourselves in then, we are going to have to make sacrifices," said Luis Cortillo, 69, a retired airline crew supervisor. "But we don't want to accept that solution; we want to go on living just like in the days when the money flowed like water."
That sense of entitlement is so deeply ingrained that past governments here have attempted to raise gasoline prices at their peril. In February 1989, President Carlos Andres Perez did just that, and the immediate result was riots, looting and hundreds of people killed -- events followed three years later by Mr. Perez's fall from power and Mr. Chavez's own coup attempt.
"The country is rich, but its people are not," said Lido Araque, a 48-year-old gas station attendant who earns about $200 a month, when asked why Venezuelans should continue to enjoy low energy costs.
"So I would say the price of gasoline has to be kept at this level for at least three more years, because when gas prices go up, food and transportation costs rise too."
Mr. Chavez calls his movement to reform the Venezuelan state a "revolution," and he clearly has the support of the overwhelming majority of the population.
But his government appears just as intimidated as its predecessors by the specter of popular resistance to any effort to bring local gasoline prices in line with international rates and thereby discourage excessive consumption.
"In determining the prices of energy, it is not just economic factors that must be taken into account," Ali Rodriguez, minister of energy and mines, said in a recent interview. "We have a critical social situation."
Eventually, "there will be an adjustment made in the price of gasoline," Mr. Rodriguez, who is also the president of OPEC, added. "But it has to be done at the proper time, when there is an economic recovery and employment is picking up."
At the moment, however, Mr. Chavez faces a situation that has no precedent in Venezuelan history. Even with the price of a barrel of locally produced crude rising so dramatically, the Venezuelan economy shrank by 7.2 percent last year, and more than half the work force is either unemployed or working off the books in what is euphemistically called "the informal economy."
To placate his supporters, Mr. Chavez has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a military-run civic assistance program called Plan Bolivar 2000, providing subsidized food and free medical care. He has also proposed populist initiatives like the subsidized manufacture of a relatively cheap "People's Car" that would obviously encourage even greater gasoline consumption.
But he has conspicuously hesitated to take steps that might hit ordinary Venezuelans in their pocketbooks. Even the idea of trying to prepare for the day when oil prices start to decline again by raising taxes is controversial, and not just because the economy is mired in a recession.
"Historically, the problem of the state here has not been how to obtain resources through taxes to cover public spending, but how to distribute this growing income," Mr. Rodriguez said. "For that reason, because money was so abundant, we were not charged taxes, and that had a cultural impact on Venezuelan society, in the sense that no one here developed the habit of paying taxes or a sense that not to pay taxes is a crime."
In a speech in early August, just before he embarked on a tour of OPEC nations aimed at keeping oil prices at their current high levels, Mr. Chavez announced ambitious plans to develop tourism, agriculture, mining and fishing.
But the reality, with the rest of the economy hobbled by a recession, is that Venezuela is probably more reliant on oil than ever, and thus more susceptible to the impact of a downturn when it eventually comes.
"Governments here are always like a gambler at a casino," Dr. Sabino said. "They have their run of luck, and they come to believe that everything can be resolved with an increase in the price of oil. Nothing that Chavez is doing tells me that he is any different from the others, and that is the problem."

HEADLINE: Philippine Leader, Facing Bad Reviews, Is Ready for a Change in His Image

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: MANILA, Aug. 17

 BODY:
"If they want war, we will give them defeat," declared President Joseph Estrada not long ago in the latest version of his tough-guy political credo: "Don't dare me."
He was speaking this time about Muslim rebels and, like his earlier turns at belligerence, this one worked. His poll numbers went up this week. 
 The public is desperate for its president to pull himself together and start getting things done. A former movie actor with a lackadaisical approach to government, Mr. Estrada has increasingly become the subject of jokes, gossip and that old Philippine staple, coup rumors.
Halfway into his six-year term, the economy is faltering, corruption and cronyism seem to be ascendant and Muslim separatists and kidnappers are getting out of hand in the southern Philippines.
Now, with his options narrowed, Mr. Estrada has unleashed his army in a cathartic take-no-prisoners campaign against the rebels on the island of Mindanao. He is also determined to resolve a kidnapping of Western vacationers that has continued for almost four months on the tiny neighboring island of Jolo.
Apparently as a result of the effort to end the hostage situation, those polled gave the president a positive rating of over 50 percent for the first time in months.
But political commentators seemed unimpressed. Representative Raul Gonzales recalled the boost former President George Bush enjoyed after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 -- only to be undercut by his perceived failure to manage the economy.
Even that comparison is on the rosy side, said Amando Doronila, a columnist for The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Mr. Bush had just won a war; Mr. Estrada does not even have a workable strategy for victory.
Fighting has flared in the three-decade-old insurgency following his failure to build on the peacemaking and economic development policies of his predecessor, Fidel V. Ramos. Analysts here say there cannot be a lasting peace unless those policies are creatively pursued.
A recent spate of bombings in Manila that many people attribute to the Muslim rebels heightened popular fears about the president's inaction. At least now, people say, Mr. Estrada is doing something. Last month, soldiers captured the headquarters in Mindanao of the main insurgent group, the Moro National Liberation Front, and Mr. Estrada traveled there to hoist the Philippine flag.
"He's enjoying a sort of windfall from Mindanao, but that windfall is like opium," Mr. Doronila said. "The opium deadens people's awareness to the really serious problems that are hurting them. They have temporarily forgotten the corruption and the economic issues."
The country's growth rate of less than 4 percent is well below projections, slower than the growth in most other nations in the region and far too low to absorb soaring birthrates. One-third of the population of 76 million remains below the poverty line and unemployment has risen to more than 13 percent.
What is particularly damaging among investors is the atmosphere of old-style cronyism that surrounds Mr. Estrada's government, with favored friends receiving both political appointments and protection in questionable business deals. The World Bank recently estimated that corruption was costing the Philippines $46 million a year.
Eschewing the hard work of making policy and legislation -- as a senator, he once said his favorite moment was when the speaker shouted, "Recess!" -- Mr. Estrada has fallen back on presidential decrees, issuing hundreds of them in his first two years.
"His presidency is very erratic, not driven by any coherent vision or planning," Mr. Doronila said. "It's very much an ad hoc presidency. But he has a sure touch for what is popular."
Mr. Estrada, a former B-movie actor who cultivates an image as a man of the people, is entranced by the example of Ronald Reagan, but the parallels go only so far. Unlike his American hero, he has little philosophy of government and is not leading the nation in any clear direction.
And unlike Mr. Reagan, he is not a natural in the role of president.
"One has the feeling that in reacting to a situation his first words are, 'How do I play this scene?' -- not whatever issues are there," said the Rev. John Carroll, an American sociologist who teaches here.
But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Estrada enjoys seeing the world in movie images. The persona he projects as president -- along with the public perception of him -- is based on his movie roles as a pugnacious little guy who faces down the slick and the powerful.
Because of this image, his base of support is among the nation's poor. With most of the political and economic elite against him, he swept to office in May 1998 with a huge plurality of 40 percent in the field of nine.
Now even the poor have begun to turn against him. Drivers of the gaudy converted Jeeps known as Jeepneys and used as public minibuses have said they no longer want him to use the Jeepney as his symbol.
So he has promised a new President Estrada.
"A nation's life is like a motion picture," he said last year. "With proper direction, the next scenes will change."
The new scenes he has written look like this: he will get to work at 8 a.m. -- rather than in the afternoon -- and he will stay on the job all day long. He will set aside his beloved Johnnie Walker whiskey and drink red wine instead.
And, he promised, he will curtail his "midnight cabinet," all-night karaoke-bar-style sessions with his cronies that one aide said sometimes produced presidential decrees that had to be quickly countermanded in the light of day.
"At 4 in the morning, I am the only sober one in the room," said the aide, Aprodocio Laquian, last March. He was promptly forced to resign.

Hostage Release Breaks Down
JOLO, Philippines, Aug. 19, (AP) -- Negotiators returned empty-handed today from an attempt to win the freedom of 25 hostages held by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippine jungle.
"We have to come back another day and renegotiate," said Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador who is part of the negotiating team that traveled to the camp of the Abu Sayyaf rebels.
Shaking his head and visibly tired and disappointed, Mr. Azzarouq said he would return when the rebels were ready to talk, but gave no time frame.
Two vans that were to carry the hostages, some of whom have been held for almost four months, returned empty from the rebels' area on remote Jolo island, and military escorts and armored personnel carriers were withdrawn.
The breakdown occurred when the guerrillas insisted on freeing the hostages in two batches for security reasons. President Estrada had ordered negotiators to win the release of all the hostages in a single group. His order raised suspicion among the guerrillas that they would face a military attack soon after the release.
The government's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, denied any such threat. He read a statement from the rebels saying that they had decided to free only two Europeans today. The negotiators refused the offer.
Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two major Muslim rebel groups that have been fighting to create an independent Islamic nation in the southern Philippines. The rebels abducted 21 people from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and later seized three French journalists and a dozen Filipino Christian evangelists who had visited the rebel camp to pray for the hostages.
They have so far released nine Malaysians, a Filipino and a German woman, but continue to hold 25 hostages in primitive jungle huts.

HEADLINE: Pat Hearn, Art Dealer In New York, Dies at 45

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Pat Hearn, one of the leading art dealers of the last two decades, a founder of the Gramercy International Art Fair and a pioneer of the art scene in the East Village, SoHo and Chelsea, died on Friday at her vacation home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Colin de Land. 
 In her 17 years as a dealer, Ms. Hearn was widely respected as unusually empathetic to artists, open to new art and willing to share artists and ideas with other dealers. When her cancer was first diagnosed and it seemed that her insurance company would not cover her treatment (although it eventually paid for some of it), her friends organized a benefit to which hundreds of artists and dealers donated work and money.
Her gallery was in some ways a continually evolving artwork in which everything, from the 1950's-ish cursive letterhead to the furniture and design of her different spaces, expressed a distinct personality and sensibility. Yet none of this competed with the art on view, which reflected an eclectic mix of artistic generations and media -- painting, Conceptual Art and video art -- and a viewpoint that evolved from somewhat kitschy neo-pop to neo-geo to an ecumenical feminism.
The artists to whom Ms. Hearn gave first shows, or first New York shows, included the painters Philip Taffee, Milan Kunc, Peter Schuyff, Jutta Koether, Monique Prieto and, most recently, Jeff Elrod, and the Conceptualists Susan Hiller, Renee Green, Lincoln Tobier and Simon Leung. She showed artists she knew from her school days in Boston, including the painter George Condo, the installation artist Jack Pierson and the photographer Mark Morrisroe, and fostered the careers of such older artists as the painter Mary Heilmann, the video artist Joan Jonas and the Conceptualist Lutz Bacher. She was especially proud that she was able to mount posthumous shows of the work of Eva Hesse and Ana Mendieta.
Behind all this was a very complex woman, at once sophisticated and wholesome, stringent in her taste, yet extremely generous. Slim, dark-haired and usually dressed in a stylish mixture of designer and vintage clothes, Ms. Hearn resembled a bohemian Holly Golightly. In the early years she was usually trailed around her gallery by a nervous, adoring Chihuahua named Chi-Chi. She liked to give Easter Sunday parties and in the late 90's she held an annual Christmas party, complete with decorated tree, in her Chelsea gallery.
Ms. Hearn was born in Providence, R.I.. She studied painting and video at the Boston Museum School, sang with a band called Wild and Wonderful, and had a brief encounter with performance art before becoming an art dealer. She spent a year in Paris on a travel grant from the museum school in 1981, and while working at an alternative space called Usine Pali Kao began to realize that she was more interested in other artists' work than in her own. She returned to Boston, and while living on unemployment insurance, started a performance space in her home -- a ground-floor room in the Hemenway Hotel -- that she and her friends called the Poly Cow. A few months later she left for New York and a few months after that, in November of 1983, she opened her first gallery.
In terms of location, Ms. Hearn tended to be the first art dealer on the block. When most East village galleries were situated between First Avenue and Avenue A, she opened on Avenue B and Sixth Street and then expanded to a big SoHo-style space with polished wood floors on Ninth Street near Avenue D. In 1988 she moved to the relatively gallery-free southwest corner of SoHo, on Wooster Street near Grand, which soon teemed with new, experimental galleries. And in 1995, hers was one of three galleries to open on a deserted stretch of West 22nd Street in the wilds of west Chelsea on the same snowy February night. The other two were the Matthew Mark Gallery and the Morris-Healy Gallery, and the joint opening signaled a radical reshuffling of the downtown art scene that would eventually bring nearly 150 new galleries to Chelsea.
The year before, Ms. Hearn, Mr. Marks and Paul Morris of Morris-Healy had begun to explore the idea of a New York art fair for younger dealers. The result was the Gramercy International, a lively, live-in fair that took place at the Gramercy Hotel on Lexington Avenue and 21st Street for five years before graduating to larger spaces. The 2001 Gramercy International will be held on Pier 90 and will include 160 participants, nearly double the number of last year's fair at the Javits Center.
Ms. Hearn's first marriage ended in divorce. She and Mr. de Land, whose SoHo gallery, American Fine Arts, is as much an art piece as her own, were married last year after almost 10 years together.
In addition to Mr. de Land, Ms. Hearn is survived by her mother, Alice Darcy Hearn of Cranston, R.I.; two sisters, Marie, of Providence, and Marion, of Warren, R.I.; and two brothers, John, of Providence, and William J., of Cranston.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
The Continuing Battles Inside and Outside the Lines

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Rivellino Jones of the misspelled name was refereeing a soccer game in Manhattan last week, a moral victory for Coach Marty Jacobson. Perhaps those other embattled friends of thelipsite@aol.com, Linda Bensel-Meyers and Billy Bean, could take heart from Jake, although hang in there is almost always the hardest advice to follow.
Bensel-Meyers, the whistle-blower at the University of Tennessee, is facing the start of a football season in which she has been portrayed as the Volunteers' most dangerous opponent. The team has just started practicing and Bensel-Meyers has already informed the National Collegiate Athletic Association of three freshman players who turned in remarkably similar compositions. She calls it institutional plagiarism and blames it on the mores of the university rather than on the athletes or tutors. 
 Most people in Knoxville call it harassing the program. The N.C.A.A. might not even find it in violation of whatever it is that concerns that trade organization.
Bensel-Meyers has been decrying, for some time now, what she sees as the exploitation of athletes and the subversion of the humanistic values of the academy. A professor of Renaissance literature and drama, she is also in charge of the first-year composition program. She is only recently being heard beyond the world of the Orange.
In what I found the most cynical and clear-eyed approach to the issue, Frank Cagle, the managing editor of The Knoxville News-Sentinel, simply brushed it off. He wrote that the "fate of the football team has a deep impact on the morale, the business and the general economy of East Tennessee" and that what might be construed as corruption in college sports was a "national scandal, not a local one. And it requires a national solution." In other words, keeping our boys eligible by any means necessary is a priority not to be tampered with unless every other school goes honest, too.
Bensel-Meyers is idealistic and fuzzy-minded; she sees universities using a bottom-line corporate model in which athletes are resources. Even the coaches and athletic administrators end up being victimized, especially if they don't win.
"My immediate problem is how do I avoid being cast as a harridan because I harp on the issue," she said last week. "The administration's problem is that you can't put the peel back on the orange once you see what's underneath."
Bean, an outfielder whose six major league seasons on three teams were haunted by the secret of his homosexuality, has decided he wants to be back in baseball, the binding thread of his life since childhood. Since he used his sports background to build functioning teams in two restaurants, he thinks he can use his business background in a front office. He would offer a rare combination of experience and skills, as well as a test of sports' institutional homophobia.
His open, often moving description of life in a major league closet last year in a front-page story in The New York Times led to a number of speaking engagements and television appearances. In talking about baseball, he realized he had not resolved that critical part of his life; he had left before his career was over. Even now, at 35, he tries to stay in playing shape and appear regularly on talk radio; he is still gripping the ball.
Bean is in the process of selling his current Miami Beach restaurant, Mayya, and writing to baseball club executives. He said last week that he understands that a team would have to be "courageous" to hire him.
Coach Jake's message has always been simple: don't quit. A recovering drug abuser long clean, a soccer coach in a basketball culture, an advocate for kids among clock-watching bureaucrats, Jacobson's saga has been struggle.
Since 1996, when his Martin Luther King Jr. High School team won the first of its three straight city championships, mostly with recent immigrants from the West Indies and West Africa, Jake has been controversial in and out of his school. He was suspended from coaching for 11 months last year when rival coaches accused several of his players of being ineligible. He was reinstated and vindicated, although his team lost in last year's championship final.
Like Bensel-Meyers, he is self-righteous and insistent on putting the needs of the individual student ahead of the institution. Like Bean, his charm masks a willingness to work harder than most. And like them both, he has a larger vision. Jake thinks the future of American soccer will rise from the cities.
To that end, the New York City Parks Department's inspired partnership with the Parmalat milk company finished its six-week Summer of Soccer 2000 yesterday. On weekday nights in Riverside Park in Manhattan and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, youngsters played six-on-six games under the supervision of parkies and soccer coaches and college players like Rivellino Jones. Jacobson ran the Manhattan program, which included washing the mesh scrimmage vests.
"Look at that passion," he crowed last week as teenagers from Senegal and Brazil and Trinidad stormed up and down the turf with bursts of heart-stopping athleticism. "This is going to be the urban game. These kids are going to be our future."
Rivellino Jones, 22, named for Roberto Rivelino, the Brazilian star, is a symbol of that future. As a 16-year-old Trinidadian overwhelmed by homesickness and a huge, chaotic high school, Jones found his new roots at midfield on the King varsity. He was on Jake's first title team and expects to graduate from Medgar Evers College this year. He says he wants to be a public school guidance counselor and coach. Like Jake.

Two years after Californians voted to end bilingual education and force a million Spanish-speaking students to immerse themselves in English as if it were a cold bath, those students are improving in reading and other subjects at often striking rates, according to standardized test scores released this week.
Many educators had predicted catastrophe if bilingual classes were dismantled in this state, which is home to one of every 10 of the nation's public school children, many of them native Spanish speakers. But the prophecies have not materialized. 
 In second grade, for example, the average reading score of a student classified as limited in English increased 9 percentage points over the last two years, to the 28th percentile from the 19th percentile in national rankings, according to the state. In mathematics, the increase in the average score for the same students was 14 points, to the 41st percentile from the 27th.
The results, which represent the first effort to measure the new law's effects, are expected to reach beyond California's borders, most immediately in Arizona, where voters will be presented with a ballot initiative in November asking them whether the state should outlaw bilingual education. The California test scores are also expected to influence Colorado, where a similar measure narrowly missed getting on the ballot this fall, and in Massachusetts and New York, where antibilingual forces are marshaling.
It is too early to know precisely how much the erasure of bilingual education contributed to the rising scores -- class sizes in the second grade have also been reduced over the same period, for example -- but the results are remarkable given predictions that scores of Spanish-speaking students would plummet.
Consider the experience of Ken Noonan, who likened the change in his position on bilingual education over the last two years to a religious conversion. Mr. Noonan, who founded the California Association of Bilingual Educators 30 years ago and who is now the school superintendent in this city 35 miles north of San Diego, was among those who warned in 1998 that children newly arrived from Mexico and Central America would stop coming to school if they were not gradually weaned off Spanish in traditional bilingual classes.
Now, he says he was wrong.
"I thought it would hurt kids," Mr. Noonan said of the ballot initiative, which was called Proposition 227. "The exact reverse occurred, totally unexpected by me. The kids began to learn -- not pick up, but learn -- formal English, oral and written, far more quickly than I ever thought they would.
"You read the research and they tell you it takes seven years," added Mr. Noonan, a Californian whose Mexican mother never learned English. "Here are kids, within nine months in the first year, and they literally learned to read."
As evidence, Mr. Noonan need not look farther than his own district, where, in a mirror of the state, one of every four students, or more than 5,000, is classified as limited English proficient. Oceanside was among the most diligent school districts in the state in adhering to the new law, and recorded some of the biggest increases.
In the second grade in Oceanside, for example, the average reading score of students initially classified as limited English jumped 19 percentage points over the last two years -- to the 32nd percentile from the 13th, according to preliminary state figures. Only in the 10th and 11th grades, in a reflection of the entrenched language problems of teenage Spanish speakers statewide, were the increases below four percentage points.
Oceanside's performance was all the more striking when measured against the nearby district of Vista, where half the limited English speakers -- about 2,500 students -- were granted waivers by the superintendent to continue in bilingual classes. In nearly every grade, the increases in Oceanside were at least double those in Vista, which is similar in size and economic background to Oceanside.
At the very least, the results so far in California represent a tentative affirmation of the vision of Ron K. Unz. Mr. Unz is the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who almost single-handedly financed and organized the initiative that has all but eliminated bilingual education in California, in which students were taught math, social studies and science in their native language until they gradually picked up English. (Students who now wish to be taught in such classes must seek a waiver from their districts, on the grounds that they would otherwise be educationally or psychologically harmed by the pace of the English immersion class.)
Mr. Unz, who has played an active role in the Arizona effort, said he had been dismayed to read several years ago that students across California were languishing in bilingual classes for six years or more, routinely failing to graduate. He also found that there was little research that supported bilingual education, which had been developed in Congress in the 1960's, at least in part, as a means to send federal aid to poor Southwestern school districts. Even supporters concede it soon became entrenched as a way to pay the salaries of thousands of bilingual teachers and administrators.
"The test scores these last two years have risen, and risen dramatically," Mr. Unz said in a telephone interview. "Something has gone tremendously right for immigrants being educated in California."
In Oceanside, as in many districts in the state, the elimination of bilingual education has been accompanied by other changes, making its effect hard to gauge with precision. Class sizes in the lower elementary grades have been pared to 20, from more than of 30 two years ago, with an infusion of state aid. For the most intransigent readers, Spanish speakers chief among them, an old-fashioned, sound-it-out, phonics approach to teaching reading has replaced whole language, a more progressive approach that encourages students to use context clues to extract meaning, sometimes at the expense of pronunciation.
With so many variables introduced at once, Kenji Hakuta, a professor of education at Stanford University, argued that few conclusions about bilingual education could be drawn from the results, other than that "the numbers didn't turn negative," as many had feared. Indeed, Professor Hakuta said that given a new emphasis on testing statewide, some districts are clearly teaching to the exams. Scores are up across the board in nearly all grades, though rarely as sharply as in Oceanside.
He said that districts like Oceanside were posting such sizable gains, in part, because their previous scores had been so abysmally low -- and remained so.
While the school districts are required to implement the new law, it is difficult to ascertain to what degree they have been teaching their Spanish-speaking students in English. The law requires only that teachers instruct "overwhelmingly" in English. But that is often easier to do in third grade, when the subject is multiplication, than in 11th grade, where it might be trigonometry. The state has mounted little effort to measure compliance.
Despite his initial, personal opposition to the new law, Mr. Noonan of Oceanside said that he was insistent that his district, in a city of 152,000 whose residents range from migrant farmers to naval officers to dot-com millionaires, would strictly follow the ban and teach Spanish-speaking students exclusively in English.
And thus, Mr. Noonan's district makes an interesting case study.
Though the state permitted districts the discretion to grant waivers, Mr. Noonan took a hard line. Of 5,000 students in the district who, according to a basic skills test, were found to have limited English proficiency, 150, or 3 percent, sought waivers; only 12 were granted.
By comparison, in the nearby district of Vista, where parents supporting bilingual education have created a powerful advocacy group, about one of every two students sought a waiver from the new law, and all such requests were granted.
"Our philosophy," said Dave Cowles, the Vista superintendent, "is that we give the parent the information about the benefits and the downside of the bilingual program, and then let them decide."
But so far, for the first time in recent memory, Oceanside is outpacing its archrival Vista.
In Oceanside, the average score of third graders who primarily speak Spanish improved by 11 percentage points in reading over the last two years, to the 22nd percentile; in Vista, the gain was a more modest 5 percentage points, to the 18th percentile. In fifth grade in Oceanside, limited English speakers gained 10 percentage points in reading, with the average in the 19th percentile; in Vista, there was no increase, the average of limited English speakers staying flat, in the 12th percentile.
"It's premature to comment on which ultimately works better," said Mr. Cowles, the Vista superintendent. Yet he added, "If these results are indicative of how students learn best, then we have to take them into account when we talk to parents."
In Oceanside, virtually all vestiges of bilingual education have been disassembled, including at Garrison Elementary, a stucco-coated building surrounded by eucalyptus trees, where nearly one of every two students is a native Spanish speaker. There, Leticia Cortez, a certified bilingual teacher, now teaches mathematics in English to her Spanish-speaking first graders. She resorts to speaking Spanish to a student only if he appears to be in emotional distress, and then only to counsel him, not to instruct.
That was the case with Christian Dominguez, 7, whose broad grin is usually flanked by deep dimples, but who cried for the first two weeks he spent in Ms. Cortez's class, which he entered only days after arriving from Mexico.
"The only thing I could talk in English," he said, "was nothing."
But nine months later, Christian is able to read short books about dinosaurs and the cartoon character Arthur, while understanding what he hears on his favorite television show, "X-Men."
His mother, Rocio, 28, a baby sitter, said, "I'm happy, oh, wow!"
In fact, so much English is spoken by parents and children and teachers in Oceanside that Gabriela Diaz, 8, who is entering the third grade, has experienced an unforeseen consequence of Proposition 227.
"When my friends from Mexico come here," she said, "I don't understand what they're saying."

Against Tough Odds, Nigeria Bets on Reform

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, Aug. 19

 BODY:
When President Clinton crisscrossed Africa on a six-country visit in March 1998, his plane overflew Nigeria in a pointed snub at the generals leading it. Ground down by misrule and miscreants, Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, was an ailing giant perilously close to collapse.
On his second trip to Africa next weekend, Mr. Clinton's main destination will be Nigeria, which under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power just 15 months ago, has undergone one of Africa's most stunning and convulsive political transformations. 
 Mr. Clinton rhapsodized about a renaissance on his last visit to Africa. Nowadays, no one mentions the leaders he heralded then as beacons of Africa's rebirth: only months after his trip, the leaders of Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea all went to war, against one another, from the Horn of Africa to Congo.
The hopes of Washington, and the West, now rest largely with Mr. Obasanjo and Nigeria. As he tries to restore freedom and bring some measure of Nigeria's immense wealth to its overwhelmingly poor people, Mr. Obasanjo must contend with secessionist tendencies, the spreading imposition of Muslim law in the north, rampant corruption and decades of neglect of the infrastructure that should hold his country together.
Mr. Obasanjo's performance has been mixed. Faced with the declaration of Shariah, the Islamic legal code, in eight northern states, he has reacted cautiously and called for a political solution to the challenge of Islamic extremism. Yet he ordered soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger Delta. His initial crackdown on corruption went far and wide, but his own aides have engaged in old-style influence peddling.
He has called himself a true believer in democracy and appears to have reined in the military, but he has surrounded himself with weak ministers and has little regard for the National Assembly.
As daunting as his problems are his potential assets: 113 million people above ground and billions of barrels of crude oil underground. On the continent with the world's richest natural resources and poorest people, Nigeria has so much oil that it may eventually rank second only to Saudi Arabia, but its inhabitants have one of the lowest standards of living. On a continent riven by cleavages among ethnic groups, Nigeria has the most, perhaps as many as 400.
Nigeria is home to Lagos, a reeling, clogged metropolis that is yet Africa's most thrilling city. It is a country that has given birth to some of Africa's most resonant music and literature, yet it is also a place where only 1 in 270 people has a telephone. The National Electric Power Authority -- whose initials are also said to stand for Never Expect Power Anytime -- is so unreliable that several nationwide blackouts have occurred in recent months. Long lines at gas stations -- the iconic image of a country of corrupt leaders and suffering masses -- have recently reappeared.
There is little sense here -- even less than elsewhere in Africa -- that politicians can improve the lives of ordinary Africans. The politicians, said Uti Akpan, 30, a textiles trader in Lagos, "have abandoned the schools because their children do not go to schools here."
"We are hungry, but they carry our money and go and invest outside," he said. "If there's democracy here, we don't know."
But Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general who is the West's new darling in Africa, seems resolved to try to improve the lives of Nigerians, even if he may find it as hard as previous leaders have to look beyond the big gated villa that is Abuja, Nigeria's spanking new capital, to the sprawling diversity and violent strife that lie beyond.
In tranquil Abuja, planted in the sparsely populated heart of the country as a neutral zone, the troubles of the nation that has long represented both Africa's highest hopes and deepest despair seem unimaginable.
Drive two hours north to Kaduna, however, and the despair is on stark display. In a city that once had a cosmopolitan tone and religious integration, where the political and military elite used to spend their weekends playing polo, riots killed thousands of residents this year, and neighborhoods reduced to rubble have become segregated between Muslims and Christians. "If we want to get proper peace in Kaduna, we have to divide the state into two," Simeon Achi, 61, a Christian community leader, said inside his house there. "Let them go to the north and let our people go to the south."
To the northwest, in Zamfara, the first state to adopt Shariah this year, motorcycle taxi drivers have been whipped or caned for carrying women. A cow thief's hand was chopped off.
"Sure," said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy governor, when asked whether his government would continue cutting off hands. "It's a deterrent." Just outside his office, workers were building a mosque in this officially secular country.
At the other extreme of this vast country, in the mangrove swamps of the Niger Delta, people are threatening to take up arms to form their own republic -- so that all the country's oil would become theirs.
"Every ethnic nationality in this country now has a focus on where it wants to go if the nation disintegrates," said Bello Orubebe, a lawyer in the oil city of Warri.
 
A Convert to Democracy
For most of the 1990's, under the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria was an international pariah. But for its oil, the West would most likely have forgotten it altogether.
Then, in June 1998, General Abacha mysteriously died. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, surprisingly decided to restore civilian rule. And in May 1999 power passed to Mr. Obasanjo, a man much admired abroad for having relinquished power in 1979 after three years as a military ruler and viewed at home as a possible unifier of this almost impossible country.
He is a Christian from the south in a country traditionally dominated by Muslims from the north, yet has the respect of that northern elite; he is a former absolute ruler who, in the three years he spent in jail under General Abacha's rule, is said to have become both a convinced democrat and a born-again Christian.
The shaky democracy over which Mr. Obasanjo presides has been tested severely despite the new openness. Still, the center has held so far -- although in so fragile a fashion that President Clinton will spend his two days in Nigeria only in Abuja, for security reasons.
"Nigeria and the transition there is of huge importance," said a Clinton administration official in Washington. "Given its size and its potential role in stabilizing and democratizing Africa, Nigeria represents a huge opportunity for our own interests in Africa and also a huge challenge to us."
In the last two years, Nigeria has risen from receiving nearly nothing in American aid to being at the top in sub-Saharan Africa: $109 million for general aid -- still less than $1 for every Nigerian -- as well as $10 million to reform its military and about $50 million to train and equip its soldiers for peacekeeping operations in West Africa.
The United States wants Nigeria to play an increasing security role and to help America resist calls to intervene in places like Sierra Leone. And so within this short period Nigeria has gone from untouchable to being, along with South Africa, one of Washington's two most important partners in sub-Saharan Africa.
Much of the West's hope for Nigeria lies in its leader, Mr. Obasanjo.
Although his earlier presidency was marred by widespread corruption and human rights abuses, he relinquished power voluntarily in 1979, becoming the first general to do so and earning the lasting respect of Western leaders like President Carter. What is more, when the newly oil-rich Nigeria saw itself in the 1970's as Africa's leader, General Obasanjo was one of the leaders of pan-Africanism.
Under General Abacha, Mr. Obasanjo was jailed in 1995 on a trumped-up charge of attempting a coup. After the general's sudden death, Mr. Obasanjo was released and soon declared his candidacy for president.
The Hausa-speaking Muslim military elite, who have controlled Nigeria for most of its 40 years of independence, trusted Mr. Obasanjo even though he was a Christian Yoruba. The southwestern Yoruba and the northern Hausa are two of the country's three main ethnic groups; the third is the southeastern Ibo. The military elite bankrolled his campaign to an easy, if not altogether transparent, victory in February 1999. As Mr. Obasanjo prepared to take over in May 1999, he remained a giant question mark. Would he be a stooge of the north or his own man? Would he be a democrat his second time in power?
Onukaba Adinoyi-Ojo, who was appointed managing director of The Daily Times, a state-owned newspaper, by Mr. Obasanjo last year, said the president was converted to civilian rule after his first term.
"He's not a reluctant democrat," said Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo, who has been a protege of Mr. Obasanjo since the early 1980's. "Over the years he interacted with a lot of world leaders and saw that democracy was more beneficial. When he was imprisoned by Abacha, he never thought that could happen to him after having attained his position in Nigeria. He saw that only democracy could protect everyone's rights."
Indeed, immediately after taking over, Mr. Obasanjo flushed the military of its politically ambitious senior officers, set up investigations into corruption and human rights abuses and, describing himself as a "detribalized politician," appointed officials from diverse ethnicities in the military, ministries and his cabinet. The north, used to a monopoly on power, felt betrayed.
Mr. Obasanjo's decision to become a born-again Christian "has made him approach government with a messianic attitude," Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo said. "He sees his second coming as a call from God as if he were a Messiah come to save this country. That's made him impatient. He's domineering. There's almost an I-know-it-all kind of attitude. Some feel he doesn't consult widely. I think he's aware of that fact."
Mr. Obasanjo's failings have been overlooked by foreign governments. Restive Nigerians tend to swing to the other extreme nowadays, giving Mr. Obasanjo credit for little and seemingly forgetting the genuine strides during his administration.
"The mere fact that Obasanjo has been able to hold this country together is praiseworthy," said Hakeem B. Harunah, a historian at the University of Lagos.
Lagos, the political capital until two decades ago and the focal point of the opposition to the military, had felt the army's clamps more than any other corner of Nigeria.
 
Grinding Poverty the Norm
"There's a kind of freedom that we now enjoy," said Soji Omotunde, 45, a publicist who was browsing recently in a bookstore in the neighborhood of Ikeja. "In spite of the political upheavals which are the product of a lack of democracy, we are on a path to survival."
And yet, having grown used to the idea of greater freedom, most Nigerians now mention it as an afterthought. Instead, they focus on how their daily lives have otherwise not changed: despite the billions of dollars this country earns each year from oil, most Nigerians live in grinding poverty.
Lagos reels daily, dragged down by the weight of its estimated eight million inhabitants, collapsing roads and an undercurrent of violence. Only the great Nigerian spirit -- of "suffering and smiling" at the same time, as the late Afrobeat musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti described it -- lifts up Lagos's squalid slums and gaudy mansions into what is perhaps Africa's most vibrant city.
Persuading Nigerians that a democracy can keep improving their lives remains a race against time for Mr. Obasanjo. Generals have long used the public's lack of confidence in politicians as an excuse to seize and keep power. Nigeria's last experiment with civilian rule, which began in 1979, ended in 1983 because politicians proved altogether corrupt and incompetent.
Some worry that the continuing shambles in Abuja will produce a repeat of the past. National Assembly members have exerted most of their energies in the last year on matters like obtaining allowances to buy furniture for their state-furnished private homes. In the end, senators who had been granted $35,000 to buy furniture awarded themselves $50,000 -- in cash. This month the Senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, No. 3 in government, was impeached after an internal investigation found that he had awarded himself $370,000 for furniture and $220,000 as a Christmas bonus.
Nigeria now has its third Senate president in a year. The first had to resign after lying about his age and academic record; the first House speaker, No. 4 in the government, suffered a similar fate for the same reasons. Both allies of Mr. Obasanjo, they had been elected to their positions after his aides handed out bags of money to lawmakers to secure their votes, congressmen and senators acknowledge privately.
The practice has come to be known as "Ghana-must-go" politics -- after the huge multicolored bags that illegal Ghanaian immigrants used when they were expelled from Nigeria in the early 1980's. In the National Assembly, the bags were needed to carry the bricks of notes of the local currency, the naira, of which the largest denomination until recently was worth only 50 cents.
"What baffled me is that even the money recovered from Abacha has been stolen," said Mr. Akpan, the Lagos textiles trader. "If you recover money from a thief and you go back and steal the money, it means you are worse than the thief."
A small part of the $5 billion estimated to have been stolen by General Abacha has been recovered from overseas accounts, but the amount has been loosely controlled once back in Nigeria.
The economy remains stagnant, partly because of the government's failure to privatize important sectors like the telephone industry. Nigeria's economy, like those of most African nations, still remains tightly controlled by the state.
"Everyone is still trying to live off government patronage," said Kenneth Enahoro, 47, a businessman and the son of a prominent politician, Anthony Enahoro. "The economy was destroyed by the long years of irresponsible military rule. It's going to take honest work to try and resuscitate the economy and give food to the man on the street, without relying on government handouts."
 
The Ever-Present Nightmare
After its vigorous start, the Obasanjo administration became bogged down by the various forces fueling the country's anger. Certain things have remained constant since British colonialists created it in 1914: a breakup has always been a nightmare, one that came close in 1967 when the Ibo tried to secede in the war of Biafra. A million Nigerians died.
With the military out of power, the country's sectarian and separatist forces have hit Mr. Obasanjo with full might. Out of favor, powerful northerners have challenged him by encouraging the spread of Shariah. In Kaduna, the possibility that it would be enforced led to deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.
"You cannot have a country that is ruled by one law and, once you travel one hour away, by a different law," said Yohanna Madaki, a Christian lawyer, retired colonel and former military governor. With soldiers off the streets, ethnic-based vigilante groups have mushroomed.
"People don't feel that they can rely on the government for protection, so they are going outside the system," said Ozonnia Ojielo, a lawyer at the Center for Conflict Resolution and Peace Advocacy, a private organization in Lagos. "The result is that all these vigilante groups have created a sense of lawlessness."
This sense of looming anarchy resurrected the military ruler in Mr. Obasanjo late last year. When clashes occurred in Lagos involving a Yoruba extremist group he ordered that its members be "shot on sight."
Around the same time, 12 police officers were killed in the Niger Delta by inhabitants of a town called Odi. Hundreds of troops sent by Mr. Obasanjo flattened Odi and killed countless innocent people. The president later expressed regret, but the good will he had earned by visiting the delta soon after his inauguration evaporated.
"We thought a civilian regime would bring us succor," said Mr. Orubebe, the lawyer in Warri, perhaps the most unlivable city in West Africa. Its streets are forever choked with cars and motorcycles and a thick bluish haze hangs in the air. Mountains of garbage, dumped helter-skelter, had grown so high recently that several streets were blocked off.
Mr. Orubebe spoke at dusk. After night fell, Warri reached its full surreal power. Surrounded by towering oil company gas flares that lit the sky, the city itself, lacking electricity, sank into darkness. Candles flickered along narrow streets in the center of town, where the shadows of thousands of people darted in and out of traffic and engine fumes mingled with the smoke from roadside cooking fires and burning garbage.
The obverse of Warri is Abuja, a city of new villas and wide traffic-free streets, where the building cranes in the sky point to the destination of the delta's oil money. Leaders from Sierra Leone to Congo to Angola have plundered Africa's riches, stashing the money away in Switzerland and erecting sprawling gated villas, where they live guarded by armed men. Nigeria has perhaps Africa's biggest villas.
Whether its new leaders will really look beyond the villa gates remains unclear.
At a forum this week to foster better relations between the executive and legislative branches, Mr. Obasanjo castigated lawmakers, accusing them of neglecting their duties and focusing on obtaining government contracts. The lawmakers shot back that they had rooted out corruption by removing the Senate leadership.
Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu, 34, a congresswoman, accused Mr. Obasanjo of continually undermining the legislature so that he could enjoy a "civilian dictatorship."
Still, in these quarrels, Ms. Ikpeazu saw the noisy workings of a young democracy. In the halls of the new National Assembly building here and in Lagos's flourishing media, Nigerians are arguing, clamoring, challenging. "One year can't do much," Ms. Ikpeazu said. "The important thing is that we have laid the foundation."

HEADLINE: Making Roommates of Perfect Strangers

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
AT Roommate Finders, an apartment referral service, the on-hold telephone tune is the bouncy theme from "The Odd Couple."
"Sometimes we have people come in and say, 'I don't want any Felix Unger types,' " said Michael Santomauro, the company's founder, speaking about the nit-picky neat-freak from the old television show. "They'll say: 'I'm a slob and I want them to know that. I want them to prefer to live with someone like me.' " 
 As one of perhaps two dozen companies that occupy a sliver of a niche in the New York real estate market -- bringing together apartment dwellers with folks who want to rent that extra bedroom or, often, just a corner of the living room -- Roommate Finders, along with its competitors, deals with "people looking to live with the perfect stranger," Mr. Santomauro said.
The niche is the apartment referral industry, which ran afoul of state regulators two decades ago after scandals shed light on a variety of scams. And the sliver is roommate referrals -- an enterprise characterized by wide-ranging fees, complicated refund policies and, recently, an increase in consumer complaints.
When done properly, roommate referral means more than merely handing out often outdated apartment listings. It is as much a social, even psychological, practice as it is a business dealing with apartment sizes, locations and rents. It calls for mixing and matching an array of personal preferences, interests, habits and quirks. It is one of the few commercial activities in which focusing on ethnic, religious or gender profiles is permissible. And often it does bring together perfect strangers.
Consider Yuko Nakaguchi and Benjamin Dzang.
Ms. Nakaguchi is a diminutive, demure young woman from Shizuoka, Japan. Mr. Dzang is a lanky, jocular, globe-trotting son of a diplomat from Ghana.
"I worried about living with a stranger," said Ms. Nakaguchi, who moved into Mr. Dzang's two-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a year ago. "But I met a good person to live with. No problems. He sometimes cooks Ghanaian food for me, and I cook Japanese food for him. So we are doing a good exchange."
Ms. Nakaguchi, 27, and Mr. Dzang, 25, were brought together by Japanese Clientele Shares and Apartments, a roommate referral service that, while willing to do business with anyone able to pay a $500 fee, focuses on "shareseekers" (to use the industry parlance) from Asia, and from Japan in particular.
"Not to make a stereotype," said Sam Kawahara, manager of Japanese Clientele Shares and Apartments, "but we get people who want to rent out to these Asian or Japanese people because in general they are very good with making the payment on time. And also, they keep the apartment clean by not wearing their shoes, so the brand-new parquet floor stays brand new."
It was the Gay Roommate Information Network that brought Blair Lawhead and Barry Kawakami together in November -- but determinedly not for matchmaking purposes. "Absolutely not," said Mr. Lawhead, 37, who when not playing the violin in Broadway orchestras runs a nonsurgical hair-replacement service -- "Please don't say wigs," he said with a laugh -- out of his apartment in the Chelsea Gardens co-op on West 23rd Street. "It's just the opposite for me, strictly a business thing.
"I needed to pay off the advertising and start-up costs for my company. And I did not want to scale down my life style after 'Ragtime' closed. Barry pays $700 a month, and that includes all utilities, a maid once a week, 24-hour doormen and stimulating, sparkling conversation with me."
Not inconsequential to the equation is the fact that Mr. Kawakami, 22, is a flight attendant who was seeking someone he could get along with as a friend and would understand his odd schedule. "Sometimes I go to work at 5:30 in the afternoon, sometimes 5:30 in the morning," Mr. Kawakami said. "And I'm gone two to four days at a time, maybe 12, 15 days a month."
Mr. Lawhead also travels. "I go out of town on music jobs, so we each get a certain amount of privacy," he said.
The Gay Roommate Information Network is operated by DG Neary Realty. "It's not a dating service, it's a roommate service," said Dan Gerstein, a principal of DG Neary.
Mr. Gerstein said he tells clients they should not accept a share with a someone for whom they feel a romantic chemistry. "Instead, date," he said. "Because when the fires of passion cool, you're going to have to have breakfast with that person, and that could be uncomfortable."
Mr. Santomauro's Roommate Finders does not cater to a specific clientele. And while services rendered by different referral agencies certainly vary -- to the point where the Better Business Bureau of New York has recorded a significant increase in complaints this year -- the work done by Roommate Finders meets expectable, if unwritten, industry standards. It goes well beyond the mere distribution of apartment listings.
"We take into account 35 compatibility factors, so we don't waste anyone's time," Mr. Santomauro said. "We take into account age range, sexual orientation, if they are open to living with two other roommates, to parent and child situations -- moving in with a family -- to pets, pet peeves, religious or racial preferences, if any, marijuana use, reformed alcoholics, smoking.
"We ask: 'Are you looking for a roommate for purely practical-financial reasons, or for companionship, or both? Do you keep routine hours? Entertain a lot?' " Other factors commonly included in roommate profiles are attitudes toward noise, overnight guests, cleanliness, work schedules and dietary considerations, like keeping kosher.
But besides exchanging personal data, Mr. Gerstein said, roommate services should -- but do not always -- provide full information on their listings: factors like apartment size, building amenities, transportation connections. "We not only describe the space they are renting, but the entire apartment," he said. "We give them the floor plan, so that they have an idea what common space there is and what sort of creature comforts."
And, of course, the rent.
"We list apartments throughout the New York area," Mr. Gerstein said, "so the prices range from as low as $300 to as high as $1,300 or $1,400."
POINTING out that the referral services are not involved in setting rents, Mr. Gerstein cautioned that some people listing apartments "try to make a profit on it."
"The person could be asking too much for a share," he said, "like $1,200 for a living room."
Mr. Santomauro said his company has a rent cap of $1,500. "If it's a two-bedroom for $3,000, that would be $1,500 for each person," he said. "Most rents are going to be around $800, $900 for a walkup in Manhattan; that's for a two- or a three-bedroom. Usually, an elevator building is around $1,000. And a doorman-luxury is around $1,100, $1,200."
There is a wide range of fees and refund policies among the two dozen or so roommate referral services that are listed in the Yellow Pages or that buy display ads in neighborhood newspapers or in The Village Voice.
For example, at Roommate Finders, a "shareseeker" pays $300 for unlimited use of the service for a year, even if the original or subsequent matches do not work out. If the client finds an apartment on his own within the first 30 days, 50 percent is refunded. (Most services accept listings from tenants at no charge, but some ask for a small fee. At Roommate Finders, for example, the listing fee is $25.)
The Gay Roommate Information Network charges a shareseeker only $50, in part because it wants to serve its constituency. "But we're not totally altruistic," said Mr. Gerstein, whose parent company specializes in apartment sales and rentals in downtown Manhattan. "It gives us publicity for the real estate company. Our hope is that people will come back to us when they are ready to buy or rent an apartment, and that's how we really make our money."
Another company, Rainbow Roommates, used to specifically serve the gay community. But Douglas Levy, its president, said it recently merged with Roommates N.Y.C., "a straight but gay-friendly company." Rainbow Roommates charges $250 for four months' worth of service. "If someone is not satisfied, we will consult with them, try continuously to make a new match," Mr. Levy said, but the company does not give refunds.
At Japanese Clientele Shares and Apartments, the $500 fee has no limit on the time or number of listings available to a client. "If people register with us but find a place on their own," Mr. Kawahara said, "we credit the whole $500 permanently. So they could come back any time they want to use the service again."
And, of course, the levels of service vary.
Most agencies provide listings on a daily or weekly basis -- either by telephone, fax or on a Web site -- regularly updating the list. "We call all of our listings every week," Mr. Gerstein said, "and no listings are left in the system for more than three weeks -- so the clients don't see 500 listings and discover that 300 of them are gone."
"It's unlikely that any realistic share is going to be available for more than three weeks," he said.
Many services customize their listings to a client's needs: by neighborhood, by rent level or by any particular preference. But most do not directly bring the parties together.
Japanese Clientele does. "We actually make the appointment with the primary renter," Mr. Kawahara said. "The people who register with us have to call in every day to find out their appointments for that evening -- two, maybe three a night.
"It's very difficult for our clientele, which is mostly students or corporate people from Japan, because their English is limited. And they have no credit history in this country, no Social Security number, even though they have financial backup from their parents or their company back in Japan. That's where we come in."
Sometimes there is disservice -- but perhaps nothing as notable in recent years as the furor that Basil Paterson confronted as New York's secretary of state in 1981, during his investigation of the apartment referral industry.
"Agencies would emblazon on their show window, on their literature: 'Licensed by the State of New York,"' Mr. Paterson said recently. "It gave the image of legitimacy. But too many of them weren't authentic, and we got voluminous complaints."
His department, Mr. Paterson said, "had people go out and pretend to be seeking apartment referrals," leading to a series of license suspensions and revocations. Among the chief complaints, Mr. Paterson said, "was that people paid their money, would call about the referred apartment and it would have just been rented -- always just rented." The referral agency would then offer other listings.
In roommate services, said Ronna Brown, president of the Better Business Bureau of New York, that practice took, and still takes, its own twist on the old bait-and-switch scam. "It's really just bait to get you in the door," she said.
Ms. Brown said roommate seekers should be wary of ads that sound like a specific apartment listing, especially if the apartment sounds too good to be true. "One way that some companies scam consumers is to place an ad for what sounds like a specific apartment in the paper," she said. "When you call to see the apartment, you're told you must pay the registration fee first."
In the current torrid rental market, Ms. Brown said, the Better Business Bureau has recorded a marked increase in complaints about apartment referral and roommate services, "82 so far in 2000, compared with 56 in all of '99."
"Most of the complaints we receive say the company did nothing," she said, "or that the listings were literally taken from last week's newspaper, or were months out of date."
The bureau does not adjudicate complaints but will try to mediate a resolution. And it keeps records of the worst offenders. Consumers can check a referral agency's reputation with the Better Business Bureau at (212) 533-6200, or on the Web at www.newyork.bbb.org. They can also check to see if a company is licensed by calling the New York Department of State at (518) 474-4429.
Sharon Kwiatkowski contends that because of inadequate service by a particular agency, Transworld Roommate Referrals, she is still living with her parents in Milltown, N.J.
"Every single time I got a listing through the fax, there was something wrong with it," said Ms. Kwiatkowski, 23, who graduated from the Parsons School of Design in May 1999 and commutes to her job as a graphics designer in Manhattan. "I filled out this contract and it specified what I was looking for. I wanted to live with a female. I said Midtown, 57th Street down to the Flatiron District, or south of Union Square."
Her experience, Ms. Kwiatkowski said, "is that I got all these listings and, in a number of these, they were not females. And, for the most part, they were way uptown, as high as 180th Street, way out of the area I was requesting." Ms. Kwiatkowski had paid a fee of $297.69. Reluctantly, she accepted a refund of $56.25.
JACK KOOPERMAN, an official in the legal department of Transworld, would not discuss details of Ms. Kwiatkowski's complaint about mismatches, saying, in general: "This is done by computer. When we put in male, straight, 20 to 30 years old, nonsmoker, etc., the computer matches." For mismatches to occur, there would have to be a software failure, Mr. Kooperman said. "And I don't believe it regularly breaks that way."
The business is not a perfect science and complaints are inevitable, Mr. Kooperman said. "Many times we get complaints that we give an individual listings and they call these listings and the person on the other end will inform them that the apartment is no longer available. Usually, when we follow up, it's a situation where they are trying to get rid of the person; they aren't comfortable telling the person why they are rejecting them and they're fearful that the individual has their phone number and will seek some kind of revenge."
"This will turn into a complaint," Mr. Kooperman said.
Mr. Dzang, the son of the Ghanaian diplomat, has no complaints with the service he received, despite the apparent cultural differences with Ms. Nakaguchi. Mr. Dzang is a recent graduate of New York University with a degree in economics. Ms. Nakaguchi is studying business management at La Guardia Community College in Queens.
From 1995 to 1998, Mr. Dzang's father was Ghana's ambassador to Japan. "I tagged along," Mr. Dzang said, "so I speak a little Japanese. And I help her with her English when she doesn't understand her homework." They share household chores and sometimes go to clubs together, he said, but usually they meet at at home at about 10 p.m., cook the evening meal and chat.
During his stay in Japan, Mr. Dzang said, he learned that rents there are high and rooms are small. Ms. Nakaguchi pays $495 -- half the rent -- for her share of the two-bedroom apartment.
"It's a bit bigger than a closet -- maybe 10 by 18," Mr. Dzang said of Ms. Nakaguchi's room. "She thinks it's a mansion."
 
A New York State Law Is Explicit on Roommates
In contrast to Connecticut and New Jersey, New York State has a law dealing with roommates, essentially giving tenants the right to share apartments with people who are not members of their family or are not named on the lease -- with some restrictions.
Commonly called the Roommate Law, the legislation was enacted in 1983 as Section 235-f of the Real Property Law. It applies to all tenants, regulated and unregulated.
"If only one tenant signed the lease, that tenant is entitled to one roommate," said Michael Finder of the real estate law firm of Finder, Novick, Kerrigan, Anderson & Palitz, who has written articles on the law. "If two or more tenants have signed the lease and they all live there, they are not entitled to roommates."
If, however, one or more of the named tenants moves out, each can be replaced by a roommate -- but only as a roommate, not as a lessee.
"Named tenants or roommates can always have dependent children living with them," Mr. Finder said, "and dependent children don't count in the enumeration of roommates."
Named tenants are required to give the landlord a roommate's name within 30 days of the roommate's moving in, or within 30 days after a request by the landlord.
Neither the roommate nor the roommate's children acquire any right to remain in the apartment if the named tenant vacates. Similarly, neither the roommate nor the roommate's children acquire any right to purchase the apartment under a co-op or condominium conversion plan.
In some cases, however, roommates do have succession rights. "In rent-regulated apartments, a named tenant and a roommate may constitute a nontraditional family, whereby the roommate may stay after the named tenant vacates," Mr. Finder said. "They would have to prove that the relationship merged economically and emotionally to a point tantamount to family."
A landlord cannot make a tenant waive rights under the roommate law. However, the rights created by the law do not apply if having roommates violates some other law -- for example, restrictions on overcrowding. And in 1994, in Barbizon v. Chudick, the courts found the roommate law applicable to co-op proprietary leases. DENNIS HEVESI

HEADLINE: A Land So Wild, It's Getting Crowded

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN; TIMOTHY EGAN is a reporter for The Times, based in Seattle.

 BODY:
IT was not so long ago that most of Alaska was cloaked in anonymity, and the idea that more than half a million people a year would pay money to visit a waterlogged fishing village or come within smelling distance of a grizzly bear was laughable. Towns that had seen their last mines sealed, their timber mills shuttered and their fishing docks empty huddled against the elements, the people wondering whether one last boom would come their way.
In the minds of many outsiders, Alaska was too cold, too wild, too remote. But those very words have become the selling points of a $1 billion tourism industry that has exceeded even the wildest projections. Visits have tripled since 1980, and tourism has caught up with fishing to become the state's second largest industry, behind oil and gas. 
 But even as cash registers clank and whirr from Deadhorse, in the far north, to Sitka, in the southeastern rain forest, an effort to rein in explosive growth has taken hold and appears to be gaining momentum. Some of the people who live in the coastal towns that have had their economies transformed by the cruise ship industry are trying to limit visits. In the national parks, which used to be some of the loneliest places on the planet, the number of visitors has doubled in 10 years, and officials say the crowds at some sites are threatening the very thing that is their draw -- the sense of wildness. Backpackers, kayakers and sports fishers are complaining about excessive helicopter flights, Jet Skis and group fishing tours.
Tourism itself is not under fire. There is nary an Alaskan village, from the Bering Sea to the roadless interior, that does not welcome visitors. What bothers many Alaskans is the onslaught of "industrial tourism," a term coined by the environmental writer Edward Abbey to describe mass tourism and its effects -- in Moab, Utah, for example, the crush of visitors has damaged the fragile desert and forced federal officials to limit visitation to some areas. People also fear that the singular character of the state is changing as Alaskans conform to the expectations of large tour companies.
"My concern is that the people coming to see Alaska ultimately won't see it," said Kelley Weaverling, a former mayor of the fishing village of Cordova, on Prince William Sound, who runs a bookstore in the town. "When I first came here, this place was almost prehistoric. Now, it's in danger of becoming very Disneyfied."
 Cordova is the kind of town where dogs fall asleep in the middle of the road and relentless rain wraps the town in a towel of moisture nine months a year. It is known for the fleet that brings in the first wild salmon of the year, from the nearby Copper River. But its quirky charms have been discovered by some of the biggest tourism operators in the world -- to mixed reception.
When Princess Cruises and Tours recently announced that it would be building a $10 million, 100-room lodge on 200 acres of the Copper River, a wild expanse of glacial runoff that feeds one of biggest wetlands in the Western Hemisphere, it was hailed by the company as a new frontier in Alaska tourism. The lodge would border the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve -- at 13 million acres, the largest unit in the National Park system. Princess officials described the lodge plan as a way for visitors to experience "one of the state's best-kept secrets," and said it would not harm the marine ecosystem.
But while new lodges are welcomed for the construction and service jobs they bring, small tour operators and wilderness advocates fear that much of the state's tourism is being ceded to foreign-owned interests. Princess, a subsidiary of the London-based shipping company P & O, runs four big lodges in Alaska, 10 private rail cars between Fairbanks and Anchorage, numerous buses, and a fleet of ships carrying more than 200,000 people a year to the state.
"Cruise ships are kind of like colonists," said Mr. Weaverling, referring to the companies that run the lines. "They come in their own large ships. They put people on their own tour buses. They build their own lodges. Until, finally the cruise ship visitor never sees an actual Alaskan unless it's somebody who made their bed."
 Dean Brown, an executive vice president at Princess, scoffs at such characterizations. Alaska cruise ship passengers, he said, defy the stereotype of sedentary seniors tied to the cocoon of the cruise ship.
"When people used to come to Juneau or Sitka, they wanted to ride a tour bus," said Mr. Brown. "Now they want to kayak, or ice-climb or canoe or hike to a glacier -- and we don't own any of those attractions or the services built around them."
As for fears of Alaska's being loved to death, the solution, according to state tourism officials and some cruise line executives, is to spread out the visitors. "People forget that Alaska is a huge land mass, and we have a million visitors a year -- just a fraction of what Hawaii gets," said Ginny Fay, director of tourism for the state. "We just need to disperse our visitors more."
 Mr. Brown pointed to the plan to build a lodge on the Copper River as an example of how the major tour operators were trying to move visitors out of crowded areas.
The most vocal and organized opposition to the growth of the cruise ship industry is in Juneau, the state capital, where more than 630,000 passengers are expected this year, in a town of 30,000 -- a nearly 50 percent increase over the last five years. The biggest of the 540 ships that will tie up in Juneau this summer is the 10-story Sea Princess, which is taller than the highest building in Juneau.
Juneau residents complain about excessive noise, air and water pollution, and crowds from the cruise ships, which usually dock in the morning and leave in the evening of the same day. Helicopter and small-plane sightseeing tours, working with the cruise ships, have made the skies around Juneau a zone of noise and air clutter in the summer.
"It's like 'Apocalypse Now,' " said Kimberly Metcalfe-Helmar, a Juneau resident who has helped to promote two ballot initiatives to limit tourism related to cruise ships. "You just can't get away from the noise. If you're on your favorite hiking trail, there may be six helicopters overhead. People are fed up."
Reflecting the outrage, voters in Juneau last year bucked the cruise ship industry and Alaska's political leaders. Seventy percent of voters agreed to put a $5 a person tax on every arriving cruise ship passenger. The money is used for hospitals, parks, roads and other parts of the city that are burdened by heavy visitation.
This year, Juneau residents are likely to vote on the so-called Peace and Quiet Initiative, which would restrict helicopter flights in the area. It is being promoted by some bed-and-breakfast owners, who stress that they are not against tourism but are unhappy at the growth of mass tourism. A Web site run by Crondahls' Bed & Breakfast in Juneau (www.juneaucrondahls.com) has links to the campaign, with pictures of ships belching smoke into the sky above the clear harbor.
North of Juneau, the town of Haines voted last year to limit the number of cruise ships that can dock. But in nearby Skagway, a former ghost town that had its glory years during the Gold Rush, the ships are welcome, as they bring more than 8,000 passengers a week to a village of 800 people.
The cruise industry responded to the campaigns in Haines and Juneau by cutting donations to the arts and canceling some visits. Princess pulled out of Haines, and Holland America reduced its charitable donations. And while this cutback has prompted many in Alaska to label the industry arrogant, it has spurred merchants to fight future efforts at restricting tourism.
Cruise ship passengers spend more than $160 million a year in southeast Alaska, according to Alaskan tourism officials and studies sponsored by the industry. To towns like Ketchikan and Sitka, which saw their big timber-processing mills close in recent years, the cruise ships are the key to prosperity. Cruise industry officials say they oppose head taxes, because they already pay in excess of $10 million a year in local sales tax and fees.
But it would be wrong for the industry to ignore or dismiss complaints from the towns most affected by heavy growth, said Ms. Fay, the Alaska tourism director.
"If you think of these residents as the canaries in the coal mine, the fact that they are complaining is a good indication that visitors may soon start complaining," she said. "The message from Juneau was: 'I'm trying to tell you something.' And I'm not sure the response of the industry was as constructive as it could have been because it has not calmed down."
Another concern is that the growth of large-scale tourism will come at the expense of not just individual communities but also of Alaska's largely pristine environment, and the many small outfits who cater to the growing eco-tourism market.
These critics point to the dumping of toxic waste water by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines during the mid-1990's, and recent citations of other lines for violating air pollution levels. Royal Caribbean agreed to pay $6.5 million in criminal fines -- a record for a cruise ship operator in American waters -- for the discharges at sea.
The industry promotes itself as environmentally clean, and says it processes solid waste on board and then disposes of it ashore. The water used in showers, dishwashing and laundry is still dumped at sea, but cruise ship operators say it is harmless and in compliance with Federal regulations.
Steve Torok, the Environmental Protection Agency's senior representative in Juneau, and Capt. Ed Page, chief of marine safety for the Coast Guard in Alaska, said the only regulations for this so-called gray water is that it comprise solely waste water from showers, food preparation and laundry. Yet there have been violations over the years, they added, because hazardous materials were mixed with the waste water and dumped. As a result, Captain Page said, spot-testing of such water began this year.
Beyond pollution concerns, some critics say Alaska's wild lands and formerly empty fjords and inlets have simply become too crowded. Twenty years ago, President Jimmy Carter more than doubled the size of the national park and wildlife refuge systems in the state. The move outraged members of Alaska's Congressional delegation, who said the new parks and refuges would not attract sufficient visitors.
Not only have people flocked to these federally protected lands, but Alaska's powerful representatives in Congress have become the biggest promoters of the expanded tourism industry that has resulted. In the mid-90's, the delegation pushed through a change in the law allowing cruise ship traffic to nearly double -- to 184 -- in June, July and August in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, the nation's largest protected marine ecosystem. A compromise eventually set the limit at 139.
The Congressmen have also promoted plans to build a 90-mile road through the wilderness of Denali National Park, and have quashed efforts to limit visitors around the falls where brown bears gather to eat salmon in Katmai National Park. Senators Frank H. Murkowski and Ted Stevens, Republicans of Alaska, say Denali needs more development and Katmai can accommodate more visitors without affecting the behavior of the big bears.
Others, like Chip Dennerlein, director of the Alaska office of the National Parks Conservation Association, which is opposed to many of the new development plans in or near Alaska's parks, disagree.
"If you come all the way to Alaska to experience the wild," he said, "and what you see is a free-for-all to watch bears, or you go to pristine camp site and there are 35 helicopter flights over your head, that's going to give you second thoughts."

Finance, by an Ex-Punk Rocker

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
ONE thing you learn quickly about Ken Kurson, who as founder and editor of Green magazine has become the financial mentor for the Limp Bizkit set: he does not have an ounce of pretension. He is slightly rumpled, chronically bemused. During a conversation, a mischievous glint leaps out of his eye. He always looks ready to hop on his Vespa motorcycle to take a friend on his "Sopranos" tour of New Jersey. And that's precisely the point.
Mr. Kurson, who is 31, has made personal finance palatable for people who might otherwise believe that it belongs on the shelf with Geritol and Dentu-Creme. He derives enormous pleasure from explaining in everyday language the murky world of stock indexes, P/E ratios and betas. 
 His common-sense views -- already heard in his guest appearances on CNN, CNNfn, ABC, MSNBC and National Public Radio's "Marketplace" -- are getting a wider audience. Early last month, Green began providing two articles a week to the business section of Salon, the online magazine. Also in July, he began twice-a-week appearances on ZDTV, the Ziff-Davis cable channel, directly from Green's offices. Next month, United FeatureSyndicate (Peanuts, Miss Manners, Dilbert, etc.) will begin selling a weekly package of Green content to newspapers.
Mind you, all this is not Money for Morons. For all his glibness, Mr. Kurson is very serious -- passionate, really -- about showing young people the money. "Five years ago, I paid a couple hundred bucks for the trademark to the phrase 'Personal Finance for the Unashamed,' and that's who Green is for -- those who don't care how cool it is to admit they care about their lives and their futures," he said at a restaurant near his Midtown Manhattan offices.
His advice is wide-ranging. He adheres to the idea that an investor should subtract his age from 100 and invest the remainder, as a percentage, in stocks. But he says a sector fund can be a good compromise between the passivity of investing in a general mutual fund and the "take-chargedness of individual stock-picking."
In the preface to his book, "The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance," (Doubleday, 1998), he wrote: "It's not about the ability to quit your job at any moment or to jet off to suave locales. It's about knowing that you have some control over the things that matter to you. It's about working at a job because you love it, because it elevates you, instead of because you're deeply in debt, stuck with rent you can't afford or so afraid of investing you bury your savings in jars, scattered around the backyard."
Mr. Kurson does have the backyard, if not the jars. He lives in Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Rebecca, a literary agent. He keeps the Vespa and a Harley Davidson in the garage.
David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire, saw Mr. Kurson's noncomformist streak in full color as soon as he chose him to write a monthly money column, "Green," in 1997. "The day I told him he got the job, he went out and dyed his hair orange," Mr. Granger recalled.
But then Mr. Kurson has always believed that money matters should be fun. "I've never met anybody who thought they could bring joy to people by telling them how to spend and save it," Mr. Granger said. "He might be the only financial writer in the world who makes that part of his mission. He has a real feeling that understanding personal finance can improve people's lives."
Mr. Kurson says his financial skills date from the late 1980's, when he played bass in a Chicago punk rock band called -- you guessed it -- Green. He ended up in charge of the band's books and contracts.
In 1993, he headed to New York, figuring to get into journalism, and landed internships and jobs at Rolling Stone, Harper's and Worth. (He had attended the University of Chicago for two years, but he calls college "soul-deadening.")
In 1995, he compiled an irreverent eight-page publication, calling it The Kenny Quarterly, which he furtively photocopied at his day job as an editor at United Media and distributed to friends in need of financial advice. It was a hit -- especially among investment professionals who in turn gave it to friends and family who hadn't previously found discourse about Simplified Employee Pensions particularly fascinating.
In late 1995, he and his best friend, John Packel, turned The Kenny Quarterly into Green. It now has a paid circulation of 25,000, with enhanced prospects for growth since Eastern Distributors, a major magazine handler, recently agreed to carry it. The Web site has 335,000 unique users, according to PCData Reports last month.
A year ago, the magazine and the Web site, www.greenmagazine.com, were bought by Ilife.com (formerly Intelligent Life), based in North Palm Beach, Fla., and the owner of financial sites including Bankrate.com, for about $830,000 in cash and stock, plus options.
"Am I doing well? Absolutely," he said. "My dad was a traveling salesman of motorcycle parts. Some years were good; others we had to sell our piano and all our furniture. I probably make more than he ever did. But I'm poorer than 90 percent of the people I've interviewed in my career as a business journalist. I'm on the phone all day with people, many of whom are brilliant and hard-working but plenty of whom are lazy dunces -- who spend more than my annual income on wine."
He sees few limits to young people's appetite for what he is serving up. "The Internet has changed just about everything," he said. "Not the fundamentals of corporate economics, but the way we live. Green is for a person who essentially didn't exist as recently as 10 years ago: the guy who likely won't stay in a job long enough to learn where the bathroom is, let alone retire with a gold watch; the gal who never wanted to learn the word mutual fund and suddenly finds herself controlling a substantial sum of money that can be invested in any of 7,923 funds, or thousands of stocks. These are people whose parents told them even less about money management than they did about religion and sex."
Nor, despite his anti-establishment roots, will he apologize for being a die-hard capitalist. "I write about money for two reasons," he said. "It fascinates me, and it is the most powerful way for people I care about to enact the kinds of lives they want and deserve."

 "I WAS CONTENT
 AND NOT CONTENT"
 The Story of Linda Lord and the Closing
 of Penobscot Poultry.
 By Cedric N. Chatterley and
 Alicia J. Rouverol with Stephen A. Cole.
 136 pp. Carbondale:
 Southern Illinois University Press. $34.95. 
 In February of this year, the Public Broadcasting Service showed a new film by the acclaimed documentarian Frederick Wiseman titled, simply, "Belfast, Maine." Its subject, beyond the small coastal town of that name an hour south of Bar Harbor, might be termed "the other Maine." Wiseman's cinema verite captured the largely unseen social reality of the majority of the inhabitants of "Vacationland," its images scattered among, in fact far outweighing, those of the picture-postcard harbor, the wide fields with their autumn rolls of hay, the flower-basket classes, reading groups and amateur chorales that make Maine one of the most popular retirement destinations. Repetitive work in small factories and in service industries, multigenerational legacies of alcohol abuse and poor education, poverty and unemployment constitute life for many native-born Mainers.
In " 'I Was Content and Not Content': The Story of Linda Lord and the Closing of Penobscot Poultry," Cedric N. Chatterley, a photographer, Alicia J. Rouverol, a folklorist at the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with Stephen A. Cole, a staff member of Coastal Enterprises, a community development corporation based in Wiscasset, Me., probe in depth the story of one working woman in Belfast. By extension, their book lays out the human costs of downsizing and globalization.
Linda Lord began working for Penobscot Poultry, a small processing plant in Belfast, shortly after graduating from high school in the late 1960's. Her father had also worked for the company. Lord worked her way up through a series of gruesome jobs, from hanging defeathered poultry on the assembly line to putting birds on a shackle for evisceration to cutting the veins by the birds' jawbones after they had been stunned in the "blood tunnel" where she spent most of her years with the company (she called it "the hell hole," because there was so much blood): "The machine got, oh, maybe 65 to 70 percent of the birds, and the rest I had to do." She stayed with it because "that was top pay. I mean I got the same as the trailer-truck drivers did." When the factory closed in 1988, Lord was making $5.69 an hour, "more than what the people were getting on the line. Maybe 5, 10, 15 or 20 cents more."
In the narrative of her 20 years with Penobscot Poultry, elicited in interviews conducted over six years, Lord describes in detail the small indignities of life at the plant -- indignities particular to the poultry industry, but similar to those of any factory job: blood poisoning, rashes and warts from handling raw birds, tendinitis from repetitive hand movements. "You had to be out over three days to draw on workmen's comp," Lord says. "If you were out maybe one or two days, you just couldn't get anything -- you lost a couple days' work. So a lot of people just kept going."
There were more serious dangers at the plant as well. A hose on the poultry foot-cutter let go, and Lord hit her head on the machinery, "a freak accident," she calls it, that cost her the sight in her right eye. The company took three years to settle fully: "They did play some awful things on people to try and get out of paying."
Lord's philosophical acceptance of working conditions at the plant makes them seem more terrible: "When I first went to work there, my hands were awful sore. They would swell up. You'd go home and you'd soak them and try to get so you could move them. And about when you got up in the morning so you could move your hands, you were back in there and you had to go through it again. Oh, it might take two or three months, and finally your hands get used to it. But it was a job. It was a fairly good paying job for around this area at that time. So, in some ways, I was content and not content."
Penobscot Poultry had for years been the largest employer in Waldo County (population 31,000); the plant closing cost 400 workers their jobs and affected the livelihood of some 400 more in related industries. Competition with the South, mismanagement and the high costs of shipping grain to Maine were some of the direct causes of the shutdown. But the closing also reflects the larger trend of consolidation and deindustrialization in Maine and in the nation, a trend that has left hundreds of thousands of workers like those who people Wiseman's documentary with years of service but little education, and little in savings, behind. Lord herself "defied the statistics," Rouverol reports in a chapter on the closing of Penobscot Poultry; "within six months of losing her job she found work at a local ropemaking factory employing 30-35 workers." Her medical coverage for this piecework job is good, though she has no retirement benefits. Still, as Lord puts it, "Well, I tell you, looking at 10 miles of rope goes a lot faster than watching chickens go by on a line."
RouveroL asks, "Under what conditions does our economic system undermine our efforts to create healthy and stable communities?" Rather than attempting to draw new industry, or focusing on retraining workers like Lord for competitive jobs in the new economy, those in power in the town and in the state have generally concentrated instead on setting up programs to shelter companies like MBNA America Bank, the credit-card giant, and its information mills; to protect land for the upper-class retirees, which in turn raises property values and taxes, pricing out the natives; and to attract tourist dollars.
The story of Belfast, as related in this compassionate and sorely needed book, suggests that in the pull and tug between capital and community, capital is coming out ahead.

National Geographic Buys Stake in iExplore

BYLINE: By JANE LEVERE 

 BODY:
The National Geographic Society is venturing into new terrain; it is buying a stake in an online adventure travel company.
The nonprofit society, created in 1888 for the "increase and diffusion of geographic knowledge," plans to announce today that it will buy 30 percent of iExplore Inc., a privately held Internet company that sells adventure and "experiential" vacation tours in 152 countries. Experiential travel includes things like culinary tours and Antarctic cruises. 
 Under the agreement, National Geographic will incorporate iExplore's travel information and database of trips into its own four-year-old Web site, www.nationalgeographic.com. It will promote iExplore in its magazines, which include National Geographic, National Geographic Traveler and National Geographic Adventure. And the society will give iExplore marketing access to its members.
For its part, iExplore will add National Geographic Expeditions, the society's own tour program, to iExplore's tour offerings. National Geographic content will also appear on iExplore's Web site, which will also carry a National Geographic logo, and allow visitors to chat online with National Geographic experts.
IExplore, which has had its site since February, is backed by investors that include Soros Private Equity Partners. The company has had sales of less than $5 million so far, according to its founder and chief executive, George M. Deeb.
John M. Fahey Jr., National Geographic's chief executive and president, said the society had considered developing its own online travel business and had been pursued by several companies besides iExplore.
Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said getting the nod from National Geographic was "extremely impressive" for iExplore and would give it an edge over competitors like the Gorp.com Web site and tour operators like Mountain Travel Sobek. "You can't really buy National Geographic's endorsement," he said. "It's like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval."

HEADLINE: New Economy;
An old-style deal maker takes up the cause of high technology with manufacturing over the Internet.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, it was obvious which prominent Irwin Jacobs was the business executive exemplar of the new economy. That would be Irwin M. Jacobs, the computer scientist and electrical engineer who founded Qualcomm in San Diego in 1985. He built it into a thriving Fortune 500 company through pioneering innovations in cellular communications.
The other Irwin Jacobs, Irwin L. Jacobs, is an irrepressible deal maker and bargain hunter based in Minneapolis. He became wealthy by taking big stakes in Fortune 500 conglomerates in the 1970's and 1980's, usually with the goal of unlocking value by breaking them up. 
 New technology was never high on Irwin L.'s list of fascinations. His idea of an electronics venture was to sell surplus and returned consumer electronics devices obtained from big retailers through the Jacobs Trading Company. His effort to sell such goods directly to consumers over the Web (wgdeal.com, for "world's greatest deal") was a bust. The only major business he retains from his days as a corporate raider -- Genmar Holdings, the nation's second-largest leisure boat manufacturer -- is in a labor-intensive segment of the economy that has been among the slowest to invest in new technology.
Irwin L.'s image may get a cybersheen at the end of this month, though. That is when Genmar plans to hold an open house at its Little Falls, Minn., factory to show off a compact, enclosed computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be remotely operated over the Internet.
Visitors will see 18-foot hulls, which used to take eight hours to produce, pop out every 35 minutes. Pollution, waste and labor will be sharply reduced, while quality will be so much higher that Genmar is offering a lifetime guarantee instead of the industry standard of five years. Genmar says the total cost is comparable to that for boats made by conventional techniques -- and should become lower over time.
Time Magazine, given a preview tour and a sales pitch on how the system could be adapted to many other products, called it "the revolution in a box" and suggested it could make large centralized factories "obsolete." Bruce Bobbins, Mr. Jacob's publicist, calls the process, known as virtual engineered composite, or V.E.C., "the most important manufacturing revolution in the past half century" and says that Genmar has been inundated with inquiries from other manufacturers, including producers of cars, household products and construction materials.
The technology was invented by Gene Kirila II and Robert McCollum, two Pennsylvanians who envision scattering leased VEC manufacturing cells around the world that would produce a variety of products close to where they would be used. The expertise to run the systems could reside at a central control center thanks to the Internet, so that workers at the production sites would not need extensive training.
Mr. Jacobs was so impressed with how well the virtual engineered composite process had fitted Genmar's needs that he bought Pyramid Operating Systems, the company Mr. Kirila and Mr. McCollum created in 1993 to develop VEC. Genmar's control room is hundreds of miles from Little Falls, in Greenville, Pa., where Mr. Kirila, Mr. McCollum and an expanding team of engineers are searching for new VEC applications.
Manufacturing experts say Mr. Jacobs would be justified in bragging about the process at any high-technology gathering. That does not mean that other manufacturers will jump at Mr. Jacobs's offer to sell them access to the technology. Their reaction matters because Mr. Jacobs is counting on more than stronger sales at Genmar to justify the $30 million he has invested in VEC so far. Interest in VEC could provide the fuel for taking Genmar public, a move Mr. Jacobs has talked about for years.
But like a 20-something Silicon Valley entrepreneur with the latest Web-based strategy for going from zero to millionaire in a matter of weeks, Mr. Jacobs and other backers of his technology face the temptation to oversell VEC's future. In addition to underestimating the costs and risks other manufacturers could encounter in moving to their new technology, proponents of the process, like true believers in any new technology, are probably underestimating the strengths and potential of competing technologies.
No wonder, as the history of robotics, machine vision and other innovations shows, computer-based technology generally seeps, rather than bursts, into manufacturing. The bigger the manufacturing sector the more cautious are managers to replace proven, if less than perfect, technologies and materials with new approaches. There is no particular reason to believe that any of VEC's attributes, including its ability to be controlled by remote experts via the Internet, will change that.
"We have to make numbers every quarter," said Paul Dickard, a spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which has been experimenting with VEC for several years. "There's always the question of which quarter you are going to sacrifice on the altar of Internet-enabled manufacturing."
Internet capability is central to the vision of virtual-engineered-composite manufacturing "cells," as the company calls its systems, serving as remote minifactories that could be set up and running within days. But that innovation, already available in different forms on other computerized manufacturing equipment, is only part of what makes VEC a unique package. The other key element, developed to keep costs down, is the use of laminated plastic skins instead of metal as the molding frames.
The skins are attached to supports inside the VEC cell and composite resins are injected between them. To give the skins the rigidity that metal would usually provide, Mr. Kirila and Mr. McCollum hit upon the elegantly simple idea of water pressure. Before the molding compounds are injected, the cell is sealed and the cavities behind the skins are filled with water.
Computers monitor the numerous variables in this "floating mold" process -- there are roughly 800 in the hull-making operation -- so that relatively unskilled laborers can handle all of the necessary work at the actual manufacturing site.
VEC is clearly innovative enough to attract many window shoppers, but the chances that it will lead to the wide dispersal in manufacturing that its inventors envision are slim. Plastics manufacturing experts say Mr. Jacobs is likely to have his hands full simply establishing the process as a reliable system in a few segments of industry best suited to it.
Those segments include fabricators like Genmar that use fiberglass and other plastic composites, face environmental restrictions and have high labor turnover because of the health risks and discomforts associated with current working conditions. Potential sites will also have lower volumes than the typical auto plant and less need for precision than, say, aircraft manufacturers. Logical candidates include other marine products like jet skis as well as bathtubs and paneling for buildings, trucks, rail cars or specialty vehicles.
"It's suited for about half the volume of the plastics composites industry," estimates Robert Locavara, director of technical affairs for the Composite Fabricators Association, a trade group for companies that make industrial components and consumer products out of fiberglass and other plastic composites.
That could add up to billions of dollars of production, but one thing is for sure: even if it comes to pass, it will not happen at Internet speed.

HEADLINE: A Learned Journal Aims to Defog Globalization

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
In the often rarefied world of foreign policy treatises, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is making a bet: that there are plenty of readers interested in a magazine about globalization and how it affects them.
No longer will Foreign Policy, the 30-year-old publication of the endowment, concentrate on articles about relations between governments, on military policy, or on the domestic politics of an important American ally. 
 Instead, the magazine, remade from its elegant slim size into a bigger, flashier format that resembles the celebrity magazine Talk, will concentrate on "global politics, economics and ideas."
The first issue of the remade magazine, which is in the mail to subscribers and will be on the newsstands early in September, poses the question: Would a sudden collapse on Wall Street spark a global 21st century Great Depression? Not necessarily, is the answer. The article, by Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial Times, goes on to delineate some likely results: a weaker dollar, a slump in international trade particularly hurting Mexico and Canada, and falling petroleum prices that would severely limit the oil boom in Russia.
Foreign Policy was founded 30 years ago, partly as an antidote to Foreign Affairs, the more staid, more establishment voice of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
The magazine's founders, Samuel P. Huntington and Warren Manshel, thought that an alternative voice was needed to the hawkish views of Foreign Affairs on the Vietnam War. Its initial creed, according to its opening editorial, was to re-examine and redefine American foreign policy as the United States disengaged from Vietnam. Richard C. Holbrooke, currently the chief representative to the United Nations, was its managing editor from 1972 to 1976.
By focusing Foreign Policy on globalization and the new economy, the editor and publisher, Moises Naim, is making a fundamental change from the founders' emphasis on the American role in world affairs. Indeed, the choice of Mr. Naim three years ago was quite a switch. A Venezuelan who was a trade minister of his country and who had served two stints as a senior official at the World Bank, Mr. Naim took charge of the magazine after the 17-year tenure of Charles William Maynes.
Mr. Naim -- whose interests span economics, and psychology as well as classic foreign policy -- soon revamped the magazine to make it look more like a literary publication. He livened it up with a Web site, introduced reviews of books published abroad and ran lengthy interviews with figures normally considered offbeat by a serious foreign policy publication.
The visage of Lori Wallach, a leader of the protests in Seattle last year against the World Trade Organization, beamed out from the cover of the magazine this spring, accompanied by an interview in which she excoriated Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky.
But Mr. Naim's initial revamping did not go far enough in satisfying the appetite of an audience he believes wants to know more about how globalization is going to change their lives and businesses.
He is not so brash as to try to put out a news-you-can-use publication. But in the world of foreign policy he is getting about as close as possible. "There is a lot of confusion," he said. "Globalization is changing things faster than people, countries or companies can digest or react to, A lot of the anxiety about globalization is rooted in fast-paced changes, and it's not very clear how people are going to come out of this."
So Mr. Naim is now directing Foreign Policy to readers who want an understanding of globalization without reading specialist fare. Next month, a lead article "Sushi Goes Global" describes how in just a decade a Japanese speciality has become a worldwide phenomenon involving the international regulation of the fish trade. The lead interview will be with Ray Kendall, the head of Interpol, the crime prevention agency, which has become more important in the fight against people-trafficking and other crimes that easily cross borders in the post-cold-war era.
Indeed, the rival Foreign Affairs has also gone through something of a modernization, but it remains, according to Mr. Naim, the journal of record.
His magazine's circulation, subsidized by the Carnegie Endowment, is a modest 30,000. With its new content and an extra $1 million investment by the endowment, Mr. Naim thinks he can push that up to 130,000 over the next three years.
He is not beyond attracting attention. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year, he gave a talk called the "Occupational Hazards of Power" in which he described how some chiefs of Washington, Hollywood and Wall Street suffer from what he called "narcissistic personality disorder." If the size of the crowd that came to hear that piercing criticism is a gauge, Mr. Naim may reach his circulation target.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Early Advocate of Seat Belts Now Heads Safety Agency

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SUE BAILEY, the government's new highway-safety chief, insists she is not obsessive when it comes to safety on the roads. "I'm not at all an anxious person," she says. "I'm not compulsive."
So who, then, was that young mother in Philadelphia in the early 1970's who hired a mechanic to install a seat belt for her son on the bus that ferried neighborhood children to preschool? And who, before child-restraint seats, made one of her own by cutting holes in a plastic child seat so a seat belt could be looped through it to keep her toddler daughter safe? 
 Her son, now 31 and an emergency-room physician in suburban Washington, "will tell you that he still remembers that he was the only one on that little school bus who had to buckle himself in," said Dr. Bailey, a psychiatrist, neurologist and public-health specialist who begins work today as the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
"I was interested way before anybody else seemed to be interested in how to make yourself safe in a vehicle," she said, recalling that three decades ago Americans rarely used seat belts, and that her neighbors "thought I was crazy" to be so concerned about her children's safety in the car. "I was probably ahead of Ralph Nader."
When the White House announced her appointment to lead the safety agency, "my family and friends were all laughing," she explained. "They said, 'This is perfect. She's driven us crazy for years about these safety issues in automobiles. Now she can do something about it.' "
Dr. Bailey will have no time to ease into her new job at the agency, which is responsible for the safety of the nation's highways, automobiles and tires.
The agency is under scrutiny after the announcement that millions of Firestone tires are being recalled because of evidence that they are prone to shredding; 62 deaths have been linked so far to separation of the treads on tires that were installed as original equipment on some Ford vehicles. The agency has been criticized by public-safety advocates for failing to properly track accidents involving the tires, and for not forcing Firestone and Ford to do more, faster.
Dr. Bailey says it is too early for her to discuss the tire recall in detail. But without making judgments about the agency's performance, she says she will review the methods used to monitor tire safety. "I'm so hesitant to speak about this because this was before my tenure," she says. "But I do want to review our ability to track in a timely fashion, which is part of how we serve the American public."
SHE is not new to controversy. During her time at the Pentagon -- she was assistant secretary of defense for health affairs from 1998 until this summer, the first woman to oversee the military health system -- she directed a program to inoculate troops against the anthrax virus, despite reports from some soldiers that the vaccine was unsafe.
She has no apologies for the program, which was scaled back significantly because of shortages of the vaccine and mismanagement at the company licensed to produce it. "I knew what we were doing was right," she said. "Anthrax is easily weaponized, it's as deadly as the Ebola virus, and you need protection. We had a safe vaccine. It would have made me uncomfortable to think that there were body bags coming back that I could have prevented."
Dr. Bailey, 57, was born Patricia Sue Bailey in Rapid City, S.D., the third of four children. Her father, a physician, dabbled in engineering, and during World War II he worked at a B-17 base in Rapid City and invented a type of compass still common in aircraft today. "By all rights, my family should be very rich" on the basis of that invention, she says. "But we're not, because he did it for the public good. I respect that."
When she was 3, the family moved to Washington, so her father could continue his engineering work at Andrews Air Force Base. Of his children, Sue was the one most likely to help her father under the hood of the car. "I was the one who worked on machinery with him, whether it was the car or the lawn mower or the furnace," she said.
She followed her father into osteopathic medicine, which emphasizes holistic treatments. She graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and completed her residency in psychiatry and neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She worked in private practice in Washington, raising two children. She is divorced.
A lifelong, politically active Democrat, she returned home Friday from the party's convention in Los Angeles. She is an eager supporter of Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, she says, will continue the economic expansion that is helping make cars safer. "It's a luxury to make policy that provides for safety," she said. "If you have a sound economy, corporations are going to be more willing and more able to embrace techniques to make cars safer."
Stepping into a car at the airport Friday night for the ride home, she fastened her seat belt. And she looked disapprovingly when she noticed that a passenger had not buckled his.
She announced -- only half in jest, it seemed -- that the car would stop until he buckled up. "You're being a danger not only to yourself but to the other people in this car," she explained, all but shaking her finger. "You could be a flying object that would endanger the driver. I'm not going to participate in this ride if you don't put that seat belt on."
The passenger hurriedly obeyed.

HEADLINE: In America;
This Is Class Warfare?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"This is my tranquillity," said Jose Valles. "Sitting here waiting for the bus. Because most of the time I am stressed. Why? I will tell you. Because I don't have enough money."
Mr. Valles earns his living serving hamburgers at a McDonald's restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. He's a family man. He and his wife, Lily, have two children, a boy, 9, and a girl, 6. He talked about his family's circumstances while waiting in the hot sun last Thursday afternoon for the No. 60 bus at the corner of Seventh and Alameda Streets. 
 "It's hard. It's rough," he said. "You don't have the nice kiss on the cheek or the 'Hello, honey, how are you?' when you come home from work. It's 'What the hell are we gonna do?'
"I make $5.75 an hour. That's about $240 a week. One hundred ninety dollars after taxes. You can't really live on that. Lily works in a fast-food place, too. She makes the same as me. Two weeks of my pay and two weeks of her pay every month goes for rent. Then you have to pay the fare to go back and forth to work. You gotta pay for your food. You have bills. We're still paying on the sofa.
"You see, it's stressing me out just thinking about it."
I asked Mr. Valles what he and his family did for recreation.
"We take the kids to the park."
I asked if they ever went on vacation. He looked at me as if I'd asked if his children could fly. "No," said Mr. Valles quietly. "There is no money for vacation."
The Valleses are among the millions of working families Vice President Al Gore is trying to connect with as he travels the country promising to fight for "those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind."
The Republicans have denounced this effort to reach out to working families -- to build, as Mr. Gore says, a "better, fairer, more prosperous America" -- as divisive. It's dangerous, we're told. Un-American.
Mr. Gore is "a candidate who wants to wage class warfare to get ahead," said George W. Bush.
Welcome to the intersection of greed and paranoia. We may be enjoying good times, but the wealthy are not yet wealthy enough -- at least in the view of the G.O.P. -- to accede to a little bit of help for the likes of Jose Valles and his family.
With Mr. Bush already gift-wrapping most of the nation's projected surplus, which he intends to hand over to the very wealthiest among us, it's fair to ask who's waging war on whom.
In our conversation last week, Mr. Valles mentioned politics just once. "The politicians keep saying they are going to raise the minimum wage, but nothing happens," he said. "A minimum wage increase would help everybody, not just me."
Class warfare? Let's see. The Democrats have been trying without success to raise the minimum wage -- now $5.15 an hour -- by a mere $1 over the next two years. That's a whopping 50 cents an hour the first year, and another 50 cents the year after. My goodness, is that an attack on the rich? Is that what they mean by class warfare?
The Republicans in Congress have stood in the way of this most modest of pay hikes for the nation's low-wage workers. Mr. Gore favors the increase and says he'll fight for it. If that's class warfare, we need more of it.
Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, is getting a retirement package worth an estimated $20 million from the Halliburton Company, an energy services outfit that has a big financial stake in the policies of the federal government. No problem, said Mr. Bush.
But a tiny boost in the minuscule minimum wage would seem to be a different story.
(The radical Texas Republican Party, at its convention in Houston in June, declared that all minimum wage laws should be repealed.)
I asked Jose Valles how his life would change if he earned a few more dollars a week. He said: "I would do something nice for Lily. I would buy some clothes for the children and try to take them to a movie every now and then. My dream is to someday be able to invest in a house."
He added: "I'll tell you the truth. I would like for my kids to go to college, which I was never able to do. I'm like all parents. I would like the best for my children. I would like my children to soar."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Renews Push on Patients' Rights and Drug Prices

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that of Harry S. Truman, but leaving the "give-'em-hell" to his running mate, Vice President Al Gore renewed his attacks on drug companies and health maintenance organizations today and vowed to bring broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.
At the first of four appearances today in Illinois and Iowa, all of them in communities along the Mississippi River, Mr. Gore said he would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect H.M.O. consumers and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program. 
 "If you entrust me with the presidency, we will flat make it happen," Mr. Gore promised a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Moline.
Both Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, used their speeches here to draw on the Trumanesque imagery that has enthralled Democrats for more than half a century. But Mr. Gore left it to Mr. Lieberman to assail the health care record of Mr. Gore's Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
While Mr. Gore made only passing references to the Republicans, Mr. Lieberman cited statistics that 1.4 million children in Texas did not have health insurance, that Texas led the nation in the percentage of residents who were uninsured and that it ranked next to last in health care coverage for women.
Mr. Lieberman said Mr. Bush often responded to criticism of his state by saying, "Don't mess with Texas." But, he asserted, "when it comes to health care, it's a mess in Texas."
Aides to Mr. Bush accused the Gore campaign today of distorting the governor's health care record, pointing out that a bill he signed in 1999 was expected to add 423,000 children to the health insurance rolls by 2001. (Mr. Bush, however, had earlier fought for a less-inclusive plan.)
"The further Al Gore floats down the Mississippi, the more he drifts away from the facts on Governor Bush's record on health care in Texas," said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.
After a two-day riverboat tour down the Mississippi, Mr. Gore left the slow-moving ship and traveled by bus today so he could make all four cities on his schedule. Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were rejoined by Mr. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who had left the tour in Wisconsin on Friday to observe the Jewish Sabbath.
The candidates clearly have been buoyed by polls showing they received a significant boost from the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, and they have been received enthusiastically by sizable crowds. "I'm no expert as to what to make of it," Mr. Gore told reporters, "but it feels good."
As in his speech at the convention on Thursday night, Mr. Gore accepted credit today for the economic health of the Clinton years but said there was more work to be done. He noted, for instance, that 15 percent of Americans still lacked health insurance.
"We've got some serious problems in our health care system," he said, his voice still hoarse from his convention speech, "and we've got to fix them without undermining the good things about our health care system."
Mr. Gore said he would move incrementally toward a system of universal health care, starting with guaranteed coverage for every child by 2004. And he said the country owes its older citizens a prescription drug benefit, a proposal estimated to cost $253 billion over 10 years.
"When people have bills for pills that are more than their Social Security check," Mr. Gore said, "it is wrong for our country to put seniors, the generation that won World War II, in a situation where they have to choose between food and medicine when the drug companies have the biggest profits of any industry in America."
The drug companies, Mr. Gore said, do not support such plans because they fear that drug prices will come down. "Well, they need to come down," he said. "They need more competition." He added: "I'll be like Harry Truman. I'll tell them the truth and they'll just think it's hell."
Mr. Gore then switched targets from the drug companies to H.M.O.'s that he accuses of making financial decisions that usurp medical recommendations. "Some bean counter behind a computer terminal who doesn't have a license to practice medicine and surely does not have a right to play god overrules the doctor because the H.M.O. or the insurance company doesn't want to shell out the money, even though you've been paying the monthly premium," Mr. Gore said. "What is that all about?"
Mr. Gore's proposal for a patients' bill of rights, campaign aides say, would assure access to specialists, would guarantee emergency room care regardless of when and where the need arises and would provide either a right to sue or an alternative appeals process if insurers deny coverage.
The Gore campaign criticizes Mr. Bush's proposed bill of rights because it would cover only those Americans in federally governed health care plans, a restriction that Gore aides say would exclude 135 million people with private insurance.

HEADLINE: Harry Oppenheimer, 91, South African Industrialist, Dies

BYLINE: By MARILYN BERGER 

 BODY:
Harry F. Oppenheimer, the South African gold and diamond magnate who used his great wealth and considerable influence in the fight against apartheid, died on Saturday in Johannesburg. He was 91.
Mr. Oppenheimer was admitted to Kenridge Hospital in Johannesburg on Friday after complaining of abdominal pains and a headache, said Glen Finnegan, a spokeswoman for the family. 
 Mr. Oppenheimer for decades headed one of the world's largest multinational industrial and mining conglomerates with resources stretching from Cape Town to London to the Yukon. Called the "king of diamonds," he was also the king of gold, platinum, uranium, vanadium and copper, wielding extraordinary power over some of the world's strategic metals and minerals.
The Oppenheimer empire has been called a "Chinese puzzle" of majority and minority holdings. The bewildering complex, in addition to effectively controlling the world's supply of diamonds through the linked De Beers mineral companies, has vast holdings in banking, real estate, pulp and paper, bricks and pipe, coal and potash, locomotives and beer.
As head of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, Mr. Oppenheimer for a quarter of a century was the most powerful figure in his country's economy as well as one of the richest men in the world.
He became an important force in South African politics, elected to Parliament in 1948 as a member of the minority white liberal opposition. In that capacity, he spoke out frequently and consistently against apartheid, the country's policy of institutionalized racial discrimination.
In 1957, he became head of Anglo American, a mining and metals company formed by his father during World War I, and chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. During the years he was in charge, he presided over an enormous expansion of the business. Anglo American grew to a net value of 24 billion South African rand in 1987 -- $3.47 billion at today's sharply reduced exchange rate -- from a value of 65 million rand in 1957.
Mr. Oppenheimer stepped down from the chairmanship of Anglo American in 1982 and as chairman of De Beers in 1984. But he remained active in the businesses in which his family maintained controlling interests. His son, Nicholas, became chairman of De Beers in 1998.
In his political life, Mr. Oppenheimer grounded his opposition to apartheid on humanitarian impulses, often bringing economic principles and a sort of elegant understatement to the argument.
"I've never thought that the policy of racial discrimination had been a great benefit to business," he said, "because while it may have had the effect of keeping wages low, it also had the effect of keeping labor exceptionally inefficient. I believe that apartheid is something that works against the interest of economic development, not for it."
Mr. Oppenheimer, who was of Jewish origin, championed the creation of black trade unions, and he lived to see those unions challenge the power of his mining companies. He was influential in ending an employment system that set aside certain jobs for whites only. His industrial group took the lead in creating housing near the mines for blacks, although the new housing accommodated only a small percentage of the three-quarters of a million blacks employed, many as migrant laborers, by his companies. He developed programs to educate blacks to bring them into positions of responsibility in his companies.
Franklin A. Thomas, former chief executive of the Ford Foundation, called Mr. Oppenheimer "a tireless fighter who tried to change the apartheid system from within." While he said he wished Mr. Oppenheimer had done more from his special position, he praised his efforts "to increase democracy in the workplace and to spread it beyond the workplace to communities in which people live."
The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan of Philadelphia, the framer of the Sullivan Principles, a code of corporate conduct in South Africa, said that Mr. Oppenheimer "has been a force for good, a progressive influence in South Africa, far beyond the vast majority of business leaders in that country."
Mr. Sullivan, who, like Mr. Thomas, came to urge international investors to withdraw from South Africa, and disagreed with Mr. Oppenheimer in later years, said he continued to have "the highest respect and regard for him."
Mr. Oppenheimer maintained that an expanding economy was a better environment for political change than a contracting economy and therefore remained a steadfast opponent of economic sanctions as a means of pressing the South African government to relax racial strictures.
"I'm not one of the people who think that sanctions have no effect," he said in an interview in 1987. "I think they have a very serious effect in South Africa, but I think the effect is bad in that it brings pressure to bear on people who are on your side anyhow. And it certainly doesn't force the government to change their policy."
He continued: "You know these highly nationalistic people in South Africa are extremely allergic to pressure from outside," and adding, "In fact they become very bloody-minded about this sort of thing. They're a tiresome, obstinate lot, our masters."
These "masters," the Afrikaner nationalists who controlled the government from 1948, tried to have as little to do with Harry Oppenheimer as possible. Despite the enormous power conferred on him as the head of a group of companies that that were a leading force in the South African economy, Mr. Oppenheimer was never asked to dine with the prime minister in the first 34 years of rule by the National Party, the political form Afrikaner nationalism.
In 1982, he was finally invited, along with his house guest, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, to dine with Prime Minister P. W. Botha. By 1987, he said, he had seen Mr. Botha three or four times in the preceding year. But in the past, he recalled then: "He objected to sitting down to the same lunch table with me. You see, I was not a very popular figure with him."
And he said, "I feel that in the direct political way I was able to achieve virtually nothing except to keep what I considered a voice of common sense and humanity alive."
Mr. Oppenheimer said in the 1987 interview he believed that the growth of the economy had "made the apartheid policy more and more implausible," and that the government was moving away from it. "What they've not done is to make really significant movement on sharing political power."
A little more than two years later, Mr. Botha's successor, F. W. de Klerk, legalized antiapartheid groups and began moving toward negotiations with them for a democratic constitution.
Majority rule, Mr. Oppenheimer said, would have to come in stages, with guarantees for the rights of various groups in the country. "I think if you try to insist on having no guarantees for group rights, the effect would be that you won't get any movement at all," he said.
Mr. Oppenheimer was not someone to loudly take credit for his accomplishments and even less for his charities, which included the "usual thing" as he put it -- hospitals, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, and seed money for education, especially for blacks. A particular interest was the Urban Foundation, which he helped establish, dedicated to improving the environment in which black South Africans live in the cities.
He was known for his refined sensibilities and exquisite taste. In Little Brenthurst, the palatial home in Johannesburg he inherited from his father, and in the seaside "bungalow" he built near Durban, he had a collection of Picassos, Sisleys, Goyas, Dufys, Degas and Chagalls. He was particularly fond of a Renoir he bought in London for 40 while a student at Oxford, where he developed a reputation as a generous host when he took friends on Champagne picnics.
He collected manuscripts of English poets and had a special regard for Lord Byron, whom he admired for a "curious combination of the romantic and the practical.
Mr. Oppenheimer also had a major collection of Africana, and took special delight in a private press he established to publish manuscripts. "I started about 10 or 15 years ago," he said in 1987. "I've been having a great deal of fun out of that."
He maintained a private game preserve and kept a stable of racehorses. His wife, the former Bridget McCall, was an avid bettor. Mr. Oppenheimer, who was not exactly a wagerer himself, used to be seen going down to the equivalent of the $2 betting window in Durban to place her bets.
A modest man of medium height, with a slight stammer, he spoke four languages -- English, Afrikaans, German and French. In conversation he was direct, engaging his guests with genial, but penetrating, brown eyes.
Harry Frederick Oppenheimer was born on Oct. 28, 1908, in Kimberley, South Africa, six years after his father, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, had emigrated from Germany by way of England. Young Harry became the heir apparent of the family's business empire when a brother died. From his childhood he was prepared for the position he was to to occupy. He studied politics and philosophy at Christ Church College at Oxford, where he was tutored by Sir Roy Harrod, a British economist.
Mr. Oppenheimer volunteered for military service early in World War II and became an intelligence officer with an armored-car regiment of the South African Army. While still in the army he married Ms. McCall. She and their two children, Nicholas and Mary, as well as five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren survive him.
His father, the son of a Jewish cigar maker from Friedberg, Germany, converted to Anglicanism in the 1930's. Harry followed in his path, as he did again when, at 40, he was selected to represent the Kimberley constituency in Parliament. There, like his father, he was a voice for liberalism.
But Mr. Oppenheimer's first term, which started in 1948, coincided with the victory of the National Party led by Prime Minister Daniel Malan, which under successive leaders would rule South Africa for more than 40 years.
When Mr. Oppenheimer left Parliament in 1957 to take over the family business empire after his father died, he threw his moral and financial support to the relatively liberal Progressive Party.
Once, when a state television interviewer asked him whether it had ever occurred to him to follow another career, he responded with customarily dry wit: "I chose my father with discretion and I found myself in a certain position. And, I mean, like the prayer book says, I have sought to do my duty in the station in which it pleases the Lord to call me."

HEADLINE: Paul Bunyan Settling Into His New Cubicle

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: COOS BAY, Ore., Aug. 17

 BODY:
Zeldon Linn has worked on the railroads and in a sawmill. He has been a sergeant in the Army and a mechanic in a garage. At times for the last 15 years he has found work as a fisherman, crabbing and catching salmon in the Pacific Ocean off this struggling blue-collar town along the Oregon coast. At other times, he has found no work at all.
All of which, he conceded with a laugh the other day, seems like odd preparation for his new job, where he sits in a cubicle each day, fires up a computer, dons a headset and swings into action on the first ring of the telephone. 
 "Good morning," Mr. Linn says. "Thank you for calling MSN Technical Support. My name is Zeldon. May I have your e-mail address, please?"
For Mr. Linn and 345 other people here in remote Coos County, where the historical economic pillars of logging and fishing have been severely battered and where the unemployment rate was in the double digits as recently as last year, an improbable savior has emerged, mushrooming in a matter of months into the second-largest private employer in the county.
As high-tech companies face an acute shortage of workers in many urban areas, they have begun to branch out to areas of the country that had been passed over by the boom, bringing jobs and training and making inroads on the "digital divide" between America's urban and rural regions.
Here in southern Oregon, the company is CyberRep.com, a Virginia concern that has contracts to provide phone and Internet services for well-known corporate clients. CyberRep workers like Mr. Linn answer the toll-free help lines for the Microsoft Corporation's MSN online service and for Barnes & Noble.com, the online division of the bookseller.
For places like Coos Bay, once the largest wood-products shipping port in the world, there are some painful twists. These are the back-office jobs of the "new economy," paying $8 to $9 an hour and offering no stock-option bonuses. There is a graveyard shift, because the help lines need to be staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even with CyberRep set to surpass the Mill Casino, owned by the Coquille Indian tribe, as the area's largest source of private jobs, it will still represent just a fraction of the 3,200 jobs in the wood-products industry that local officials say have been lost in the last 20 years. In many cases those jobs paid, in constant-dollar terms, twice as well as the new ones.
Still, these are jobs, offering health benefits and computer skills that many workers say they believe are the perfect entry to more lucrative employment. And most of the workers, like Mr. Linn, seem grateful for the work, though they often express ambivalence about the nature of the work and the sweeping economic forces that have taken them out of the woods or off the seas and placed them in small workstations in a boxy warehouse building up the street from the local airport.
"I miss the ocean," said Mr. Linn, 43, a burly, bearded man who still wears work boots to his job. "There's a feeling of freedom you get there like no place else. Now here I am, confined to this little cubicle.
"On the other hand," he said, his face brightening, "this is the first job I've ever had where I go to work clean and I come home clean. I've never had a job where I didn't come home smelling like fish or oil."
Mr. Linn and other workers at CyberRep described the kick they get from helping frustrated or even irate callers from around the nation facing trouble with their dial-up adapters, modem connections, configuration schemes and all manner of other software and Internet problems. Some callers simply need old-fashioned help, like directions.
"I'm driving through Kansas right now," said a woman named Peggy, speaking on her cell phone, after she called Barnes & Noble's 1-800-THE-BOOK help line and reached Stella Smith, 62, the wife of a retired logger, at her workstation here. "I'm driving across the country. Do you have a bookstore anywhere near Topeka, Kan.? I'd really like to go to a bookstore."
Mrs. Smith instantly used her computer mouse to navigate the "find a store" function of the Barnes & Noble site to locate the store in Topeka and give Peggy the directions.
These jobs are not for everybody. Some who have worked around trees or at the port all their lives said they could not imagine being cooped up all day, staring at a computer screen.
"You put me indoors and I'm lost," said George Sjostrom, 59, a wiry man with a chain saw and a hard hat, who shook his head when asked if he might want to trade his job as a log-yard worker for that of a computer-support specialist.
"I'm out of my world," continued Mr. Sjostrom, who tags and sorts giant logs all day with the help of enormous claw-equipped machines that move the logs around the yard as if they were toothpicks, readying them for placement aboard ships at the nearby port or in machines that turn them into wood chips bound for pulp mills. "I wouldn't have any idea what to do with a computer. If I could figure out the 'on' button, that'd be a big accomplishment for me."
At CyberRep, though, many of the workers said they enjoyed computers and several, including Mr. Linn and Mike Armijo, 38, who lost two jobs in recent years when local mills closed, said they had initially taught themselves how to use the machines.
The jobs have their stressful aspects, perhaps chief among them the constant pressure to satisfy customers while sticking to an average time of roughly nine minutes a call.
"You walk a fine line," Mr. Armijo said. "You've got to be as caring as you can, but you've also got to get them off the phone as quickly as possible."
Workers here trade horror stories about their longest service calls -- 82 minutes here, 74 minutes there -- often involving customers who have completely fouled up their software settings in a bid to solve what began as a much simpler problem. Men are generally more difficult than women, workers of both sexes agree.
"Men are much more likely to think they know something about computers when they don't," Mr. Linn observed. "But women, I've found, are more willing to say something like, 'I really don't know, I need help.' They'll really listen to you more. So they take less time."
Several elements came together to culminate in the deal that brought CyberRep to the call-center building, which is part of the airport office park in North Bend, the neighboring town to Coos Bay. The idea started last year in the mind of John Stadter, then the chief financial officer of 800 Support, a company based in the Portland suburbs that was recently acquired by CyberRep.
Mr. Stadter grew up on the Oregon coast and had a vacation home near here, in Bandon. So, he explained, he knew something about the area and convinced his initially skeptical colleagues that there was a large, willing and able work force.
"Some of the smartest people in my high school class went to work in the woods, because that's where the big money was," said Mr. Stadter, now the general manager of Coos Bay operations for CyberRep. "And they're still around here."
The Oregon International Port of Coos Bay, which helps broker economic development deals, put together a package of tax incentives and agreed to lease the building. The local Southwestern Oregon Community College provided computer training classes.
Coos Bay's wood-shipping industry, as well as its fishing, has declined in the face of foreign competition and heightened environmental regulations. While 300 million board feet of lumber were shipped out of Coos Bay annually a decade ago, the number last year was 13.5 million, said Ingvar Doessing, the manager of a local stevedoring company and a member of the port commission.
The region, 80 miles away from the nearest Interstate, is remote by many measures. Local officials have sought unsuccessfully to attract a steel mill, a pulp mill and a fish-processing plant. They say they are thrilled to have landed a high-tech company.
"This area has never really participated in the economic boom of the 1990's," said Allan E. Rumbaugh, the port's general manager. "It certainly participated very strongly in the recession of the early 1980's. So this deal has given us a real sense of optimism that we're not the pariah we sometimes worry we are. We can attract a company to come here from out of town. That feels pretty good."
Mr. Armijo, the CyberRep support technician, expressed more caution: "It's been my sad observation that nothing lasts forever around here as a source of jobs. I've never seen anything that permanent.
"But for now," he said, using an analogy that looks back to what was once an economic mainstay, "I think it's a godsend that this company has come in here. It's kind of like a guy going fishing and reeling in a 1,300-pound tuna. It's unbelievable."

HEADLINE: Lazio Finds New Friends In Democratic Stronghold

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Vivian and Salvatore Frisicaro were wearing Hillary stickers, but when Representative Rick A. Lazio strode past them at the Pulaski Day parade here this afternoon, they did not voice fist-waving contempt or even just grimace like the longtime Democrats they profess to be.
A few minutes later, the Frisicaros let slip a secret: they were apostates, Lazio fans who had turned against their party's Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 "We need help, economically, medically," explained Mrs. Frisicaro, 69, a retired teacher's aide who said she had put on the sticker as a courtesy to a friend who handed it to her here in this Buffalo suburb. "I think she had her try when President Clinton was in, with the health-care plan. And health care is still going down the tubes."
Like the Frisicaros', the political allegiances of Erie County, a classically blue-collar Democratic redoubt in western New York, are not always predictable. The county has increasingly become one of the most crucial swing areas in New York, and if the number of Lazio backers who lined the route today on Harlem Road was any indication, Mrs. Clinton cannot assume the county is a sure thing.
The Democratic organization here in Erie County is more formidable than any in the state outside New York City, but it has faced some unexpected defeats in recent years. It lost the county executive's office last year and could not stop Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, from winning the county in both 1994 and 1998.
Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have identified Erie as vital to their campaigns, and although Mrs. Clinton skipped the parade, which celebrates Polish-Americans by honoring the Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, she arrived late this afternoon for a visit to an arts festival that followed the parade.
Mrs. Clinton was greeted enthusiastically as she mingled with people before taking the stage to dance a polka with her daughter, Chelsea.
She also served kielbasa at a food stand, conducting a taste test that compared the local variety with one her campaign had brought from Westchester, her new home county.
In brief comments to reporters, Mrs. Clinton did not directly address her chances in Erie, though she expressed fondness for the people of the county.
Her campaign aides disputed the idea that Mr. Lazio had a chance here, saying that wayward white, working-class Democrats like the Frisicaros would return to the fold.
"It's a swing area that it's important to win, and I'm confident that we will do so," said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. "We have devoted an enormous amount of time upstate. And we are the only candidate in the race to have an economic plan to bring new jobs upstate."
It also might be argued that some of those at the parade could have been smitten by Mr. Lazio because he took time to shake their hands or pose for photos with their children. Still, it was not difficult, in more than 20 interviews with Democrats at the parade to find people leaning toward him.
"He's New York State-born," said Adolph Rakowski, 62, a retired custodian who recalled that the only Republican for whom he had voted in recent years was Mr. Pataki in 1998. "I don't think that we should have a carpetbagger running. She does not know where western New York is. If she learns where western New York is, maybe we can vote for her."
Nearby was Ray Full, 79, a retired painter, who said it would be unthinkable to vote for Mr. Lazio.
Mr. Full said he had supported a Republican in the past -- Representative Jack Quinn, who has close ties to labor -- but would not do so this time. "Hillary is going to win," Mr. Full said. "Most of the time the Democrats get in around here."
Speaking to reporters after he marched, Mr. Lazio said the response pleased him. "If this today is any indication of the level of support that we have in a county that has a Democrat registration edge, we are going to do very well," he said.
Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lazio also used the day to express his appreciation for the county and for Polish-Americans, though he seemed to evince a little confusion about geopolitics when he said in a short speech that he had favored Poland's entrance into the North American, rather than North Atlantic, Treaty Organization, or NATO.
Mr. Lazio and his aides continued to attack a Spanish-language radio commercial that is being sponsored by the Democratic State Committee in support of Mrs. Clinton. The commercial declares that Mr. Lazio has always voted in Congress against the interests of Hispanic people on government spending, the military's use of a bombing range in Puerto Rico and other issues.
"It is an attempt to bring out the very worst in people," Mr. Lazio said of the commercial. "It's beyond distorting the record -- it's an outright fabrication."
Mrs. Clinton dismissed his criticism and his demand that the commercial be withdrawn, saying that it was factually correct.
"National Hispanic groups have given him a zero for his voting record," she said.

HEADLINE: Defense in the 21st Century

 BODY:
The presidential campaign has embarked on an unhelpful debate between the candidates about Gov. George W. Bush's assertion that American military forces have been "hollowed out" during the Clinton administration. That is not true, and it deflects the conversation from a host of important defense issues that the candidates should be addressing. The United States has by far the world's most powerful military forces and invests more money in maintaining them and their weapons than the next 10 largest countries combined spend on their militaries. The question for Americans to consider is whether the armed forces are adapting quickly enough to fight the kinds of battles they are likely to face in the years ahead.
The paramount non-nuclear military issue before the nation is how the country's military forces should be organized, armed, trained and used. We will deal in a later piece with nuclear weapons and missile defense schemes. The United States must maintain conventional military forces of sufficient strength to defend the nation's vital interests. But war should always be the option of last resort in settling a conflict. 
 When Washington sends Americans into combat, it must do so with the intention and means to achieve victory quickly and decisively but without a wanton use of firepower. America cannot expect that all its future conflicts will be as casualty free as those of the past decade. Still, commanders must exercise military power overseas with due regard for the safety of American troops and civilian populations. Ground troops should be employed only if air power and precision weapons cannot achieve American goals.
Though the armed services have been downsized over the past 10 years and battle doctrines have been modified since the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States today still has military forces better suited to dealing with the kinds of threats encountered during the cold war than the new dangers the nation faces. That must change.
America now has some 1.4 million men and women on active duty, down from about 2.2 million a decade ago. The Army has shrunk from 18 divisions (each with roughly 15,000 troops) to 10, though it still has 470,000 people over all. The Air Force has gone from 22 air wings (each with 72 planes) to 12. The Navy has slimmed from 13 aircraft carrier groups to 12 and from a total of 528 ships to 315. Defense spending, at nearly $300 billion a year and once again rising in real terms, is now about 25 percent below the peak Reagan years, after accounting for inflation.
The nation's conventional forces are now organized on the assumption that they might have to fight two regional wars simultaneously, for example in the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula. Future military conflicts are possible in either region, but overlapping wars seem highly improbable. The Pentagon should be ready to fight one regional war on short notice, using ground forces if necessary, while relying on air power to give the country time to mobilize for a second conflict. One regional war would likely require four to five army divisions, five air wings and three carrier groups. In the highly unlikely event of a second war breaking out at the same time, the country should rely on mobilizing its 865,000 reserve troops, including eight reserve air wings.
To fight regional wars, the army needs lighter, more easily transportable tanks and artillery than it has today. The Pentagon needs to strengthen its capacity for airlifting and sealifting troops into battle regions. The services also should be equipped with a robust arsenal of sea- and air-launched cruise missiles, more smart weapons and airborne drones for intelligence. The Pentagon must improve the way it delivers to battlefield commanders the sophisticated photographic intelligence now available from satellites and reconnaissance aircraft.
Since the Persian Gulf war nine years ago, the largest American military operations have involved protracted peacekeeping, as in Bosnia, punitive air and missile strikes, as in Iraq, or emergency actions to halt ethnic conflicts, as in Kosovo. The future is likely to see more of these interventions, which require different kinds of training, equipment and planning than the large European land battles anticipated during the cold war. The Army, with its heavy weaponry and lack of mobility, seems least prepared to engage in these new conflicts, as seen in Kosovo. Even if a decision had been made to use ground forces, it would have taken many months to transport an effective force to the area.
The Navy and the Air Force are better adapted to the post-cold-war world. But too much of their weapons budgets are now allocated to dubious projects like the next-generation fighter plane. This is an expensive indulgence in a world where no potential rival is developing aircraft superior to America's current F-16's and F-15's. The Air Force could use the money it would save to assure a more reliable flow of spare parts and more cargo planes for airlifting troops and equipment, among other things. The Navy could devote its savings to adapting more of its submarine and surface fleet for launching cruise missiles.
Charges that the American military is unprepared to wage war are a regular feature of presidential campaigns. A more fundamental debate is needed, looking not just at time spent training for combat but also at factors like air and sealift capacity and the availability of appropriate equipment. Both candidates have usefully called attention to issues of military pay and housing and to the need to recruit and retain skilled pilots and computer professionals at a time when the civilian economy is offering attractive lures.
Mr. Bush has offered a few thoughtful and provocative ideas on defense but now needs to move beyond generalities. Mr. Gore, long a student of military issues, has seemed content to let the Clinton administration's record and policies speak for him. Both candidates have chosen running mates who are interested and knowledgeable about military issues. The two tickets should now move on to an expansive defense debate.

Top Southern Democrats Offer Gore Little Support
Several prominent Democratic politicians in the South have been keeping their distance from Vice President Al Gore as they begin their own general election campaigns. Their decisions seem to illustrate the South's general indifference to Mr. Gore's appeal, and demonstrate how hard he will have to work to capture even a few states in the region. A1
 
Mr. Gore renewed his attacks on drug companies and health maintenance organizations and vowed to bring broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans. Campaigning in Illinois and Iowa, Mr. Gore also said he would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect HMO consumers and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program. A18
 
A senior adviser to Mr. Gore accused Gov. George W.

HEADLINE: ACCORD IS REACHED FOR MOST WORKERS IN PHONE WALKOUT

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
The two unions representing more than 86,000 striking telephone workers reached a contract agreement yesterday with the nation's largest telecommunications employer, Verizon Communications, for about two-thirds of the strikers, indicating that organized labor still has a place in the New Economy.
Although about one-third of the union locals had still not signed off on the settlement last evening, the company and the union leaders said the 15-day strike was effectively over. They said union workers in the region affected by the strike -- 12 states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia -- could return to their jobs in New York and New England as soon as this morning, although workers in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania are still waiting for their local presidents to approve the contract. 
 The first task for Verizon will be to work down a backlog of telephone repair orders that has risen to 90,000 -- one-third more than normal -- since the strike began Aug. 6
Under the three-year contract agreement, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers secured numerous concessions from Verizon, which is the nation's largest provider of wireless and local telephone services, with 260,000 employees around the nation.
The unions secured a 12 percent wage increase, over three years, for a work force that was already one of the best paid in the telecommunications industry. The average hourly base pay for a customer service representative in New York, $26, would increase to $29.25 in the contract's third year, for example. And in a new-economy wrinkle, each of Verizon's union workers will receive a small grant of stock options.
But the broader significance of the agreement, and the reason the negotiations have been closely watched throughout the high-technology industry, involves issues that go beyond wage and benefit concerns.
The unions have won the right to more easily organize workers in Verizon's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of the division's 32,000 employees belong to a union. The unions also secured Verizon's promise that union telephone workers will be given the opportunity to do more work in fast-growing areas like the installation of high-speed Internet lines -- an activity for which Verizon has tended to use nonunion contractors until now.
Those were key points for the unions because wireless and Internet communications are growing much faster than the conventional telephone business.
"This contract is a breakthrough not just for our members who work at Verizon but for workers throughout the telecommunications industry," Larry Mancino, vice president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents about 72,000 of the striking employees, said yesterday .
The unions also secured agreements on several other issues that reflected worker anxieties in the new economy, which is characterized by big corporate mergers and an entrepreneurial ethic in which the shorthand "24/7" -- meaning 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- symbolizes the relentlessness of work in today's economy.
Verizon was created by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation and through the formation of a wireless venture with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain. And union employees, particularly in the Northeast, had been worried about the prospect of the company transferring work to lower-paying parts of the country.
The unions, especially customer service representatives, had also sought relief from job stress brought by long periods of work with few breaks and frequent mandatory overtime.
Verizon agreed to greater job stability for union members by limiting the number of employees whose jobs could be moved to a different region to 0.7 percent of the union workers in a given geographic area each year. The measurement would be based on a geographic area as small as a county, as the unions wanted, instead of an across-the-board number, as the company wanted.
On job-related stress, Verizon agreed to give customer service representatives and telephone operators up to five 30-minute periods each week during which they can do work other than taking calls. And mandatory overtime for customer service representatives and operators would be reduced. For example, operators who are single mothers will be limited to as few as 7.5 hours a week in some areas, down from as much as 20 hours before the strike.
Verizon (pronounced Vuh-RISE-en) was under various pressures to settle the strike, which the company had apparently expected to be only a token few-day walkout. It had come at the busiest time of the year for the consumer telecommunications industry, when many students were about to return to college and would require new telephone and Internet access service.
Shortly before the strike began, the company also started a major advertising campaign to make people aware of its new name. And lately, concern over the company's earnings have pushed Verizon's share price close to a two-year low. Since the strike began, Verizon's stock has fallen more than 10 percent. It closed at $42.4375 on Friday.
"We're glad to put this strike behind us and move on," the company's chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg, said yesterday in an interview. "I would say that every one of the unions' issues was legitimate going forward. We've strengthened the fiber of our company over the long term with this agreement."
What remains to be seen is how the agreement will be viewed elsewhere in labor circles, by other big telecommunications companies and by Wall Street.
"This is one of the most wide-reaching contract settlements the industry has seen," said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst of the telecommunications industry. "It'll be interesting to see whether this will result in a more qualified work force or a ball and chain around the company's leg."
The unions' right to organize Verizon's wireless division may end up as the strike's most significant outcome. The unions won an important concession allowing them to organize by card check, which permits a given work site to join a union if a majority of its employees sign cards saying they wish to do so. The process is faster and less bureaucratic than holding elections.
Under this part of the agreement, the employees at a work location would join the union if 55 percent signed up through the cards.
The wireless agreement applies only to workers in the strike region, where about one-quarter of the 32,000 employees of the Verizon Wireless division are located.
The agreement would include technicians, customer service representatives and employees who work as customer sales representatives in the wireless division's retail stores.
Making it easier to organize Verizon's wireless work force could have broad implications for the nation's wireless industry, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the new economy and which so far has remained a primarily nonunion business.
Of course, there is no certainty that the majority of workers in parts of Verizon Wireless that are not covered by the settlement or at other wireless companies -- or in other high-growth, high-technology industries, for that matter -- are eager to unionize.
But some union advocates are optimistic.
"For us, the parallel issues are glaringly apparent," said Marcus Courtney, co-founder of the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, a Seattle organization affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. The Washington Alliance has already organized a small number of employees at companies that include Microsoft and Amazon.com.
"This will make our efforts easier, because it shows that the largest company in a key high-tech industry is not off limits," Mr. Courtney said. "Now we can hold up this example that says, 'Your voice can be heard.' "
And as in the Verizon strike, the future of union organizing efforts in high-technology companies is not expected to focus on wages as much as on issues like job security, benefits, overtime, work-related stress and even stock options.
"The questions have been raised," said Stanley Aronowitz, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York who has studied labor issues. "In the 30's, no one took workers' complaints seriously until the G.M.'s and U.S. Steels were organized."
Already in the wireless industry, where Verizon will try to compete with other companies that are mostly nonunion, there are inklings that organizing can be viable.
At SBC Communications, which will soon operate the nation's second-largest wireless carrier in a venture with BellSouth, the same kind of card-check organizing Verizon has agreed to has been permitted for nearly three years. So far, more than 5,000 of SBC's wireless employees out of a potential 12,000 eligible are union members, the C.W.A. says.
And at AT&T Wireless, the third-largest wireless carrier, the union won the right last year to card-check organizing, although elections must be held several days after the cards are gathered -- a potential union impediment not included in the Verizon agreement.
 
THE AGREEMENT
Highlights of Contract
 
LENGTH OF CONTRACT -- Three years.
 
ORGANIZATION -- The unions will be able to organize more easily in Verizon's wireless division, and union members will have the opportunity to do more work in fast-growing areas like the installation of high-speed Internet service.

In addition, full-time employees will receive 100 stock options and part-time workers will receive 50. A profit-sharing plan tied to that of the chief executive will provide payouts up to $1,000 a year.
 
JOB STABILITY -- The number of Verizon employees who can have their jobs transferred to a different region as a result of the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger is limited to seven-tenths of 1 percent each year.
 
JOB STRESS -- Customer service representatives and operators will receive up to five 30-minute periods each week in which they can do work other than taking calls.

HEADLINE: For Incumbent Legislator in the South Bronx, a Primary Rematch

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY/32 Senate District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Few local political races are laced with the kind of unvarnished acrimony seen in a primary contest being waged in the 32nd Senate District in the South Bronx between an incumbent state senator who is one of the Democratic Party's most loyal soldiers and his predecessor, an ardent enemy of the party organization.
For the last four years, Pedro Espada Jr., who operates a large health care center in the Bronx, has been the principal thorn in the side of the Democratic Party organization in the borough. And Mr. Espada is now engaged in another primary battle to regain the seat he lost four years ago. 
 In doing so, he is taking on David Rosado, who acquiesced to the wishes of party leaders in 1996, when he resigned his City Council seat to run against Mr. Espada. That matchup was short-lived. Mr. Espada was removed from the ballot because of irregularities in his nominating petitions. In their last battle, in the 1998 Democratic primary, Mr. Rosado prevailed, but by just 745 votes, making his one of the narrowest victories in the state that year.
Mr. Espada, 46, is back this year in what has become a high-voltage battle filled with old grudges and bitterness. On any given day, residents in the district might run into the caravans of either of the competitors, with sound trucks blaring the names of the candidate. Posters for the candidates are in storefronts. And the candidates have been spending their mornings greeting voters at subway stations and their evenings in door-to-door campaigning throughout the district.
The Rosado campaign, for example, is operating telephone banks from three different locations. And Mr. Espada has opened three offices and has campaign workers deployed throughout the district, passing out campaign literature, T-shirts and campaign trinkets to get the attention of voters.
Mr. Rosado, 58, said the closeness of the 1998 primary was a reflection of his limited campaign activity that year. He said that he spent months suffering from a nerve disorder in his neck and that he had surgery for it before the primary. "But this year," he said, "I am out here working hard, campaigning every day and I am connecting with the people."
He defends his stewardship in the State Senate, saying he worked vigorously to create a bill, signed into law last month, that imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.
"I have a long record of working within the community," said Mr. Rosado, a former state assemblyman and city councilman. "I have worked on creating new housing for the people in the Bronx. I have helped people with landlord-tenant disputes. I have worked hard in the district and in Albany."
Mr. Espada, who served in the State Senate from 1992 to 1996, said he was running again because of his desire to expand economic opportunities for the residents of the district. He said he would work with the Republican majority in the Senate to bring job creation programs to the district and to increase the number of public housing units.
Assailing his opponent, Mr. Espada said: "David Rosado is not a leader. We are in one of the poorest districts in the state and Rosado is simply an instrument of the local political operation. Clubhouse politicians treat their positions as jobs. I see it as an opportunity to create new change for our community. He is an instrument of the Democratic machine."
The Espada family has had its share of tangles with that machine. The most dramatic came in 1996, when Mr. Espada was in the Senate and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, won a special election for an open Assembly seat. But later that year, after a feud, the Espadas broke with the Democratic organization, which resulted in Mr. Rosado running against the senator, and Ruben Diaz Jr. running against the son.
Furthermore, the party organization was then successful in having both Espadas thrown off the ballot after finding irregularities in their nominating petitions.
Since then, however, the Espadas have enjoyed at least something of a political comeback. In 1997, Pedro Gautier Espada was elected to the City Council in an embarrassing defeat for the Democratic organization. And a year later, Jose Espada, the former senator's brother, was elected a Democratic district leader.
The following year saw more difficulties for Pedro Espada Jr. He was arraigned with two of his employees on charges that they had illegally diverted $221,000 in Medicaid money to his failed 1996 re-election campaign and that of his son, the assemblyman. But Mr. Espada said the charges were politically motivated since they came just a few days after he announced that he would run. The case is still pending.
The current Espada campaign has become a family affair. His son, the councilman, is the campaign chairman, and another son, Alex, is working as the field director. But the Rosado campaign has also enlisted a high-profile campaign manager: Assemblyman Diaz. Mr. Diaz won his last election by a margin so wide that he is considered one of the borough's most popular politicians.
The 32nd Senate District sweeps through the southern tier of the Bronx, and includes the Crotona, Soundview, Clason Point and Mott Haven neighborhoods. In the 1990 census, the district was 61 percent Hispanic and 31 percent black. Non-Hispanic white residents accounted for about 5 percent of the district's population.
Many Bronx Democrats expect that this year's race in the district will be close. Both campaigns say they will spend about $150,000 on the campaign leading to the Sept. 12 primary. Mr. Rosado has the support of the Bronx Democratic organization, but Mr. Espada, who employs more than 300 full-time workers in the Bronx, said he would have hundreds of campaign workers at his disposal on Election Day.
Mr. Rosado predicts that because he is campaigning more vigorously, his victory will be more substantial this year and that winning by an overwhelming majority, as he hopes to, will likely mean an end to Mr. Espada's interest in running for the State Senate seat.
"I don't think he will run again if I win big," Mr. Rosado said. "That's why I'm working so hard."

HEADLINE: Tourism Flowing Upriver to the Hudson Valley

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: MILLBROOK, N.Y.

 BODY:
Like more and more tourists these days, Glynis and John Seale, an English couple who live on the edge of the Cotswolds, decided to venture off the well-trodden sidewalks of Manhattan and make their way up the Taconic Parkway to travel the quiet back roads to a vineyard here in the heart of the Hudson Valley.
It was not their first trip to the region, and between sips of chardonnay and pinot noir in the tasting room of the Millbrook Winery, the rows of vines in the afternoon sun visible through a Palladian window, they rhapsodized about the valley's attributes. "We're very keen on history, and we're interested in the links" to Winston Churchill and Great Britain, said Mrs. Seale, while her husband likened the countryside to "parts of Wales and Scotland." 
 Tourism officials say the Seales represent the new face of tourism in the Hudson Valley. After years of getting lost between the hyperkinesis of New York City and the tranquillity of New England, the Hudson Valley seems to have finally arrived. The amount of money spent on lodging has almost doubled in 10 years, and visitors no longer hail strictly from places like Delaware and New Jersey.
"A lot of the historic sites have guest books and we're seeing people from all over," said Susan H. Cayea, president of Hudson Valley Tourism, a state-financed group that three years ago began publishing its guides in four languages. "Some of us can track the origin of the person on our Internet sites, and on any given day, particularly on the Hudson Valley tourism site, you'll find Finland, Australia, Japan -- a wide variety of people."
Some 25 million people a year visit the Hudson Valley, according to official estimates, and their spending adds about $2.5 billion to the local economy. While it is hard to track the growth in tourism, hotel and bed-and-breakfast receipts in 1998 climbed to $301 million from $178 million a decade earlier. Studies indicate that foreign visitors make up a small percentage of the total, but anecdotal evidence suggests that their numbers are rising.
Some people in the tourism industry say more needs to be done before the Hudson Valley becomes a true international destination. They cite a shortage of hotels and inns, insufficient state money for promotion and a marketing strategy that they say pits counties against one another.
"The state gives each county money to promote itself, and that leaves a fragmented message," said Burns Patterson, a spokesman for Historic Hudson Valley, a nonprofit organization in Tarrytown that owns and operates historical sites. "Right now a visitor from Germany or Japan trying to get information about the Hudson Valley would have difficulty finding the right source for general information."
Officials at Hudson Valley Tourism say more money is needed for promotion, pointing out that their annual allotment from the state fell steadily after reaching a peak in 1988 and is only now rebounding. But they dispute that competition exists between counties, whose individual travel guides, they say, are a necessary supplement to the regionwide guide.
"It's 150 miles of river and if we were to put down every restaurant and every bed-and-breakfast and every site, you'd have the New York phone book, and nobody wants to lug that around on vacation," Ms. Cayea said.
Another potential problem for tourism is Gov. George E. Pataki's push to build power plants in the valley, which cultural organizations and environmental groups have criticized.
Winding through the verdant Hudson Highlands, the river is cleaner than it has been in years, a fact that many say has contributed to the valley's rebirth. Congress designated the Hudson Valley an American Heritage Area in 1996, while two years ago President Clinton named the Hudson an American Heritage River.
But even naysayers agree that a growing regional identity has crystallized, a crucial step.
Once a collection of counties north of New York City that shared a river and little else, the Hudson Valley has acquired a shared consciousness, much like the Napa Valley in California. Unlike the Napa Valley, which is defined mostly by wine and food, the Hudson Valley offers a varied landscape, drawing visitors for its scenic beauty, history, architecture, arts, antiques, food and wine.
Signs that the 10 counties between New York City and Albany have started to be seen as one include "The Hudson River Valley Cookbook," recently published by the chef Waldy Malouf, as well as a handful of coffee-table photography books and travel guides focused on the region. There is even a Hudson Valley board game modeled after Monopoly, called Hudson Valley in a Box.
"Suddenly, there's an identity," said Lynn Hazelwood, who until recently was editor of Hudson Valley Magazine. The magazine has grown since its inception in 1972 into a glossy monthly available at supermarkets as far south as Westchester County.
Foreign visitors say that while not all of their compatriots have heard of the Hudson Valley, certain attractions here were widely known back home. The Seales, for example, said many British were familiar with the Franklin D. Roosevelt historic site in Hyde Park. And a group of Chinese graduate students at the University of Chicago said at West Point that they were familiar with the United States Military Academy from movies like "Patton."
"West Point is very famous in China," said Bright Liu, 33, standing in the visitors center at the academy a day after he and his classmates had explored New York City.
The dozens of historical sites in the Hudson Valley are perhaps the biggest draw for tourists. West Point alone has an estimated three million visitors a year, with 750,000 people going through the visitors center, said Nils Anderson, a spokesman for the academy.
Among the many 19th-century homes overlooking the river and open to the public for tours are Olana, the home of the Hudson River School painter Frederic E. Church, and the opulent Vanderbilt Mansion.
A new Hudson River waterfront map, listing 300 sites and attractions on either side of the river, was published in the spring by Hudson Valley Tourism. "We printed 30,000 maps, thinking they would last us two years," Ms. Cayea said. "They lasted us a month."
A surge of interest greeted the 1994 opening of Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate outside Tarrytown, with an entire season's worth of tickets -- 50,000 -- selling out before opening day.
"We were caught off guard," said Mr. Patterson of Historic Hudson Valley, which runs the visitors program there. "It created a sensation overseas. It's just a very private, legendary family, and the fact that their home was opening was in some ways saying that their family story was going to be told for the first time."
Tourists also seem to want to take a piece of the past home. That may explain why once-faded industrial cities like Hudson, as well as little-known villages like Millbrook, have reinvented themselves as antique-and-boutique centers, joined by a half-dozen others, from Saugerties in Ulster County and Cold Spring in Putnam County to Tarrytown in Westchester County.
"It was a struggle 20 years ago -- a lot of the stores were empty," said Antonia Salvato, a dealer who owns the Millbrook Antiques Mall, which opened in 1979. She now represents 30 dealers and recently began to advertise in an English trade publication, The Antique Dealer Newspaper.
The ubiquity of antique shops is one of the reasons the Seales have returned to the Hudson Valley. "Antiques in the United Kingdom are very expensive, and it's hard to get bargains," Mr. Seale said. "Here, you think, 'My goodness me, that would be four or five times the price in England.' "
The Culinary Institute of America in Dutchess County, the nation's leading cooking school, had long put the region on the map in terms of food. But a number of restaurants that could go toque to toque with some of Manhattan's best have emerged in the last decade. Many make a point of relying on locally produced vegetables, meats, cheeses and wines, a trend reflected in some Manhattan restaurants like Mr. Malouf's Beacon.
There are signs, too, that the arts are establishing a significant presence in the Hudson Valley. Already, there is the Storm King Art Center, an outdoor sculpture museum on 500 acres in Mountainville, and the Bard Music Festival, now in its 11th season in Annandale-on-Hudson.
Next year, the Dia Center for the Arts, a $20 million space for the exhibition of large-scale works, is to open in an abandoned paperboard factory in Beacon. In 2002, Bard College plans to open a 100,000-square-foot performing arts center designed by Frank Gehry on its campus in Annandale-on-Hudson, for opera, dance and theater productions.
"It will absolutely solidify the Hudson Valley's reputation as a cultural destination," Mark Primoff, a spokesman for Bard College, said of the center.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the state recognized the importance of tourism in the Hudson Valley when it chose to highlight the region in television advertisements for the first time two years ago.
"There's a huge interest in cultural and historic sites," he said. "That's what a lot of families are interested in doing now. West Point is there, Hyde Park is there, and we think that the Hudson Valley has the best opportunity for growth because of its proximity to New York City."
But the growth in tourism could be hindered by the one thing the Hudson Valley does not seem to have enough of: beds.
"To truly become an international destination," said Mr. Patterson of Historic Hudson Valley, "you can't make people work so hard to find a room."

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: Nancy Padian;
Battling AIDS in Africa by Empowering Women

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Lounging in a high-floor room at the St. Francis Hotel, drinking coffee served in perfect porcelain cups, Dr. Nancy Padian was far from the sad, overcrowded streets of Harare, Zimbabwe, but they and their beleaguered people remained on her mind.
Dr. Padian, 48, an epidemiologist who is director of research for the AIDS Research Institute of the University of California at San Francisco, is one the world's foremost experts on the heterosexual transmission of AIDS. 
 For the past seven years, she has commuted between San Francisco and Harare -- some 10,000 miles -- to help Zimbabwean health workers gain some measure of control over the AIDS epidemic tearing through their nation in southern Africa. Their chief weapon against H.I.V. has been the barrier method of contraception, using devices like condoms.
"There's this zeal to find this new magic bullet," Dr. Padian said. "But there are all these existing methods with great potential and they are right under our noses and that haven't really been looked at. I'm hoping that what we do in Harare will help the women there and, frankly, here too."

Q.: You've racked up thousands of frequent flier miles between San Francisco and Zimbabwe. What exactly do you do there?
A.: I run a series of studies as part of a joint project between the University of Zimbabwe and the University of California, San Francisco. We examine the effect of contraception in preventing H.I.V. in Zimbabwean women. In Africa, AIDS is mainly heterosexually transmitted. So what we are looking at in a country where 25 to 30 percent of the population is infected with H.I.V. is whether different forms of contraception might increase or decrease the acquisition of H.I.V.
We see a population of women who come to regular family planning clinics in Harare. About 30 to 40 percent are infected. The rate is much higher, of course, for women in the sex industry. In the one study, we try to help uninfected women to get their male partners to use condoms. We've been able to persuade people to use condoms far more than we originally thought we could. In fact, we've been able to get more than half the women in this category to do this.
For those women who aren't successful at that, we try to encourage them to use female methods of contraception: female condoms, spermicides, diaphragms. We are also looking at whether or not women who are using hormonal contraceptives are at increased or decreased risk of H.I.V. This study has just begun, so we don't have any answers yet.
Q.: The assumption has been that women in Africa and elsewhere cannot convince men to use condoms. What are you doing differently?
A.: Some women can't. But for others, it's a question of teaching them negotiating strategies. We do role-playing. We present the women with obstacles and have them work out ways to overcome them. We encourage them to think it's O.K. to talk about sexual activity with their partners, that these discussions are part of a healthy lifestyle.
Q.: What makes women in southern Africa so much more vulnerable to AIDS than American women?
A.: There is a higher prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases there -- as well as a lack of male circumcision, which turns out to be a factor in the susceptibility of the man to AIDS. And you know, the rates of infection from parasites, poor nutrition, all contribute to the problem. In general, if a woman's immune system is compromised because of other infections and nutritional factors, that too increases susceptibility to H.I.V. once she's exposed.
There are some particular cultural factors, too. It is not uncommon also for African men to have multiple partners and still have their monogamous partner. The practice of "dry sex," which occurs in certain countries in southern Africa, almost certainly increases the susceptibility of women to H.I.V., if their partner is infected. Dry sex is when a woman uses a chemical or physical substance that she puts into herself to dry up the cervical and vaginal secretions in advance of having sex. Women sometimes engage in this practice because there's a belief that men prefer it.
Q.: The Colombian writer Silvana Paternostro claimed that the biggest AIDS risk factor for a woman in many Latin American countries was to be married. Is that true in southern Africa, too?
A.: I think that's true in Zimbabwe, where the infection rate is from 25 to 30 percent, and where the likelihood that a husband is infected is quite high. It's not a question of the woman having multiple partners. Unless they are sex workers, the women are generally monogamous.
Q.: To what extent do you think the power imbalance between African men and women contributes to the spread of AIDS?
A.: I think the gender imbalance is huge there and accounts for some of the transmission. One of the things I see as helping in preventing AIDS, are microloan programs for women's economic development. These are small loans to women to help them start businesses of their own. In order for women to really negotiate sexual activity, it's important for them to be economically empowered.
Q.: The president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, has issued some rather ambiguous statements on AIDS. He has raised doubts about whether H.I.V. causes AIDS, declared a need for an African solution to the epidemic and suggested that researchers should look at poverty as a root cause. Considering that the South African AIDS rate has increased 50 percent since his election, what do you believe he's thinking?
A.: I don't understand why he said it. I wondered whether he was confusing two issues. I completely agree that we need indigenous solutions to indigenous problems. You definitely can't export American models of behavior changes and expect to implement them in southern Africa. But to suggest that H.I.V. doesn't cause AIDS when all the evidence points to the contrary verges on being irresponsible. It delegitimizes prevention programs. Most prevention programs, after all, are geared at preventing someone from being exposed to H.I.V. And if H.I.V. is not the issue, then what are we doing?
Q.: Is President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe in similar denial?
A.: Denial may be too strong a word here. Mugabe has certainly not dealt strongly with the epidemic. He's not strongly supporting the national AIDS control program in promoting condoms. Whether that's denial or avoidance, it's a shame. Because your best chance of success is if you can engage the local leaders. If the government isn't behind it, it's much more difficult to have widespread effective programs throughout the country.
Q.: How do you deal, emotionally, with the high death rate you are witnessing in Harare?
A.: I find it unbelievable, overwhelming. Among my colleagues at the university, someone I am working with is always off to a funeral. It's unbelievable. But I feel like I'm doing something. And that keeps me going. What makes me angry is when people say that it's all sealed and that it's too late and that you can't do anything more. Because I feel like even if I do a little bit, it will make a difference.
Q.: How did the epidemiology of H.I.V. in women become your specialty?
A.: I was in graduate school here at Berkeley in the early 1980's. I had originally wanted to be a psychologist, but fell in love with epidemiology because it seemed to be a good way to help a lot of people -- rather than one person at a time.
My graduate adviser, Warren Winkelstein, had a grant to look at the natural history of AIDS. H.I.V. hadn't been discovered as the cause yet. So at that point, no graduate student was interested in working on this. I got the job as his assistant because there were no other takers. He suggested that I look into the female partners of bisexual infected men in the group he was studying. That's when I started getting involved in the heterosexual transmission of AIDS.
Of course, what we found was, at that time, that male-to-female sexual transmission was a lot more frequent than female to male, that risk factors for transmission were primarily not using condoms, anal intercourse and S.T.D.'s in either partner.
Q.: You are about to go to India to start an AIDS study there. How bad is the problem on the subcontinent?
A.: The infection rate isn't that high, but the absolute numbers of people who are infected is huge. Huge! Given the numbers, one can only guess that the epidemic exists at an early stage. And, of course, all of the gender issues that we talked about in Zimbabwe are acute there as well. The women have little say. What I'm discovering as I travel the world, is that for women, power is an absolute dimension of physical health. The bottom line, universally is, If you cannot negotiate what you are doing with your body, you will not be able to lead a healthy and long life.

HEADLINE: Loans to Buy AIDS Drugs Are Rejected By Africans

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The United States' offer of $1 billion in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa has been rejected by South Africa, one of the countries most devastated by the disease, health officials say. Namibia has also rejected the offer, and other nations in this stricken region are voicing serious reservations, the officials say.
South Africa, the nation with the largest number of people infected with the virus that causes AIDS, and Namibia said they needed affordable drugs, not loans that would burden their economies. 
 Officials at the Southern African Development Community, which represents 12 other countries in the region, along with South Africa and Namibia, are also expressing doubts about the proposal. They say they would prefer the United States pressure American drug companies to reduce prices and to support countries that are disregarding patents and producing generic drugs more cheaply.
"Members are already burdened by debt," said Dr. Thuthula Balfour, director of the health unit of the Southern African Development Community, in a telephone interview from Pretoria. "Making drugs affordable is the solution rather than offering loans that have interest."
The offer last month by the United States Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency financed by Congress, was made to 24 sub-Saharan countries. Bank officials said that none of the countries had formally accepted the offer so far. The officials, who emphasized that it was too early to assess interest in the program, said they were still educating eligible African nations about the program.
But even when the program was announced, officials acknowledged that some members of the Clinton administration had doubts about its benefits. The offer comes at a time when the West is seeking to forgive as much as $100 billion of the debt held by poor countries, hoping to free up scarce resources for health, education and other social programs in those nations.
Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank, said bank officials knew of South Africa's concerns. She said they understood these concerns and the hesitancy expressed by officials elsewhere.
"These are poor countries and should they be taking on more debt? That's a very valid question," she said in a telephone interview from Washington.
"We're just doing what we can, knowing it's a small part," Ms. Berry said. "We have not got anyone to sign on the line yet. But it's going to take a couple of months of working through these touchy details."
Third world nations have been pressuring the West and pharmaceutical companies to make costly anti-AIDS therapies more accessible. Earlier this year, Unaids, the United Nations agency dealing with AIDS, and five drug companies began negotiating steep drops in prices of the drugs for poor regions afflicted by the disease.
But some AIDS groups argue that the companies are lowering prices simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by poor countries desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have recently passed laws allowing such seizure; India, Bangladesh and Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.
In May, the Clinton administration angered the pharmaceutical industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would not interfere with African countries that violated American patent law to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.
In South Africa, where about four million people are infected with the virus that causes AIDS, health officials say such efforts, which support the production and distribution of generic drugs, are more useful than loan programs, said Nothemba Dlali, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Health.
Dr. Kalumbi Shangula, the permanent secretary for the Namibian Ministry of Health, agreed. He said his country simply could not afford the drugs. In the United States, an American patient might spend $12,000 a year or more on drug therapy, a price tag way out of reach for patients in poor African countries.
The Export-Import Bank offers loans to buy the drugs at commercial interest rates that now average about 7 percent. But health officials in Namibia are desperately searching for other ways to get drug therapy to their infected citizens, who make up an estimated 20 percent of that country's population.
"When you take loans, you are plunging the country deeply into debt," Dr. Shangula said. "We are actually looking for ways to acquire the anti-retroviral drugs to improve the quality of life of our people, but this does not offer the solution."

HEADLINE: Lynn Townsend, Ex-Chrysler Chief, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Lynn A. Townsend, a retired chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, died Thursday at Botsford Continuing Health Center in Farmington Hills, Mich. The cause of death was not disclosed. He was 81.
When Mr. Townsend retired in 1975, Chrysler was heavily in debt and incurring large losses as inflation and oil prices soared. Four years later, with the company on the brink of bankruptcy, Lee A. Iacocca took over. 
 Mr. Townsend, an accountant, joined Chrysler as controller in 1957. After becoming Chrysler's president in 1961, Mr. Townsend was credited with strengthening the ailing company by decreasing its overhead expenses, improving its cars and revamping its dealer system. One of his first moves was to lay off thousands of white-collar workers from Chrysler's overloaded payroll -- a move that prompted some employees to nickname him "the Brute."
Mr. Townsend's early plan worked. Each year brought improved financial results. And by 1968, Chrysler, which is now part of DaimlerChrysler A.G., had almost doubled its share of the domestic auto market.
But problems began again in 1969 when profits fell. Many observers attributed the decline to bad management decisions. They said that the tight operational controls that had made the company successful in the early 1960's had been relaxed with disastrous results.
Among the four largest American automakers, Chrysler appeared hardest hit by a recession in the 1970's. In 1974, the year before he retired, Mr. Townsend miscalculated the size of the auto market. Sales of new cars plunged and Chrysler was left with thousands of new cars and little cash to pay its bills. To get through, the company cut car prices and closed most of its plants for a month.
In April 1975, at Chrysler's annual meeting, investors and laid-off employees pummeled Mr. Townsend with questions and some asked him to resign.
He did so unexpectedly three months later at the age of 56, saying that he believed that the interests of the company would best be served by "an early and orderly transition of leadership to our younger executives."
He said he had reached his decision to retire on his own and that no one had pressured him to leave. He said that he had made up his mind years earlier that he would not serve until he was 65 because that would mean he would have dominated the company for a quarter of a century and "the impact of one man" would have been too great.
Mr. Townsend graduated from the University of Michigan in 1941 with a master's degree in business administration. Before he joined Chrysler, he worked as an accountant at Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, where he audited the books of the firm's major client, Chrysler.
During World War II, Mr. Townsend served as disbursing officer on the aircraft carrier Hornet in the Pacific.
He is survived by his wife, Ruth; three sons, James, Charles and Richard; and eight grandchildren.
Mr. Townsend made it a point to be home at 6:30 each night and rarely worked overtime. He told his children he had 180,000 people working for him so the job should get done.

A senior Clinton administration official said today that Congress was not likely to approve a landmark trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam this year. The official, Robert L. Mallett, said the administration had sent him to Hanoi to reassure Vietnamese officials, and to "keep the drumbeat going for economic reform."
Mr. Mallett, the deputy secretary of commerce, predicted that the deal, signed in Washington on July 13, would be approved by Congress eventually regardless of how many seats each party gains or loses -- or who wins the White House -- in November. Neither Republicans nor Democrats, he said, will seek to kill an agreement that has great potential benefits for both countries. 
 At the same time, Mr. Mallett said that carrying out the deal would be as arduous as the four years it took to hammer it out.
"There has been some talk about foot-dragging in Vietnam," said Mr. Mallett in an interview here during a stopover on his way to Hanoi. "If you're going to have foot-dragging, then their economy is not going to improve. Economic reform must be a front-burner issue for Vietnam."
Among the issues Mr. Mallett said he would raise with Vietnamese officials is the protection of intellectual property. Although Hanoi has passed laws protecting copyrights, he said it was not enforcing them adequately. He also plans to discuss labor conditions, which were not addressed in the trade deal but have been an issue because of Vietnam's reputation for sweatshop factories.
"They cannot expect to be a member of the group of trading nations and pretend that labor doesn't matter," he said.
Still, Mr. Mallett was sanguine about prospects for trade between the two countries. He said American exports to Vietnam could grow to between $800 million and $1 billion a year within two years of the deal's ratification. That compares with $291 million last year, and $4 million in 1993, the year before President Clinton lifted the trade embargo.
Under the agreement, Vietnam would gain improved access to American markets for its products, with the average tariff on Vietnamese goods falling to 3 percent from nearly 40 percent. In return, it would open itself to American banks, insurers and retailers, though on a somewhat slower timetable than in the recent trade agreement between China and the United States.
The long road the China trade bill is taking through Congress is one reason the Clinton administration is unlikely to push the Vietnam pact before the end of the year. With Congress facing a crowded calendar and an impending election, administration officials said the White House was pouring its resources into winning Senate approval of permanent normal trading relations with China.
Regardless of the delay, the Vietnamese government is already starting to carry out provisions of the agreement. Hanoi, for example, recently issued a license to the American International Group, a United States insurer, to sell life insurance. Under the deal, it does not have to admit wholly foreign-owned insurance companies for five years.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Bush Focuses on Education and Other 'Tough Problems'

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:

The Republican presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney began showing two new commercials in 21 states yesterday. One deals with Mr. Bush's education proposals and the other declares that now is the time to deal with "tough problems," such as Social Security, declining moral values and education.
 
PRODUCER Maverick Media for both 

'Education Agenda'
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Children running in a school hallway. Mr. Bush again. Then four quick cuts, showing alphabet blocks, children reading and other school scenes, followed by another scene of Mr. Bush from the convention.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: "Seven out of 10 fourth graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read a simple children's book. Millions are trapped in schools where violence is common and learning is rare." Announcer (as school scenes shift): "The Bush education agenda: Reform Head Start, focus on reading, restore local control, triple funding for character education, hold schools accountable for results." Mr. Bush: "Now is the time to teach all our children to read and renew the promise of America's public schools."
 
'Hard Things'
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush, in a sport shirt, talking to the camera. Then, as he discusses problems, pictures of a classroom, of elderly women singing around a piano with trophies on it, of a black woman and of a teenage girl in a shot that widens to include a teenage boy. Then Mr. Bush again.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: "This is a moment in history when we have a chance to focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say 'Our children can't read' or 'Social Security needs improving' or 'We have a budget surplus and a deficit in values.' But those are the right things to say. And the right way to make America better for everyone is to be bold and decisive, to unite instead of divide. Now is the time to do the hard things."
 
ACCURACY -- Aside from the assertion about reading levels in schools in the poorest neighborhoods, which is based on a federal Department of Education study, neither advertisement includes factual statements that could be either accurate or inaccurate. Mr. Bush has indeed made the education proposals that his commercial cites.
 
SCORE CARD -- The education commercial is intended to re-emphasize one of Mr. Bush's political strengths, the impression that he cares deeply about education, long a Democratic strong point. The "Hard Things" commercial is intended to underline an argument made in his acceptance speech that the Clinton administration squandered the opportunity presented by economic prosperity to solve major problems. And its call "to unite instead of divide" seeks to imply that the Gore campaign is divisive and negative. That was a Bush strength after the Republican convention, but a CBS News Poll released on Monday shows that more people now say Mr. Bush, not Mr. Gore, is spending more time on the attack.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE NEW PROPOSAL;
Spending More Where All Predecessors Urged Less

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Fifty years ago next month, on Sept. 23, 1950, President Harry S. Truman signed legislation to provide federal money to schools overcrowded by the children of federal workers and military personnel.
Every president since then has tried to abolish the program or at least cut it to the bone. And every one has failed. 
 They failed because every senator and most representatives in Congress have schools in their districts that receive money under the program, called impact aid, and have not been willing to let the program die.
Now comes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president. In a speech in Milwaukee today to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Mr. Bush proposed adding $310 million to the impact aid program, increasing the budget by more than a third.
"Our men and women in service put their lives on the line to defend our freedom," Mr. Bush said. "We have a special obligation to rebuild the schools that educate their children. As president, I will ensure that this obligation is met.
"This funding means that thousands of students who are dependents of military personnel and attend public schools located near or on military facilities around the country will learn in better school environments."
The justification for the program has always been that school districts need compensation because the children of federal workers and people who work on military bases attend public schools that are supported by property taxes, but the federal government does not pay local taxes.
That may have posed a burden in Truman's day. But for decades, budget experts have put the impact aid program in the same category as federal subsidies for the producers of honey and mohair: relics of the past that exist entirely because of pork barrel politics.
The consensus of authorities who have studied the matter is that parents who work for the federal government today more than pay their own way. Most of the parents nowadays live in the community, pay property taxes and state and local sales and income taxes, and contribute to the local economy by buying goods and services.
And military bases must be an economic boon to communities or they would not fight so hard to keep them when base-closings are threatened.
Thomas M. Corwin, the acting deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, said today that over the years, some presidential candidates have been more eager than others to do away with the program. But Mr. Corwin said he could not think of a single one before Governor Bush who proposed expanding it.

HEADLINE: Returning Luxury to Fifth Avenue

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
One bright afternoon last week, at the Prada store on Fifth Avenue, two young women who appeared to share the same parents and the same attitudes about highly elective surgery, passed a baby and platform shoes back and forth between them. With some fall shoes already sold out, they gave up and moved downstairs to the handbag section. "I have the Chanel, I have the Louis, I have the Gucci," said the redhead to the brunette, as a saleswoman showed them a burgundy bowling bag. "I want tan," said the redhead. "I need tan."
The two women seemed to defy the conventional thinking about just who the Fifth Avenue shopper is. First, as locals, they were in full command of the English language, and second, they were spending actual money in a place that displayed not a single Tweety Bird athletic sock. 
 While certain New Yorkers continue to lament the downscaling of the stretch of Fifth Avenue from Rockefeller Center to Grand Army Plaza -- its amusement-park feeling, the out-of-towners in their Easy Spirits -- it has become harder to argue that the blocks have been abandoned to the tastes of those eager to dine at Hooters.
On Sept. 4, Gucci will re-open on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street after an extensive 17-month remodeling, unveiling a new limestone facade, an interior by the architect William Sofield and 13,000 square feet of space in which to sell the label's $800 boots and chevron mink coats. In December, Louis Vuitton will open a 6,000-square-foot store, about the size of its Beverly Hills boutique on Rodeo Drive, one block north of Gucci. Both Bergdorf Goodman and Cartier are in the midst of overhauls. And Saks Fifth Avenue is undergoing a $100 million renovation that will add 40,000 square feet of sales space to the store's flagship, including an expanded fine jewelry section, when complete in 2005.
What all of this amounts to in the minds of some retailers and shoppers is that Fifth Avenue is reclaiming something of its resplendent past. In a symbolic shift, several months ago the Coca-Cola store on 55th Street -- the first of the avenue's theme stores, which opened in 1992 -- shut its doors for good. Its former space is occupied temporarily by Cartier while it spiffs up its longtime home, three blocks south at 52nd Street. "It's still a world-renowned shopping destination," Pat Malone, the president of Gucci America, said of Fifth Avenue. "You see the resurgence of luxury brands here."
Gucci, long a Fifth Avenue resident, briefly considered joining the luxury exodus to upper Madison Avenue before deciding to stay put. It is the sort of logic with which John Slavinsky, the senior vice president for stores of Louis Vuitton, would not argue. Mr. Slavinsky compared the company's decision to open a store on Fifth Avenue to its decision to move one in Paris from a quiet street to the more clamorous Champs-Elysees two years ago. Sales there increased about 50 percent, Mr. Slavinsky said.
"In my mind, Madison is where you put a third store," Mr. Slavinsky said. (Louis Vuitton put its first New York store in SoHo.) "We wanted to be in a place with a lot of people."
There is speculation in the commercial real-estate world that the Warner Brothers store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, a mighty symbol of Fifth Avenue as theme park, may move well before the expiration of its lease in five years. The speculation is driven by the fact that the theme-store business has been slackening (Warner has closed four stores in 18 months) and that the building housing its nine-story emporium was purchased in March by Allied Partners, a development firm. A representative of Allied, which could theoretically buy out the Warner Brothers lease, would not comment. A spokeswoman for Warner Brothers, when asked if there were plans to close the store, said, "Not that I'm aware of."
For some, Fifth Avenue started its descent toward lowbrow well before the theme stores ever arrived -- back in the late 1960's, 70's and 80's, when discreet stores like De Pinna and Peck & Peck stopped selling their establishment tweeds. Peck & Peck had opened on Fifth Avenue and 48th Street in 1907, pioneering upscale retailers' shift from the East 20's and 30's to what was then considered "upper" Fifth.
Beginning in the 90's, with the arrival of Barneys New York on the Upper East Side, the focus shifted again, this time to Madison Avenue above 61st Street, where rents in recent years have caught up to what they are on Fifth, about $600 a square foot, said Faith Hope Consolo, the vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a real-estate consulting company. The renewed interest in Fifth, Ms. Consolo said, has much to do with a heightened understanding among retailers of the modern shopper's habits, whether she is from Westport, Conn., or Dusseldorf. "There's no pure luxury anymore," Ms. Consolo said. "There's no pure shopper."
"Someone who shops at Chanel also shops at H&M," she said, referring to the inexpensive Swedish clothier drawing crowds on Fifth Avenue.
Ms. Consolo, who bids on store spaces for retail clients, makes it her business to know how well purveyors of expensive clothes do once they land on Fifth. The Prada store between 56th and 57th Streets on Fifth achieves sales four times greater per square foot than at Prada's Madison Avenue store, Ms. Consolo said. She said that when the men's clothier Ermenegildo Zegna opened on Fifth near 57th, it increased its wholesale business by about 70 percent.
In the view of Tom Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue Association, "the whole notion that Fifth turned down a mass path is overblown." As head of the association, a group of merchants and property owners, Mr. Cusick wouldn't be expected to say otherwise; but he does point out that while many spent the 90's whining about the end of a recherche Fifth Avenue, the decade saw the arrival of a fair number of high-end stores. Prada replaced a Doubleday bookstore on Fifth. Fendi took the place of a Hallmark card store.
Giulia Melucci, a publicist at Scribner, who was walking up Fifth not long ago, felt that merchants like the National Basketball Association had been gaining on the avenue until recently. "I walked past H&M," she said, "and I saw that big sign announcing a new Louis Vuitton across the street and I thought, 'What does it all mean?' It means that Fifth is a democracy, not purely elite, not purely crass."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Manager of Hedge Fund Fiasco Seeks to Repair His Reputation

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
John Meriwether is ready to apologize, but not ready to quit.
Two years ago, high-risk strategies drove his hedge fund empire, Long-Term Capital Management, to the brink of collapse and unsettled world financial markets. Now Mr. Meriwether, 52, is struggling to raise money for a new fund and making an attempt to repair his reputation by apologizing for failed strategies. In interviews appearing yesterday in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times, Mr. Meriwether conceded that his strategy had not worked. 
 "Our whole approach was fundamentally flawed," Mr. Meriwether was quoted as saying in The Journal. "I feel enormous remorse."
Eric Rosenfeld, one of Mr. Meriwether's past and current partners, said yesterday, "I wish we had recognized the faults."
When asked why they were speaking out now, Mr. Rosenfeld said: "Frankly, we thought it might be a good time to tell our story -- one that we have been telling a long time to investors. It's a point where everything has been taken care of with Long-Term and everyone paid off. Our new attitude is being more open."
The public contrition, after two years of mostly silence, comes a few weeks before the publication of a new book about Long-Term Capital by Roger Lowenstein, the journalist, titled "When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management" (Random House).
Long-Term Capital, with several Wall Street legends and two Nobel laureates among its advisers, had $7.5 billion in assets in 1997. But bets on the direction of global bond prices went against them, draining $4 billion from the fund in nine months in 1998.
The unraveling of Long-Term Capital came about in part because of Russia's default on its debt payments and by the fund's heavy use of leverage, or borrowed money, which accelerated its troubles. Ultimately, it took a consortium of 14 Wall Street firms to bail out the concern.
Mr. Lowenstein describes how Mr. Meriwether and his partners wrangled with the Wall Street firms trying to rescue Long-Term Capital and how the partners, "motivated by insatiable greed," ultimately lost the bulk of their personal fortunes.
Mr. Lowenstein's book follows another, by Nicholas Dunbar, "Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term Capital Management and the Legends Behind It" (John Willey & Sons) that came out earlier this year.
Robert Stavis, one of Mr. Meriwether's successors as head of Salomon Brother's arbitrage group and an investor in the fund, said, "It's been an interesting question why they haven't said anything for two years."
Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld, and several other partners, are operating as JWM Partners from Long-Term Capital's old offices in Greenwich, Conn. The Relative Value Opportunity Portfolio, as the new fund is called, is billed as a conservative version of the former fund.
Conservative, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. The fund's managers say they will use less leverage, borrowing about $10 for every $1 invested, as opposed to the nearly $30 to $1 leverage that Long-Term Capital sometimes reached. The new fund also aims for returns of 15 percent a year, half the 30 percent a year sought by Long-Term Capital.
The firm says it has raised $350 million to $400 million since its inception last December, well short of the $1 billion the partners would like. Institutional investors, some of them burned by Long-Term Capital, have largely stayed away.
"Unfortunately, he's the poster child for all that's perceived wrong with hedge funds -- volatility, risk, exposure," said Barry Colvin, chief operating officer for Tremont Advisors, a consulting firm for the hedge fund industry, referring to Mr. Meriwether. "This is a very hard allocation for anybody to make. If you're right, you're eking out 15 percent to 20 percent returns. If you're wrong, how stupid are you? There's a whole lot of downside."
Still, that Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld have raised several hundred million dollars at all is testament to either faith or folly. Many of the investors are former associates of Mr. Meriwether from the days when he ran the bond arbitrage group at Salomon Brothers, now a unit of Citigroup.
"I gave them real money because I believe in what they're doing," said Mr. Stavis, now a partner at the venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. He believes there might be more opportunity for their strategies now that other firms as well as Long-Term Capital have abandoned it. Basically, the new fund, like Long-Term Capital, makes sophisticated bets mostly on the convergence of the yields of similar bonds around the globe.
Mr. Rosenfeld said that the Long-Term Capital partners believed that they were well diversified because they were using different strategies in different markets around the world. But he added that they realized too late that "there was a thread that ran through all of these trades," namely, that during a market crisis too many investors fled from positions they viewed as illiquid, regardless of their relative value.
Clearly, there is still some confidence. JWM charges a higher fee than the normal 1 percent flat fee and 20 percent performance fee charged by most hedge funds. JWM, like Long-Term Capital, charges a 2 percent annual fee and a performance fee of 20 percent of profits. Since its beginning in December, the fund is up about 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Labor Accord Hits New-Economy Notes

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
From wage increases to greater pension benefits to less mandatory overtime, telecommunications union workers in 12 Eastern states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia appear to have been the victors in the strike that ended yesterday for more than half of the 86,000 workers who walked off their jobs 16 days ago.
What is more, the unions' agreement with Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, with 260,000 employees around the nation, touches many of the hot-button issues of the new economy -- including stock options, profit-sharing and the relentlessness of long workdays. 
 As the company tried to bring the remaining 40,000 or so strikers in several mid-Atlantic states into the fold yesterday, labor and management experts were marveling at a settlement that is generous by almost any measure.
"This is a huge victory for the unions because it shows what they can do in parts of the economy where they still have leverage," said Paul Osterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But I suppose it remains to be seen how this plays out in wireless organizing, the most tantalizing part of the agreement, because that's where unions have far less leverage."
To be sure, it was one matter for the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to go on strike against Verizon, a company formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. The strike involved workers in the union's stronghold -- the region formerly served by Bell Atlantic. But it is quite another task to begin organizing at the company's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of 32,000 employees around the country are unionized.
And yet the unions won concessions that should make it easier to try to recruit members at Verizon Wireless unit -- the issue at the heart of the strike. The unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America, are intent on organizing workers at the mobile-telephone company, which is operated in a venture with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain. Verizon Wireless is the nation's largest wireless carrier, with more than 25 million subscribers, and it is growing much faster than Verizon's conventional telephone services.
Analysts say it is too early to gauge how the union effort might play out with the wireless unit, where organizing is not expected to begin in earnest for six months or so. The union will no doubt be pointing to wage disparities between some workers -- like customer service representatives, who can make no more than $33,000 a year at Verizon Wireless, but as much as $44,400 for Verizon's union telephone company.
While the natural inclination of Wall Street is to associate union jobs with higher costs, some analysts say greater unionization could have a potentially positive impact in some parts of the company.
The unions, for example, won a concession from the company allowing their members to perform the entire installation of high-speed Internet access for customers who sign up for Verizon's Internet services. (Wholesale installations performed by Verizon under other companies' names would not necessarily be performed by union workers, according to a person involved in the talks.) Union members are expected to be able to complete the installation process in about a day, instead of the two days it can sometimes take when Verizon uses nonunion contractors to perform some of the tasks of each installation.
"A shorter installation cycle should quicken Verizon's deployment of access," said Joseph Bellace, an analyst at Jefferies & Company who covers companies providing high-speed Internet access. "It sort of surprises me that this hasn't happened sooner."
Verizon officials, too, sought to put a positive spin on the unions' new contract. "I'm thoroughly confident this will enhance our competitiveness," Lawrence T. Babbio, vice chairman of Verizon, said in an interview. "We've found ways to motivate our employees on a performance basis that will also reduce churn within the organization."
In another move that could speed Verizon's effort to transform itself into a nimble new-economy player, the company created a profit-sharing plan -- pegged to that of the chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg -- that would provide payouts of up to $1,000 a year per employee.
And adopting a benefit similar to the nonunion competitors that Verizon competes with in many parts of its business, the company will hand out a small number of stock options to union members in an effort to further interest them in Verizon's overall financial performance and efficiency. Full-time employees will receive a one-time grant of 100 stock options, while part-time employees will receive 50.
As union members absorb details of the agreement before meeting to vote on its approval over the next three weeks, the company and financial analysts mainly seem relieved that the strike is effectively over. Verizon said it had a backlog of some 78,000 repair orders, about 38,000 of these including people with no service at all and 40,000 with trouble like static on the line.
And there are an estimated backlog of 200,000 orders for new installations of service, which Verizon hopes to clear up in about a month. This estimate anticipates an increase in orders as students return to universities along the East Coast in coming weeks.
"No matter how good the agreement looks to the unions, Verizon nipped the real risk of the strike in the bud by ending it before it entered into September," said Courtney Quinn, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company.
Investors expressed mild optimism yesterday, bidding up Verizon's shares 69 cents yesterday, to a closing price of $42.81.
Of course, there is the lingering risk that the bargaining unit for the communications workers' union representing nearly 40,000 employees in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, could let the strike drag on in their states.
But people close to the talks yesterday said it was unlikely that those unions would not eventually sign on. The sticking points are apparently not over the main terms of the contract, but finer points involving pensions, job titles and mandatory overtime. "It's a question of putting the remaining pieces into the puzzle," said Jeff Miller, spokesman for the communications workers' union.

HEADLINE: U.N. READIES TEAM TO CHECK WEAPONS HELD BY THE IRAQIS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The United Nations has assembled a new team of arms inspectors that is ready to enter Iraq within weeks, raising the prospect of another confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over his weapons programs.
The creation of the new team comes more than two years after Mr. Hussein halted cooperation with a previous group of inspectors, provoking a diplomatic crisis that culminated in four nights of American and British airstrikes in December 1998. 
 Iraq has repeatedly said it will not cooperate with the new weapons commission, which the Security Council ordered nine months ago in the hope that it would resolve some objections the Iraqis, as well as the Russians and French, had about the previous commission.
One of the chief Iraqi complaints about the previous commission, headed by Richard Butler, an Australian arms control expert, was that there were too many inspectors from the United States and Britain, who the Iraqis asserted were really spies.
The new team, with members from 19 countries, is meant to be more accountable to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan. All the members work directly for the United Nations, not for their own countries as before.
This week, Hans Blix, the leader of the new team, is to discuss the need for access to Iraq with a panel of international weapons experts who serve as the commission's directors. By Sept. 1 he is expected to report to the Security Council that the inspectors are ready to begin work and, barring a change in Iraq's position, to report that the Iraqis continued to reject new inspections.
But it remains far from clear what the United States or other members of the Security Council will do if Iraq refuses to cooperate.
It is also not clear how forcefully the council will push the new inspections, especially since its 15 members are sharply divided over Iraq and the broad economic sanctions imposed on it. Their positions are not likely to become clear until debates in the council begin sometime in September.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They are to remain in place until Iraq is certified as free of prohibited weapons -- chemical, biological and nuclear arms as well as long-range missiles. Last December the Security Council said it would suspend the sanctions if Iraq cooperated with the new team of arms inspectors.
Refusal by Mr. Hussein would leave the council no alternative to keeping the sanctions in place. It is unlikely that the council would call for the use of force, but in previous confrontations the United States and Britain have argued that existing resolutions authorize military action.
A confrontation would focus new attention on the Clinton administration's policy toward Iraq in the middle of the presidential election. That policy has come under sharp attack from Republicans and even some Democrats in Washington, who complain that President Clinton has not acted forcefully enough to force Mr. Hussein's government to accept the inspections.
If Mr. Hussein refuses to cooperate, the administration will be under political pressure to act forcefully. If the Iraqi leader reverses course, Mr. Clinton's successor could be confronted with the politically difficult decision of whether to go along with a suspension of sanctions.
Diplomats and other officials at the United Nations said they believed that during this year's election campaign, the Clinton administration is not likely to press for strong action, even if Iraq remains defiant.
But a senior administration official said the Iraqis or anyone else would be foolish to assume that. Although the administration has not indicated how it would answer new Iraqi defiance, the official refused to rule out the possibility of an "October surprise" of American military action at the height of a campaign, should the Iraqis provoke it.
"They will be making a severe mistake if they think an election campaign will affect how we carry out our foreign policy," the official said.
In Washington, administration officials said they would insist that Iraq comply with the resolution that created Dr. Blix's team or face an indefinite extension of sanctions.
"It's a mandatory resolution," Thomas R. Pickering, an under secretary of state, said in a telephone interview. "If the Iraqis don't comply, the sanctions will stay in place."
Under the resolution that created Dr. Blix's team, those sanctions can be suspended six months after the Iraqis fulfill a list of key requirements set by the inspectors and, ultimately, be lifted once the inspectors conclude that Iraq has come clean and dismantled its prohibited weapons programs.
The previous commission had a more comprehensive standard for declaring Iraq free of weapons before sanctions could be lifted, offering no interim steps like a suspension.
The new inspection organization is officially known as the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. Dr. Blix, a Swedish arms control expert, previously served as director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.
This month, he completed recruiting and training the 44 inspectors from countries friendly and not so friendly to the Iraqis.
Dr. Blix said his first step would be to find out what had happened to several hundred sites inspected by the last commission in 1998, a process that could take at least several months.
The Iraqis have said they believe that the United States would never agree to a suspension of sanctions but would instead find another reason to keep them in place, making cooperation, in their view, fruitless.
Administration officials have long argued that resuming inspections in Iraq -- rather than resorting to force -- is the most effective way to combat Mr. Hussein's efforts to hold on to nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, as well as long-range missiles that could deliver them.
But within the Pentagon and the American intelligence agencies, there is growing concern that Mr. Hussein has used the prolonged absence of inspectors to continue those efforts. The Central Intelligence Agency sent a report to Congress this month warning that Iraq had already rebuilt missile and chemical weapons factories since the airstrikes in 1998.
The issue of inspections is only one area in which the international standoff with Mr. Hussein appears headed for a new period of confrontation, a decade after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to the Persian Gulf war.
In recent weeks Mr. Hussein has taken steps to ease his diplomatic isolation, receiving a visit from President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. A thriving black market is reportedly eroding the sanctions, while Russia, supported by China, is challenging the American and British patrols of the "no flight" zones in northern and southern Iraq, which were established to protect Kurds and Shiite Muslims from Mr. Hussein's government.
In the face of these challenges, diplomats at the United Nations and even some American officials say, the administration's policy has been left to drift. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, has not involved himself in the issue. Mr. Holbrooke says he has been too busy on other matters.
"There's no doubt things are on autopilot," said one official in Washington. "And it might be an autopilot with a 10-degree downward tilt."
Several diplomats, including some from nations on the Security Council, said the administration had undermined its influence by openly calling for the removal of Mr. Hussein from power. That has given the Iraqis an excuse for dismissing the council's pledge to suspend sanctions if Mr. Hussein cooperates with new inspectors, the diplomats said.
The administration may find itself even further isolated on the council, since three countries supportive of the United States and Britain -- Argentina, Canada and the Netherlands -- will be among the five countries relinquishing their rotating council seats.
Administration officials say they have succeeded in containing Iraq by enforcing the sanctions and continuing to enforce the "no flight" zones despite repeated Iraqi provocations that have resulted in hundreds of limited retaliatory airstrikes since 1998.
When American and British warplanes and missiles launched a much larger attack 20 months ago, administration officials acknowledged that the attack would make it difficult to resume weapons inspections. But they argued that with Mr. Hussein refusing to cooperate, there was no other way to prevent Iraq from acquiring chemical or biological weapons.
"Mark my words," President Clinton said of Mr. Hussein at the time, "he will develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them. Because we're acting today, it is less likely that we will face these dangers in the future."
At the time, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and others also warned that the United States was prepared to use force again if there was evidence that Iraq had resumed its chemical or biological weapons programs -- or if Iraq threatened its neighbors or attacked the Kurds in the north.
James M. Bodner, the principal deputy under secretary of defense for policy and a longtime aide to Mr. Cohen, said in an interview that the United States remained ready to respond if Iraq crossed any of those "red lines."
Administration officials said they had no concrete evidence that Iraq had restarted its weapons programs. But in addition to repairing the damage done in 1998, Iraq has resumed testing its shorter-range missiles. Officials fear that those tests, while not prohibited under the United Nations resolutions, have allowed Iraq to perfect longer-range missiles.
Despite that, the administration's warnings about Iraq's weapons have lost much of their urgency. In the fall of 1997, Mr. Cohen held up a bag of sugar on television and ominously warned that an equivalent amount of anthrax bacteria, which Iraq is believed to possess, could destroy half the population of Washington.
In recent months administration officials have made no such dire warnings, even though there have been no effective inspections in two years. At the same time, Americans have done little publicly to press Dr. Blix to accelerate the formation of his inspection team, which has proceeded slowly.
He began interviewing weapons experts in May, and those selected have completed a four-week training program. Dr. Blix said there are signs that Iraq is thinking over its next moves.
The Iraqis recently presented a legalistic analysis of the new inspection plan to governments of Islamic nations meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The memorandum suggests that the Iraqis still nurture hopes that the resolution creating the inspection commission can be rewritten. Russia has already called for changes, but United Nations and American officials have adamantly ruled that out.
Some diplomats say that Iraq may have calculated that it can bide its time, hoping for a better deal. Others say Mr. Hussein will stop short of any actions that would invite American retaliation, while trying to build support for an unconditional lifting of the sanctions.
"Right now, he thinks things are going his way," a Defense Department official said. "He's outlasted the Clinton administration. He outlasted the Bush administration. I think his perception is he can outlast them all."

HEADLINE: Deregulation and Weather Fail to Cool Electric Rates

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Millions of Consolidated Edison customers got a rude shock last month when they discovered that even though this was one of the coolest summers in memory, their electricity bills had increased by an average of 43 percent over last summer.
That raised two questions: How could electric prices show such a big jump over last summer, when temperatures were soaring and air-conditioners ran nonstop? And why didn't the recent state deregulation of electricity usher in a new era of lower prices? 
 Some critics are blaming the State Public Service Commission, the agency that regulates the utilities. They say it adopted policies that hurt Con Ed customers in order to spur them to shop for new suppliers, thereby pumping up its deregulation program.
Maureen O. Helmer, the chairwoman of the commission, acknowledges that the two-year-old deregulation effort has been slow to have much effect, but denies the contention that the commission deliberately tried to jump-start it this summer.
Ms. Helmer conceded, however, that higher Con Ed bills were likely to encourage the public to seek better rates from other companies.
"In the long run," she said, "consumers are going to have to see what the real prices of energy are if they're going to respond to competition. There can be positive benefits by having people see what their electric rates are over time."
And some relief is already in sight, Ms. Helmer said. She said that Con Ed bills sent out in August would increase an average of only 8 percent over the same month last year and that the average bill in September was expected to be slightly lower than it was in 1999.
Under deregulation, Con Ed was required to sell most of its power plants and customers were permitted to buy their electricity from private, unregulated companies instead of being forced to buy it from Con Ed. No matter which company supplies the electricity, however, Con Ed continues to deliver it through its wires. Eighteen companies now offer electricity to Con Ed customers, but only nine of them will accept residential customers.
Customers have virtually ignored the chance to switch suppliers, however. In June, the latest month for which figures are available, only 118,000 (or 2.2 percent) of the state's 5.5 million residential electricity customers had made a change, along with 36,000 (4.8 percent) of the state's 754,000 business and other nonresidential customers.
Of Con Ed's 3.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester, only 42,028 residential users and 13,124 business users had signed on with a new electricity supplier by June. For the most part, the competing companies have made little effort to seek new residential customers, preferring instead to sign up large business accounts.
One customer disappointed that deregulation did not lower prices is Alan B. Hochman, who runs a small business out of his home in Croton-on-Hudson. He buys electricity from Robison Energy in Elmsford, and his July bill from Robison was nearly double last year's, although he used only slightly more electricity this year. Daniel P. Singer, a Robison vice president, blamed generation and transmission costs for the increase and said Mr. Hochman would not save money by returning to Con Ed.
But according to Wattage Monitor, a privately operated company that offers rate comparisons on its Web site (www.wattagemonitor.com), Mr. Hochman would save with Con Ed, which is now offering a better rate than his other choices.
Although deregulation began in 1998, most customers are probably unaware that they can choose a supplier, and few of the independent companies seem eager to enlighten them. Con Ed's own unregulated subsidiary, Con Edison Solutions, for example, has done no recent advertising and is focusing its marketing efforts on large businesses, said Gail S. Workman, a company spokeswoman. Con Edison Solutions will also analyze the energy uses of its business customers to promote greater efficiency, but does not offer that service to residential customers.
In April, the regulatory commission authorized Con Ed to pass along to users its cost of buying electricity on the new spot market. By contrast, upstate utilities, including New York State Electric & Gas, which covers parts of northern Westchester County and Putnam County, provide energy to residential customers at fixed prices that do not fluctuate with spot market prices.
The commission's critics say that by eliminating Con Ed's risk when buying electricity on short notice (and shifting that risk to its customers) the commission gave the utility little incentive to try to make long-term deals with suppliers that could result in lower prices. Con Ed is allowed to recover part of the savings it gets when it makes such deals and buys electricity at below-market prices, but it can also lose money if it makes the wrong prediction and gets stuck with electricity that costs more than the market price.
Con Ed officials say they have been forced to buy on the spot market because a shortage of power plants has meant that the long-term deals needed to meet the surging demand have not been available.
"We're always shopping for the best deal for our customers," said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for the utility. "That's our primary objective. It doesn't help us if they're having a hard time meeting their needs." Last week, Con Ed said it would seek permission from the commission to ease this summer's increases by eliminating late payment charges on bills issued from July 3 to Aug. 30.
The new system allowing Con Ed to base its rates on the wholesale market cost of electricity took effect on May 1 despite objections from New York City officials. They warned that it would be "substantially more volatile" than the existing system and asked that the change be delayed until Nov. 1, according to commission documents. Con Ed itself had asked earlier for a six-month delay, saying it was not ready to put a new system in place.
Ms. Helmer said postponing the changeover would not have resulted in lower Con Ed bills. "There was no reason to delay it," she said.
Fulfilling the city officials' prediction, prices on the spot market soared this summer. Electricity that cost an average of $50 a megawatt hour last year shot up as high as $1,300 an hour (until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed a cap of $1,000 an hour). Ms. Helmer blamed rising gas and oil prices and the temporary closing of Con Ed's Indian Point 2 nuclear plant for most of the increase. But the commission is also concerned about possible software and design glitches in the market, as well as the possibility that prices have been artificially inflated.
On Aug. 14, the State Public Service Commission ordered the New York Independent System Operator, which runs the spot market, to open up its records and data to help regulators determine why the spot market had been so volatile. "Prices on June 26 were quite high," the commission said in its order, "whereas on June 27, they were markedly lower despite similar load levels."
Gerald A. Norlander, the executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, a state-financed advocacy group that represents low-income residents, said the commission wanted to nudge competition along but never expected bills to rise by more than 40 percent.
"They wanted a controlled burn," Mr. Norlander said. "And it got out of hand."

HEADLINE: Newark Ex-Mayor Pleads Poverty and Not Guilty in U.S. Case

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Kenneth A. Gibson, who was Newark's mayor for 16 years, pleaded not guilty today at his arraignment on federal fraud and bribery charges -- and then pleaded poverty, asking the court to pay for his current defense lawyer.
Mr. Gibson, who in 1970 became the first black to be elected mayor of a major Northeastern city, is charged along with two business associates with defrauding the Irvington Board of Education between 1991 and 1995, when his engineering firm was construction manager of a $50 million school rehabilitation and construction project. 
 Mr. Gibson's lawyer of four years, Cathy Fleming, said today in United States District Court here that he had insufficient income and assets to pay her to represent him. His personal property holdings could not finance the expense of a complex and long federal trial, she said, and many of his business holdings in partnership with others were tied up because of nearly $1 million in other court judgments.
Ralph J. Marra Jr., the assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, opposed both Ms. Fleming's request for court-financed representation and her request to continue as Mr. Gibson's lawyer. Mr. Marra said he believed that Mr. Gibson's assets made him ineligible for taxpayer assistance and that the federal law providing such assistance was not intended to let a defendant pick his own lawyer.
Judge William G. Bassler asked both sides to submit detailed arguments and said he would rule on the defense requests at a hearing on Sept. 6.
Mr. Gibson, 68, whose indictment on the charges was unsealed on July 24, was allowed to remain free on a $300,000 personal recognizance bond. Also pleading not guilty and released on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond were his co-defendants, Camille Savoca, 53, vice president of the engineering consulting firm, Gibson Associates, and William Bernowich, 53, an employee.
It is not unusual, even in high-profile cases involving public officials, for the court to appoint and pay for a defense lawyer when the defendant is unable to pay. It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for a defendant to keep the same private lawyer he had before seeking court assistance.
Ms. Fleming, an experienced defense lawyer who once was a chief in the special prosecutions unit of the United States attorney in New Jersey -- the unit prosecuting this case -- said that in appointing her, the court would get "competent counsel with a good familiarity with the case."
"This saves taxpayers money because the learning curve is eliminated," she said after today's arraignment. "Plus, I suspect others would tell you that it is a matter of some sensitivity that a public figure like Ken Gibson ought to have someone representing him who is familiar with the case."
Ms. Fleming is on the panel of lawyers that federal judges draw from to provide court-financed representation to defendants who cannot otherwise afford to pay a lawyer. Under the court program those lawyers receive a maximum of $75 an hour. Ms. Fleming's normal fee is $425 an hour. She said she nevertheless felt "strongly about representing someone who did an awful lot for American politics."
Mr. Marra said that Mr. Gibson did not meet the economic criteria for such court-financed representation and that he expected to show that by submitting detailed appraisals of two pieces of Newark property that the former mayor owns. He also said the value of the business properties that were the subject of the court judgments would more than cover those judgments.
Mr. Marra, in seeking successfully to attach conditions to Mr. Gibson's bail, asked the court to prohibit him from trying to make contact with or approach the property of an unnamed cooperating witness in the case. In court papers, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents working on the case said that as recently as June, when it became known that the witness was cooperating, a relative of the witness saw Mr. Gibson circling the block around the family's home four times.
Ms. Fleming denied that her client had done such a thing, calling the assertion "ridiculous." She said Mr. Gibson and the witness lived within three blocks of each other, perhaps explaining why Mr. Gibson may have been seen so often.

HEADLINE: A Hollow Lesson

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
If a phone circuit goes dead and no one is on the line, does it really stop carrying sound?
In many ways, a similar question could be asked about the effective end to the strike against Verizon Communications. While the strike is important for Verizon, the walkout and Sunday's agreement with two-thirds of the union membership on strike probably will not have much bearing on the rest of the telecommunications industry. Even for consumers, the strike's effect can fairly be described as only minimal. 
 As for Verizon itself, the company will continue to be penalized to the tune of billions of dollars of market value for the strength of its unions.
When auto workers go on strike, cars stop rolling off assembly lines. When pilots go on strike, planes stop flying. But when phone workers go on strike, life pretty much goes on.
That is because modern networks are largely automated. Incidents of vandalism cut service to a few thousand customers here and there. Two striking workers who were nearly electrocuted were accused of trying to slice a phone line on Long Island last week. But in a backhanded testament to the power of the machines, those figures paled beside the hundreds of thousands of Verizon customers who lost long-distance phone service last week when an obscure piece of equipment failed in New Jersey.
By Sunday, Verizon, the company created by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE, had a backlog of about 92,000 outstanding requests for repairs. That figure was perhaps twice normal, implying that about 46,000 of Verizon's 25 million customers in the strike region were having problems they would not have otherwise had.
That works out to fewer than 2 of every 1,000 customers. Of course, for each of those customers one problem was one too many, and those figures do not include the thousands of people who were stymied in attempts to sign up for or change phone service.
Verizon's success in serving almost all of its customers during the strike does not mean that people are unimportant in modern communications. Without the thousands of managers that filled in for the strikers, the extent of the service failures would have been far greater. A network as extensive as Verizon's requires extensive maintenance, and that requires many people.
Largely, however, lower-level employees are needed because customers want to talk to people. Most customers do not want to sign up for new phone service online. Customers with billing questions want a person on the line right now -- not an e-mail response tomorrow.
During the strike, Verizon's directory assistance was largely disabled because the people who answer calls were on picket lines. If voice-recognition software is ever ready for prime time, Verizon will surely prefer to lay off thousands of operators. But while Verizon's unions would certainly block such a move, consumers would probably complain, too. During the strike many consumers have borne the inconvenience of using a phone book, the mark of an old economy if ever there was one.
In the big scheme of things, the effect on consumers of the strike and its partial settlement was and will be quite small. And much the same could be said of the deal's effect on the rest of the industry, even though the unions appeared to win almost everything they had asked for.
For one thing, while the wrangling over the unionization of Verizon's wireless unit was viewed as a referendum on unions' power in newer industries, the deal that was reached in the end was not all that different from those already in place at some other major wireless operators.
"In terms of wireless, it seems as though what they're talking about in terms of union organizing might be similar to AT&T," said Burke Stinson, an AT&T spokesman.
Eric W. Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, even ventured that his company had made a better wireless deal than had SBC Communications, the No. 2 local phone company after Verizon. "The wireless deal that we made, from the union point of view, is more restrictive than the deal SBC already had in place," he said.
The expedited organizing that Verizon agreed to covers only a quarter of the wireless unit employees.
In any case, the main reason the Verizon deal is not a harbinger for the rest of the industry is that Verizon's unions are stronger -- perhaps a lot stronger -- than those at any other phone company in the nation, largely because of Verizon's Northeastern geography.
"I think that Verizon has the toughest unions, so it's very difficult to extrapolate from what happens here to the rest of the industry because Verizon is in a pretty unique position," said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber.
BellSouth, Qwest, SBC, Sprint and WorldCom declined to comment on the settlement.
The other companies have nothing to gain by becoming involved in what would be considered a debacle for most of them. The fact is that under Sunday's deal, with its limits on overtime and its limits on job movements, Verizon ultimately has less control over its own business than does just about any big communications carrier.
"The most important thing is the pace at which they can adapt to change in the industry and innovate and capitalize on the new growth opportunities," Mr. Strumingher said. "If the Bells didn't have unions, it's worth a lot."
This month, just as the strike was starting, Verizon announced new projections for its future revenue and earnings growth. Mr. Rabe said the strike and the new deal would not alter those projections.
But unionization nonetheless carries a big price on Wall Street.
The price of a stock is often calculated in terms of a multiple of the company's expected per-share earnings. For instance, Verizon's shares closed at about $42.81 yesterday, up about 69 cents, meaning that they are worth 14.63 times the company's expected per-share earnings of about $2.93 this year.
Yesterday, Mr. Strumingher said unionization was probably costing all of the Bell companies "at least five" multiple points. If Verizon's stock were trading at an earnings multiple of 19.63 rather than 14.63, each share would be worth $57.44. Over all, Verizon would have a market value of about $156 billion, not the $116 billion it currently has.
All else being equal, Verizon's earnings multiple probably suffers "a couple of points" relative even to SBC or BellSouth, said Mr. Strumingher, because of its strong unions and the presumed drop in productivity they cause. Just two points of earnings multiple costs it about $16 billion in market value.
None of this will come as a surprise to Verizon's senior management. They know it all too well. Now, there is nothing they can do about it.

HEADLINE: In Reverse, California Acts To Cap Some Electric Bills

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 21

 BODY:
With electricity rates doubling or tripling for some consumers in San Diego, the California Public Utility Commission took a step back from the recent deregulation of the market today and narrowly voted to cap electric bills for some residential and business customers in that city.
The arrangement, a compromise, left many people still unhappy, and several experts said further regulations might be needed because of what some have described as price gouging in the wholesale electricity market and a system that leaped toward deregulation before sufficient supplies were available. 
 Today's decision, on a vote of 3 to 2, would reduce rates for many residents of San Diego by about 43 percent, assuring that customers who keep their consumption below certain caps would pay no more than $68 a month through the end of the year. San Diego was the first big market in California to be deregulated because its principal gas and electric utilities merged earlier to form Sempra Energy.
Loretta Lynch, the president of the commission and an opponent of the decision today, explained that the price caps would apply only to individuals who use 500 kilowatts or less a month or from 60 percent to 70 percent of customers in the city. Customers who use more than that will be charged the higher rates in the unregulated market, she said. The decision also applies only to small-business customers, those that use 1,500 kilowatts a month or less.
San Diego's mayor, Susan Golding, said one of her biggest concerns was that the plan left important users, including public schools and hospitals, at the mercy of a market that has seen prices skyrocket. Ms. Golding said that while she generally favored deregulation, it was ill-considered because the supply was clearly inadequate to meet demand, particularly at a time when the economy was booming.
"But even if demand weren't so strong, we still would be in incredibly bad shape," Ms. Golding said.
San Diego's utility welcomed today's step as a temporary measure that would be required only until new power plants come into operation, perhaps in three years or so.
"The impact of deregulation on San Diego has been just awful," said Steve Baum, the chairman of Sempra Energy, which owns San Diego Gas and Electric. "This step as a smoothing mechanism has been very helpful."
The deregulation of the $20 billion electrical power industry in the state resulted from passage of a 1996 law. But the state has suffered power shortages that led rolling "brownouts" in the San Francisco Bay area in June, in addition to the price increases in San Diego.
The average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was $117 per megawatt hour, up from $25 per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year, The Associated Press quoted a member of the utilities commission, Carl Wood, as saying.
This was not the first time that the commission had retreated slightly from its earlier decision to deregulate rates in San Diego, but it was seen as a larger move than in the past. It was also characterized as a possible prelude to more restrictions because of the soaring rates and concerns that inadequate supplies have thwarted this experiment in allowing market forces to determine prices.
Ms. Lynch said that an investigation was under way into why wholesale rates had soared and that the results of that inquiry might be used to establish other restrictions, at least until significant new supplies of electricity were built.
Gov. Gray Davis said he supported a competing proposal that would have provided a broader price cap, but which was defeated in a commission vote today.
Nevertheless, Mr. Davis said, "the action taken today by the P.U.C. is clearly a step forward."
Mr. Davis, a Democrat, also called for a thorough investigation of the wholesale market by the federal government, and added that he put most of the blame for the problems on price gouging by out-of-state suppliers of electricity.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RALLYING CRY;
'Working Families' Becomes a Theme Meant to Attract Female Voters

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The phrase is suddenly everywhere. In his acceptance speech last Thursday, Vice President Al Gore mentioned "working families" nine times. Party officials told other speakers to use the phrase, and they did, over and over. Now the Gore campaign is printing up signs with it and repeating it time and again on the road.
"In the name of all the working families who are the strength and soul of America, I accept your nomination for president of the United States," Mr. Gore declared halfway through his 52-minute speech in Los Angeles. 
 "It's about fighting for working families!" Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said earlier in the night.
"Imagine how strong we're going to be when we help our working families with affordable college educations and affordable health care," said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo.
While Democrats have been speaking to "working families" for years, the Gore campaign has recently latched on to the theme as a way of appealing to women. But unlike the pitch in the last two elections, directed to Volvo-driving suburban "soccer moms," Mr. Gore's appeal this time is to the "waitress mom," the working woman who not only juggles family and a job but also looks to the government for help in meeting the needs of her family.
So as his campaign has steamed through the populist heartland in recent days, Mr. Gore has talked less about gun control and abortion rights, topics more likely to appeal to the more affluent "soccer moms" and more about bread-and-butter economic issues like adding a benefit to Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and shoring up Social Security.
Mr. Gore, the son of a populist Southern senator, used the "working families" phrase in his 1988 campaign for president. And it became popular among Democrats after the Republicans swept the Congress in 1994, and the party of the little guy needed to regroup its base.
But when Mr. Gore formally began his campaign more than a year ago, he seemed more focused on busy, relatively upscale suburban parents who were snagged in traffic jams and could say good night to their children only by cell phone.
Mr. Gore tried out the concept of "working families" late last year with the slogan "Change that works for working families." It was noticeable for its double-barreled emphasis on work.
But by that time, the threat from former Senator Bill Bradley was growing and the theme did not reflect what Mr. Gore was saying on the campaign trail. Besides, it was too clunky. The slogan, along with others like "practical idealism," vanished as quickly as it appeared, as Mr. Gore slipped more naturally into combat mode with the phrase "Stay and fight!"
Then about two months ago, as Mr. Gore began drafting his speech for the convention, the phrase "working families" re-emerged. It came up in the normal course of the focus groups that most campaigns conduct, and advisers said it was tested with a so-called people meter, a hand-held device that test groups of consumers can use to register their reaction to products, or in this case, to political language.
"These are not new words in the dictionary," a top Gore strategist said. "You hear things that the candidate says, you expose people to it, there are some things that resonate more than others, you get feedback from crowds and in the course of that, the language of the campaign begins to take shape.
"There was no epiphany on these two words," the strategist said, "but there was a consensus developing in recent weeks, not just on this term but that the whole program was a powerful way of speaking to the needs and concerns of the people who will decide this election."
Behind the phrase lies an entire political strategy. The phrase, along with Mr. Gore's populist fervor, marks a broad, thematic shift, intended to energize the party's base, which polls had shown to be less enthusiastic in their support of Mr. Gore than the Republican base was in supporting Gov. George W. Bush.
Anne Brown, 34, a schoolteacher who attended the opening rally for Mr. Gore's boat ride down the Mississippi in La Crosse, Wis., said she responded to the phrase because "we know what he's talking about." Ms. Brown went to the rally with her 2-month-old daughter and her 55-year-old mother, who has lung cancer, and said she especially appreciated the Democrats' support of the Family and Medical Leave Act. "It lets you be at home with your family as long as possible," she said, adding that she was leaning toward Mr. Gore for this reason.
A top Gore adviser said: "Working women in general encompass one of the largest elements of persuadable voters in this election. One of the great accomplishments of our convention was to soften up Bush's vote and expand our scope of opportunity."
There was some evidence today that Mr. Gore's approach was having some effect. Several polls showed Mr. Gore's standing among voters improved after the convention, largely because of stronger support from women. A CNN poll showed Mr. Gore beating Mr. Bush, his Republican rival, by 20 percentage points among women. It also showed Mr. Bush beating Mr. Gore by 20 percentage points among men.
The Gore campaign believes that getting the ear of these women is a crucial first step toward getting their vote, and that as Mr. Gore wins over lower-income voters, he can advance up the economic ladder to win higher-income voters.
"They are a large bloc of voters who are anxious to see who will be their champion," said the Gore strategist. "As the vice president gains more standing with more voters, others will come -- like blue collar men -- and he'll have the capacity to talk to other groups higher up in income scale, like the wired workers."
Mr. Gore's tax cuts are aimed specifically at working families -- tax credits for college tuition, day care, after-school programs, long-term health care, retirement and investments. He is offering $500 billion in tax cuts and credits over 10 years, which might seem a lot for someone who has criticized Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, but Mr. Gore said today on the last leg of his boat trip that his own tax cuts "will go to the right people."
A Gore adviser who helped coax the phrase "working families" from the focus-group stage to the candidate's lips explained its purpose this way: "It implies we're talking about the people who really need government to be on their side, particularly the federal government, where so many programs from retirement, security and health emanate, and the federal government would be a real partner in terms of education."
The idea of getting help for education costs spoke directly to Lou Cook, 48, a mother of three, who showed up at a rally Saturday for Mr. Gore in Dubuque, Iowa. She said that her local property taxes, which pay for her public schools, were so high that she needed help. "All of us who work for a living have to send our kids to school, pay taxes and mortgages, and we know the only way our kids are going to benefit themselves is through education," Ms. Cook said.
Although Ms. Cook and her husband together earn nearly $100,000 -- she licenses day-care centers and is studying toward her master's degree in therapy, while her husband is a lawyer -- she said she considered herself working class, and she liked the phrase "working families."
Gore advisers said they were not worried that the phrase sent a subliminal message, as Mr. Bush has charged, that "working families" was code for class warfare. They said that this tack by the Bush campaign could help Mr. Gore because it steered the conversation away from whether Mr. Bush was more likable than Mr. Gore.
"When Bush says 'class warfare,' that's a sign he's moving to our terrain," one Gore aide said. "Bush wins if we talk on his terrain about 'affability.'
"But if we move the argument from 'Kumbaya' " the aide said, referring to the good vibes engendered by the Bush campaign, "to 'fighting for working families,' Gore wins."

Teenagers Surveyed On Brand Switching

 BODY:
Teenagers said they would be likely to switch from one brand or retailer to one that supports a good cause -- if price and quality were equal -- according to the second annual Cone/Roper Cause-Related Teen Survey. The study was commissioned by Cone Inc. in Boston, a division of the Omnicom Group, and conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide in New York.
Eighty-nine percent of the respondents to the survey, which was completed in online interviews from Aug. 3 to Aug. 9, said they would be likely to switch brands to one that supported a good cause, if price and quality were equal. Likewise, 85 percent of the respondents said they would be likely to switch retailers to one associated with a good cause, if price and quality are equal. The survey was conducted with 600 America Online users aged 12 to 17. 
 Given a list of eight factors that could be considered when making a purchase, the youths said, making donations to causes and support of causes ranked behind the quality of the product but ahead of factors like price, advertising and celebrity endorsement.
The survey found that the most popular ways to find out about a company's social commitments were television advertisements, followed by school and then newspaper or magazine ads.

HEADLINE: Simple Method Found to Increase Crop Yields Vastly

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
In a stunning new result from what has become one of the largest agricultural experiments ever, thousands of rice farmers in China have doubled the yields of their most valuable crop and nearly eliminated its most devastating disease -- without using chemical treatments or spending a single extra penny.
Under the direction of an international team of scientists, farmers in China's Yunnan Province adopted a simple change in their rice paddies. Instead of planting the large stands of a single type of rice, as they typically have done, the farmers planted a mixture of two different rices. With this one change, growers were able to radically restrict the incidence of rice blast -- the most important disease of this most important staple in the world. Within just two years, farmers were able to abandon the chemical fungicides previously widely used to fight the disease. 
 "I wasn't surprised that the system worked, but I was surprised that it worked so well," said Dr. Christopher Mundt, population biologist at Oregon State University and the one American-based author on the study, which was published in the current edition of the journal Nature. "I'm excited about the possibilities. There is a lot of potential even beyond rice."
Dr. Youyong Zhu, plant pathologist at Yunnan Agricultural University, heads the mostly China-based research team whose study now covers 100,000 acres and involves tens of thousands of farmers.
In fact, many researchers have long argued that planting a diversity of crops should lead to benefits like greater productivity and the suppression of disease, compared with single variety plantings known as monocultures. Yet the use of diversity and other ecologically based cures for agricultural ills have tended to be viewed as more politically correct than economically viable. Scientists say that this latest study shows that such environmentally friendly methods can be highly effective, even more effective, in this case, than standard chemical pesticides.
Calling the results "very significant," Dr. Alison Power, agricultural ecologist at Cornell University, said, "People have said that these kinds of ecological approaches wouldn't work on a commercial scale. This is a huge scale." She added, "We have more alternatives that are really viable than we often think about or include in our arsenal of possibilities."
Those studying natural ecosystems also welcomed the new work, saying it closely paralleled findings for the role of species diversity in reducing the incidence of disease in the wild.
"It's an important study," said Dr. David Tilman, ecologist at the University of Minnesota. "It's going to raise a great deal of interest."
The scientific hypothesis behind the study, the latest in a growing number examining the effects of biodiversity, is simple. If one variety of a crop is susceptible to a disease, the more concentrated those susceptible types are, the more easily disease can spread and the more victims it can claim. The disease should be less likely to spread, however, if susceptible plants are separated from one another by other kinds of plants that do not succumb to the disease and can act as a barrier.
Rice blast fungus, which destroys millions of tons of rice and costs farmers several billion dollars in losses each year, moves as an airborne spore -- a method of transport that should easily be blocked by a row of disease-resistant plants.
Scientists tested the hypothesis by asking farmers to plant their farms in experimental plots using two kinds of rice: a standard rice that does not usually succumb to rice blast disease and a much more valuable sticky rice known to be highly susceptible. Farmers also planted control plots of monocultures, allowing scientists to test rigorously the importance of the mixtures in the health and productivity on these farms.
What scientists found was that farmers garnered even more benefit from the mixtures than expected. Resistant plants did block the airborne spores in a field, but as more and more farmers became involved in the study, these positive effects began to multiply across the region. Not only were disease spores not blowing in from the next row, they were no longer coming from the next farmer's field either or the next or the next, rapidly damping the spread of the disease on a grand scale.
In addition, scientists found that the sticky rice plants, which poked up above the shorter, standard rice plants with which they were grown enjoyed sunnier, warmer and drier conditions than they would have in a stand of tall, sticky rice plants. These conditions appeared to discourage the growth of the fungal rice blast in the sticky rice plants.
The fact that rice blast is the most devastating disease of rice, the staple crop of most people worldwide, would alone make the study important. But scientists interviewed said there was no reason why mixtures could not decrease disease spread in other crops as well, though how powerful and useful a remedy it would be was likely to vary.
"There's already a lot of work with barley in Europe and coffee in Colombia," said Dr. Mundt. "I've seen beautiful disease reduction in mixtures of willows grown in England."
The study is of particular interest for organic farming as it involves the application of no chemicals.
"Biodiversity is an absolutely essential tool for organic production," said Dr. Martin Wolfe, director of research at Elm Farm Research Centre, an agricultural research institute. "It's an essential part of the armory." Yet, Dr. Wolfe said, even organic farmers underuse diversity, as they also have been indoctrinated in the simplicity of and seduced by the universality of monocultures.
In Yunnan province, farmers were able to harvest rice grains by hand, making it simple to gather and sell the two rice varieties separately. Some scientists argue such problems can also be overcome with mechanized harvesting. In the Pacific Northwest, where an increasing number of farmers are using mixtures of wheat to increase yields and cut down disease, growers may choose varieties that differ in useful qualities, such as resistance to disease, but that can still be harvested and sold together.
Dr. Eileen Watson, plant pathologist at the crop protection sector of Novartis Inc., which makes agricultural fungicide, said using fungicide with the mixtures could lower the incidence of rice blasts further. Dr. Watson said farmers would benefit by further delaying the day when rice blast would overcome the resistance of the nonsusceptible rice.
Researchers say the study's implications extend to prairies, rainforests and other natural ecosystems.
Just as the new study examines the role of a diversity of crops in fighting disease and in productivity of a rice paddy, biodiversity studies have been examining whether increased species number can affect such things as the health of plants in natural settings.
So far the two kinds of studies appear to support one another well. For example, Dr. Tilman and Charles Mitchell, an ecologist at University of Minnesota, have found evidence in prairie ecosystems that an increased diversity of plant species decreases the incidence of disease. As in the rice paddies, in natural ecosystems, when there is a greater diversity of plants, it is simply more difficult for the disease to spread.
"There's been quite a push by the agrotech industry to market genetically engineered crops and genetically homogeneous crops that perform really well," said Dr. Shahid Naeem, ecologist at the University of Washington. "But what's really neat about this paper is that it shows how we've lost sight of the fact that there are some really simple things we can do in the field to manage crops."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the impact of humans on global ecosystems misstated the results of an experiment in which farmers in China planted a mixture of two kinds of rice rather than one. (The same error appeared in the section on Aug. 22, 2000, but went unnoticed.) The yield rose 17 percent, nearly doubling for one variety and staying flat for the other; yield did not nearly double for both.

HEADLINE: That New York Feeling: Squeezed;
It's not your imagination. It really is more crowded.

BYLINE: By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
IT'S that special something that makes dining in New York City unlike dining in any other place.
Some call it energy. Some call it buzz. 
 New Yorkers call it crowding.
And it's not just their imagination. With real estate at a premium and an economy that's enabling more people to eat out more often, many restaurants have begun to feel like subway cars at rush hour.
A liberal building code hasn't helped. Nor has an army of designers and restaurant managers, who have finessed the art of squeezing more people into their seating plans. And now, strange as it seems, New York City restaurant crowding has become a brand of its own, sought after by restaurateurs in other cities.
Here, the public spaces in a restaurant must allow 12 square feet per person, including diners and staff. Maximum occupancy is calculated depending on the square footage, the number of fire exits, their location and their width.
This seems fairly generous until you compare it with cities like San Francisco and Atlanta, where the limit is 15 square feet per person, or even Philadelphia, where it's 13 square feet per person. Bar areas are much tighter. In Philadelphia, a bar must allow 9 square feet per person; in Atlanta, it's 7. In New York, the space is measured by counter length: 18 inches of it per person.
"We do a lot of restaurants out of state," said Warren Ashworth, a partner in Bogdanow Partners Architects, a Manhattan design firm, "and I never see a place that's packed the way some places are here."
Cramped restaurants have long been a signature of New York dining. The "21" Club, which opened in 1929, has always had its back wall of banquettes. Lining walls with banquettes increases the number of tables that can fit in a room. What's remarkable about the tables at "21", though, is how closely they are arranged. In order for diners against the wall to get up from the table, a waiter must come by and pull the table out into the room. Now, it seems every bistro in town has the same plan.
"New Yorkers are much more sophisticated, much more tolerant, and docile actually," said Jeffrey Beers, a Manhattan architect who designed China Grill and Calle Ocho. "They don't mind being bumped around a little bit; in fact, they enjoy it." That jab to the back of the head when you're taking a bite of your crab cakes might even be a sign of warmth.
David Rockwell, a partner in the Rockwell Group, whose designs include Nobu, the Monkey Bar and Vong, said: "There's a reason you're not eating at home, where you have all the privacy you need. You're eating out as much for the social experience as for a dining experience."
But New York diners are also sensitive and, as Mr. Rockwell added, designers are constantly struggling to find that elusive place between "sardines and Siberia."
Restaurateurs spend a lot of time searching for it, too. In the process, walkways get narrower, corners are maximized, and breathing room is kept at a premium.
A dining room laid out too generously can feel dead. If the tables are six or seven feet apart, Mr. Beers said, "It's difficult to get a buzz going. It yields a quiet sit-up-straight kind of restaurant."
Energy in a restaurant has become a kind of commodity. Many New York designers working in other cities have been asked to come up with a "New York feel."
"They associate that with a slightly tighter table spacing than you might get if you were following an industry standard," said Paul Bentel, a partner at Bentel & Bentel Architects/Planners in Locust Valley, N.Y. By industry standards, Mr. Bentel said, tables for four may be spaced five or six feet apart. In New York, he would reduce that to as little as 24 inches, "to get the kind of energy they associate with a New York restaurant."
Surprisingly, though, these same designers are not trying to crunch space down to the limit of 12 square feet per person. If a room is too tight, people will feel uncomfortable and won't want to come back, Mr. Rockwell said.
The Rockwell Group and Bogdanow Partners both said their restaurants average 16 to 18 square feet per person. The industry standard, Mr. Bentel said, is 20 to 22 square feet per person.
The bar area is more of a wild card -- and a tighter squeeze. The trouble with many new designs is the mingling of bar areas with eating areas. Often, they collide.
New York City building codes dictate that smoking areas at the bar can be just six feet from dining tables. Which is why in many restaurants, like Bottino and Babbo, you often feel as if you are eating in the bar and getting bumped by all the traffic flowing through it.
"In New York, you would have to say it's unavoidable in some cases," Mr. Ashworth said. But design can play a part. At Verbena, the bar has just five seats and is set into a dark area with a low ceiling. It sends out a clear message that it is just for waiting for your table, not for lingering.
Glenn Forley, a partner in Fizer Forley, which designed the restaurant, said: "A bar any larger would have probably affected the restaurant dining experience, because you would have had more of an overlap. Now, the bar is pretty much separate from the tables." The same is accomplished at Eleven Madison Park, where the bar is set off to the side in a small dim room with low ceilings.
To avoid crowds forming in more open restaurants, designers have taken to adding communal tables in the bar area, which break up crowds and form boundaries. "By definition," Mr. Rockwell said, "it doesn't allow the bar to become too much of a bar."
The new Rosa Mexicano immediately attracted a big bar crowd, making it impossible to navigate at times. Mr. Rockwell, whose company designed the restaurant, has recently added bar-height tables. "It felt just too open," Mr. Rockwell said. "And there's a lot of people, and making them a little more comfortable made sense."
It is the long and narrow restaurants with bars up front that have the most difficulty with traffic jams. At Town, a restaurant under construction in Midtown, the bar itself and the equipment behind it are very shallow. A small lounge is positioned at the end of the bar, so people will be drawn through the area rather than encouraged to linger in it. Other designers add features like a carpet or a rail to signal which areas are for circulation.
But there is only so much that can be done by a designer. The rest is up to the management to control. And if crowds get out of control, as they do in many restaurant bars, it's the neighbors who step in. New York City's Buildings Department does not have a task force out enforcing occupancy compliance. Most complaints are filed by residents to the Fire Department.
The New York Fire Department will send an officer to take a head count at the restaurant, said Brian Dixon, a department spokesman. (For occupancies over 75 or restaurants with more than 750 square feet, a sign must be posted and there is an annual inspection, including a review of the seating plan.) If the occupancy limit is exceeded, diners will be asked to leave until it is met. The restaurant can be fined a maximum of $2,500. The unlucky, randomly chosen diners go home hungry.
But in New York, where crowds are more or less praised, this series of events is rare. So rare that when the Fire Department was asked, it couldn't dig up a single case.

HEADLINE: Dispute Arises On Iraqi Debt For Oil Losses By Kuwaitis

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 22

 BODY:
A dispute pitting the United States against Russia and France over Iraqi reparations to a Kuwaiti oil company has for the first time stymied the work of a United Nations compensation commission set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
At stake is a large claim of $21.6 billion submitted by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation for lost oil and gas sales resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, during which oil wells were destroyed or damaged. 
 The compensation commission, based in Geneva, proposed in June that the Kuwait company be awarded $15.9 billion. Russia and France objected, and no award was made.
Diplomats say the United States is lobbying to line up support for Kuwait before a vote on the issue that may be held at the commission's next meeting, late next month.
Until now, all decisions by the commission have made been by consensus on the advice of experts. The 15-member panel, made up of representatives from Security Council countries, is expected to award claims as income from Iraqi oil sales becomes available.
The disagreement adds another irritant to an already frayed Security Council consensus on how to deal with the government of President Saddam Hussein as economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait a decade ago drag on.
As a critical moment approaches in the efforts of the United Nations to return arms inspectors to Iraq -- a key to lifting the embargo -- the new dispute over war reparations reopens another divisive debate in a second important area, the oil-for-food program.
The program is an exception to the embargo under which Iraq is permitted to sell oil abroad to pay for the imports of essential civilian goods.
Mr. Hussein, now earning billions in oil sales thanks to the lifting of all restrictions on oil exports last year just as prices were rising, has always objected to the requirement that a third of his oil income should go to compensate the many victims of his invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
Money from the oil sales is also set aside for the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq and to help pay for the arms inspection program.
The Iraqis rejected the oil sales program entirely until 1995, because of the controls on how Iraq could spend the money. In the first few years of the program, with oil prices low and limits on how much oil Iraq could sell, the issue merely simmered. Iraq continued to demand that sanctions be lifted to relieve the hardships of people living under the embargo, but was never able to challenge the reparations plan successfully.
Now the sums being set aside for compensation are rising into the tens of billions and Iraq -- with the backing of Russia and France, both of which are owed money by Iraq and hope for more business in the future -- has become more active in opposing the payments.
In recent years the Iraq compensation commission has paid more than $8 billion in claims, mostly to individuals and small businesses or other institutions hurt by the Iraqi invasion.
But the commission has now begun to process claims from petroleum companies, and the amounts being sought are significant. Last year the Kuwait Oil Company and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation were jointly awarded $2.3 billion for the loss of equipment and other measurable assets.
This year's much larger Kuwaiti request for the loss of less tangible things like thwarted sales ran into technical objections from France, which requested a delay to have its own experts review the claim.
United Nations officials and diplomats said that the Russian objection was more political and that it raised the larger issue of the future of the claims process.
According to unofficial notes from the June meeting, provided by panel officials, the Russians said it would be unacceptable to give that much money to the Kuwaiti oil industry, whether or not the claim was sound, while Iraqis were suffering from a trade embargo.
The Russians then said that they would like a review of the level of Iraq's contribution to the compensation fund from its oil revenues. The money now goes into an escrow account in Paris managed by the United Nations, and any change in its allocation would have to be made by the Security Council.
Diplomats said they expected Russia to raise the issue next month, when all aspects of policy toward Iraq will be open for debate.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed's Statement

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged:
The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6 1/2 percent. 
 Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce. The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.
Nonetheless, the committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.
Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Financial Issues Jump, but Others Are Mostly Lackluster

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged.
The Fed's decision to keep the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent had been widely expected. Still, stocks of financial services companies, which stand to benefit if interest rates stabilize or start to fall, were the standout performers.
"This is what the market wanted to see," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The view is that we are now in a friendlier rate environment."
Indeed, after reading the central bank's so-called policy directive, analysts said that the Fed was not likely to prove threatening to stock investors, at least for the next few months.
"Given what we know today, the consensus view is that the Fed has finished raising interest rates for the year," said Edward Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
Led by J. P. Morgan, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,139.15. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.06, or 0.1 percent, to 3,958.21. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.35, or 0.1 percent, to 1,498.13.
Before the Fed made its midafternoon announcement, major market gauges were all solidly higher. But selling set in after the news was reported.
"We had the potential for a pullback no matter what the Fed did because the market has had a good month," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "It is too early to say the Fed is done for the year, but unless we get really bad inflation numbers, I suspect the Fed will be on hold until after the election."
Financial service stocks, especially banks, did well.
J. P. Morgan rose $3.56, to $148.50. Chase Manhattan gained $1.56, to $52.50, while Citigroup advanced 69 cents, to $77.31, and Wells Fargo rose $1.19, to $45.56.
Technology stocks were mixed.
Nortel Networks, a component of the S.& P. 500, gained $2.13, to $83. Intel managed its eighth consecutive gain, rising 6 cents, to $72.13. And Microsoft rose 63 cents, to $71.25.
Cisco Systems fell 69 cents, to $64.81, however. Qualcomm shed $2.38, to $56.63, and Dell Computer dropped $1.31, to $37.44.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained $1.19, to $33.81, after Goldman, Sachs lifted its third-quarter profit estimate.
But forest products companies fell after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lowered profit estimates for this year and for 2001.
International Paper fell 44 cents, to $32.31. Weyerhaeuser dropped $1.31, to $46.88, and Temple Inland fell $1.25, to $43.69.
Medtronic had a bad day, falling $3.13, to $49.69, after the world's largest pacemaker manufacturer reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations.
But most biotechnology stocks moved higher.
Amgen closed at $69.06, up $1.81. Genentech gained $6, to $171. Chiron rose $1.63, to $50.13. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals closed at $115.14, up $3.20.

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices were mixed yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged and warned about the risks of faster inflation.
Treasuries did not get a lasting bounce because "the Fed hasn't uncovered its next move," said William Fitzgerald of Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Still, investors may buy on the notion that the Fed is near the end of its cycle of rate increases, even if it is not finished, he said.
"Many investors believe the Fed usually raises rates one time too many," he said.
The 10-year note rose 1/32, to 99 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.77 percent from 5.78 percent. The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 107 22/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.71 percent.

HEADLINE: Fire Forces Limits in Access to Montana Counties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 22

 BODY:
With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to restrict access to at least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a decision that would put some of Montana's most popular recreation areas off limits until the fires are brought under control.
"It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing it in these terms," Mr. Racicot said today in an interview, referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday. "It's so incredibly difficult for people who rely, in so many ways, on this area for recreation and their livelihood." 
 Montana is one of several Western states in which officials have taken unusual precautionary measures because of wildfires that have now consumed 4.1 million acres in 11 Western states, and some 5.7 million acres in the entire country.
Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming last week declared the state of Wyoming a disaster area because of wildfires and drought. On Monday, the Forest Service closed the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, a part of Clearwater National Forest in north central Idaho, and the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.
The expected decision by Mr. Racicot could include as many as 19 counties, which would effectively reduce access to the entire western third of the Montana to all but those who live and work in areas that fire officials have determined are not in any immediate danger. It would also bring to 28 the number of counties he has restricted access to this month, after an order two weeks ago to shut off all or part of 9 counties in central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management has already closed federal land it controls in those counties.
The restrictions are intended to minimize the risk of injury by wildfires that have been spreading rapidly by persistently dry weather conditions and, for the most part, temperatures in the upper 80's and low 90's. Mr. Racicot's orders have and are expected to have exceptions for some recreational areas. And several major national parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier, remain open.
But limiting movement in areas like the Lolo National Forest and the Bitterroot National Forest, is one of several unusual elements that reflect the seriousness of wildfires that are making this one of the worst years in decades for the number of fires in the West -- 20,364 by this morning, with 79 large fires still burning across almost 1.4 million acres in nine Western states.
Resources have been so strained that for the first time, fire management teams from other countries are assisting. Two supervisory teams from Canada are at work, and a team from Australia is expected.
"That's unprecedented," said J. D. Coleman, a spokesman for the Northern Rockies Coordinating Center in Missoula, Mont. "Never have we been stretched so thin that we've had to bring in fire management teams from other countries."
Howard Parman, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said the firefighting force included 20,000 to 25,000 people, with about 1,200 more soldiers expected to arrive later this week to join about 2,000 others.
But the fighting force is made up of more than veterans of past fires and even scores of retired firefighters who have joined the efforts. Officials at the fire center estimate that as many as 9,000 college students may be on the lines, many of whom will have to leave in the weeks ahead to return to classes. And in Wyoming, 42 prison inmates are working alongside professional firefighters as part of a program that has been in effect since the 1960's.
"These are inmates who are about to be released or who have earned the right to less security and are not a threat to society," said Melinda Brazzale, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Corrections. "They are professionally trained by another firefighter and go out and fight fires all over Wyoming and in South Dakota."
Ms. Brazzale said the program had proved beneficial to the inmates and the state, which had saved more than $125,000 this year by using them.
"That's a savings to federal and local agencies," she said. "It's also a real benefit to the inmates to learn a saleable skill."
In addition to personnel needs, firefighting efforts this year have been compounded by the growing number of private homes that have been built inside forest areas, a trend that Governor Racicot and other officials said reflects the nation's vibrant economy. Many of the houses are owned by retirees; others are second homes.
"They have completely changed how we go about fighting fires," Mr. Coleman said. "So many people have come out West to burrow into woods, draws and creek beds. They like being a modern-day pioneer. But now we have to protect their homes, and with the volume of fires and their complexity, it makes for such an unpredictable situation."

HEADLINE: Havel Urges Multinationals to Heed the 'Voices of the People'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Aug. 22

 BODY:
President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, the host of the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund here next month, said today that international development organizations "should listen more to the voices of the people" for whom they fashion programs, showing more respect for local cultural traditions.
Issues of poverty and housing "must be solved taking into account the human dimension, and not just the interests of investors," Mr. Havel said in an interview with a small group of reporters. 
 The United Nations, too, he said, "should do everything to make people see it as their own organization, representing everyone, not as some sort of club of governments and diplomats."
Mr. Havel will travel to the United States to attend the millennial summit meeting of the United Nations early next month. As an institution, he said, "it should have more power and a smaller bureaucracy." Then he laughed. "Anyone with experience of power knows one of Parkinson's famous laws," he added, "and when two people on my staff say they need a third, soon there's a fourth and a fifth."
The fund and bank meetings here, from Sept. 19 to Sept. 28, have become a target for groups opposed to globalization and multinational capital. Mr. Havel said he welcomes the debate, but hopes it can be a philosophical and substantive one, without violence in the streets.
Globalization by itself is "morally neutral," Mr. Havel said. "It can be good or bad, depending on the kind of content we give to it." He cited the spread of information about human rights as a good use of globalization. As a negative, he cited "the spread of silly sitcoms or even more stupid commercials," which give a false picture of human life.
"These commercials say a lot," he said. "A handsome man with a great tan and strong muscles is running on a beautiful beach with blue sky in the background. A beautiful girl is running toward him and they are happy because they just ate some vitamin or drank some beverage. The stupidity of this world, which is offered to us as human happiness, should be analyzed."
Casually dressed in tan jeans and an open shirt, Mr. Havel, 63, looked fit after a vacation in Portugal, where he bought a summer residence to spend time after he leaves office in 2003. An hour before the interview, sirens went off throughout Prague in memory of the 72 people who died when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia 32 years ago on Monday.
Mr. Havel urged the news media to pay more attention to the substance of the debate than to security aspects , and he urged his countrymen to have a more worldly vision.
"It is a great privilege for this country to have the meeting here," he said.
People "often forget what it looked like here before the fall of Communism," he said. "How gray life was, how gray streets were, how the sign for a fruit shop was the same all over the country." But now, "every little shop has a different facade, and we are renewing a lot of local tradition." That, he said, was also a kind of answer to globalization and to "this unifying pressure of the dictatorship of consumption and commercials and those supermarkets that are destroying the city suburbs."
Today, Mr. Havel addressed a local controversy that has had international attention. Last month, Pavel Dostal, the Czech culture minister, wrote an article that appeared to ridicule the concerns of Orthodox Jews over a 13th-century Jewish cemetery discovered in downtown Prague during excavations to rebuild an insurance company.
The government worked out a plan with local Jewish leaders to encase the remnants of the cemetery in concrete, while allowing the company to build both below and above it. But the plan has been criticized.
"I do not know why the Prague Jews imagine dance or theater must be specifically excluded above the skeletal remains that their ancestors sold," Mr. Dostal's article said. "But even if so, it is strange that it did not bother the Prague Jewish community for 522 years that such things happened above the destroyed cemetery -- not until now. It's like the doctor showing up after the funeral, after the funeral more than half a millennium ago."
Today, Mr. Havel said: "Of course I cannot bear responsibility for all the clever or pseudo-clever comments of any of the individual ministers. The important thing for me is that this government has the will to seek a solution."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: When Funds Abroad Fill a Void at Home;
Financing Latin America's Start-Ups

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
StarMedia, one of the biggest and most successful Internet companies in Latin America, has branch offices in seven countries and millions of subscribers throughout the region. But its headquarters are in New York. Its $450 million in financing came from investors in the United States. Its stock is listed on the Nasdaq but not on any exchange in Latin America.
El Sitio, another Internet service provider with millions of Spanish- and Portugese-speaking users in Latin America, also raised money by selling shares on the Nasdaq. But El Sitio is not traded on any stock exchange in the region where it does most of its business. 
 And when Yupi Internet Inc. raised start-up money, it too bypassed local financial markets in the Latin American countries it serves, seeking investors in the United States instead. Yupi's plans for further expansion through a stock offering were postponed in April when the Nasdaq nose dived, but the company intends to sell shares to the public only in the United States, not Latin America.
The Internet revolution has definitely come to Latin America. But whether the businesses and jobs created by that revolution have helped the region begin to wean itself from economic dependence on the United States and other outsiders is considered a matter of debate.
"This keeps us more dependent on outsiders all the time, but the fault is ours," said Paul Singer, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Sao Paulo. "It is a deficiency which should be resolved."
Companies like StarMedia and El Sitio contend that they are not only truly Latin American but also helping create a pan-Latin market because Latin America's 500 million people are their main audience. These companies also say they would not even exist if they had sought to raise start-up money in the countries where their customers live and work.
But critics contend that these companies have unwittingly helped create a kind of cybercolonialism in which the major architects of the region's Internet access are foreigners, backed by foreign funds, with offices in foreign lands, just like in the old days.
There is widespread agreement that the remote-control companies and off-shore financing that made them possible underscore the persistent weakness of Latin America's financial world.
"Yes, we do have a dependency on the more sophisticated foreign equity markets," said Jorge Errazuriz a partner in Celfin, one of Chile's largest investment banks, and a member of the board of the Santiago Stock Exchange. This "inferior position," he said, means that "the real initial impulse for developing fiber optics, telecommunications and the Internet will have to come from the equity markets up north."
It is not just start-up companies that are diverting strength from the domestic stock exchanges and extending dependency. When an aggressive international corporation like Telefonica of Spain purchases phone systems in Argentina, Brazil and Peru, it deprives local exchanges of some of their biggest companies. After such acquisitions, the local companies are removed from the domestic stock exchanges, while Telefonica stock is listed only in Spain and the United States.
The Latin American exchanges have been hit hard. Over the last decade, for example, the number of listed domestic companies on Brazil's main exchange dropped about 18 percent, from 581 to 478. In Argentina the decline was even steeper, nearly 30 percent, with local companies on the exchange dipping to 129 from 179.
"It's very troubling to see these markets, which are already weak, get weakened further," said Roger S. Leeds, director of the Center for International Business and Public Policy at the Paul H. Nitzke Center for International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "And I don't think that's at all healthy for the development of the private sector."
From Mexico to Argentina, political leaders in the new Latin America have promised to improve the standards of living in their countries by unleashing private enterprise and completely engaging in the global economy. But while the biggest Latin companies already have access to the money they need to expand on either the local or international markets, small and start-up companies, which generate most new jobs, often face an impossible dream.
Even when local money is available, taking a company public on a Latin American exchange can be more trouble than it is worth. Most local exchanges lack the pool of capital and investors willing to take the kind of risks a big regional Internet company needs to start up. Besides, some require years of operating experience before a company's stock can be publicly traded, and in some instances they must show real profits, which few Internet start-ups are able to do.
Latin America's economic development has always depended heavily on outsiders. Big corporations -- many of them from the United States -- set up branch plants in Central and South America that provided jobs and some growth. But they did little to develop a financial and economic self-sufficiency.
The newest Latin American companies operate, in effect, the same way, critics like Professor Leeds contend. "There are benefits to the local economy in terms of jobs and investment," he said. "But the benefits to the local financial sector are zero."
Coming to the United States to raise money is not unique to Latin America, not even for Internet companies. Jesse E. Reyes, vice president for global product management for Venture Economics, a private equity research firm, said that Israeli and French Internet and software companies had raised generous amounts of capital on Wall Street lately.
The difference, he said, is that they enter the United States market not just to raise money but to sell their products and services here. Their growth then translates into profit that is repatriated and re-invested in their home countries.
The Latin companies that raise money here, by contrast, are not doing that.
"If you look at it from the Latin American businessman's point of view, if they can take American money and get in on the ground floor of a terrific opportunity, then so what does it matter?" Mr. Reyes said. "But the sociologists might say, 'Isn't this just another example of American colonialism?' "
The companies that have successfully crossed borders to raise funds certainly do not see it that way.
"What our inability to raise capital in Latin America says is that you cannot shift 500 years of monopoly control and monopoly orientation all at one time," said Fernando Espuelas, chairman of StarMedia. "Until very recently, if you wanted to finance a company in Latin America you got a bank loan, at 30 percent interest, and for a very short term. Obviously you'd never be able to finance an Internet company that way."
Born in Uruguay and raised in Connecticut, Mr. Espuelas realized early on that Latin American investors, especially wary of risk, would not support his dream of creating a regional Internet company.
Basing his company in New York reinforced its identity as truly regional, Mr. Espuelas said, and giving it an English name helped win over American investors. He knocked on the doors of nearly 50 American venture capitalists. Even hearing a sophisticated New York financier refer to Latin America as "that blob there below the Rio Grande" did not dissuade him.
With flawless English and a cool confidence, he won over big backers, including Chase Capital Partners, and raised nearly $100 million in private capital.
Then in May 1999, StarMedia issued its initial public offering on the Nasdaq, raising $110 million. A subsequent offering in October raised another $200 million. StarMedia stock, which first sold for $15, escalated to more than $60 at its peak.
The American investors who bought in early and sold at the peak enjoyed the kinds of gains that would have gone to Latin investors had it been possible for StarMedia to go public in Latin America.
Mr. Espuelas said he was aware of the drawbacks but felt that the region could eventually overcome the cycle of dependency.
"I'm already reinvesting money into companies in Latin America," he said, though he declined to name his investments. "Our success is demonstrative of what can happen but also of the challenges and the road that remains to be travelled."
While small local companies will continue to struggle, StarMedia's early success set loose a herd of regional Latin companies that beat a similar path to the doors of American venture capitalists
El Sitio, based in Buenos Aires, raised $130 million in its public offering in December. Impsat Fiber Networks, an Argentine telecommunications company in Wilton Manors, Fla., went public on the Nasdaq with a $195 million offering in February.
Guillermo Jofre, chief financial officer of Impsat, said the lack of adequate financing was one of the most severe limitations Latin America faced. "Right now there's simply no significant amount of local financing available in Latin America," Mr. Jofre said. "And this presents a big handicap when compared to most other countries."
But the global marketplace for capital has its drawbacks, too. Yupi Internet, a Latin American Internet service company based in Miami, planned to go public in the United States last spring. Then the Nasdaq crashed.
"We filed our initial public offering in January and we were completing our road show on April 14, the day of the debacle," said Oscar Coen, president of Yupi. That day the Nasdaq lost 355 points, its worst session ever to end its worst week ever. Yupi may have been in some trouble anyway because it was comparatively late to a market already served by StarMedia, El Sitio and others. But when the Nasdaq went into a tailspin, the company's executives and backers changed plans.
"We realized that it was in the best interest of the company to postpone the I.P.O. until there was a more favorable environment," Mr. Coen said.
Like many other companies, both American and foreign, Yupi's I.P.O. remains postponed. The delay has meant that Yupi has not expanded as rapidly as originally planned, Mr. Coen said. Yupi will not open shop in Paraguay or Uruguay, while Chile, he said, "is borderline." Yupi has also pared its advertising budget.
America Online Latin America, a spinoff of the original America Online, is also finding it tough to raise money in the United States. The Latin venture between AOL and the Cisneros Group of Venezuela originally filed its initial public offering in January but had to wait until earlier this month to move ahead. The 25 million shares were sold at $8 each and raised $200 million for the company, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
Still, a long line of Latin American start-ups is waiting to make the trip to the United States. "That is clearly the final objective for most of us," said Marcos E. Galperin, president of Mercado Libre, an Internet auction site in Latin America. He started his company less than a year ago, with American backing. One of his earliest investors was an American financier who addressed Mr. Galperin's M.B.A. class at Stanford University.
"From day minus one on this project I knew we wanted to get funding in the U.S.," Mr. Galperin said. "For us, it's a big stamp of approval."

HEADLINE: Explorer Tires Had to Carry A Heavy Load

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The Firestone tires that have been failing on Ford Explorers have fairly low weight-carrying capability for a vehicle of the Explorer's size, particularly at the low inflation pressure recommended by Ford Motor, publicly available technical specifications for the tires and the Explorers show.
Officials at Bridgestone/Firestone have said several times over the last two weeks that the recalled 15-inch tires are losing their treads at high speeds partly because drivers are overloading their vehicles. But this can be easy to do in an Explorer: its recommended maximum payload for passengers and cargo is 750 to 1,310 pounds, depending on the model. Four people, plus luggage, can exceed the lower end of that range, particularly if they use the roof rack and the rear cargo area. 
 The Explorer is at least as heavy as any of its main rivals in the midsize sport utility market, and has been several hundred pounds heavier in some model years, notably 1996, the vintage that has produced the most crash claims. Yet Ford's rivals typically use either larger tires or recommend higher tire pressures.
Increasing a tire's size or its pressure allows it to carry more weight safely, provided that the maximum pressure recommended by the tire maker is not exceeded.
The Chevrolet Blazer, for example, uses the same size tires as the Explorer. But General Motors recommends that the tires on all its midsize sport utilities be inflated to 35 pounds per square inch, compared with just 26 for the Explorer.
As a result, the combined weight-carrying ability of the Blazer tires is 1,100 pounds greater than the Explorer tires. The recommended maximum payload for a Blazer is 930 to 1,330 pounds, which four adults and their luggage are less likely to exceed.
The Honda Passport, Nissan Pathfinder and Mitsubishi Montero Sport have the same recommended tire pressure as the Explorer. But the Passport and the Pathfinder use larger tires, with 16-inch diameters, allowing them to carry more weight. The Montero Sport has 15-inch tires that are slightly smaller than those of the Explorer, because they are slightly narrower, but Mitsubishi recommends that customers raise the rear tires' pressure before carrying heavy loads -- a recommendation that Ford has not made for the Explorer.
Ford has chosen larger tires with higher pressures for its next generation of Explorers, which will go on sale in January. The new tires, chosen several years ago, will be able to carry considerably more weight than the current ones, and will give the new Explorer a recommended payload of 1,100 to 1,500 pounds.
Ford officials defend their choice of the recalled tires, saying they meet tire industry guidelines for carrying weight. Ford also questions Bridgestone/Firestone's assertion that overloading has contributed to tire failures in the United States, although the automaker acknowledges that tires did fail on Explorers overseas that became overloaded when owners installed third rows of seats and used the vehicles as shuttle buses.
Ford also contends that with the Explorer or any other truck, it is the responsibility of owners to check weight labels posted on the inside of the doors and then limit the weight put inside, with particular attention to not putting too much weight at the back of the vehicle. "It provides you on the label the gross vehicle weight rating -- you can't load it so that you exceed 3,000 pounds on the rear axle either," said Lee Carr, a vehicle dynamics engineering consultant on the Explorer and former Ford engineer to whom Ford referred questions on the Explorer tires.
But safety experts have long questioned how many sport utility customers think of their vehicles as trucks, much less check the weight ratings on the label. Mr. Carr acknowledged that people who switched to Explorers from cars might not be accustomed to checking weight ratings.
Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said the best evidence for the adequacy of the current tire size and pressure lay in the performance of Goodyear tires that were installed on nearly half the Explorers built in the 1995, 1996 and 1997 model years. Goodyear has not had any reports of problems with these tires, said Bill Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for global product marketing and technical planning. Mr. Harmon said Ford had received just one report of a tread separation involving a Goodyear tire on an Explorer, but the incident did not result in any injuries.
Ford officials have been consistent in pointing to quality problems in the Firestone tires, while contending that their design decisions did not cause the failures. Reluctant to antagonize their biggest customer, Firestone officials have said little to question this.
But John Lampe, an executive vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone, said this evening that concerns about the tires' ability to carry the Explorer's weight safely had been one reason for the tire maker's recommendation two weeks ago that Explorer owners begin inflating their tires to 30 pounds per square inch. Ford has since said that a range of 26 to 30 pounds is acceptable.
Ford's decision on Monday to temporarily close two Ranger pickup factories and an Explorer factory, to make more replacement tires available for Explorers, reflected the fact that the Ranger and the Explorer still use the same tires.
The Explorer was introduced as a variation of the Ranger in late 1990, and was an immediate best seller. Over the years, the Explorer has grown bigger and heavier, because many people choose practically every option, including four-wheel drive even if they plan no off-road driving. Yet most Explorers still share the tires of a small pickup that weighs half a ton less.
A decade ago, Ford executives expected only a few customers to choose four-wheel drive, and were taken by surprise that most drivers want the option, which adds 220 pounds to the vehicle's weight. Ford makes the key components for the four-wheel-drive systems at a factory in Bordeaux, France, that has been so backlogged that the automaker has maintained a charter fleet of jets for years just to ferry them to its Explorer assembly plants in Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis.
"It's a nice problem to have," said Steve Von Foerster, the chief program engineer for the Explorer. "People want it so bad that you have to rent your own fleet of 747's." With a profitable model, airlifting heavy auto parts is cheaper than shutting down the assembly plant, but an automaker does it only as a last resort, after greatly underestimating demand for an option.
Vehicles need tires that can support considerably more than their own weight plus the payload because they lean on the tires on one side when going around curves, and because the weight of cargo and passengers is seldom evenly distributed.
A typical Ford Explorer weighs 4,000 to 4,400 pounds. Four 15-inch tires of the type and inflation pressure now being recalled can support a total of 7,012 pounds at a pressure of 26 pounds per square inch, according to the tire industry's Tire and Rim Association guidelines. At a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, which Firestone now recommends, the tires can support a total of 7,525 pounds.
By contrast, the similarly sized Chevrolet Blazer weighs roughly 4,000 pounds or a little less. It has the same size tires but, because of a higher inflation pressure, the tires can support a total of 8,112 pounds.

HEADLINE: Invoking Suffragists, Mrs. Clinton Courts Women Upstate

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Invoking the legacy of the suffragists at every turn, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought today to portray herself as a champion of women and working families and to bolster her support in this city, where Susan B. Anthony once fought for the right to vote.
Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Senate candidate, toured Anthony's red-brick home, boasted of her own efforts to promote women's issues like breast cancer and child care, and even appeared with Ruth Dyk, 99, who once marched alongside the suffragists and likened Mrs. Clinton to them. "If I've learned one thing, it's this: New York needs a woman's touch," Ms. Dyk said while endorsing Mrs. Clinton. 
 In her latest campaign swing through Monroe County, a key electoral county, Mrs. Clinton seemed determined to show women that she was their candidate. At a meeting with union members, she said she was a working mother like many of those in the room. "I know what it's like when you have to worry about whether or not you're going to make it to that school play because you're in one of those interminable meetings," she said to laughter and clapping.
Some polls have shown Mrs. Clinton in trouble with various pockets of women who vote, particularly white women, and she has sought out issues to shore up support. At the same time, her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has aggressively pursued these same groups of voters. Just last week, for example, he visited the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women's suffrage movement.
Although she never mentioned Mr. Lazio by name, Mrs. Clinton today repeatedly tried to distinguish herself by stressing her plan for economic development in upstate New York and her support of issues traditionally important to women, like education and health care. She also advocated a woman's right to abortion, and further pledged that she would never vote to confirm a judge who would try to make abortion illegal. "I want you to know my opponent does not have the same view of reality, the same vision of the future, the same positions on the issues," she said.
Mr. Lazio also supports the right to an abortion but is opposed to a form of late-term abortion and is against public financing for abortions.
Despite Mrs. Clinton's efforts to focus on substantive issues, several women continued to bring up personal details about President Clinton's extramarital affair in the White House that led to his impeachment.
Linda Lowenstein, a registered nurse, said that she intended to vote for Mrs. Clinton but that many of the women who are her friends would not. "I think the issue is the problems with Bill," she said. "I think, unfortunately, some women can't forgive her for not leaving him."
Nora Bredes, director of the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Leadership at the University of Rochester, said that Mrs. Clinton's candidacy might make some women uncomfortable because it reflects their own struggles to be both leaders and nurturers in a modern world.
And while Mrs. Clinton was surrounded by a number of women today, some of her most effusive supporters were men. Dominic Noto, a retired railroad worker, could not wait to line up at the Marketplace Mall to shake her hand. "She's a strong woman, because she stuck by him," he said. "A lot of people wouldn't have had the courage and the strength. I told her that four years from now, I'll vote for her for the White House."

HEADLINE: Opposition Precedes Arrival of Teams at New Coney Island Stadium

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The city's new Coney Island stadium for a minor-league Mets franchise will cost up to $8 million more than previous estimates, and the project continues to provoke bitter sniping between its biggest booster, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and its most vocal opponent, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough president.
At a ceremonial groundbreaking yesterday on Surf Avenue, where construction of the 6,500-seat ballpark is well under way in the shadow of Coney Island's storied parachute drop, Mayor Giuliani said the city would spend as much as $39 million on the project -- more than 25 percent above its previous budget of $31 million. 
 Mr. Giuliani defended the additional cost, saying it was necessary to ensure its completion by opening day next June. That deadline, a year earlier than previously set by the city, means the Coney Island stadium, like a counterpart on Staten Island, will be completed before the mayor leaves office at the end of 2001.
The Brooklyn stadium has been a longstanding matter of contention between the mayor and Mr. Golden, who for years strenuously promoted a grander sports and recreation complex for the site. And yesterday's ceremony brought them no closer together. Several top City Hall aides and Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, joined Mr. Giuliani at the ceremony, but Mr. Golden was not invited and did not attend.
"It is unfortunate that the city administration continues to implement a sweetheart deal that offers little economic benefit to Brooklyn but is a windfall to professional baseball," Mr. Golden said in a statement released immediately after the event. "Taxpayers deserve more for this huge public investment than an outrageous deal."
The Coney Island and Staten Island minor-league ballparks, which are being paid for with more than $100 million in city money, have been championed by the mayor to foster economic development in the boroughs outside Manhattan. The Staten Island stadium, budgeted at $71 million and under construction along the St. George shoreline, just west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, is to be used by a minor-league franchise of the Yankees.
Although the Staten Island project will be the most expensive minor-league ballpark in the country, it has caused little upset, while the battle over the Brooklyn stadium has consumed Mr. Golden for more than a year. He has also maintained that its price is too high and that the caliber of baseball it will bring, with a single-A minor-league franchise, to the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, is beneath the dignity of the borough.
Asked why Mr. Golden was not invited to the event, Mayor Giuliani angrily replied: "Why wasn't he here? Because he is against this project. I can't imagine why."
Under terms of a 20-year lease agreement between the city and the Mets, the minor-league franchise will pay up to $520,000 a year, based on attendance, for use of the stadium. While the current home of the Mets' minor-league team in Queens sometimes draws fewer than 1,000 fans, the mayor said that he hoped a new stadium would attract larger crowds, and that if the stadium were at least half full for each game next year, he would be satisfied. In addition to lease payments, the city would receive half the advertising revenues that are generated by the franchise.
But the mayor also sought to dismiss the points raised by Mr. Golden and other critics who say that the Coney Island project will provide a windfall for the Mets. He insisted that it would lead to sweeping economic development along the neighborhood's tawdry beachfront and commercial blocks.
"This ballpark will do for Coney Island what Disney did for 42nd Street," he said, referring to the investment by the Walt Disney Company, backed by city tax incentives, in a Times Square theater and store in the early 1990's. He said the city would prompt further Coney Island development by paying for a Little League field close to the new stadium, for repairs on the rusting framework of the parachute drop, and for incentives to lure new stores to the blighted quarter-mile stretch of Surf Avenue between the stadium site and the historic Nathan's hot dog emporium.
But Mr. Giuliani declined to say which of those projects, if any, would be completed before he left office.
In an interview, Michael Carey, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is in charge of the stadium projects, said that the cost of the Coney Island field had grown because advancing its deadline meant bringing in more workers and materials at a time when both are in short supply.
He said the city and the Mets had agreed to seek a corporate sponsor for the stadium, embracing a model of corporate support established by several professional sports organization around the nation as well as on Staten Island. Although no such sponsor has been found, Mr. Carey said he expected a company to pay for the right to include its name in that of the new Coney Island stadium, and that the arrangement would probably yield as much income as the $400,000 a year that the Richmond County Bank has agreed to pay to have the field in St. George named the Richmond County Bank Ballpark.
Mr. Carey also said that the city and the Mets would select a name for the minor-league team from ideas submitted by the public.
One suggestion was made immediately yesterday at the ceremony by Joan Hodges, the widow of Gil Hodges, the former Brooklyn Dodger first baseman and Mets manager. "I respectfully submit the name of Gil Hodges," said Mrs. Hodges, whose presence was apparently intended by City hall to evoke the splendor of professional baseball in Brooklyn.
Mayor Giuliani, who followed Mrs. Hodges to the microphone, was effusive in his praise of her husband, who died in 1972, but stopped short of seconding her nomination. Without referring to the naming process of Coney Island's new club, he said that Mr. Hodges "truly deserves to be in the Hall of Fame," an honor not yet bestowed.

HEADLINE: Peter Cooper Village Owner Accused of Fraud on Wiring

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
A Manhattan assemblyman accused Metropolitan Life Insurance Company yesterday of seeking to overcharge residents of Peter Cooper Village for $30 million in new wiring, saying the insurer stands to earn huge amounts from telecommunications companies for making the improvements.
The insurance company, which owns the 2,200-unit Peter Cooper Village, on the east side of Manhattan north of 14th Street, has asked the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal for approval for the increased assessments, which, under law, would remain as rent increases after the new electric, cable, phone and Internet wiring is paid for. 
 The increases would amount to $135 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and $170 for a two-bedroom apartment. The average two-bedroom apartment rents for about $1,000, according to a list of rents for one of the buildings in Peter Cooper Village.
The tenants association has protested the increases in a letter to the state housing agency, and, with the assemblyman, Steven Sanders, a resident of Peter Cooper Village, suggests that the insurance company's application is fraudulent because it does not mention the money it may get from companies like RCN and other cable companies.
"The question is, did it really cost them $30 million, or was there an offset from income they incurred from RCN?" said Jack Lester, the lawyer for the tenants association, who said many of the residents were elderly and living on fixed incomes.
"This may be enough to force some of them out," he said.
The apartment complex, built after World War II to house returning veterans, was designed to be affordable for middle-income residents, and in recent years the apartments have been highly sought after as rents increased rapidly elsewhere in Manhattan.
Mr. Sanders said that while tenants were being asked to pay for the wiring improvements, Met Life and RCN have a marketing agreement that provides Met Life with what he believed was "several millions of dollars" for the actual wiring, plus a percentage of every new contract for a subscriber in Peter Cooper Village. The agreement includes a clause preventing the parties from speaking about it, he said.
"We are contending they seriously omitted a significant revenue," Mr. Sanders said of the insurer. "We are suggesting that the actual cost to Met Life is substantially less than what they are purporting it to be, because they have failed to indicate on their application what we believe to be millions of dollars of revenue generated."
Mr. Sanders said that a landlord who is untruthful in an application for a rent increase after completing major capital improvements could lose any chance of being reimbursed for the work and could face major damages.
He learned of the cable installations after a tenant asked him why a box in the front closet had an RCN logo, since the tenant had not subscribed to any RCN services. He said there was no mention of the cable and telecommunications wiring in the insurer's application for the increase.
Jennie Morgan, a spokeswoman for the insurer, declined to answer questions about the proposed increase.
"We are a fair landlord, we play by the rules and we have filed a legitimate application" for an increase based on major capital improvements, she said. "Other than that, there's nothing I can say."
An RCN spokeswoman also did not provide any information on the two companies' arrangement.
Dan Irizarry, deputy press secretary for the state housing agency, would not comment on the specifics of the application.
Many of the tenants at Peter Cooper Village have lived there for decades. "The overwhelming majority didn't want the wiring, and don't want to pay for it," said Al Doyle, president of the tenants association.
"It's very hard on us," said Shirley Ehrlickman, who describes herself as an elderly resident of Peter Cooper Village. She pays $907 a month in rent for a one-bedroom apartment, and expects an increase of $140.
"The rent is going up, the cost of medication is going up, everything in the city is costing more including food, so you can see it's a hardship on the older population," she said. "To be perfectly honest, I've been seeking an apartment with a lower rental, but it's very hard to find a lower rental."

HEADLINE: Effort to Recruit Minorities Falls Short in Trooper Class

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Despite a well-advertised effort to bring more blacks, women and Latinos into the New Jersey State Police, only 15 of the 105 cadets scheduled to enter the academy next month are black or Latino, and just one is a woman, according to statistics released by the agency today.
Early this year, the agency settled a discrimination suit filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by agreeing to scrap several requirements that many black applicants considered discriminatory. The state also pledged to make aggressive attempts to advertise and recruit in black and Latino neighborhoods. 
 But in releasing the recruitment numbers today, the state police superintendent, Carson J. Dunbar Jr., said he was disappointed that the agency's attempt to diversify its ranks would leave the percentage of minority troopers virtually unchanged, at 14 percent. About 3 percent of the 2,800 current troopers are women, Mr. Dunbar said, so the new class actually represents a decrease in the percentage of women.
Mr. Dunbar said the strong economy was partly to blame for the lackluster results, because many female and minority applicants had found better-paying jobs and decided not to finish the screening process.
He also acknowledged that the agency's reputation remained tarnished in many black and Latino neighborhoods because of the Justice Department's highly publicized investigation into discrimination by troopers and the state's admission that some officers had engaged in racial profiling for years -- problems that preceded his appointment last year.
"I wish I could tell you there's a quick fix for this problem," said Mr. Dunbar, who became a New Jersey trooper himself in 1973 and was the only minority officer in his class. "The real answer is, it's going to be a long process."
He refused to specify what racial breakdown the force ultimately hopes to reach, saying that he did not want to give the mistaken impression that the state police were adopting a quota system. New Jersey's population is about one-third minority, however, and in the settlement with the N.A.A.C.P. the state agreed to try to broaden the demographics of the force.
Some elected officials said they were dismayed that the state had failed to deliver on its promise to increase minority representation on the force.
"The state police have missed a golden opportunity to change its institutional image," said Leroy J. Jones Jr., a Democratic assemblyman from Essex County. "Clearly, they need to reassess their approach and re-examine who they are using as consultants in recruiting more minorities into the ranks."
Some current troopers have also complained that the state lowered its physical fitness requirements for new recruits, in an attempt to help female applicants. During the last two years, the state eliminated its pull-up, broad jump and vertical jump requirements, and applicants who fail the physical test may now take it repeatedly until they pass.
Mr. Dunbar defended the less stringent requirements, saying they still allow the state police to winnow out those applicants who are physically unsuited to perform the job. The state police also worked with several consulting firms to revise the application process and add screening that tests candidates' temperament and decision-making abilities.
"It's not just about strength, it's about what kind of person you are," Mr. Dunbar said.
The state police are scheduled to begin a new recruiting drive next year and will work with the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the National Association of Women in Policing to try and expand the pool of female and minority candidates. The state police may place more emphasis on reaching out to women's sports teams, Mr. Dunbar said, and will continue to recruit at schools and community events in minority neighborhoods.
But he said that his own experience in law enforcement recruiting, for both the State Police and the F.B.I., had taught him not to expect quick results.
"It doesn't happen that rapidly," he said. "What I would like to see is steady increases."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Law Firm Is No Longer Lonely in Refurbished Tower on Times Square

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Five years after moving to Times Square in 1990, the law firm of Proskauer Rose was still the only tenant in the 41-story tower at 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets. "We had been in two buildings on Park Avenue, and suddenly we found ourselves virtually alone in the wild West," said Alan S. Jaffe, chairman. "It was very, very lonely here."
Lonely, but not uneventful. Soon after moving into 11 floors, the law firm sued the developers and lenders, contending, among other things, that the paving outside the building was unfinished, the facade incomplete and the elevators in need of repair. And when improvements still were not made, the firm withheld its rent for about six months. 
 While all that was going on, the recession hit and the bottom rapidly began falling out of the market for office space in New York; the building at 1585 Broadway alone was losing $1.9 million a month. As a result, in December 1991, the development partnership, 1585 Broadway Associates, controlled by David S. Solomon, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Things settled down after Morgan Stanley, the financial services company (now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter), bought the building at auction for $176 million in August 1993 and moved in two years later.
Ten years still remain on Proskauer's original 20-year lease, and the 125-year-old law firm -- even now the building's only tenant other than Morgan Stanley -- has embarked on a top-to-bottom refurbishing. Three months ago, it remodeled the entire 19th floor, and next month it will begin refurbishing the rest.
The makeover of the 19th floor, which housed the firm's law library, resulted in 7 large conference rooms and 49 offices for lawyers, plus work stations and offices for secretaries, legal assistants and support staff members. All that was accomplished without adding to the 365,000 square feet that the firm already occupied.
It was able to do so by relocating the library to the firm's existing space in the subbasement, space that had been used by accounting department employees, by a messenger department and for record storage. But Proskauer employees do not refer to the underground space as a subbasement, much less a cellar. "We refer to it as a concourse," Mr. Jaffe, the chairman, said, clearly savoring his choice of euphemism.
In fact, this is no ordinary sub- -- whoops, concourse. For starters, it is flooded with light: light from lamps, from recessed ceiling lights, from concealed lights within floor-to-ceiling frosted-glass panels built into the walls, and from light reflected from the polished stainless steel in which the three four-foot-square concrete pillars are sheathed. To add to the brightness, light is reflected from the various woods, including oak and anigre, that were chosen partly for that purpose. The concourse also houses separate men's and women's locker rooms for employees who pull all-nighters or want to freshen up after working out in nearby gyms.
The library has been incorporated into a new high-tech research center, an area that also includes training rooms, conference rooms, the records department and rooms where documents that bear on a particular case can be consolidated for easy access.
The research center has space enough for 34 lawyers at any one time to be able to plug in their personal computers and surf the Internet. In addition, 14 staff members help with research, on the Internet and among the library's estimated 60,000 books, journals and other periodicals. The researchers serve not just Proskauer's 420 lawyers in New York but also the 130 or so in the firm's other offices, in Newark, Washington, Los Angeles, Boca Raton, Fla., and Paris. "This is bigger than some college law libraries," said Kit Hartnett, director of library services within the research center.
The concourse was designed by Gensler, the architectural firm. But Hal Plott, director of administration for Proskauer, said it was the firm's idea to relocate the library underground and to change the overall name to research center. "We wanted a name that better reflected its purposes," he said. The remodeled concourse and the 19th-floor makeover cost a total of $4.5 million.
From his office, Mr. Jaffe said, "We thought when we moved here that the redevelopment of Times Square would take place back then, but the recession interfered." Since then, he added, Times Square has become a corridor for legal, financial and informational services firms. And Proskauer employees no longer feel like pioneer settlers.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
BUSH SAYS GORE ERRED IN CALLING TAX CUT TOO BIG

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas aggressively defended his sweeping tax-cut proposal today, saying it was both responsible and easily affordable in light of federal surplus projections. Mr. Bush produced an assortment of figures to show that the plan would not require cuts in government spending.
"I've got to do a better job of making it clear," Mr. Bush told reporters in a surprising admission aboard his campaign plane. 
 The remark came just a day after Vice President Al Gore, suddenly resurgent in the polls, held an extensive discussion of his own suggested tax cuts, which are less than half the size of the ones proposed by Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush pointed to projections by the Congressional Budget Office that the federal government would run a surplus of about $4.6 trillion over the next 10 years, a figure that includes the Social Security surplus. He said voters needed to know that the projection represented money left over even after an expected growth in government spending of about $3.3 trillion.
He also said that after setting aside the Social Security surplus to shore up that program, he would have roughly $2.3 trillion for tax cuts, new spending and debt reduction. Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
As soon as voters understand that, he said, "People will buy into the tax-relief package even more."
"I'm not changing my opinion on it," he added, a defiant declaration that, like his comments to reporters about the surplus and tax cuts, was largely unprompted. "It's the absolute right thing to do for America."
Mr. Bush's uncharacteristic decision to revisit calculations that his campaign had previously outlined seemed to be an acknowledgment of a potentially troubling political reality for him. Many public opinion polls show that American voters, by and large, are not hankering for an enormous tax cut.
And Mr. Gore, who has proposed only about $500 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, has been hammering the Texas governor on the issue, repeatedly claiming that Mr. Bush's plan unnecessarily coddles wealthy Americans at the expense of fiscal prudence.
Mr. Gore said on Monday that Mr. Bush's tax cut would plunge the country into deficits, and today, in a speech in Milwaukee, the vice president added that it would "wreck our good economy and make it impossible to modernize our armed forces and keep them ready for battle."
The burden on Mr. Bush to convince voters that his tax cut is affordable was clear not only in his remarks today but also in those of Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, who talked with reporters after a Bush rally in Peoria, Ill. Mr. LaHood had introduced Mr. Bush at today's event.
Mr. LaHood said that while "there's some appetite" among voters for Mr. Bush's suggested tax cuts, "I think he should also be talking about, 'I want to be able to pay down the debt, too.' I think that is problematic for people."
When Mr. LaHood was asked if Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut was too large, both politically and practically, he said merely that it was "an ambitious proposal" and that "Congress will have some say about it."
"It's very ambitious," Mr. LaHood added. "There's no doubt about it."
During 14 months of campaigning, Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that he is committed to paying down the federal debt, but more often, when he talks about tax cuts, he simply tells people that he wants to return their hard-earned dollars to them. It is a pledge that draws roars of approval from his Republican base.
While some of the numbers that Mr. Bush and his aides used today for surplus and growth projections had been rounded off, they were essentially valid, in line with estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and some economists and political analysts consider Mr. Bush's tax cut to be reasonable.
But others note, among other criticisms of his plan, that if he succeeded in enacting the tax cut, it would be extremely difficult to take it back and raise taxes if the projected surpluses did not materialize.
Mr. Bush and his advisers, for their part, say Mr. Gore is the candidate who is potentially endangering the economy by outlining significantly more new spending than Mr. Bush has.
Today, they cited a report released recently by the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, that estimated that Mr. Gore's spending programs over the next 10 years would exceed the surplus, at least if Mr. Gore did not touch the part of that surplus generated by Social Security taxes, as both he and Mr. Bush have promised.
The Bush campaign's concern about accusations that the governor's tax cut is too large was evident both today and on Monday in the aggressiveness of its responses to criticism by Mr. Gore.
Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign, said Mr. Gore had gone "completely overboard" and grossly distorted the substance and effect of Mr. Bush's proposal.
Mr. Gore was "trying to muddy the waters," Ms. Hughes said. "He doesn't want the American people to know how much money's available."
She also said that while Mr. Bush was calling for tax cuts for Americans at every income level, Mr. Gore's plan, directed more specifically at less affluent Americans, would leave 50 percent of taxpayers, totaling 50 million people, without any tax relief.
Mr. Bush's plan would reduce federal tax rates across the income spectrum, lowering the highest rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent and the lowest rate to 10 percent from 15 percent.
The back-and-forth between the Bush and Gore campaigns about tax cuts, spending and fiscal responsibility reflected a larger aim: each candidate wants to be seen as the more prudent steward of the economy, an issue forever at the top of many voters' concerns.
Mr. Bush's advisers have long reveled in how well Mr. Bush did in polls that asked voters which candidate they trusted more on the issue. But some of the recent surveys that showed Mr. Gore getting an enormous -- and possibly temporary -- bounce out of the Democratic convention also indicated that voters had at least temporarily reassessed his ability to manage the economy.
In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released on Sunday, 50 percent of adults surveyed said Mr. Gore would better handle the economy, while 40 percent said Mr. Bush would. Before either party's convention, a poll by the same organizations showed Mr. Bush with a 47 percent to 40 percent lead on the issue. The margin of sampling error was four percentage points.
On the question of which candidate would better handle the federal surplus, Mr. Gore led Mr. Bush by 48 percent to 41 percent in the recent poll. In the one before the conventions, Mr. Gore trailed Mr. Bush, 38 percent to 49 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE MILITARY DEBATE;
Reluctantly, Cohen Is Joining Tug of War Over U.S. Might

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Ever since President Clinton appointed William S. Cohen secretary of defense in 1996, Mr. Cohen, the only Republican in the cabinet, has repeatedly claimed to represent the bipartisanship needed to manage matters of national security.
Now he finds himself -- by all accounts reluctantly -- at the center of a highly partisan debate over the state of the American military. And it has left him in a highly unusual position: defending the administration while at least indirectly underscoring some of the Republican criticisms leveled against it. 
 On Monday, Mr. Cohen, who represented Maine in the Senate, launched what amounted to a pre-emptive strike against criticisms by Gov. George W. Bush that the Clinton administration was responsible for a weakened, overextended military.
Appearing only hours before Mr. Bush at the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Milwaukee, Mr. Cohen noted not only the budget increases approved by Mr. Clinton, including the biggest pay increases for service members in a generation, but also the fact, rarely mentioned by the Bush campaign, that defense budgets started falling rapidly as the cold war ended. That was when another Bush was president and the governor's running mate, Dick Cheney, was secretary of defense.
The cuts that followed, Mr. Cohen went on to say, reflected a strong bipartisan demand for a "peace dividend" now that the United States no longer faced the Soviet Union.
"My constituents from Maine were demanding it, as were people around the country," Mr. Cohen said.
Vice President Al Gore, who appeared before the group today, offered his own, more partisan defense of the country's military preparedness. Thrusting defense issues to center stage in the presidential campaign for a second day, Mr. Gore went so far as to say that Mr. Bush's repeated attacks on the state of the military "for political advantage" threatened to undercut American credibility in the world. Page A18.
Mr. Cohen had offered a rebuttal, of a sort, to the criticisms that Mr. Bush has repeated throughout his presidential campaign and accentuated since the Republican convention three weeks ago.
Without mentioning Mr. Bush by name -- or for that matter Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore -- Mr. Cohen launched a lengthy, detailed defense of the nation's armed services, contending that they remained strong and ready and proved it in last year's war against Yugoslavia.
At the same time, however, Mr. Cohen left open the need for improvement, suggesting that more work, and money, was needed to meet the pressures on an ever busier military engaged in operations from the Persian Gulf to the Balkans -- something Mr. Bush said he intended to rethink, if elected.
"We can always do better," Mr. Cohen told the veterans, "and national security is certainly a subject matter that is open to debate and improvement. Hopefully that will be the case whatever administration comes in next year."
Mr. Gore, in his appearance today, made that point in a more overt, more partisan, more full-throated way.
"That's not only wrong in fact," Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush's contentions, "it's the wrong message to send to our allies and adversaries across the world."
Mr. Cohen's remarks, by contrast, have been more subtle -- and more conflicted.
While his remarks defending the armed services have sought to counter some of Mr. Bush's criticisms, they have also highlighted shortcomings in spending and readiness that have long been the subject of complaints from Republicans in Congress and even some uniformed leaders.
As a Republican surrounded by Democrats, Mr. Cohen has always been an oddity in Mr. Clinton's cabinet. He caused a minor stir when he told Barbara Walters in April that he and his wife, Janet Langhart Cohen, a Democrat, would "in all probability" vote for different candidates.
Mr. Cohen later said, "I indeed did not surrender my Republican credentials when I agreed to serve in the administration."
Now, he simply declines to say whom he plans to vote for.
Long before he accepted Mr. Clinton's offer to be defense secretary, Mr. Cohen had a reputation as an independent willing to cross party lines to build consensus, particularly when it comes to defense. Aides in the Pentagon said he took seriously the president's willingness to choose a Republican, hoping to renew a bipartisan spirit with his colleagues who control the House and Senate.
Mr. Cohen once said in an interview that he had never sat through a purely political meeting with Mr. Clinton and his advisers; the discussions had always been on the substance of the issues. The political discussions, presumably, began after he left the room.
Mr. Cohen's success as a bridge to the Republicans has been mixed.
Working with the Joint Chiefs of Staff two years ago, he persuaded the administration to agree to a $112 billion increase in defense spending over six years. He has also been the leading administration advocate for building a limited national missile defense.
On the other hand, Mr. Cohen has failed to win over Republicans in many areas, like closing more military bases, and Republican criticisms of Mr. Clinton's defense policies have only intensified in Mr. Cohen's years as secretary.
In May, Mr. Cohen invited Mr. Bush to the Pentagon for a briefing on the state of the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal after Mr. Bush pledged to reduce the number of American nuclear warheads. The invitation was curtly rebuffed.
However proud Mr. Cohen is of his accomplishments at the Pentagon, he is clearly reluctant to weigh in to the political debate over them now that the campaign is in full swing.
He winced when asked at a news conference at the Pentagon on Friday to respond to Mr. Bush's criticism that morale in the ranks was low. When reporters cornered him on Monday to ask about Mr. Bush's remarks, he began by saying, "Well, I want to keep my comments strictly on the facts and the record and to stay out of the politics as much as possible."
A White House official insisted that no one had asked Mr. Cohen to respond to Mr. Bush's criticisms, although Mr. Cohen's remarks clearly indicated that he had the criticisms in mind.
As for the Gore campaign, "when we think of somebody who can speak for the vice president or the Democratic Party on military issues, Bill Cohen is not the first name that pops in our head," a Gore aide said today.
In fact, when Mr. Gore's campaign aides sought a defense expert to brief reporters on the issues the vice president raised today, they had to reach back to Mr. Cohen's predecessor as defense secretary, William J. Perry.
Mr. Cohen was added to the list of Monday's convention speakers relatively late, defense officials said today, and only because his wife was receiving an award from the veterans.
"I am not here as a Republican," Mr. Cohen himself said on Monday. "I am not here on behalf of the Democratic administration."
Mr. Cohen's posture reflects the fine line walked by men and women in uniform, who are prohibited by law and by policy from participating in overtly political events and thus carefully couch any discussion of political points as strictly factual.
Still, Mr. Cohen's defense of the armed forces -- including noting the increase in weapons procurement and highlighting pay raises that officials said have led to rising re-enlistment rates -- are seen by some as an effective counter to the Republican critiques.
"They can't assail Cohen," one person in Mr. Gore's campaign said. "He's a great surrogate for us. No one can accuse him of politicizing the debate."
But that argument has a double edge.
When Mr. Cohen says that more can be done -- and spent -- his words support arguments made by Mr. Bush's supporters.
The same thing happened when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, rebutted Mr. Bush's assertion in his speech in Philadelphia accepting the Republican presidential nomination that 2 of the Army's 10 divisions were not ready to fight a major war.
General Shelton said that was not true, then pointed out that President Clinton's approval of a $112 billion budget increase fell far short of the $148 billion the chiefs had said they needed.

HEADLINE: Charles R. Pierce, 78, Lilco Chief Who Championed Shoreham Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Charles R. Pierce, a former chairman of the Long Island Lighting Company who championed the disputed Shoreham nuclear power plant only to see the project upend his 34-year association with the company, died on Monday.
He was 78 and lived at Lloyd Harbor, near Huntington, N.Y. 
 A precise cause of death has not been determined, according to Peter Connell, the director of the Connell Funeral Home, which is handling the arrangements.
After serving as a bomber pilot in World War II, Mr. Pierce obtained a law degree from Columbia University and in 1949 joined Lilco as a young recruit in the utility company's legal division. He steadily rose through the ranks and was named president and a director in 1974. Four years later, he was selected chairman.
Over the years, Mr. Pierce earned a reputation for smoothing the way for power plants that local residents did not want in their backyards. But it was the Shoreham project that rapidly became most associated with Mr. Pierce.
The project, in Shoreham, 55 miles east of Manhattan on the North Shore, had been undertaken before Mr. Pierce even rose to the level of president. It was originally scheduled to begin operation in 1978, at a cost of $77 million, but delays and numerous cost overruns plagued the project.
By 1982, with resistance to the project growing, Mr. Pierce took to the airwaves with a series of strongly worded radio commercials in favor of Shoreham. The advertisements lasted almost two years and brought Mr. Pierce widespread public recognition.
In defending the project and its cost overruns, Mr. Pierce had long attributed Shoreham's problems to regulatory, construction and financial requirements that he considered unnecessarily stringent, as well as to design changes resulting from "the lessons learned from Three Mile Island." That was the site of a nuclear power plant accident near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979.
Mr. Pierce's tough stance on the Shoreham controversy, which included a refusal to compromise with critics of the project, began to cause some Lilco directors discomfort. In 1984, Mr. Pierce and other managers most identified with Shoreham resigned under pressure.
Four years later, the magnitude of the Shoreham debacle became clear. The plant never opened, yet the project lifted electric rates, monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers for more than a decade and drained more than $5.5 billion from the economy. And in the end, it destroyed Lilco, a company where failure was long considered impossible. In May 1998, the Long Island Lighting Company went out of business after 87 years.
Mr. Pierce is survived by his wife, Virginia; two daughters, Theresa Kelly and Janet Duncan; and one son, Charles R. Jr.

HEADLINE: Still Inflation-Wary, Fed Lets Rates Stand

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up.
The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete. 
 The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. It has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy.
Analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it.
As it often has in recent years under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chose today to be patient but at the same time to offer reassurances that it would move quickly at the first sign of a threat from inflation.
"Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce," the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement.
Nonetheless, the panel said, "the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
The decision means that the Fed is likely to remain on the sidelines for the duration of the presidential campaign. The central bank's policy makers are next to meet on Oct. 3. But the bank has, over the years, tried to avoid taking any action on interest rates in the weeks leading up to Election Day -- which falls this year on Nov. 7. The Fed's first meeting after the election is on Nov. 15.
The outcome of today's meeting had been widely expected by analysts and investors, and there was muted reaction in the financial markets after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. Stocks finished slightly higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 11,139.15, up 59.34 points. Bonds were little changed.
Today's decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been since May, when the central bank raised the rate by half a percentage point. The Fed held rates steady at its subsequent meeting in June.
It also left unchanged, at 6 percent, its discount rate -- the interest rate charged on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system.
The central bank has pushed the federal funds rate up 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999 in an effort to tamp down inflation pressure without snuffing out what earlier this year became the longest business expansion on record.
Some analysts said it was now unlikely that the Fed would raise rates again this year. Others said inflation remained a threat and that it would be a mistake to count the Fed out.
"As intoxicating as a soft-landing scenario is," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago, "we have to remain sober for at least another couple of quarters before we allow ourselves to imbibe of it."
In the second quarter of the year, the economy grew at a 5.2 percent annual rate compared with a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year.
Those figures were well above what many economists think can be sustained over the long run without igniting a spiral in wages and prices. While it remains a moving target, the economy's noninflationary speed limit now seems to be around or just below 4 percent.
Yet inflation has edged up only slightly from very low levels, in large part because the strong economic growth has been accompanied by a surge in business efficiency, or productivity, which improved at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Even as companies find themselves paying more to attract workers in a tight labor market, where unemployment is at 4 percent, and more for raw materials and equipment, they are cutting costs in other areas or improving efficiency by investing in new technology.
Within the Fed, there is a long-running debate about whether productivity improvements can continue to outrun inflation pressure. In keeping rates unchanged today, the Fed seemed to be deferring the matter rather than trying to settle it.
In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that economic indicators were showing "that more rapid advances in productivity" had forced economists to revise upward their estimates of how fast the economy could grow without igniting inflation. At the same time, the committee said, productivity improvements have been "containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures."
But the policy panel suggested that productivity improvements were not a panacea and that the combination of low unemployment and strong growth still had to be viewed as inflationary, especially to the degree that strong demand for goods and services outstripped the economy's ability to keep up.
The committee, the statement said, "remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level."
To some degree, the inflation warning in the statement was intended to keep analysts and traders from concluding that the Fed was signaling an end to this series of rate increases.
In interviews in recent months, several Fed officials said they hoped to keep Wall Street somewhat off balance to prevent another sharp run-up in stock prices. Within the Fed, the wealth generated in the stock market is regarded as a primary driver of consumer spending and overall demand, and another strong rebound on Wall Street, it is feared, could push demand up to a level that would inevitably fuel inflation.
But Fed officials no doubt have other, more fundamental inflation worries on their minds. Oil prices remain quite high, and although their effect on overall consumer prices so far has been somewhat muted, high oil prices could still feed through the economy and accelerate inflation.
There is also concern among some Fed officials that the combination of 4 percent annual growth and 4 percent unemployment will inevitably lead to wage increases that will outstrip productivity gains and put upward pressure on prices.
Mr. Greenspan told Congress last month that he did not think the Federal Reserve would have to drive unemployment higher to prevent inflation. But some of his colleagues -- including Laurence H. Meyer, the Fed governor most closely identified with the school of economists who see a tight link between unemployment and inflation -- are not so sure.

MANHATTAN: PAPER PRIMARY PROTEST
The City Board of Elections refused yesterday to reprint ballots for the Sept. 12 primary that now omit Green Party candidates, and will force party voters to choose their nominees on paper ballots. Green Party candidates will be on voting machine ballots everywhere else in the state. Craig Seeman, the party's state election coordinator, said that it would sue the city in federal court and that the board's claim that there is no room on ballots for the Green Party candidates was unacceptable. The Senate candidates include Al Lewis, above, who played Grandpa on "The Munsters"; Mark Dunau, a farmer from Hancock, N.Y.; and Ron Dugger of Manhattan, a former newspaper publisher. (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: UNEMPLOYMENT PHONES QUIT
An automated service that allows unemployment recipients to claim benefits over the phone was out of order for 27 hours in New York City starting Monday morning, the State Department of Labor said yesterday. Hundreds of recipients who use the telephone system, called Tel-Service, may have been inconvenienced by the disruption, which was caused by a malfunction in a mechanism that routes calls, said Betsy McCormack, department spokeswoman. But, she said, the service was back by noon yesterday, and no one will lose benefits. Nina Siegal (NYT)
 
QUEENS: SHOOTING ARREST
A man was arrested Monday night in a fatal 1998 shooting at a Queens tavern, the police said. The man, Miguel Valerio, 30, was arrested in Chester, Md., after the authorities received a tip. The police said they believe that Mr. Valerio, who worked at a tavern in Sunnyside, followed Francis O'Loughlin, 32, into the bar's bathroom on Sept. 5, 1998, and shot him once in the head. Elissa Gootman (NYT)
 
ALBANY: RECORDS ON HIP SOUGHT
New York State's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, has asked medical groups to supply information about cleaning contracts, building leases and political donations related to their work for the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York. Mr. Spitzer's office and the State Insurance Department have been investigating HIP, a nonprofit company that insures many city workers, and its chief executive, Anthony L. Watson, and whether HIP spent millions on executive perquisites and contracts for board members and friends of Mr. Watson. HIP has said it is cooperating with investigators. Christopher Drew (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: NO EXECUTION, NO PAROLE
A defendant convicted of capital murder who avoids execution faces mandatory life in prison without parole, under a law signed yesterday by the president of the State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, left, who was acting as governor. The law was inspired by Thomas Trantino, who was sentenced to death in the 1963 murder of two law enforcement officers in Lodi, but was spared when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional. The death penalty has been reinstated, but Mr. Trantino, 62, is not subject to the new law and remains eligible for parole. (NYT)
 
MAURICE RIVER: SEX-OFFENDER JAIL WELCOMED
After months of resistance from Woodbridge Township, a 300-bed prison for sex offenders will be built 100 miles south, in Cumberland County. In exchange for $825,000 a year from the state once the prison is operating, Maurice River has agreed to accept the $20 million prison. Last year, the state decided to build the prison in the Avenel section of Woodbridge, on the grounds of East Jersey State Prison and next to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center, which houses sex offenders during their prison terms, but Woodbridge challenged the decision in court. Maurice River, population 6,654, already has two medium-security prisons, which, combined, are its biggest employer. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)
 
TRENTON: TEST SCORES RELEASED
New Jersey officials released a new round of standardized test scores yesterday for public school students in the fourth and eighth grades, but would not disclose the results for fourth-grade language arts literacy. In the writing section, students' scores were so low that the State Education Department's Language Arts Literacy Assessment Committee will review the test scores and the grading. The test, known as the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, was taken by 80,000 fourth graders during the 1999-2000 school year. The fourth-grade science scores did not change significantly from the previous year, with 57.3 percent ranked as proficient. Fourth graders improved in math, with 49.6 percent in the proficient category, up from 47.5 percent. The state's 75,000 eighth graders in public schools scored well in science and language arts, with more than 80 percent ranked proficient or advanced proficient . In math, 67.3 percent demonstrated proficiency, up from 68.5 percent. (NYT)
 
HOLLAND TOWNSHIP: BODY IDENTIFIED
A body pulled from the Delaware River on Saturday was identified as a Pennsylvania man who drowned last week after trying to ride the high water caused by the recent heavy rains, the Hunterdon County medical examiner's office said. The man, Charles Weaver, 58, a high school guidance counselor from Riegelsville, Pa., fell out of his kayak Aug. 15 in the Musconetcong River. (NYT)
 
TRENTON: 3 LEAVE PAROLE BOARD
Three more members of the State Parole Board have stepped down or taken leave, following the resignation of its chairman. The board has been under pressure to explain a backlog of cases and has been under investigation by the state in connection with favorable treatment for inmates with ties to organized crime. Robert Egles, the board's executive director, took a leave of absence; another member, Peter Loos, asked not to be reappointed; and another member, Joseph Ferrera, resigned. Records have been seized from Mr. Egles and the chairman of the 11-member board, Andrew Consovoy, who stepped down on July 28.(NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
NEW HAVEN: SUITS AGAINST MALL PLAN
Make it 16. That's the number of lawsuits filed by opponents of New Haven's plan to build a $500 million mall just east of downtown. Yesterday, a suit was filed in Superior Court in Hartford by Westfield America, owner of a mall in Milford, claiming that the State Office of Policy and Management illegally approved $28 million in tax breaks for the project's developer. Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said Westfield simply wanted to stymie potential competition. The project is expected to add $7 million in annual property taxes and 3,000 jobs to New Haven's limping economy. Opponents say it will destroy downtown businesses. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)

International Paper Going to Connecticut

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
International Paper has agreed to move its combined world headquarters from Purchase, N.Y., to Stamford, Conn., ending a fierce competition between Connecticut and New York for International, the largest maker of paper and forest products in the world.
Connecticut officials and a spokesman for International Paper said yesterday that a verbal agreement was reached after state economic development officials offered a generous package of incentives. 
 International has been in Purchase since 1986, but in June, it bought Champion International Corporation, which is based in Stamford. International will move its 120 headquarters employees from Purchase to the Champion headquarters building 12 miles away in downtown Stamford.
Before the acquisition, Champion had about 375 employees in Stamford. About 265 have been told that their jobs will be eliminated. About 50 more have been given jobs with International, although most of them are to be transferred elsewhere.

HEADLINE: California's Move to Limit Power Rates Hits Resistance

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Mounting political concern over what many are describing as deregulation run amok in the electricity market in San Diego prompted a major but inconclusive battle in the State Assembly today over a bill that would place a broad cap on power costs in the city.
The state utility commission narrowly approved a partial rate cap on Monday for San Diego, the first city in California to be deregulated, but many people said they believed it was too little to help people hit with bills that have doubled or tripled in just a few months. 
 By late tonight the Assembly had not voted on the bill, which the State Senate has passed, 28-0. The bill was facing great resistance because of the expected costs to the state, perhaps many hundreds of millions of dollars.
Several legislative aides said late in the day that it appeared that supporters of the measure simply did not have the votes to pass it and that its fate was unclear.
Nevertheless, the subject of skyrocketing power rates in San Diego, a virtual guinea pig in a pioneering state program, has suddenly become a source of enormous concern because of the unexpected rate change.
Deregulation was undertaken because the Legislature believed it would offer an antidote to what were already exceptionally high power rates in the state, roughly 50 percent above the national average.
Under the deregulation plan, passed in 1996 with the expectation that it would be phased in over many years, utilities had to sell off their generating plants and then purchase power through a state-controlled exchange. San Diego was opened before other cities because of a merger of its utilities to form Sempra Energy.
But many critics have complained that the market was opened before there was a sufficient supply of electricity available, skewing prices upward.
The strong economy and the added burden summer air-conditioning have accentuated the steep jump in wholesale power rates, which have been passed along to consumers.
Many people in the state, including Gov. Gray Davis and the chairman of Sempra Energy, have accused some wholesalers of price gouging, and the governor has written President Clinton, urging him to start a federal investigation.
"Time is of the essence, Mr. President," the Mr. Davis wrote in his letter of Aug. 10. "San Diego consumers have paid an enormous price for deregulation in a market that no one believes is functionally competitive."
Susan Golding, the San Diego mayor, said in an interview that she basically backed deregulation, but that the timing had been so ill-planned that some sort of market intervention was necessary to spare the city a major hiccup in what had been its best economic expansion ever after suffering through a brutal recession.
"In my experience, it takes a very long time to go from a bad economic climate to a good one, but almost no time to go the other way, and that's what I'm afraid could happen here," Mayor Golding said.
"I don't think this bill is the right long-term solution, but I chose to support it because it is needed," she said.
On Monday, the state Public Utility Commission narrowly approved a measure that would cap power costs in the city, but only for small businesses and residents who use 500 kilowatts a month or less. That left many people unsatisfied, particularly since a range of important users, from public schools to the high technology companies that have remade San Diego's economy over the last decade, would feel little improvement.
That prompted the State Assembly to resume its debate of the new bill, which is sponsored by two San Diego area state legislators, Senator Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis.
The bill would roll prices back to their levels in June, before rates began to increase, order the state utility commission to place a firm cap on rates at that level and create a mechanism for passing along excess profits to consumers.
The bill would also mandate an investigation into the spike in rates.

HEADLINE: No Longer A War Zone, Hunts Point Gains Status;
New Services Arrive As City Improvements Lift Bronx Community

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
Utter the name Hunts Point, residents say, and most people who do not know better think grit and grime and crime. Thoughts turn to a desolate and particularly polluted stretch of the South Bronx long associated with streetwalkers, drug dealers, rumbling trucks and a sprawling wholesale food market that offers little in the way of aesthetics.
But these days in Hunts Point, real estate agents regularly knock on Jeannette Johnson's door, offering $200,000 for the elegant century-old town house with the rounded facade where she has lived since 1951. Nearby, William Erazo watches from his window as 42 homes are constructed on a lot where junked cars were once dumped. 
 And Hunts Point is where Bob and Teresa Melendez moved with their teenage son after deciding their apartment in Pelham Bay was too small. It was a homecoming, for both had fled Hunts Point in the 1970's when the neighborhood was being transformed into a wasteland of violence and abandoned buildings.
"You can see the change, the immense change," Ms. Melendez said in her newly renovated two-bedroom apartment on Lafayette Street. "Compared to what it was in the 1970's and 1980's, it's being reborn. We don't see so much graffiti, drugs and stuff, so much garbage. There used to be so much dumping from windows. It's not like that. It's come a long way."
Since 1986, 60,000 homes and apartments have been built or rehabilitated in the South Bronx through city-sponsored programs, and fledgling businesses have begun giving once-barren neighborhoods a try.
These things have come more slowly to Hunts Point, some residents say.
Zoned for industry and the home of waste transfer stations and warehouses, scrap metal shops and the 1.9-million-square-foot Food Distribution Center, Hunts Point had not always been thought of as a place for a residential renaissance, longtime residents and business people in the area say.
But little by little, improvements have come to this sliver of a neighborhood cut off from the rest of the Bronx by the Bruckner Expressway and surrounded on three sides by an industrial park with 650 businesses. Hunts Point's 8,200 residents, most of whom live on a peninsula jutting into the East River known as the Point, are experiencing an array of improvements that have begun or been completed in recent months -- from rehabilitated housing to new park space to the arrival of services the Point never had before, like a post office.
"In the past, the exciting things that would happen in Hunts Point were things like the new Meat Locker coming to the Cooperative Market," said Paul Lipson, executive director of the Point Community Development Corporation, a community group and business incubator. "It was the Fulton Fish Market coming up here. Now there's much more for residents."
A credit union, the area's first banking service in 25 years, will open in October, across Lafayette Street from where the peninsula's first post office is being built. Groundbreaking has begun for a youth recreation center. In June, a new park was inaugurated on the Bronx River. A primary care clinic, also a first, opened last year, and a second is expected to open any week now. And the main street, Hunts Point Avenue, has seen storefront vacancies fall from 60 percent three years ago to about 25 percent today.
The cornerstone of a city-sponsored drive to add new housing is the current construction of 42 two- and three-family homes near Mr. Erazo's front porch on Bryant Street, where he once watched drug deals go down. This was an area once maligned as a war zone, shown as populated by heroin addicts and criminals in the 1981 film "Fort Apache, the Bronx."
"The fact that they're beginning to build homes around here means people are moving in who'll take care of their homes because it's an investment," said Mr. Erazo, 71, a retired salesman who has lived with his family in the house he bought in 1969.
Hunts Point is also selling itself to artists looking for cheap space, with boosters likening the peninsula to the artists' colony in Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The former American Bank Note Company building is offering up to 27,000 of its 365,000 square feet to artists. Seven painters, sculptors and other artisans have rented space since Arthur Aviles and his dance company arrived in 1998. Five others have signed leases and are moving in.
"If you're looking for ribbon and bows, it's not here; it's an uncut diamond," explained Howard T. Cash, a fine arts photographer. "The area is still basically camouflaged. So you have to seek things out. You have to be a journeyman and an explorer. You have to go and ask. But a lot of things are here."
But even its boosters acknowledge that Hunts Point remains a difficult neighborhood in which to raise a family, and wonder how much better a community zoned largely for industry can become.
"I think we're still in the stages of becoming a real community in terms of the residential area; it's not there yet," said Josephine Infante, director of the Hunts Point Economic Development Corporation, which she founded in 1988 when the neighborhood was still at rock bottom. "We're still talking about a poor community. It's not going to look like Riverdale."
Indeed, the peninsula is still saddled with an array of serious problems.
Its residents are among the poorest in the city. In the late 1990's, unemployment remained at 18 percent, and nearly half of all residents draw public assistance. Only 32 percent of children in the local elementary school passed the school board's reading test this year, compared with 40 percent citywide.
Perhaps because of the truck traffic and waste transfer stations, more than 25 percent of all children suffer from asthma, said Dr. Braulio Flores, staff doctor at Bella Vista Health Clinic on Hunts Point Avenue.
Francisco Perez, 57, a member of Mothers on the Move, a local group that has battled industry in the peninsula, said that breathing can be hard for her, too. "I myself have bronchitis and, at times, it becomes so much worse," she said. "We are waiting for a future when we'll have improvements. It's not easy to work in a community that still needs so many changes."
Hunts Point has two dozen waste transfer stations, more than in any other part of the city. Some 12,000 trucks move in and out of the peninsula daily. Warehouses and nearly 100 auto parts suppliers and mechanics provide a scrappy backdrop. A Swedish company is proposing to build a natural gas-powered plant there to produce electricity.
Yet, Mr. Perez and others who have long called for a tighter rein on industry say the Hunts Point of today is far different from the one they knew just a few short years ago. Crime has fallen to the point where there has not been a single homicide in the peninsula this year.
And the Hunts Point Economic Development Corporation is pushing a far-reaching plan that will spend $2.3 million to build medians and plant trees and flowers in streets considered too wide and foreboding for a residential neighborhood. The plan also calls for limiting truck routes to a select number of streets, with color-coded signs and the threat of fines discouraging truckers from taking shortcuts through residential streets.
Signs of renewed life are most apparent, residents say, amid the peninsula's eclectic mix of brick row houses and tenements.
Kristina Hosch, who with her husband, Eddie Torres, owns several Bronx apartment buildings, went into Hunts Point four years ago to inspect city-owned buildings that were being offered to investors. On that first day, Ms. Hosch recalled, she requested a police escort to tour buildings infested with drug dealers. Today, the four buildings they own have been renovated and painted, with well-lighted hallways, working intercom systems and polished tiles. Recent renovations have left apartments with new hardwood floors, windows and appliances. Tenants have flocked to fill the 172 apartments in the buildings.
"I never thought it would lose the Hunts Point stereotype and that you'd have the eagerness to get into the buildings," she said. "Now, we're seeing the transformation. As soon as people look at the apartments, they want to rent, the same day."
Michael Faust, another developer, decided two years ago to buy a 20-unit building that had been gutted. Now, he is to begin $2 million in renovations financed with loans sponsored by the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The hope, said Mr. Faust, whose company has rehabilitated buildings in neighborhoods like Fort Greene in Brooklyn that have become chic, is that the peninsula will undergo a similar revival.
"This has been one of the untainted or untouched communities," Mr. Faust said, "and now people are going there to fix up, and I think it's a good low-income or moderate-income area that's up and coming."
It was not always that way, even on the peninsula's most charming street, Manida, with row after row of elegant, brick homes.
Jeannette Johnson should know, having seen Manida Street at its best in 1951 when she and her husband, the bandleader Buddy Johnson, first moved in. Then came the 1960's and 1970's, when drug dealers took over, the garbage piled up and her neighbors fled.
These days, though, Ms. Johnson gets unsolicited visits from real estate agents who want her home, a handsome, two-family brick structure with fine moldings and elegant touches. "They want to buy the homes here now," said Ms. Johnson, whose son, Woodrow, a teacher, lives in the second-floor apartment. "You would never think they would want to buy homes in Hunts Point. But now, they're offering $245,000."
Hugh Coley, a real estate broker with Century 21 Future Homes, is among those who have made a point of staking out homes on the peninsula.
"Five years ago, I mean they were selling for $30,000, $40,000, $50,000," he said. "That was just the way the market was at that point. No one would want those houses down there. But now, there's talk about businesses moving into the area, and people are looking for investments over there."
Ms. Johnson explains that while she may some day move, for now she is happy.
"Where else can you get a two-family home like this?" she said. "You walk out, it's nice out here. You can park your car out front. It's clean. It's quiet. It's good."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
An Eastern Fantasia, Asleep for a Century

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

DATELINE: CLAVERACK, N.Y.

 BODY:
TREND-WATCHERS, take note: Lockwood de Forest may be big. Very big.
De Forest, a turn-of-the-century artist and designer who rose to eminence, then sank into obscurity, is now on the brink of rediscovery. A Manhattan gallery recently featured some of his oil sketches. A desk embodying his design philosophy is part of an exhibition on Orientalism at Williams College in Massachusetts. The Indian-style interiors he championed are being echoed by hip designers like Muriel Brandolini and Lulu Kwiatkowski. And in this Hudson River Valley village two hours north of New York City, furniture and architectural elements he produced have been brought together by the filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory in what must be his first one-man design show since the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition. 
 Scion of a New York clan whose family tree blossoms with myriad lawyers and the occasional flamboyant -- a great-uncle was the painter Frederic E. Church, and a great-niece was the Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick -- Lockwood de Forest was a pivotal member of Associated Artists, a short-lived design firm founded by Louis Comfort Tiffany.
Its specialty was self-conscious splendor, exotic interiors that were one part ABC Carpet & Home, one part "Arabian Nights." Brass lanterns hung from stenciled ceilings. Persian carpets were flung over harem-style balustrades. Fireplaces glimmered with Moorish tiles. And thanks to a woodcarving studio that de Forest discovered in Ahmadabad, on the Arabian Sea coast of India, his trendy ensembles for clients like the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad heiress Mary Garrett and her lover Martha Carey Thomas, a president of Bryn Mawr College, incorporated exquisite teak furniture and architectural fittings that resemble petrified lace.
The eight chairs, two tables, chest of drawers, fireplace surround, two doors, two settees and standing screen in "Lockwood de Forest" at the Merchant and Ivory Foundation exemplify the top-dollar exoticism that was de Forest's hallmark in the 1880's, the high point of a fitful career that ended when he died in 1932 at 82. Rendered in cinnamon-colored teak with delicately chiseled foliate and geometric designs -- there are a couple of cast-iron firebacks, too -- most of the pieces come from the collection of David L. Petrovsky, who owns an eponymous antiques shop in nearby Hudson.
On a recent visit, Mr. Petrovsky gazed wide-eyed at the feet of a gleaming armchair produced by Indian woodcarvers working under de Forest's direction. "Look at those," he said. "They look like garlic bulbs with toenails." Eye-catchingly odd, yes, but no more so than the bizarre finials higher up: the heads of impassive Hindu deities surmounted by sawtooth tiaras. The show, which closes Sept. 4, is one of several marking the 10th anniversary of the Merchant and Ivory Foundation, an arts organization founded by the Oscar-winning filmmakers. Its headquarters are in red-painted gristmill buildings near their Greek Revival house, which have been turned into exhibition and performance spaces.
"We've never had a show like this," said Mr. Ivory, whose latest film, an adaptation of Henry James's "Golden Bowl," starring Uma Thurman, will open this fall. "But a couple of months ago, David suggested it, and Ismail and I thought, 'Why not?' De Forest's work is very intriguing, and both Ismail and I are fascinated by everything to do with India, for obvious reasons."
Lockwood de Forest was not the only American aesthete of his time who fell under the spell of India, a country that became a pop-culture influence after Queen Victoria became its empress in 1876. But the largely self-taught artist, designer and architect was the most passionately pro-India Yankee of his time, the American equivalent of John Lockwood Kipling, father of the empire-thumping poet and curator of a museum in the Indian city of Lahore (now in Pakistan) in the days of the British Raj.
Just as the elder Kipling's scholarship led him to create widely admired Indian-style rooms -- a dining room at Queen Victoria's Osborne House on the Isle of Wight and a billiard room for her son the Duke of Connaught at his country house in Surrey, Bagshot Park, now the home of Prince Edward -- de Forest's passion for the Mogul art and architecture of the subcontinent led him to install similar spaces from Ithaca to San Francisco.
"The 1880's were his glory days," said Roberta A. Mayer, an art historian, who lives in Hopewell, N.J. De Forest's work was exhibited to acclaim at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886, and at the World's Columbian Exhibition seven years later, attracting an impressive array of clients: the steel king Andrew Carnegie, the transportation magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes, the hotelier Potter Palmer, even Mark Twain.
Though he did not have a hand in its design, a stylistically related desk by Associated Artists is featured in "Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America, 1870-1930," an exhibition that runs through Sept. 4 at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. Made of satinwood, brass, pewter and leather, it embodies everything that Associated Artists and de Forest stood for in the late 19th century: Eastern exoticism conjured for Western millionaires.
De Forest visited India on his honeymoon in 1879, a nearly two-year trip that he turned to his economic advantage, keeping his eye peeled for objects and inspirations that would benefit Associated Artists. In Ahmadabad, he met Muggunbhai Hutheesing, a philanthropist whose woodcarving studio would become crucial to de Forest's career. The studio was only a small component of a family fortune built on some of India's largest carpet and textile factories, as well as on opium trafficking.
Unlike European Orientalists, many of whom looked upon Asia and the Middle East with colonialist superiority, de Forest wanted to help the cause of Indian woodworkers and preserve traditional Indian arts and crafts, which were being forgotten in the wake of brightly varnished knockoffs being made in Paris. His equally enthusiastic wife, Meta, had her couturier transform cheap Indian cottons into dresses that were the envy of her friends -- until they learned of the fabrics' "lowly" (i.e., non-Western) provenance.
"Having committed themselves as to the beauty of the material, it was difficult for them to crawl out of it with either grace or success," Lockwood de Forest gleefully recalled. "We had a fine chance to rub their ignorance in, which we often enjoyed doing." By directing Hutheesing's carvers to copy or adapt centuries-old details from mosques, temples, tombs and mansions -- designs that were used in de Forest's interiors, furniture and accessories, including a wall bracket at Olana, the house of Great-Uncle Frederic -- one small part of India's artistry could continue to flourish, albeit reinterpreted in costly Western settings.
Part of him had a romantic response to all that beauty, but he was pragmatic, too, Ms. Mayer said: "He wanted to make his art into a legitimate profession, a way to create beauty and make money at the same time."
Unfortunately, de Forest's Indian experiment appealed to a fickle audience too conscious of fads to be loyal to his narrow vision. By the turn of the century, his romantic rooms were passe, a victim of the Francophile chic popularized by Elsie de Wolfe and Ogden Codman Jr. By 1908, he had sold his stock of moldings and furniture to his old friend Tiffany and retired to Santa Barbara, Calif., where he spent much of his remaining life quietly painting. (His son, another Lockwood, would become one of the state's great landscape designers.)
Apparently, not one de Forest interior survives intact, and even the bits and pieces remaining are not completely appreciated. His teak room for Andrew Carnegie, for instance, still occupies its second-floor spot in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the former Carnegie mansion, though its furniture was sold long ago and its carvings are obscured under temporary exhibition walls. As for de Forest's furniture, no one knows precisely how much was produced, a mystery that deepens when it becomes clear that none was labeled or marked, thus making it difficult to distinguish it from the often fine copies produced by competitors.
But it does show up periodically, often misidentified, at auctions and other, less likely, places. In 1995, Mr. Petrovsky discovered a seven-piece suite of furniture in a consignment shop in New Canaan, Conn. He says that Mitchell Wolfson Jr., founder of the Wolfsonian museum in Miami Beach, recently bought more than 100 pieces of carved teak, each a different pattern and individually numbered, apparently a set of samples that the artist used to guide the Ahmadabad carvers.
Even with the uncertainty, some of Lockwood de Forest's magic lingers. A house he designed in Baltimore is now an Indian restaurant called the Brass Elephant. His furnishings for Mary Garrett are scattered throughout several rooms in the Bryn Mawr alumnae house. As for the brick town house that de Forest built for himself at 7 East 10th Street between 1886 and 1888, once heralded as the most Indian house in America, it is now the Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life at New York University. Its extraordinary lacelike interiors have suffered over time, but its teak-bedecked facade, like that of the elaborate Burmese-style Ava apartments next door, is splendidly unaltered, an incongruous reminder of a trendsetter who once reigned in a city that too often forgets.
The Lockwood de Forest exhibition is open for the next two weekends, Aug. 25 to 27 and Sept. 1 to 4, at the Red Mills gallery, on Route 23 just east of Patroon Street in Claverack, N.Y. Hours: 1 to 5 P.M. Free admission. Information: (212) 586-6014.

HEADLINE: GENERATIONS;
Raising More Than Consciousness Now

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
BESS GORNICK was an only-in-New-York New Yorker. The kind of woman who, living alone at age 90 in a Manhattan apartment, thought nothing of bounding up to a police officer, with the back of her sweater half-fastened, and demanding, "Button me!"
The city and its tempestuous motion -- its bus drivers, cashiers, pretzel vendors, street talkers, dog walkers -- were a perpetual source of renewal to Mrs. Gornick, a "working-class toughie from the Bronx," in the words of her daughter, the writer Vivian Gornick. 
 When Bess became housebound in the mid-1980's, unable to roam freely, her deterioration was rapid. Within herself, she began to drift, growing listless and withdrawn. "For the first time in her life she lost definition," Ms. Gornick recalled. "My mother had suddenly become a generic old woman." But one day, Ms. Gornick brought along a friend to visit, and in no time at all her mother and friend were deep in conversation. "The change in my mother was astonishing," the writer recalled. "She began to look again like herself."
Those last years of Bess Gornick's life made her daughter, who has inherited both her socialist mother's vigor and luminous skin, think about her own aging, and of the loss of connections that Bess craved. Their situations were strikingly similar. Like many creative city people, Ms. Gornick lives and works alone, one of the legions, she has written, who "stare out the window of a room empty of companionship." Like many writers and artists, she finds herself growing old without a pension or benefits.
"I looked around at my own soul," Ms. Gornick said the other day in Greenwich Village, while engaged in her mother's favorite activities, walking and talking fast. "I discover as I go on that the loneliness is crippling."
Thus was born the idea for the House of Elder Artists, or Thea, a confederacy of kindred souls dedicated to creating an un-retirement home for female writers, artists, community activists -- and those game enough to grow old among them. They envision Thea, as yet unbuilt, as a sort of Yaddo with superintendents: a nonprofit residence and cultural center in Manhattan with 100 rental apartments, many reserved for people of low to modest means. To build it, the group has teamed up with the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to women's housing issues, although the project must still surmount major hurdles, from finding a site to securing financing. Today, communal living arrangements of various sorts are appealing to a broad group of single women. From shared housing, where housemates are often matched by nonprofit or religious groups like the National Shared Housing Resource Center, to golf resorts in Florida for those seeking the Dinah Shore lifestyle, housing is beginning to address profound statistical realities: between 1970 and 1998, the number of women living alone across the country doubled, from 7.3 million to 15.3 million, according to the American Association of Retired Persons. In New York City alone, 41.8 percent of all women age 65 and older live alone, versus 20.8 percent of the men.
In many ways, the Gornicktchiks are following squarely in the tradition of the material feminists of the 19th century, women like Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who proposed a feminist apartment hotel in New York City and campaigned for redesigned spaces that would support women's public work and end their physical isolation.
The group currently is made up of the advocates of yesteryear, as one puts it, including the novelist Helen Yglesias, 85, the writer Alix Kates Shulman, 67; the children's book illustrator and author Vera B. Williams, 72, the documentary filmmaker Lilly Rivlin, 62, and assorted lawyers, judges, painters and Village leftists, 53 and older.
"You might say, Why now? Why us?" Emily Goodman, a judge in her 50's, said over Italian food in a Manhattan restaurant one recent evening with some Thea sisters. They shared some dishes, rejecting the ones saturated in olive oil as too fattening. ("Are we going to do this at Thea?" one wondered.)
"We're a group who've always been involved in movements," Ms. Goodman said. "If we sat around and waited, it would never happen."
Ms. Gornick, who pulls up a Murphy bed each morning to make space for her office at home, speaks of spiritual isolation as the great, largely unspoken fear. In her 1987 memoir, "Fierce Attachments," she recalls life in the Bronx tenement apartment building where she grew up, the connection her mother felt each time she opened the window onto the alley, where women were calling to each other, "the sound of their voices mixed with the smell of clothes drying in the sun."
As an old woman, she said, her mother had an even stronger desire to connect to the life of the city, but she became unable to reach out. "My mother and her friends got old sealed off in little apartments," she said.
As more women live alone and housing costs climb, "shelter poverty" among older women is rising, said Marci LeFevre, a consultant for the AARP, resulting in more and more older women pooling resources to live together.
"When you think about it," said Ms. Williams, whose eyes exude youthful mischief, "it's odd that it should be unusual that people who've had great autonomy get together to think about arranging their lives as they get older."
In contrast to the glory days of the feminist movement, middle-age women prefer sofas to the floor. Thea has gone through many permutations since Ms. Gornick went through her phone book three years ago and invited "almost every woman I'd known in the past 20 years" to think about her proposition.
It was probably fortunate that David Letterman was not a fly on the wall. The original idea was a feminist retirement residence, a concept that was shot down almost immediately by the room of feminists.
Ms. Gornick remembers the conversation:
"Too broad."
"Too narrow."
"Too inclusive."
"Too restricting."
"What, no men?"
The second suggestion was to make it a residence for women in the arts. But that didn't wash with the lawyers. ("What, no men?") The third idea was to make Thea a residence for women active in political causes. ("Activists? What does that mean? They'll think were Communists." "What, no men?") The meetings went on -- and on -- with about 20 to 30 women in attendance. "It was talk, talk, talk that went nowhere, like an academic faculty meeting," Ms. Gornick recalled.
Then one night, Ms. Rivlin said, "Why are we calling this a retirement home? Who's retiring? We have to be a part of the polis, the city, and have the city come to us." It was a galvanizing moment. "Every face in the room lit up," Ms. Gornick said.
The idea took hold of a residence organized around a strong shared public sense of things, in her words, where writers and artists would give back to the city and keep their own working minds alive by inviting the neighborhood in for master classes, readings and the like. The preliminary ideas call for a common dining room as well as studio space and rooms for public performances.
But the endless tortured discussions about minutiae might have continued to eternity had Thea not hooked up with Nancy Biberman, a housing advocate, developer and lawyer, who founded the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation and was responsible for the $23 million transformation of the vacant Morrisania Hospital in the South Bronx into a low-income apartment building for 132 families, many of them formerly homeless.
Ms. Biberman, 52, whose first experience with building was barricading Hamilton Hall at Columbia University in 1968, became a partner with Thea and the project's developer. To make Thea a reality in Manhattan, she said, as either a new building or a renovated one, would cost about $20 million. About $16 million would come from tax-exempt bonds through the city's Housing Development Corporation, a loan that would be repaid with rental income over 30 years.
Thea also qualifies for tax credits, because it has committed itself to setting aside 20 percent of its one- and two-bedroom apartments for low-income tenants. The sliding scale of rents would range from $857 to $3,500, including two meals a day, with residents selected by lottery. The design would allow spaces for home health-care attendants, whose services might be shared.
The women of Thea themselves will need to raise an additional $2 million. The project is so daunting that some members of the original group have dropped out, among them the writer Susan Brownmiller. "Fund-raising wasn't my thing, and the whole project sounded fearfully expensive," she said.
Given the current real estate climate, would the group consider living outside Manhattan? Ms. Gornick wouldn't hear of it, convinced not only of the long-term benefits of Manhattan's cultural richness but also of the contributions the group could make to it. She remembers once asking her mother, the ultimate Manhattanite, to consider moving to Florida. Not long afterward, Ms. Gornick went there on assignment.
"Ma!" she shrieked into the telephone. "You were right! I hope you die in a blizzard running for the 23rd Street crosstown."
Last year, Ms. Biberman said, the group negotiated for an option to purchase a piece of vacant land on West 46th Street but chose not to pursue it because of a more desirable possibility. "We're pursuing that now," she said.
The walls of Thea, which could resemble a gray-haired version of a 60's college dorm, would be resonant with the rich experiences of women like Ms. Yglesias, whose latest novel, "The Girls," is about four sisters in their 80's and 90's living in Miami. Ms. Yglesias, who has three children and five grandchildren, divides her time between a house in Maine, where she hires people to drive her around, and the Markle Residence in Greenwich Village, an intergenerational apartment building run by the Salvation Army.
She published her first novel, "How She Died," at age 54, after raising a family. "Life intervenes for many women," she said. "I was lucky." She remains committed despite the fact that she may not live to see the project's fruition. Ms. Yglesias, who describes herself as "a seasoned voyager in the territory of the aged," continued, "I don't really think in terms of Thea happening in time for me, not that I brood."
Like Ms. Gornick, Ms. Williams regards Thea not only as a personal solution but as a social model. She has already pioneered alternative housing: in 1955, she and a group of friends from Black Mountain College in North Carolina got together to establish a radical cooperative community at Stony Point, N.Y.
Today, she shares a graffiti-spattered waterfront studio in the Village with fellow artists and, after years living alone, has begun sharing her apartment with a roommate. "I'm not interested in the acquisition of property or furnishing places," she said. "They don't fascinate me the way solving social problems does."
She wasn't sure at first she had the energy for Thea. "There's a reluctance to make any plans for old age, because you're reluctant to be old," she said. "You need solitude. But you also need crosscurrents. Here you would be in a place where you might be needed by other people, where there would be others around to talk about your work. It would be enlivening, harder to get into ruts. "
Most important, she said, eyes crinkling, "It would be fun."
It would be a place where Ms. Gornick could continue writing about "the lovely human bustle at noon, a density of urban appetites and absorptions." In an essay she describes the searing New York loneliness "that engulfs me like dry heat." She finds an antidote walking the city streets -- as she hopes to do at age 95 -- grinning to herself at the exhilarating lengths people will go to to survive, the "50 different ways people struggle to remain human until the very last minute.
"I join the anxiety," she writes, "I share the condition. I feel in my nerve endings the common refusal to go under."

HEADLINE: AIDS Risk in Nigeria

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Against Tough Odds, Nigeria Bets on Reform" (front page, Aug. 20): Nigeria is in grave peril from H.I.V. and AIDS. The H.I.V. infection rate is relatively low, an estimated 5 percent compared with 20 percent in South Africa. So Nigeria still has a chance to prevent catastrophe.
The key is to empower the country's 26 million adolescents, aged 10 to 19, by providing the information and services, education and employment opportunities they need to avoid risky sex. 
 The United States should do all it can to support this generation of Nigerians, especially the girls. If we don't, as Prof. Ibironke Akinsete, the chairwoman of Nigeria's National Action Committee on AIDS, has said, "we will not have a next generation."

HEADLINE: Relief for the Hungry

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Given the necessarily partisan character of presidential candidates' nomination acceptance speeches (front page, Aug. 19), it is heartening to find 188 members of Congress willing to take a bipartisan approach to a problem that besets poor families, including the working poor. These are the 28 senators and 160 representatives who are co-sponsors of the Hunger Relief Act. 
 The bill would restore food stamps to all legal immigrants, make special provisions for families that pay more than 50 percent of their income for lodging, and increase financing for emergency food providers.
In their letter urging other members to sign on as co-sponsors, the sponsors remind us that "over 30 million Americans live with hunger or the threat of hunger." One hopes the remaining members will follow suit.

HEADLINE: Clinton Defends the Outlay Of $1.3 Billion to Colombia

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton today defended his decision to sign a waiver freeing up $1.3 billion in anti-drug assistance for Colombia, saying that the country is improving on human rights even though the government of Andres Pastrana has yet to meet all the conditions imposed by Congress.
"I did it because I believe President Pastrana is committed to dealing with the human rights issues, about which we're still very concerned," said Mr. Clinton, who signed the national security waiver on Tuesday night, a week before he flies to Colombia for a brief trip. 
 Congress voted in July to support a White House request for economic and military aid to Colombia, a package designed to interrupt the flow of cocaine and heroin to the United States.
The aid package, called Plan Colombia, includes $1 billion to train and equip the army and police forces of Colombia, as well as additional funds to promote economic development, judicial reform and human rights improvements. Congress put conditions on the assistance amid concerns about the Colombian military's poor human rights record and ties to paramilitary groups.
But lawmakers said Mr. Clinton could waive the conditions for national security reasons.
Mr. Clinton's use of the waiver was widely expected but it still drew criticism from some members of Congress and human rights organizations, who accused him of overlooking the Colombian military's brutal record.
"There is no need or justification for waiving the conditions," said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who pushed for conditions on the aid. "These conditions are nothing more than what the Colombian government and our administration said they would do, and this is not too much to ask."
Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota and opponent of the aid package, was even more critical. "A waiver that ignores Colombia's abysmal human rights situation gives the green light to the Colombian military to continue business as usual," Mr. Wellstone said.
But Mr. Clinton, in a Rose Garden appearance today with reporters, said the situation in Colombia was too precarious to wait.
"I think we've protected our fundamental interests in human rights and enabled Plan Columbia to have a chance to succeed, which I think is very, very important for the long-term stability of democracy and human rights in Colombia and for protecting the American people and the Colombia people from the drug traffic," the president said.
Among the conditions imposed by Congress were requirements that the military suspend personnel believed to have committed human rights violations and that it set up a judge advocate general corps to investigate abuses. Of seven conditions over all, Mr. Pastrana has satisfied only one, by issuing a statement warning the military that soldiers accused of human rights abuses will be tried in the country's civilian courts.
But Mr. Clinton, exercising a waiver on the ground of national security, declared that a "drug emergency" exists in Colombia and that Mr. Pastrana is making progress on human rights. The president said the United States could still turn down specific military units for aid if abuses were uncovered.
Administration officials said that while Colombia is improving its human rights climate, it is unlikely to meet one condition imposed by Congress -- that it eliminate the country's total coca and opium poppy production by 2005. The Colombian government has a goal of eliminating half its drug crop over the next five years, officials said. Eliminating all the cultivation, the officials said, would require even more resources.
"Colombia confronts a drug emergency that directly affects the United States," the White House said in a memorandum justifying the waiver. "In spite of aggressive counter-drug efforts, coca cultivation in Colombia has increased 140 percent over the last five years. This massive rate of increase threatens to reverse the counter-drug successes in Peru and Bolivia."

HEADLINE: Texas Takes Step on Warming; Some See Shift in Bush's Position

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Texas' three natural resource commissioners, all appointees of Gov. George W. Bush, said yesterday that global warming was a serious problem and that the state would explore ways to cut its emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
The decision, although just a tentative move toward action, was praised by some private environmental groups. They said it could signal a shift in the global-warming stance of Mr. Bush, who so far has said that although earth's climate appears to be warming, more research must be done to determine whether human activities are the cause. 
 Asked about the prospect of any such shift, Michael Jones, a spokesman for the governor's office, would say only that the commission's action "is a step in the right direction to help us get the information we need to address this issue."
International negotiations on cutting greenhouse gases are to resume this fall, and emission reductions are an issue on which Mr. Bush and his presidential campaign opponent, Vice President Al Gore, have sharply differed. Mr. Gore has pushed for aggressive action to cut emissions, while Mr. Bush has cautioned against haste.
The decision yesterday in Texas, which produces far more greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels than any other state, was the response by the Natural Resource Conservation Commission to a petition filed last month by private environmental groups asking the state to create an emission-cutting plan.
Twenty-five states already have such plans, or are drafting them, and 35 compile annual tallies of greenhouse gas emissions. But in Texas, where it has been almost a decade since the Legislature authorized the commission to write rules governing such gases, nothing even preliminary has resulted until now.
For the moment, the commission is planning only a thorough review of the state's data on emissions, a review of scientific research on the problem and an appraisal of other states' climate programs. Some conservative groups opposed to big emissions cuts pointed out happily that the agency was essentially calling for more research and putting off any commitment to cuts until late next year at the earliest.
Nonetheless Peggy Venable, the director of one such group, Texas Citizens for a Sound Economy, lamented what she described as pressure on the agency stemming largely from election-year politics.

HEADLINE: Visas for Mexican Workers

 BODY:
Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has some provocative if premature ideas about cross-border immigration. His ultimate goal is free movement of labor across an open border. But that is not practical anytime soon. With the more than tenfold gap between United States and Mexican wages, the migration would be all one way, as low-wage Mexican workers competed with the poorest, least skilled Americans. So for now, Mr. Fox would like to see Washington significantly increase the number of temporary visas available to Mexican workers. In exchange, Mexico would strengthen policies to discourage illegal emigration to the United States. That is an experiment worth discussing.
America's current border enforcement policies are not working well. The nearly $1 billion a year Washington spends to police its southern border has not measurably reduced the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Around 340,000 Mexicans enter the United States every year, well over half of them illegally. Traditionally, illegal immigration has provided a safety valve for Mexican governments and low-wage labor for American employers. But it has also been a source of diplomatic tension, particularly when would-be immigrants are killed by border agents or unscrupulous smugglers or die from the effects of heat and dehydration. 
 Mr. Fox proceeds from the realistic assumption that the number of Mexicans entering the United States each year, either legally or illegally, will not fall below 340,000. But he would like to see a significantly larger proportion of that total given legal status, through the issuance of tens of thousands of additional work visas annually. He would also like legal status granted to many Mexicans who entered the United States illegally in the past.
In return, Mexico could crack down on Central Americans who cross its territory to enter the United States illegally, and enforce racketeering laws against smuggling syndicates. Any increases in the number of American visas should be linked to evidence of improved Mexican border enforcement.
Some Americans fear that adding temporary visas for Mexicans will drive down wages of low-income Americans, and that any amnesty for those here illegally will only invite future illegal crossings. But the border is already highly porous. Some experts believe that a well-conceived program along the lines Mr. Fox suggests could produce a long-term drop in illegal crossings. Legalized immigrants also have greater ability to unionize and demand decent conditions, making them less likely to undermine the status of low-wage Americans.
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush will both meet the new Mexican leader during his current visit to the United States. Both candidates should use the opportunity to learn more about his immigration ideas.

Home Heating Oil Prices Surge on Sudden Drop in Inventories

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Consumers received another dose of bad news on the energy front yesterday as an unexpected decline in crude oil inventories sent home heating oil prices to their highest in a decade.
The surprising drop was reported in two surveys, one by the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, and one by the United States Energy Information Administration, released yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for October delivery jumped 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $32.02 a barrel, while the price of heating oil for September delivery rose 5.26 cents, or 5.8 percent, to 95.61 cents a gallon. 
 What this means for this winter is still hard to predict. But the average price of home heating oil this month is 52.5 percent more than it was in August 1999 and 23 percent above the average for last fall and winter. And although last fall and winter were warm by historical standards, the average cost of home heating oil, based on the futures price, was the third-highest since the winter of 1989-90 and missed being second highest by less than 0.2 cent.
By examining some of the factors that will affect the price of crude oil and home heating oil, one can, at the least, get a sense of what will make for a really bad winter or where some relief -- in addition to more OPEC oil -- can come from.
One way to do this is to look at the winter of 1996-97. That was the last time that distillate oil stocks, from which home heating oil is made, were even tighter than they are now. According to the American Petroleum Institute, there were 106.1 million barrels of distillate in inventory at this time in August 1996, compared with the current inventory of 111.1 million barrels.
At this time in August 1996, the price of home heating oil was around 60 cents a gallon and on its way to a peak of 76.49 cents a gallon in October. That price was not surpassed until last winter, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed its production to push crude oil prices back up from lows of less than $11 a barrel to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf war.
A very cold fall in 1996 helped keep the price of home heating oil bouncing up back near the October high. According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center in Ithaca, N.Y., that fall in the Northeast was the 15th coldest since 1895.
But the pressure was let off as the actual winter turned out to be one of the warmest ever, the 11th warmest, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center. By the end of January, when the weather pattern was becoming apparent, the price of home heating oil began to plunge, falling as low as 52.54 cents a gallon on March 5, 1997.
Still, that fall and winter had the second-highest average home heating futures price since 1989.
If it is cold this fall, "the price can go very high," said Irene King, the senior markets analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company.
She also said that the high cost of natural gas, which jumped 8.5 cents yesterday, to $4.605 per million British thermal units, will probably lead many companies that have the ability to do so to switch to distillates. That would put more pressure on heating oil supplies and prices. Natural gas inventories themselves are near six-year lows.
Beyond the fall and winter weather and what happens to inventories in that time, the politics of the United State presidential election and the politics and production problems within OPEC will be the other big factors affecting how much it will cost to keep warm this winter.
The Clinton administration is again mentioning the possibility of using oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help push prices lower. And the connections of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to the oil industry will sharpen the focus on the issue this fall, especially if it is cold.
Within OPEC, the key player, in terms of possible relief, is still Saudi Arabia, which pretty much went out on its own to pump more oil as oil prices rose earlier this summer. So far, strong demand has kept oil inventories surprisingly tight, offsetting the benefit of that extra production.
Many oil analysts think that the rising price of crude oil, which is just below its decade high of $34.13, and heating oil will put added pressure on the OPEC members to agree to pump more oil when they meet in Vienna in early September.
The members have already agreed on an informal trigger for the pumping of more oil: if crude oil stays above $30 a barrel for West Texas intermediate for 20 consecutive trading days.
But oil politics could make OPEC members ignore this mechanism or work to get the price just below the trigger level just long enough to force the beginning of another 20-day period. One reason that many OPEC members are not interested in approving an increase in production is that they are already pumping at full capacity. Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, oil analysts say, have the ability to increase their current production levels of crude oil.
President Clinton said yesterday that he would discuss the high oil price this weekend when he meets with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a member of OPEC. In comments to reporters in Washington, Mr. Clinton indicated that he understood that capacity restraints within OPEC were a problem. "We have to look at where there is excess capacity," he said, adding that "this is a question of whether the OPEC nations can increase their production."
But, he added, "I'm going to do what I can to keep these prices moderated and to continue to argue to all the OPEC nations that if the price gets too high they will cause recession."
"The oil price," he said, "needs to be, I think, in the low $20's somewhere."

HEADLINE: Only 2 Developers Express Interest in Building Trading Complex for Stock Exchange

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
New York City officials are finding that the road to building a new trading complex for the New York Stock Exchange can be long and bumpy.
In response to solicitations by the Giuliani administration, only two developers told the city last Friday that they were interested in building the proposed $727 million, 1.9-million-square-foot trading complex and office tower on a block bounded by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place. Two other developers approached by the city's Economic Development Corporation decided that the project was too complicated and risky, according to real estate executives involved in the talks. 
 And 20 months after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans for the heavily subsidized project in the financial district, the New York Stock Exchange has still not signed a formal agreement with the Giuliani administration, although city officials say a deal is imminent, as they have been saying for more than a year.
"I think we're getting close," said Michael Carey, president of the Economic Development Corporation. "I continue to be optimistic that the project will go forward."
Mr. Carey said he was close to concluding a deal to buy the site from the property owners, J. P. Morgan and the Rockrose Development Corporation. The state would condemn one other parcel on the block.
Tishman Speyer Properties and Brookfield Financial Properties both indicated interest in the stock exchange project, but the Rudin real estate family and Boston Properties took a pass. The city has told the applicants that it wanted to select a developer by Sept. 1.
In one bright spot, the American International Group, one of the world's largest insurance companies, has expressed interest in occupying a part of the office tower over the trading complex, real estate executives and a city official said. But the company has made no commitments and says it is unsure yet how much space it needs.
City officials are hoping that the sale of development rights for the office tower will more than offset the projected $350 million cost of acquiring the block across the street from the stock exchange's historic Wall Street home.
"The trick is to get a tenant," said one real estate executive working with A.I.G. "But this is not even close to being done. It's very murky."
The proposed project has been clouded by rapid changes in the financial industry -- toward electronic trading -- as well as by the complicated nature of the deal.
Two years ago, the stock exchange threatened to move to New Jersey if the city could not help it expand beyond its cramped, 97-year-old quarters on Wall Street. Many urban planners and real estate executives doubted that the exchange would relocate, especially since most of the large investment banks that trade at the exchange had invested in Manhattan real estate and received tax breaks for promising to remain in New York.
But Mayor Giuliani said the city could not risk losing the stock exchange, and in December 1998, city and state officials agreed to build a new trading complex and provide $160 million in tax breaks. The cost for the trading complex itself has since grown to $482 million.
At the same time, some securities analysts have questioned the need for expanded trading floors, given the rapid growth of electronic trading. Electronic networks now account for 37 percent of the trades on the Nasdaq and about 3 percent of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange, according to the Tower Group, a research firm.
Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the stock exchange, has insisted that the need for a new trading floor remains. But the plans for the new complex no longer call for two 50,000-square-foot trading floors.
To offset the separate cost of buying the property to build the complex, the city proposed selling the right to build a large office tower over the project. There is very little vacant space downtown.
Earlier this year, city officials, in consultation with the stock exchange, asked four developers to submit proposals to build the trading complex and office tower, which would be assessed full taxes. The developers were required to build whether or not they had a tenant for the tower, a risk that few builders were willing to undertake.
"There was no way we could look the city in the eye and tell them we could go ahead without a tenant," said an executive who decided not to get involved. "I saw something enormously complicated that would take years to build."
Some real estate executives were also worried that the security requirements imposed by the exchange and the uncertainty about the start of construction would scare away many potential tenants.
But, according to real estate executives, Tishman Speyer, which has long sought to build the project, said it was willing to take the risk and pay millions of dollars in penalties if it failed to move ahead with the building. But it stopped short of saying it would build no matter what. Brookfield, another major landlord in the city, said it wanted to develop the project, but only under certain conditions.
Many of the developers' misgivings would be allayed if A.I.G., or another company, agreed to lease a major block of space in what would otherwise be a speculative office tower. The insurance company has thousands of employees working in Lower Manhattan. But it has backed out of deals before. In 1989, A.I.G, scuttled a tentative commitment to take 500,000 square feet of space at Renaissance Plaza in downtown Brooklyn.
Nearly four years ago, the Giuliani administration gave A.I.G. $55.7 million in tax breaks to stay in the city. The city had provided the company a round of subsidies in 1993 after it threatened to move to Georgia.
Nevertheless, A.I.G. is expanding and in need of office space.

HEADLINE: Lt. Gen. David W. Traub, 97; Coordinated Logistics for D-Day

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Lt. Gen. David William Traub, a pivotal Army logistics officer for D-Day and in the Korean War, who later oversaw the rapid expansion of the State University of New York system, died on Aug. 16 at a hospital in Lawrence, Mass. A former resident of Loudonville, N.Y., an Albany suburb, he had recently moved to Andover, Mass., to be with family. He was 97.
General Traub was commissioned into the field artillery in 1928 and retired from the Army 34 years later with three-star rank. He lived to be one of the oldest graduates of the United States Military Academy, where he had returned in 1932, four years after graduation, to teach economics and government history. 
 In 1942, with the United States' participation in World War II well under way, the Army named him assistant chief of transportation for planning. As a colonel based in London, he played a central role before, during and after the Normandy invasion, planning the movement of troops, tanks and supplies for the liberation of Europe. He and his staff charted the port, ship, rail and motor operations that made it possible for the generals to deploy their forces.
After the war, he taught logistics for three years at the Command and General Staff College, then put theory into practice again by directing transportation and logistics in Korea.
Promoted to brigadier general in 1954 and to major general in 1957, he spent much of the mid-50's as an assistant chief of staff dealing largely with economic aid for South Korea and the civil administration of Okinawa, where the United States had maintained control after World War II.
In 1957 he was named director of the Army budget in the Army comptroller's office. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1960, when he became comptroller of the Army, the post from which he retired in 1962. As comptroller, he had a hand in a command-structure overhaul ordered by President John F. Kennedy.
Within weeks of General Traub's retirement, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York persuaded him to serve as general manager of the newly created $700 million State University Construction Fund, whose purpose was to expand the SUNY system. General Traub directed the construction program into the early 1970's.
He is survived by a son, David B., of Delmar, N.Y., near Albany; a daughter, Susan A. Russell of Andover, Mass.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Bush Stumbles, and Questions Are Raised Anew

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 23

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush was supposed to be spending this week focusing on education, the issue with which his campaign is wooing women and independent voters.
But in recent days on the trail, he instead found himself reaching for big numbers and defending his proposed tax cut in a manner that came across as reactive and not entirely coherent. 
 In that, and other ways, the brief period after the Democratic National Convention has not been entirely flattering to the Republican nominee.
After Vice President Al Gore's fiery pledge at the convention on Thursday night to fight long and hard for the presidency and the people he wanted to serve, Mr. Bush had his chance to reclaim the spotlight.
But on Friday, his one public event was over by midafternoon, and the high point on his remaining schedule was a run along one of his favorite routes in Dallas. On Monday, after a day at home, he told reporters that one of the pleasures of his break was taking a nap.
In addition, he added, "Went to bed relatively early."
While this sort of thing represents a mere snapshot in time -- and comes in the two weeks before Labor Day, not the two weeks before Election Day -- it has exposed some of the Texas governor's weaknesses and quirks at a juncture when small impressions can sometimes take on big significance as the attention to both candidates intensifies.
Mr. Bush's advisers said today that they were not concerned.
One of them acknowledged that the Texas governor's largely unprompted defense of his sweeping tax cut proposal this week, coupled with the admission he made that he needed to do a better job of pitching it, had thrown the campaign off its chosen message.
But the adviser said the campaign would be back on track later this week, with new education proposals on Thursday and a new speech on international relations on Friday.
"Things like this happen," the adviser said. "It's overblown."
The adviser and others said they had always expected the rise in Mr. Gore's poll numbers and that the news media's spotlight on anything and everything that looks like a sign of trouble in Mr. Bush's campaign was an equally predictable part of the ever-shifting dynamics of the race.
But that equanimity itself raised questions.
While Mr. Bush's advisers have taken great pains recently to talk about how many states he planned to visit in late August, a preliminary schedule for the next week and a half showed Mr. Bush taking three days off of the campaign trail over the weekend, traveling just three days next week and then taking three days off the trail before Labor Day.
Mr. Bush himself makes frequent comments about resting and sleeping and a sensible pace, concerns that do not exactly portray him as a ball of fire. His advisers sought to frame this as an advantage, saying it casts him as a sensible man not utterly consumed by politics.
"Gore runs the risk of looking like he's just an absolute, total political animal," one adviser said.
But Mr. Bush's acknowledgment that he had to sell his suggested tax cut more strongly than he has pointed to a different problem: that a proposal that resonated with the Republican base in the primaries could give pause to swing voters in the general election. Many polls suggest that tax cuts are low on a majority of voters' wish lists.
Although there was discussion in Mr. Bush's campaign before he made that proposal last year about whether the cost of it -- $1.6 trillion over nine years -- was too large, Mr. Bush has promoted his plan as a matter of unswerving principle and economic justice, and both he and his advisers said he would not retreat from it.
But some Democratic pollsters said that their research indicates that voters, while happy to have some tax cuts, particularly for middle-class Americans, worry about the effect of a large, broad one on Social Security, Medicare and the economy in general.
"Bush has walked into a significant trap of his own making on this," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.
And one Republican strategist in Washington who sometimes advises the Bush campaign conceded, "What's Bush going to do? No matter how hard he pushes his tax plan, it doesn't seem to catch fire."
Several other Republican strategists and pollsters said that a basic appetite among Americans for tax cuts was obvious in the fact that Mr. Gore has offered a proposal that would cost $620 billion over 10 years, and that Mr. Bush simply needed to push his plan in more deliberate ways.
During long stretches of time on the stump, especially recently, he has often cast it in broad, ideological terms. John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Bush "has got to sell this as a kitchen-table, pocketbook issue: This is what it means to you."
Interestingly, Mr. Bush's unprompted defense of his tax cut this week was an effort to explain how spending and surplus projections over the next week enabled him to accomplish his proposals.
But he stumbled over his numbers in a speech on Monday night and then, when he revisited the topic with reporters on his campaign plane the next day, went through the issue so quickly and elliptically that aides had to come back to provide more detail on his arithmetic, which turned out to be well in line with estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
And that underscored a potentially larger concern for the Texas governor, one that has been on intermittent display since the Democrats' convention: when he departs from the scripted eloquence of a stump speech (and, sometimes, when he mangles the words within it), he can seem fuzzy on specifics, less than forceful in his thinking, tired.
"The minute he tries to get deep into the weeds, a la Al Gore, who's excellent there, it runs counter to his personality," an adviser acknowledged.

United Airlines Requires Overtime for Mechanics
To help overcome delays and cancellations that have plagued it this summer, United Airlines has issued an order requiring mechanics at five airports to work overtime if asked. About 50 of the airline's 10,000 mechanics have been working overtime in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and Indianapolis to try to make sure that flights take off on time.
An order, called an operational emergency, was also issued in Denver, but no mechanics have been asked to work overtime there. United and union spokesmen said the airline does not often issue such an order. Shares of UAL, United's parent, fell $1, to $47.63. Page A14. 

Stocks Edge Up After Fed Decision
Stocks closed modestly higher as investors surveyed a new economic outlook that apparently includes stable interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.50 points, to 11,144.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 7.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,505.97, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 52.80 points, or 1.3 percent, to 4,011.01. C11.

MANHATTAN: POLICE LEADER CHOSEN
Police officials have decided to select Assistant Chief Joseph J. Esposito, left, commander of the Brooklyn North Strategic and Tactical Command, as the next chief of department, a city official who had been briefed on the decision said yesterday. Chief Esposito, a 32-year veteran and former narcotics detective, will replace Joseph P. Dunne, who was appointed first deputy commissioner last weekend. The chief of department is the senior uniformed officer in the 41,000-member force. Chief Esposito's appointment will be announced within the next few days, the official said. C. J. Chivers (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: RAT TESTING URGED
Warning of the risk of rat-borne diseases, members of the City Council yesterday called on the Department of Health to test rat carcasses. They cited reports this month that a dog had died of leptospirosis, an infection that rats can transmit, after eating a dead rat in Prospect Park. "Just as we test dead birds for West Nile virus, we need a similar strategy for rats," said Victor Robles, chairman of the Council's Health Committee. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: WOMAN FOUND DEAD
A partly clothed woman was stabbed 12 times early yesterday, apparently on the roof of a building in East Harlem, and then was either pushed or fell five stories to the street, the authorities said. The woman, Iris Dixon, 39, was found dead in front of 315 Pleasant Avenue about 5:30 a.m. The police said items belonging to her were found on the roof of a building around the corner from Pleasant Avenue. William K. Rashbaum (NYT)
 
THE BRONX: MONEY FOR TEACHERS
The Bronx will receive $17.2 million to hire 164 new teachers and reduce class sizes this fall, United States Representative Jose E. Serrano announced yesterday. The money is part of a $1.3 billion initiative by the federal Department of Education that aims to reduce class sizes by hiring 29,062 new teachers nationwide over seven years. Local school districts can use the money for hiring teachers in grades one through three, and for teacher testing and training. Tara Bahrampour (NYT)
 
ROCHESTER: CANAL FLOTILLA PLANNED
A world conference on canals will begin here on Sept. 10 with a flotilla of 100 boats down the Erie Canal, organizers said. The parade will include antique tour boats, tugboats and houseboats. It is being held to call attention to the 175th anniversary of the canal. The six-day World Conference on Canals will include seminars on its importance to the economy of the region, said Cheryl Marshall, an organizer of the event. (NYT)
 
GARRISON: FRIARS REACH SETTLEMENT
After 15 years of negotiations, the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement and the National Park Service have settled a dispute over a stretch of the Appalachian Trail that runs through the friars' 400-acre property, Graymoor. Details were not released, but officials said the deal would increase the buffer around what is officially called the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The deal also allows the friars to improve facilities within the trail easement at Graymoor, where friars have tended to homeless and alcoholic men since 1898. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: FORMER BOOKKEEPER SUED
A Manhattan magazine publishing company has filed a civil lawsuit in the Philippines to recover $10 million allegedly stolen by the firm's former head bookkeeper, prosecutors said yesterday. Manhattan prosecutors have charged the bookkeeper, Fidela Caparas, a 54-year-old Philippine immigrant now in jail in New York awaiting trial, with transferring the stolen money to a bank in her native country. The lawsuit, first reported in The Filipino Reporter, was filed in Tagaytay City in the Philippines. David Rohde (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: INFECTED MOSQUITOES FOUND
The State Health Department said it had confirmed the first case of mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus in New Jersey. The mosquitoes were found in pools in Westwood and River Edge, both in Bergen County. Officials said 165 birds in nine counties in northern and central New Jersey had tested positive for the virus; but mosquitoes pose a far greater threat to humans. No humans in New Jersey have tested positive. (NYT)
 
CAMDEN: OFFICER ARRESTED
A Camden police patrolman was arrested yesterday after identifying an undercover officer to a known drug dealer, the Camden County prosecutor said. The officer, Patrolman David T. Dupree, 26, was charged with official misconduct, which can carry a 10-year sentence, before being released on $50,000 bail, said the prosecutor, Lee A. Solomon. Mr. Solomon called the actions the patrolman is accused of "most disturbing," and said they compromised an investigation in a city plagued by drugs and endangered a fellow officer's life. (AP)

MILFORD: SCULPTURE COMPLAINTS
Officials of the American Red Cross chapter have removed a sculpture from the agency's front lawn, after critics complained that the artwork was obscene and frightening to children. The agency's director, Joan Heybruck, also said the sculpture posed a safety hazard by distracting drivers. The piece is part of a community arts project involving 22 sculptures of submarines across Milford, home of Simon Lake, a pioneer of submarine design. The sculpture, called "A Cry for Help," depicted a half-naked woman with an expression of agony atop a submarine. The artist, Paul Perrotti, called the criticism "narrow-minded." David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: COLLAPSE INJURES 4
Four construction workers were hospitalized after a construction crane being used to repair a chimney at Hartford Hospital collapsed twice yesterday. Two of the workers were left dangling by their safety harnesses more than 80 feet in the air when the top of the 120-foot crane collapsed at 10 a.m. Three hours later, the crane broke again while workers were removing it, injuring two other workers. The four were in stable condition after being treated for head injuries and scrapes and bruises. (AP)

HEADLINE: Mexican Leader Visits U.S. With a Vision to Sell

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CORONEO, Mexico, Aug. 22

 BODY:
For eight hours each day, in a desolate warehouse with stone walls, some 12 men and a couple of women in this village of squat adobe houses learn to build furniture with circular saws and power drills.
The government pays for the training and gives each aspiring carpenter a small stipend, but the goal is not to prepare them for scarce and poorly paid jobs at home. It is to give them skills they can use when they migrate -- usually illegally -- to the United States. 
 The program is one of many begun here in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato by the former governor, Vicente Fox Quesada, who is making his first visit to Washington on Thursday since being elected president in a landmark victory in June.
Mr. Fox plans to use his informal meetings with President Clinton and the two American presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to encourage them to join in his vision of a sea change in relations along the 2,000-mile border, in particular one more open to the flow of Mexican laborers. As he does so, the voices of those workers he has helped train in his home state will echo in the background.
"Mexico has many working hands and America has many jobs," said Claudio Torres Resendiz, 33, one of those being trained in Coroneo. "We do the work they need, and they pay us the money we need to take care of our families. Both sides benefit."
American officials have so far been less than enthusiastic about Mr. Fox's idea. And his job-training programs, like the one here, have been criticized both within and outside Mexico as encouraging the exodus of Mexican laborers for menial jobs in the United States. About 340,000 already migrate each year, some legally, others illegally.
But Mr. Fox defends his initiatives -- which mostly offer training in low-skill jobs as landscapers, construction workers, factory workers and maids -- as a pragmatic way to increase the earning potential of workers that Mexico simply cannot sustain.
A straight-talking son of ranchers and a former business executive who focuses on the bottom line, Mr. Fox considers the labor force one of his nation's proudest and most lucrative assets. His plans for the border, he says, would force the United States to face up to its need for Mexican workers, rather than treating the migrants' contributions to the American economy as a kind of dirty economic secret.
"We have the people, and people are an asset" Mr. Fox said in an interview at his family ranch in the state of Guanajuato before leaving for the United States. "I know many people in the United States want to see people as a burden, as a problem, but people are an asset."
"That is why we are going to invest and invest heavily in people," the president-elect went on. "If we have talented people, not only will Mexico progress, the United States will benefit and progress."
When asked to explain his visions for an open border and better working conditions for migrants, the typically practical Mr. Fox turned suddenly passionate and cast back to life here in his home state. It is the state with Mexico's third-highest rate of migration to the United States. During various seasons of the year, isolated villages are almost completely abandoned by able-bodied men and women as they go to the United States to work.
The carpentry training program Mr. Fox began here is far from cutting edge. Students work primarily with outdated tools and learn the most rudimentary techniques while assembling tables and chairs.
But for workers like Mr. Torres, who has worked illegally on peanut and cotton farms in Mississippi for the last 15 years, the workshop means not only the possibility to make more money abroad, but also the chance to seek work with his head held high.
"Working in the fields is very hard and the pay is getting worse," he said. "But I did not have the chance to finish high school, I had to take whatever work I could get. I am trying to better myself so I do not have to take that humiliation anymore."
During his campaign for president, Mr. Fox was widely criticized for a private initiative that has sent some 300 men from Guanajuato to work legally as landscapers on golf courses in Michigan over the last three years.
One of the more popular promises of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as he negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada was that Mexico would strive to increase exports of products, not people. But the benefits of Nafta have been felt less among Mexico's 40 million poor, and the number of Mexican immigrants to the United States has not significantly declined.
Unlike many of his predecessors, Mr. Fox publicly accepts his country's inability to offer its workers the kinds of salaries and living conditions offered in the United States. Until his administration is able to begin narrowing the wage gap -- he has pledged annual economic growth of 7 percent and the creation of 1.35 million new jobs each year -- Mr. Fox wants more Mexican workers to be able to cross the border without violence and harassment. And he wants to make it easier for immigrants to invest more of their earnings from abroad back home.
An example of that kind of economic return stands at the entrance of a village called Timbinal, where Napa Valley vineyard workers paid for the building of a small apparel factory to employ women who stay behind.
One of the workers, Rosa Maria Sierra Lopez, 21, said her job at the plant was the first thing in her life that had made her feel useful. But she said it was not enough to make up for the pain that the northern migration inflicts on her town and her home.
Most of the men in the village, she said, spend more time in the United States than they do at home. And each year her 52-year-old father risks his life by illegally crossing the United States border to work in apple orchards in the American Northwest. It is a journey he has made since before she was born, Ms. Sierra said.
"It's very hard for us to see him go," she said, pressing her eyes closed to hold back tears. "It's hard for all of us."
As expected, Mr. Fox's talk of opening the border to increased legal migration has been met mostly with polite skepticism from officials in Washington.
And while analysts consider Mr. Fox's trip to be the beginning of a long campaign -- one that he himself predicts could take 30 years -- none dismissed the president-elect's ideas as impossible. Labor groups as well as immigrant activists have joined together to support legislation proposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, that would legalize some 1.1 million undocumented residents.
"People in the U.S. hear open border and they panic," said Pamela Falk, a former staff director of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. "That's not what he's trying to do. He's trying to adjust the laws to fit the reality in a way that would be good for the American economy and for Mexican workers."
John Bailey, director of the Mexico Project at Georgetown University, said: "At first I thought Fox was pushing a nonstarter. But my second reaction was that what he says is really interesting. And even though he may not get everything he wants, he will get a new conversation started."
Ismael Rojas, 65, doubts he will see the day when the men in his native La Calera will stop leaving their families to work in the United States. He did it for 25 years -- most of that time as an undocumented worker -- and his sinuses are still choked from his work at an Illinois lumber company.
He has retired to the sprawling house he built with his life's earnings. Two cars and a tractor are parked inside a huge shed in the back and the garden is full of fruit trees.
Everything he has, he said, comes from his labor in the United States. Now it is his sons who work up north. One was given legal status under a broad amnesty approved by Congress in 1986; the other has a seasonal permit to work at a golf course in Michigan. He is happy that his sons do not have to endure the insecurity and shame of living illegally in the United States. Still, Mr. Rojas said, the advances are bittersweet.
"In Mexico," he said, "you can either abandon your children to make money to take care of them, or you can stay with your children and watch them live in misery. Poverty makes us leave our families. I want President Fox to create jobs, jobs that are well paid, so that our families can stay together."

HEADLINE: CABARET GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
* "OUR SINATRA," Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday night at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; premium ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Stephen Holden). 

MARC SALEM, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater with his 1997 show, "Mind Games." Now Mr. Salem, accompanied by a trio of bass, piano and percussion, is in residence at Feinstein's with "Mind Games and All That Jazz." But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays. The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the "Twilight Zone" sort. Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights. Friday and Saturday nights at 8:30 and 11; Sundays at 1:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8:30. Cover: $40 on weekends; no cover on weekdays; dinner required for early show on weekends, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show; Sunday brunch is $30 and cover is $30.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Strong, Modest and Sincere Behind All the Giddy Cheer

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
Since "Bring It On" is a movie about high school cheerleaders, you might expect whatever plot it has to be a flimsy scaffolding for the shameless exploitation of young women in short skirts -- a slice of diet cheesecake, a "Coyote Not Quite So Ugly." And you wouldn't be entirely wrong. Kirsten Dunst, who plays Torrance Shipman, the striving, energetic captain of a Southern California pompom squad, displays her bellybutton in nearly every frame of the picture, and when she's not wearing her cute red and black uniform, she's outfitted in pajamas, a bikini or, when modesty (or the school dress code) demands, a series of colorful sports bras.
But "Bring It On," directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Peyton Reed from a brisk, slangy script by Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery -- though it does feature an extended visit to the girls' locker room, a scene in which the cheerleaders don skimpy bathing suits and wash cars (it's a fundraiser), and of course innumerable splits, leg extensions and carefully photographed bounces. But in the post-Brandi Chastain era, female athleticism and female sexuality seem closer together than ever, and underneath this movie's tight acrylic sweater beats an unapologetically feminist heart. 
 If Mr. Reed's camera can't help ogle Torrance and her teammates, Ms. Bendinger's script manages to respect their hard work and their aspirations. It may be impossible to dispel the notion that cheerleading is a silly, trivial enterprise -- a notion upon which much of the comedy in "Bring It On" depends -- but this movie rarely feels cynical, condescending or cheap.
Cheerleading, the filmmakers insist, is a sport, requiring discipline, timing and strength as well as, um, certain physiological gifts. One of the running jokes is that the Rancho Grande High School football team -- represented by a couple of dim, clueless jerks -- loses every game, while the cheering squad has racked up five consecutive national championships. And "Bring It On" is, structurally as well as thematically, a sports movie, following Torrance and her squad through the anxieties and tribulations of a season aimed toward the climactic national championships in Daytona, Fla.
Their main competition comes from the East Compton Clovers, a mostly black inner-city squad whose crowd-pleasing routines Torrance's villainous predecessor (Lindsay Sloane) had plagiarized. "My whole cheerleading career is based on a lie," Torrance laments when she learns of the theft, and the film is at its most honest and interesting when it deals with the consequences of her discovery, and her relationship with Isis (Gabrielle Union), the Clovers' proud captain.
A whole movie, rather than just a subplot, might have been devoted to East Compton's struggle for recognition and to the out-of-uniform lives of Isis's squad, played with gusto by the members of the singing group Blaque. As it is, the Clovers are on hand to serve as symbols of a complexity the movie isn't quite able to explore. They're better dancers and better athletes than their white counterparts, and also, for all their gumption and self-sufficiency, the agents of a white girl's moral awakening.
On the other hand, the fact that a bouncy teenage sports comedy can even gesture toward serious matters of race and economic inequality is pretty impressive, as is the occasional snarl of genuine satire. The vicious back-stabbing and defensive homophobia of the cheerleaders seem as accurate as the high school vernacular in which they address one another, and even the cheering hides an edge of hostility behind its smiling allure.
"That's all right, that's O.K.,/ You're gonna pump our gas some day," the Rancho Grande squad chants in the faces of rivals from a less affluent school district. And the opening sequence of strutting cheerleaders mocking their own power and vulnerability puts those in the audience out for a cheap voyeuristic thrill on the defensive from the start, picking up where "American Beauty" left off.
And then retreating. "Bring It On" is, in the end, a deeply conventional movie, which is hardly surprising given that it combines two of the most convention-bound genres in existence. In addition to being a sports movie, it's a teenage romantic comedy, which means that Torrance must give up bad, popular Aaron (Richard Hillman) for cute, goodhearted misfit Cliff (Jesse Bradford).
Mr. Bradford, with his crooked smile and his unthreatening coolness, is perfectly suited for the role. But it is Ms. Dunst who carries the movie and unifies its disparate elements. She's a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt.
No doubt with the preservation of its PG-13 rating in view, "Bring It On" tiptoes around the issue of sex even as it flaunts its wholesome sex appeal. But in one scene, when Torrance and Cliff surprise each other while brushing their teeth, it ascends to the frothy, sublimated seductiveness of classic screwball. Ms. Dunst's expression as she emerges from the bathroom, having done nothing more risque than spit in the sink, is perfectly enigmatic and completely convincing, a mixture of mischievous amazement and unconscious arousal. It's a wonderfully subtle moment -- exactly what you'd expect from a cheerleader movie.
"Bring It On" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its characters swear occasionally and almost never appear fully dressed.

HEADLINE: For 'Miss Saigon,' Light at the End

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
THEY call it the Nightmare. That is how the crew refers to the sequence in which the metal embassy fence drops in, the helipad moves down, the sound of whipping blades intensifies, and a life-size chopper descends.
On Dec. 31, American troops will evacuate Saigon this way for the last time on the stage of the Broadway Theater, bringing to a close the musical "Miss Saigon," the sixth-longest-running show in Broadway history. After nearly 10 years, the production, loosely based on Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," will have played 4,063 performances and gone through 1,218,900 pounds of dry ice, 89,386 scene changes and 812,600 light cues. 
 "Miss Saigon" has taken in more than $1.3 billion internationally at the box office since its world premiere in London in September 1989. The Broadway production, which opened on April 11, 1991, has grossed more than $266 million and has been seen by nearly six million people.
The show spawned two United States touring companies and a Toronto production. "Saigon" has been performed in six other countries, and a new production will open in the Philippines next month, starring Lea Salonga, who originated the title role on Broadway.
The show's imminent departure is significant, and not only because "Miss Saigon" is the most technically complex show in Broadway history, or because it broke several records during its phenomenal run, like the largest advance ticket sale ($37 million) and highest ticket price ever for a musical at the time ($100). With "Cats" scheduled to close next month, the departure of "Miss Saigon" leaves just two in a crop of mega-musicals still running -- "Les Miserables" and "The Phantom of the Opera" -- suggesting that an era of theatrical spectacle may be at an end.
With musicals now costing $5 million to $12 million to mount, many producers say they would not attempt a "Miss Saigon" today. (The show cost $10.9 million in 1991.)
Written by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg (who wrote "Les Miserables"), with additional lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr., and produced by the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh, "Miss Saigon" is also a landmark in that it was the first successful musical to deal with the sensitive subject of Vietnam.
In addition, the production originally engendered considerable controversy when Sir Cameron clashed with the Actors Equity Association over casting: the union insisted on an Asian actor for the major role of the Engineer, a Eurasian pimp, while Sir Cameron insisted on Jonathan Pryce -- initially canceling the production -- and ultimately prevailed. But "Miss Saigon" has proved to be a source of steady income for Asian actors, who often find work hard to come by on Broadway.
 
Its Own Following
Those who have been with the musical the longest say they are in no position to mourn its passing. After all, most shows don't last even a year on Broadway. And "Miss Saigon" just kept on going.
"Because it was the last great blockbuster of the 80's, it had all that sort of media-frenzied hype behind it," Sir Cameron said. "Therefore, it wasn't until the dust had settled that actually the audience decided to like it for itself. To this day it has its own following."
While the production is best known for its special effects, it is the poignancy of the love story between Kim, a Vietnamese waif forced to work as a prostitute after witnessing the death of her parents in the war, and Chris, an American G.I. compelled to leave Saigon on the last helicopter out, that seems to explain why the musical has run so long.
"I think what happened was, there was an appetite for what opera has always done well," said Nicholas Hytner, who directed the show, "which is to dramatize large passions in some people set against a sweeping historical background."
In his review of the show in The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote, "For all that seems galling about 'Miss Saigon' -- and for all that is indeed simplistic, derivative and, at odd instances, laughable about it -- this musical is a gripping entertainment of the old school."
While audiences may be moved by the tale and its tragic ending, they are also awed by the element of spectacle, with sets by John Napier, lighting by David Hersey, sound by Andrew Bruce and costumes by Andreane Neofitou and Suzy Benzinger. In addition to the famous 1,700-pound helicopter (often derided as too Disneyland), the show features an 18-foot fiberglass statue of Ho Chi Minh and a real 1959 Cadillac, cut in half to fit backstage. The crew is bigger than the cast, 55 to 46. There are 375 costumes, 206 props, 45 firearms, including handguns, M-16's and AK-47's. The touring company that closed this month in Buffalo required 40 tractor-trailers.
" 'Phantom' had been the largest automated show," said Jake Bell, the show's production technical manager. " 'Saigon' surpassed that by more than double."
Experiencing a matinee from behind the scenes offers a glimpse into what it takes to make this monster of a show work its magic.
 
Busy in the Wings
The action begins a half-hour before the curtain goes up. The last of the actors enter through the stage door, sign in and head up to their dressing rooms to get into their wigs, makeup and costumes.
On the cool, cavernous stage and in the wings, the crew readies the props and scenery. Set pieces that have been left on the stage from the close of the show the night before -- like the runway for the Moulin Rouge strip club in Bangkok, where the story moves in Act II -- are moved into the wings and, in most cases, flown, which means they are strung up on chain hoists to keep the limited wing space as clear as possible. Act I sets and props are moved onto the deck -- meaning the stage and wings -- including bicycles and details for the wedding shrine: incense, candles and colorful hanging unicorns.
"It's like rotating stock in a store," said Andrew Douglas, the assistant propertyman.
Because of the tight space, large pieces of scenery must be constantly moved around in the wings to allow others to get on and off the stage. The towering Ho statue, for example, gets shifted from side to side at the rear of the stage like a pendulum clock throughout the performance. Then there are the five different beds to keep track of: Kim 1 Bed, Kim 2 Bed, Kim 3 Bed, Kim 4 Bed and Hotel Bed.
In addition there are the smaller details to account for, like the basket of lacquered vegetables (exactly what kind is a matter of backstage debate: zucchini, okra, bitter melon?), stacks of fake dollar bills, carts with hanging fish and trays of jewelry.
With so many sets rising and descending in the wings, backstage can be a dicey place to be. "Organized chaos," said Peter Wolf, the first assistant stage manager. To make room for all of the show's big bells and whistles, the theater first had to be transformed. Jack Cennamo, 61, the head carpenter, who has been with "Miss Saigon" since it began, said he and his crew spent two months tearing out walls, radiators and stairwells.
During the performance, the stagehands are particularly concerned with how the scenery moves on and off. "It's routine," Mr. Cennamo said of running the show. "But you have to pay attention."
There are 19 muslin blinds that look as if they were made of rice paper and frame the stage. Behind them is black masking through which scenery glides in and out on metal pylons that are meant to evoke Vietnam. The rising of the blinds is carried out by one of the show's three computers, which occupy a room of their own. If a computer malfunctions and the blinds don't go up, the pylons carrying the scenery rip through them and the stagehands have a problem. It has happened, but not often.
Coordinating all this, calling the cues, is Mark Dobrow, the production stage manager, who has been with "Miss Saigon" for five years. Outside the office he shares with his assistant stage managers -- Mr. Wolf and Lisa Buxbaum, the second assistant -- Polaroid pictures cover the walls, featuring every cast member who has been with the company, almost 300 over the years. Each of them signed the show's coolie hat upon leaving.
The role of Kim's son, Tam, has been played by 34 different 4- and 5-year-olds, mostly girls. "Boys, when they're 4, are not mature enough," Mr. Dobrow said. "They get bored really easily."
 
The 'Child Wrangler'
Looking after this child is a chaperone, or "child wrangler," currently Suzanne Arnold, who stays by her charge's side throughout the show. When Tam (played by Jenna La Salla and Gail A. Quintos, who alternate performances) is offstage, Ms. Arnold entertains the child in the dressing room with games, storybooks and toys. When Tam is onstage, Ms. Arnold is nearby, out of sight of the audience. When, for example, Tam is sitting on a bed (Kim 3 Bed) that is curtained off, waiting to make her entrance, Ms. Arnold sits beside the girl, telling her jokes or reading aloud.
Mr. Wolf is in charge of training the new Tams, who generally stay 3 to 10 months. Rather than explain the entire show to a 4-year-old, Mr. Wolf has given each of Tam's scenes names. So when Tam first enters by running from the bed to his mother, that is called the "Tam Run Game." When Kim shoots her cousin with a gun to protect Tam, that is the "Tam Bang Game."
The stagehands have developed joke names for some of the grown-up scenes, too. The one in which the men enter wearing sandals, for example, is called "the flip-flop boys."
In the locker room under the stage before the show, the actors playing soldiers get dressed in their Army gear, attaching their microphones, draping dog tags around their necks. Ray Santos, one of the original cast members who plays a Vietnamese customer in the first bar scene, says he values this time the most. "We make each other laugh," he said, "talk about things outside of the show."
All shows become families; this one has become a dynasty. Cast members have left and come back, borne children, married one another. Tams have grown up, and their younger siblings have become Tams.
 
'Here We Go Again'
It is nearing 2 p.m.: showtime. Gradually actors wander onto the stage to stretch and chat before the curtain goes up. Mr. Dobrow, the stage manager, stands at his podium in front of a script with marked cues, puts on his headset and announces in low tones: "We're at places. Places, please."
Then he checks in with all the other departments on headsets: automation, carpentry, electronics, sound, his fellow stage managers, the house manager who monitors the audience. Robert Billig, the show's musical director, who is conducting today and visible on backstage infrared monitors, reports on the number of substitutes in his orchestra, so the sound man knows what to expect. "Count is 12," Mr. Billig says of the subs. "One cello, two violins, an oboe, Asian flute. . . ."
Michael Harris, the house manager, reports, "House is ready."
Mr. Douglas, the propertyman, says, "Here we go again."
The show begins in Saigon, 1975, with a sequence the crew has come to refer to as "Dreamland," in which Kim and Chris meet for the first time in a nightclub. Then the show moves to Kim's hut (Kim 1 Bed), then on to Ho Chi Minh City, 1978.
The actors onstage look sharp, as if they were performing these songs and dances for the first time. But keeping it fresh is a challenge, especially for those who have been with the show the longest.
"Sometimes it's near impossible," said Alan Ariano, an original member of the ensemble. "I blank out sometimes and go on automatic: 'O.K., did I do the laundry?' You catch yourself, have to snap yourself out of it."
 
A Gold Mine for Asians
Mr. Ariano said he had supplemented his "Miss Saigon" life with a photography business, shooting theatrical head shots, and more recently with a degree in computer graphics. Knowing that no show lasts forever, and that there may not be another one immediately to follow, he said he wanted something to fall back on. "What's next for me I don't know," he said. "The nature of this business is job insecurity."
The business is doubly insecure for Asian actors, who say they must rely on productions like "The King and I" and "M. Butterfly" to get work. In this light "Miss Saigon" has been something of a gold mine, employing actors of Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Hawaiian descent as well as black and Hispanic performers. "Both the professional and the public view of minority casting, nontraditional casting, colorblind casting has taken a terrific leap forward," said Alan Wasser, the show's general manager.
Mr. Ariano and Francis J. Cruz, two original cast members, attended the same high school in Chula Vista, Calif. "We've been part of an elite group that's been able to work" in the theater, Mr. Ariano said. "I don't take that for granted."
At intermission the crew prepares for the top of Act II, flying all the scenery from Act I up on the chain hoists, bringing down the Bangkok units. The act opens at a conference in the United States, 1978. Then it moves to Bangkok. Then it flashes back to Saigon when Kim remembers the American evacuation. In other words, the Nightmare.
The helicopter is the sum of six separate automated effects. The boom arm can swing from side to side; the cab can pitch up and down, move side to side and rotate; the rotor on top is a nylon rope with a rubber ball on the end that is ejected, creating the illusion of a spinning blade. At the controls is Virgil, a robot whose head turns as the helicopter lands.
When the chopper settles on the helipad, it is up to Ms. Buxbaum, one of the stage managers, to signal the live co-pilot (hidden on the pad) to come through the helicopter, motioning the rest of the soldiers to climb aboard. The 13 men who scramble into the helicopter actually drop into the hollow box of the pad, lined with two benches, handing off their rifles to a prop man as they descend. Ms. Buxbaum holds a flashlight in her mouth to light their way.
Then Ms. Buxbaum reports, "All clear" into her headset, and the helicopter rises into the eaves. "It's really cool to be onstage when the helicopter is coming down," said Eva Schegulla, Kim's dresser. "After four years I still get a kick out of it every day."
Usually this all goes smoothly. But there have been exceptions. Like the time the helicopter didn't take off. Fortunately the automation guys were able to run the machinery from a dial on the encoder, as opposed to going through the computer, controlling each effect individually. But there have been times when the helicopter didn't work at all, and for such times there is Plan B, which essentially amounts to blinding the audience with light and adding a lot of smoke. Remarkably, audiences who have experienced Plan B have apparently found it satisfying. "They think they've seen something," Mr. Dobrow said.
Initially Mr. Hytner, the director, did not think the helicopter was at all essential, though he now says he is glad it is there. "I thought, 'Oh, we don't need this,' " he recalled. "But it's not necessarily about what you need."
Once the impact of the helicopter has receded, the show returns to its human drama, as Kim encounters Chris's wife in a hotel room. Downstairs in the green room, members of the cast settle in for the matinee ritual of "Asian Treat."
It started about 10 years ago when a dresser began bringing fruit and drinks for the male cast members she attended to. This mushroomed into an exclusive group of about 14 members who take turns bringing snacks for the matinees. Only members can partake. A sign nearby explains the rules of the Asian Food Treat Club: "Anyone is welcome to be part of the club after having contributed to the festivities and having passed the requirements specified by the A.F.T.C. board of directors at the time of one's application -- just kidding!"
Today the menu includes crackers, brie and dip, and the members, from the cast and crew, dive in while the non-members eye the spread hungrily from the sidelines.
 
A New Job
In the hair room, John James, who has been hair supervisor for seven years, is putting the female cast members into their blond wigs for the "American Dream" number. Sparkly in their glittering fringe and white fishnet stockings, the women congratulate Lisa Yuen, an ensemble member, on her new job: she will be leaving "Miss Saigon" to join the road company of "The Scarlet Pimpernel."
This news is clearly bittersweet; cast members know they need to figure out what to do next, and those landing jobs before the end of the run feel lucky. But it also offers a sobering reminder to the actors who remain that the end is near. On Nov. 2, a gala featuring "Miss Saigon" alumni will celebrate the show's 4,000th performance. The New Year's Eve show will be the last.
"They're happy that she got another job, but sad that she won't be there when it ends," said Mr. James. "You can just feel that people are pulling away emotionally, trying to find what to do next and where to go next. Is there life after 'Saigon'?"
Mr. James said he was concerned about the future, too. "I'm a little worried," he said. "This is the first time I've ever had to face unemployment."
Onstage the "American Dream" number has its usual buoyant effect on the audience, particularly because of the Cadillac -- carrying a woman in a Statue of Liberty crown that lights up -- which seems to float downstage on a cloud (read: dry ice). Mr. Maltby, who collaborated on the lyrics, said that this showstopping number goes to the heart of the play.
 
On to Heartbreak
"Vietnam was a turning point in America's estimation of itself, and the American dream, which hovers over the whole show, is what was at stake," he said. "America has never believed in the American dream after that event. Prior to that we were always the good guys, and we always won. Suddenly we were the bad guys doing terrible things, and, worse than that, John Wayne didn't come riding over the hill to save the day.
"The show in its essence is about that, about the American inability to make the leap to Vietnam, to understand it and to ultimately help."
Today's matinee moves to its heartbreaking conclusion, accompanied by surging notes from the orchestra. Kitschy perhaps, but some in the audience are crying. The cast comes on for its curtain call, bowing between the billow and the bang of the heavy red velvet curtain as it rises and falls. "I think they loved it," one actor quips as she comes offstage, "and we should do it again, tonight."
Just two and half hours later -- the show runs more than two and a half hours with intermission -- all of these people will be back to do it all over again, almost exactly as they did it before. For them this is work: what they wake up and do every day except Sunday, sometimes twice a day, to feed their families, afford vacations, pay the rent. They casually head out the stage door to their dinner breaks, showing no trace of having weathered something wrenching.
The audience, on the other hand, emerges dazed, the way people do coming out of a movie in the middle of the afternoon, taking a moment to recover and re-enter their real lives, blinking in the sunlight.

HEADLINE: Little Action Expected From Report on Auto Fuel Use

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 24

 BODY:
A government report to be released as soon as Friday reaches few conclusions about the effects of tightening federal fuel-economy regulations for automobiles, making it virtually certain that the regulations will not be changed by Congress before the end of this year.
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the chairman of the Commerce Committee, ordered the report from the General Accounting Office of Congress late last spring, when high gasoline prices were prompting outrage among motorists. But while gasoline prices are rising again now as crude oil prices increase, enthusiasm for tighter rules has faded in Congress since a Senate compromise this summer called for the National Academy of Sciences to perform a more thorough yearlong review of the issue. 
 A Commerce Committee aide who insisted on anonymity said that the committee was virtually certain not to hold a hearing this autumn on gas mileage standards, and would wait instead for the more complete report from the National Academy of Sciences. The committee is considering, however, a hearing this autumn on global warming, to which gasoline combustion by automobiles is a big contributor, the aide said.
Senator McCain has been sent a memorandum about the General Accounting Office report but has not seen the document itself, and has not had time to discuss it with his staff, the aide added.
Current fuel-economy regulations require each automaker to manufacture cars with an average gas mileage of 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks -- a category encompassing sport utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks -- that get an average of 20.7 miles a gallon. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate have used the Transportation Department's annual budget to bar regulators since 1995 from raising either standard. But the more lenient standard for light trucks was the object of particular scrutiny in Congress earlier this year.
The General Accounting Office report concludes that tighter standards would reduce gasoline consumption and emissions of gases that contribute to global warming, but would have an unclear effect on safety.
Cars and light trucks account for one-sixth of the emissions of global-warming gases in the United States, which in turn accounts for a quarter of the world's emissions, the report found, adding that for the cars and light trucks alone, "This amount exceeds the total greenhouse gas emissions of all but a few countries."
The more gasoline that an automobile burns, the more such gases it emits. Average gas mileage has fallen 8 percent in the United States since a peak of 25.9 miles a gallon in the 1988 model year, as many motorists have switched to light trucks from cars, the report said.
The safety effects of raising standards would depend on how quickly new rules were phased in, the report noted. A rapid increase in standards might prompt automakers to build many small, lightweight, less-safe vehicles to improve their averages, while a slower increase might cause automakers to adopt more efficient technologies instead, it said.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said that automakers want fuel-economy rules eliminated, not tightened.
A separate study by Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, estimates that automakers avoided $10.2 billion in gas-guzzler taxes in the 1999 model year alone because light trucks are exempt from the tax. The tax penalizes cars based on the extent to which their fuel-economy falls below 22.5 miles a gallon, with fines of up to $7,700 for a few high-performance sports cars that get as poor mileage as the largest pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
Friends of the Earth assumed that if the gas-guzzler tax were applied to light trucks, the tax would still be collected for vehicles getting less than 22.5 miles a gallon. Ms. Bergquist said that Friends of the Earth was wrong to ignore the difference in fuel-economy standards between cars and light trucks in calculating the taxes not paid. The auto industry opposes applying the tax to light trucks in any case, she said.

HEADLINE: Turkey Assails a Revered Islamic Moderate

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Onur Elgin, a Turkish teenager, has no doubts about why he spent his summer vacation studying physics. In fluent English, he explains that he wants to succeed for his school, his country and the world.
Onur's high school, Fatih College, is part of a prospering Islamic community associated with Fetullah Gulen, a 62-year-old religious leader who lives in Pennsylvania. In addition to hundreds of schools in Turkey, the Balkans and Central Asia, the loose-knit brotherhood runs a television channel, a radio station, an advertising agency, a daily newspaper and a bank, all pro-Islamic and all centered in Istanbul. 
 Though little known in the United States, for many years Mr. Gulen was an unofficial ambassador for Turkey who promoted a moderate brand of Islam. He preached tolerance, meeting with Pope John Paul II and other religious and political leaders, among them Turkey's prime ministers and presidents.
But this month, after a yearlong inquiry, a state security court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Gulen. A prosecutor has accused him of inciting his followers to plot the overthrow of Turkey's secular government, a crime punishable by death. The authorities have not tried to extradite Mr. Gulen, but the warrant sent a chill through his circle of admirers and raised anxieties among liberals who are not associated with his movement.
At the same time, the government has been involved in a highly public dispute over its attempt to fire thousands of civil servants suspected of ties to pro-Islamic or separatist groups. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit sought the authority for the dismissals through a governmental decree, but the president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, has twice refused to sign the measure into law. Mr. Sezer argues that the authority can be created only by Parliament. The government agreed today to submit the matter to Parliament in the fall.
The deadlock has led to some calls for the resignation of Mr. Sezer, who took office in May. It has also contributed to the almost continuous tension between hard-line backers of the country's secular order and people who advocate more tolerance of religious views and free speech.
In a written response to questions from The New York Times, Mr. Gulen recently broke a year of public silence about the accusations against him. He described the charges as fabrications by a "marginal but influential group that wields considerable power in political circles."
He said he was not seeking to establish an Islamic regime but did support efforts to ensure that the government treated ethnic and ideological differences as a cultural mosaic, not a reason for discrimination.
"Standards of democracy and justice must be elevated to the level of our contemporaries in the West," said Mr. Gulen, who has been receiving medical care in the United States for the past year and said his health prevented his return to Turkey.
Turkey's military leaders have long regarded Mr. Gulen as a potential threat to the state. Those fears seemed confirmed a year ago when television stations broadcast excerpts from videocassettes in which he seemed to urge his followers to "patiently and secretly" infiltrate the government.
Mr. Gulen said his words had been taken out of context, and some altered. He said he had counseled patience to followers faced with corrupt civil servants and administrators intolerant of workers who were practicing Muslims.
"Statements and words were picked with tweezers and montaged to serve the purposes of whoever was behind this," he said.
Mr. Gulen's explanations are unlikely to satisfy the secular hard-liners who see themselves as the guardians of modern Turkey, which was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. For them, the businesses and schools run by his followers sow the seeds of an Islamic regime.
Some moderate Turks see such Islamic-oriented schools and businesses as an attempt to fill a gap left by government policies and discrimination. A study by the private Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation found that these Islamic groups appeal not only to the poor but also to strict Muslims who often feel excluded from the mainstream.
The Gulen-oriented schools teach only government-approved religious instruction, in Turkish and English. Tuition payments are several thousand dollars a year, and students face rigorous academic challenges.
"Strategically speaking, the schools are something that should be supported by the state because you have a Turkish presence in these countries," said Ozdem Sanberk, director of the Economic and Social Studies Foundation.
At Fatih school outside Istanbul, the young Mr. Elgin, 16, has no intention of overthrowing the state. His sole goal right now is learning enough physics to compete on the Turkish national academic team.

HEADLINE: Plant Orders For Big Items Have Largest Decline Ever

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Factory orders for aircraft, electrical equipment and other durable goods showed their largest decline on record in July, government figures showed today, suggesting manufacturers may scale back production in the months ahead as the economy slows.
Orders for big-ticket items plunged 12.4 percent last month, more than reversing a June increase of 9.5 percent, the Commerce Department said. Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell 4.8 percent in July after rising 0.5 percent the month before. 
 "We are seeing more moderate growth," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. Rising concern based on the June statistics that "the economy would pick up again isn't true," he said.
Signs of a slowdown in manufacturing -- along with a fourth consecutive weekly increase in jobless claims -- indicate less growth and less threat of accelerating inflation.
"This is exactly what the Federal Reserve wanted to achieve" in raising interest rates six times since June 1999, said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics L.L.C. in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Fed policy makers kept the rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent on Tuesday, citing slower growth and the benefits of rising worker productivity.
Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of the nation's total economic production, employing millions of workers. A decline in orders -- usually as a result of a falloff in demand from consumers and businesses -- can cause factories to slow production.
Still, manufacturers are hardly suffering from widespread weakness in demand. Compared with figures in the month a year earlier, the value of newly ordered goods was 4.9 percent higher in July. What is more, July's drop in orders excluding transportation equipment was only the second this year.
And unfilled orders, a gauge of backlogs and whether manufacturers are able to supply goods quickly, fell just 0.3 percent last month after a 4.6 percent surge in June. Unfilled orders were 12 percent higher than they were in July of last year.
"As long as backlogs have to be worked off, production will remain solid," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
Analysts had expected a 7 percent drop in July orders after a previously reported 9.7 percent gain in orders for June. June's increase was the largest since a 13.9 percent surge in July 1991.
The Labor Department said in a separate report today that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 last week, to 314,000.

HEADLINE: Fed Unanimous in June Vote

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate committee agreed to leave rates unchanged in June, the decision was unanimous, but many members said they might have to increase rates in the future to curb inflation, according to minutes of the meeting, which were released today.
The minutes from the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meeting of June 27 and 28 said Fed officials saw little risk in keeping rates steady but disagreed over the prospects for inflation. 
 "Many committee members noted that, based on the currently available information, additional firming of policy could well be needed at some point," the minutes said, "though a number also expressed the opinion that less tightening probably would be required than they had thought at the time of the May meeting."
The members said they did not want to leave the impression that further policy tightening was "an unlikely prospect," but they saw only a "remote" chance that inflation would increase appreciably in the near future.
The committee met again on Tuesday and left interest rates unchanged. The Fed, however, warned that with a scarcity of workers and with demand exceeding the nation's ability to produce, there was still a risk inflation could harm the record economic expansion, now in its 10th year. The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999 to keep inflation at bay.
At their meeting in June, Fed officials differed on inflation, but there was general concern that higher energy costs were leaking into other areas of the economy.
Some members noted that because the pool of available workers was so low, companies might raise prices to offset the higher wages and benefits they would need to pay to retain and hire workers.
Some, however, remained confident that huge gains in productivity would keep costs in check.
Committee members said tentative signs of slowing consumer demand, coupled with the strong probability that much of the effect of the recent interest rate increases had not trickled into the general economy, gave the Fed room to watch and wait.

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Neighbor

BYLINE: By Vicente Fox; Vicente Fox, president-elect of Mexico, will take office on Dec. 1.

 BODY:
The elections of July 2 brought the end of 71 years of virtual one-party rule and inaugurated my country's first experience in a democratic rotation of power. Mexico's electoral institutions, built over several rounds of gradual reform, proved their maturity and reliability. The smoothness of our transition, the civility shown by all the political actors and the statesmanship demonstrated by president Ernesto Zedillo are all reflections of our enormous transformation.
That transformation frames the message I have brought this week to President Clinton and the candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore. The full advent of democracy will complement our economic reforms, bring them to full fruition and better distribute their benefits. The fight against corruption, accountability of public officials, the rule of law and security for all citizens will provide the assurances that Mexico's partners are expecting. These are the issues Mexicans strongly raised during the presidential campaign, and they are also at the root of some doubts our friends abroad -- investors, creditors, tourists -- have harbored. My first priority after taking office will be to confront these challenges forthrightly. 
 I will also attempt to redress the age-old poverty and inequality that, despite economic gains in several regions, still plague too many Mexicans. We must accelerate economic growth, promote local and regional development and above all ensure better distribution of income. Strengthening civil society, democratizing the labor movement, giving women a greater voice and defending minorities are all steps in this direction.
As we undertake these changes, we will also engage our neighbors and partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta and the current state of relations with the United States have been good for Mexico, and we can build on what has already been achieved. Within 25 years we envision a North American area of shared prosperity, where goods, services, capital and people can move more freely across borders.
My administration will seek to "deepen" Nafta in several ways. The first involves expanding the resources and mandate of the North American Development Bank, enabling it to finance infrastructure projects in Mexico; the second, setting up North American public and private regional funds to invest in human capital in the poor areas of Mexico where most migrants to the United States come from. Both would combat poverty and discourage undocumented immigration.
Years from now, we visualize a more ambitious economic integration as we actively pursue the narrowing of wage differentials among Mexico, the United States and Canada. In the meantime, negotiations should begin with a view toward providing humane working conditions for Mexicans already in the United States, and for exploring new and imaginative mechanisms to organize and regulate future flows. These should include institutional guarantees of the human and civil rights of Mexicans and reduction of tensions along the border. The violent deaths of my countrymen on the border are simply intolerable.
Finally, I believe that the changes wrought in Mexico by the election will provide an impulse to greater effectiveness in the war on drugs. We need to stop the blame game. The drug trade is driven by both supply and demand and can only be dealt with through international cooperation. As a first step, we should eliminate the sources of gratuitous tension. The yearly ritual of United States certification of other countries' cooperation in drug enforcement strains our relationship and diverts valuable political and diplomatic resources. It should be replaced by an international mechanism to evaluate the efforts of all countries in the drug war.
Mexico is ready to do business with the United States. We want to maximize the "democracy bonus" of good feeling generated across the world by our July 2 elections, in order to significantly increase direct foreign investment in our country and to engage Washington in bold negotiations.
The onset of democracy in Mexico provides the best chance in a generation to build a forward-looking agenda that moves beyond stale debates. I am sure we can set this process in motion during my meetings this week and move ahead decisively early next year, when both our countries begin the 21st century with new administrations.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Flat in Reaction to Drop in Durable Goods Orders

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices were flat yesterday after the government reported a larger-than-expected drop in orders for durable goods in July, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may hold off raising interest rates again this year.
By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note rose 1/32, to 105 9/32, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.71 percent from 5.72 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 108 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.66 percent from 5.67 percent. 
 The 12.4 percent plunge in durable goods orders last month was the largest on record and surpassed economists' expectations.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebbber, said the "orders data are consistent with our forecast for G.D.P. growth to slow in the third quarter to 3.3 percent at an annual rate after 5.2 percent growth in the second quarter." He said the numbers were consistent with forecasts that the Federal Open Market Committee, which next meets on Oct. 3, will remain on hold indefinitely. "Nevertheless, one should not overreact to the weakness in these numbers."
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management, said, "Signs of a moderating economy, coupled with faster productivity growth that is helping to suppress inflationary tendencies, has given the Fed some breathing room in its quest to maneuver the economy into a soft landing."
"Furthermore," Mr. Fine said, "the proximity of the presidential election makes it highly unlikely that any change in policy would be instituted at the Oct. 3 F.O.M.C. meeting. Thus if the Fed should deem additional tightening necessary, a clearly debatable point both inside and outside the F.O.M.C., the Nov. 15 meeting would appear to be the earliest conceivable date for further action."
While the Fed is still very sensitive to the potential for inflation in a vibrant economy with a 4 percent unemployment rate, Mr. Fine said, the Fed will remain on hold for an extended period of time unless economic growth picks up or inflationary pressures become threatening or both. He says neither appears imminent.
With the Fed expected to adhere to an unchanged monetary policy, bonds are likely to trade in a range, Mr. Fine said.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., also saw the bond market's lack of reaction to yesterday's data as a sign that it is trading well ahead of itself.
"I think this economic slowdown is not as strong as what Treasury rates are telling us," he said. "You just can't put a pen to paper to justify the current rates."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Up From the Ashes of a Cuban Cigar Case

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, on a sultry August morning, Ken Aretsky was playing golf in Southampton and riding high indeed. That regrettable public unpleasantness at the "21" Club was long behind him (more about that later). He was loving his life as the doting father of two small children (more about that later, too). And he was basking in critical accolades for having created two successful new Manhattan restaurants, Patroon and Butterfield 81 (much, much more about that later, as well).
That's when the phone call came: the United States government was charging him with violating the Trading With the Enemy Act. Such a transgression can be a felony punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of $100,000. 
 Federal agents armed with search warrants had seized dozens of boxes of cigars from the upstairs cigar bar of Patroon, Mr. Aretsky's three-star restaurant at 160 East 46th Street. The next day Mr. Aretsky and his cigar bar manager stood in federal court, accused of buying and selling cigars made in Cuba.
In a stogie-crazed city afire with aficionados overwhelmed by an abundance of bootleg Cuban Cohibas and Montecristos, cigar worshipers bristled at the news.
Indeed, cigarophiles loudly contended that the arrest was a publicity stunt. For though the United States had imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in the early 1960's, for decades American cigar smokers had hidden Cuban stogies in their luggage and had had cigars mailed to them from London tobacconists.
But officials said they were following up on a violation of federal law. Customs agents had tracked a large illegal shipment of Cuban cigars to a house in Connecticut. A raid there had revealed a list of clients that included Mr. Aretsky, his manager and five others, who were arrested.
"It was devastating," said Mr. Aretsky, now 59, in his first interview since that time. "I was shocked. I suppose some people think that notoriety is cool, but I didn't, and neither did my family. It was rough for them. I worried about the future of my business."
Mr. Aretsky had never had a brush with the law before. He grew up at 504 Grand Street on the Lower East Side, took over his father's seltzer-gas supply business, sold it, then made a 1972 success of his first restaurant, Truman's, in Roslyn, N.Y.
After a stint in Manhattan as a stockbroker (one co-worker was the future domestic diva Martha Stewart) he opened the thriving Upper East Side saloon, Oren & Aretsky. He followed that with Arcadia at 21 East 62nd Street, which flourished until the lease ran out in 1997.
In 1987, Mr. Aretsky was asked to turn around that power-lunch dinosaur, the "21" Club. He amended the food and attracted a devoted, less geriatric following. His genial presence was marked by his signature wardrobe, for which the word "dapper" is hardly dapper enough.
BUT after eight years at the helm, "I still had no equity position in the restaurant," he said, adding that he was fired in 1995 after a dispute with the owners. He sued for breach of contract, but says the case is in limbo because the company that hired him filed for bankruptcy last year.
Mr. Aretsky jumped back on the horse immediately by opening an American bistro, Butterfield 81, then opened his competitor to "21," Patroon, which won three stars from The New York Times, in 1996 and again in 1998.
By then Mr. Aretsky was enjoying mature fatherhood. He and his third wife, Diana Lyne, a former Tiffany & Company senior vice president who is a consultant there, had two children, Grace and Eugene, now 7 and 6. (He has two grown children from his first marriage.)
And then federal agents came through the door. Mr. Aretsky acknowledged that "Cubans were sold here with my knowledge," he said on a recent afternoon in the former cigar bar, now a banquet space.
"Clearly we did something wrong and were punished accordingly," Mr. Aretsky said. The United States attorney's office in Manhattan says he ultimately pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and paid a $5,000 fine. He was sentenced to serve 200 hours of community service.
What Mr. Aretsky never anticipated was that he would become so passionate about his court obligation, as he journeyed to the city's inner-city high schools, mentoring students and working with teachers.
He is doing so through the auspices of a 10-year-old nonprofit group called C-Cap, which promotes restaurant careers among inner-city students. "I'm trying to get these kids interested in working as line cooks and pastry chefs and managers," Mr. Aretsky said. "There aren't enough bodies to fill all these jobs, and restaurants need these kids' tremendous energy."
Mr. Aretsky's supervisor, Richard Grausman, founder and president of C-Cap, said, "Ken has put his whole heart into this," referring to the group that reaches out to 2,200 students a year. "Ken has been wonderful with the kids and the teachers."
And now, this August, Mr. Aretsky is about to embark on a new multimillion-dollar restaurant venture on the Upper East Side. "It'll be a fabulous neighborhood American brasserie," he said, name and location to be revealed "imminently."
What of his missionary work with students? "It's a new world to me, something I knew nothing about," he said. "I hope to keep involved with these kids for the rest of my life."

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Founder Charged With Defrauding Its Investors

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Michael W. Berger, a hedge fund manager, was charged yesterday with defrauding 300 people who invested about $575 million in his fund.
Mr. Berger was charged with securities fraud and fraud under the Investment Advisers Act. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail of $75,000 cash and a $100,000 bond secured by his home in the Hamptons. 
 Mr. Berger, an Austrian citizen, was also required to surrender his passport. His attorney, Sara Mogulescu, declined to comment.
Mr. Berger, 28, was the manager of the Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd., which bet that Internet and high technology stocks would decline at a time that they rose.
Federal prosecutors from the United States attorney's office in Manhattan said that Mr. Berger reported annual fund earnings as high as 27.4 percent in 1997, when his company lost about $400 million.
Prosecutors charge that Mr. Berger hid the losses from investors and from auditors by creating fake financial records and passing them off as the fund's actual returns. When auditors from the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche asked for additional records to confirm Mr. Berger's reports for 1999, prosecutors said, Mr. Berger fired them.
Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Berger and his management company for overstating the fund's holdings and using misleading account statements to raise more than $350 million from investors since 1996.
The S.E.C. froze the assets of the fund and the court appointed a receiver to review the figures. Peter H. Bresnan, the S.E.C.'s assistant chief litigation counsel, said when the fund was frozen about $35 million remained. Some investors had removed about $140 million, leaving overall losses of about $400 million, he said.
Mr. Bresnan said that for the most part the fund did not attract small investors. "These were institutions and high-net-worth individuals predominantly from outside the United States," he said.
According to prosecutors, investors had to contribute at least $250,000 to participate in the fund.
Mr. Berger opened his hedge fund in August 1995, and began to market it overseas in April 1996. Prosecutors said that he marketed the fund by predicting downturns in certain areas of the stock market; for example, in a March 1998, letter to investors, Mr. Berger predicted that "economic momentum should deteriorate." He said the most vulnerable sectors included the Internet, telecommunications and drugstores.
Prosecutors charged that the strategy resulted in tremendous losses when the value of these stocks increased. But they said that Mr. Berger was able to conceal the growing losses, and continued to attract new investors, by falsifying the fund records. According to prosecutors, the hedge fund maintained an account with Financial Asset Management, although the fund's assets were held by Bear Stearns Securities, which served as the clearing broker.
Beginning in September 1996, prosecutors charged, Mr. Berger began to falsify statements that were passed along to investors by the fund administrators.
According to the charges filed with the court, Mr. Berger used statements from Bear Stearns as a template, but changed the heading to Financial Asset Management. They said Mr. Berger altered the fake statements and sent them to the fund administrator. The administrator also received statements from Bear Stearns that accurately reflected the fund's performance, prosecutors said. But they said that Mr. Berger told the administrator to disregard the Bear Stearns statements because they only represented a small portion of the fund's actual holdings.
Mr. Berger wrote a monthly letter to investors that the administrator distributed along with the statements. In his March 10, 1999, letter, prosecutors said, Mr. Berger spoke of his "bearish outlook towards the market," and noted that although the market had hit a new high "an exhaustion point has been reached."
Prosecutors said Mr. Berger used the same techniques to fool the fund's auditors. They said when auditors for Deloitte & Touche requested more documentation, Mr. Berger fired them on Jan. 6 and the accounting firm withdrew its annual audit opinions for 1996 through 1998.

HEADLINE: 'Buyers' Clubs' for Medical Services Crop Up

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
A variety of new companies are beginning to offer below-market prices on prescription drugs and services like doctor, dental and eye care and medical tests.
Like buyers' discount clubs such as Costco or Sam's Club, the new companies attract people looking for a better price, in this case because they have no health insurance or because their health insurance does not cover the treatments they want. 
 Individual patients sign up, often on the Internet, and agree to pay for medical services with cash or a debit or credit card. They usually pay a small annual membership fee, and get an identification card that is accepted by a network of doctors, drugstores or other health care providers.
The drugstores and other providers join the plans -- and accept the lower prices -- to reach more customers. And doctors, eager to avoid payment delays and restrictions when patients are using insurance, accept reduced fees comparable to those they receive from managed care companies.
Because the services are so new, there are no firm statistics on how many people have signed up, or how many thousands of doctors are involved. But many self-employed people with little or no insurance find the new discounters particularly useful.
Adria Firestone, a mezzo-soprano who lives in Jersey City, said her performers' union health plan became so expensive she could no longer afford full coverage. So when she needed bifocal contact lenses before a concert in Italy, she showed her card from a company called Medisavers to a participating Manhattan optometrist. As a Medisavers member, she paid $306.68 instead of the $475 retail price.
David Wallen, a freelance entertainment writer in Los Angeles, saw a Web site operated by a company called HealthAllies soon after it began offering doctor's services last May. There was no charge to sign up. "They negotiated rates for me with the internist and eye-ear-throat doctor I was already seeing," he said. "It saved me half on my medical bills. It's great for people without health insurance."
Patients with insurance are using the new services as well. Patients trying to see a doctor outside their managed care network, or looking for a medical service their insurance does not cover, like acupuncture or cosmetic surgery, may now be able to find a lower price.
"We are seeing a real phenomenon," said Gail Wilensky, a health care economist and former White House official. "People are going to be able to shop and choose" from a variety of medical services including "individual providers and services they want."
The new programs are not specifically aimed at people of limited means who do not qualify for Medicaid, those often referred to as the working poor. The programs can stretch the buying power of people who can afford to pay for medical care -- including the one in 10 uninsured people who earn $50,000 a year or more.
Making discounts on health care widely available "is clearly a method for making the market work better," said Judith Lave, a professor of health economics at the University of Pittsburgh. "We are clearly better off with them than without them." But she said the services would mainly attract patients who were relatively well off, so the discounts would not solve "our macro problem" -- the 45 million people without health insurance.
Limited alternatives to employer-sponsored medical plans have existed for some time. AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, has long had a mail-order pharmacy for its members, for example. But the new companies can help people who do not have an employer or an organization to negotiate the lower discounts that are typically provided to groups.
The most recent, HealthMarket, a start-up in Wilton, Conn., led by Stephen F. Wiggins, the former chief executive of Oxford Health Plans, began listing doctors on its Web site in late July and plans to add hospitals, dental and vision care and alternative medicine next month.
Other small companies starting up or expanding discount medical services include HealthAllies, based in Glendale, Calif.; MedAdvantage in Southfield, Mich.; AmeriPlanUSA in Dallas; and Medisavers, which also offers health plans to a number of New York unions.
There are larger companies entering the business as well. In June, the Reader's Digest Association joined with Medco, a subsidiary of Merck & Company, to advertise drugstore discount cards and mail service to 50 million customers of Digest magazines, books and records, and says it may eventually offer other medical services as well.
People who join YourxPlan, the Reader's Digest-Medco program, pay $25 a year, or $40 for a family, to get promised savings averaging 18 percent on brand-name drugs by mail order, and 11 percent at 40,000 participating pharmacies. Members can also check on prices or order refills on the Internet.
Thomas O. Ryder, chairman of the Digest, said it started the business after conducting a survey of customers of its magazines, books and records. "We discovered that around 20 million did not have drug coverage," he said.
Other people find the new services through professional organizations. Melissa Wahl, executive director of the National Association for Female Executives, said the organization was recommending HealthAllies to its 135,000 members, many of whom run small businesses with limited insurance benefits.
Most of the new medical service companies hope to grow swiftly if the tight employment market eases, and if big companies begin to remodel health benefits the way they did when they replaced pensions with 401(k) plans. If companies make that change, employees would receive a set amount for their health-care needs instead of the relatively open-ended coverage they have now, and they would spend their own money if their costs exceeded the set amount.
Already, employees are shouldering more of their health care costs. The percentage of employees with fully paid health coverage has dropped sharply under managed care. In 1998, 26.6 percent of Americans had fully paid care, compared to 45.5 percent in 1983, said James L. Medoff, a Harvard University economist who studied the trend for the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research organization.
Even the covered services in managed care are disappointing many patients. "Health plans have so frustrated consumers that some of them are ready to reach in their pocket and spend money," said Karen Donelan, a public opinion expert at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Bill McGahan, a health care industries investment banker at UBS Warburg said: "Everybody hates the current system. Employers don't like it; physicians don't like it; employees don't like it."
Indeed, out-of-pocket spending on health care services is exploding, especially for drugs. Americans spent $199.5 billion of their own money on health care in 1998, by the government's latest count, up 38 percent since 1990.
Of that amount, consumers spend $30 billion annually on alternative medical treatments like acupuncture, said Prof. Regina Herzlinger, a health care expert at the Harvard Business School. Professor Donelan said that a recent survey by Harris Interactive found that 15 to 20 percent of Americans who have health insurance were already spending their money for extras.
To capture some of that spending, the online discount health plans offer services and products that many health plans do not cover, including expensive, heavily advertised drugs like Claritin for allergies, life-style products like Viagra for male impotence, and laser surgery to correct nearsightedness.
Express Scripts said it was adding more than 500 members each week to several new drug card programs it started this summer with groups like Seniority America, which sells services to people over 50.
As with much of what is available on the Web, the information provided by the new medical companies is not always screened for reliability or accuracy. The Web sites provide only limited information about the doctors in their programs, and many rely on outside organizations that have been approved by the National Committee for Quality Assurance to vet doctors' credentials.
"Consumers on their own looking for quality information about doctors are at a real disadvantage," said Barry Scholl, a spokesman for the quality assurance committee, whose main function is to set standards and accredit managed care plans. Yesterday, legislation in California that would have regulated the discount companies was defeated. Consumer advocates and some medical groups said the law would have been too lax.
At HealthAllies.com, the listings on doctors include their addresses, fees, the number of patients they see each day, and whether they are board certified in their specialties. The company promises savings of "10 to 50 percent on the things insurance doesn't cover."
On HealthMarket, Mr. Wiggins's start-up, consumers can get information, including professional profiles of doctors, fees and full charges for dozens of treatments. Individuals pay $29 a year, $49 for families, plus a transaction fee for each service.
Doctors said they liked the prompt frustration-free payments and increased patient flow. Dr. Stephen B. Meisel, a radiologist who is chief executive of Medfocus, a national chain of 1,800 medical imaging centers, said the services were "a great idea."
"When we sign up with insurance companies or employers," he said, "we give them a good value because they provide patient volume. We offer the same range of fees for HealthAllies.com. The patients are getting a big break." For example, he said, a magnetic resonance imaging scan, or M.R.I., in New York City would cost "50 percent off the retail price."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Showalter Is Feeling Arizona Heat

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The Arizona Diamondbacks didn't know when they were well off. They certainly didn't know their place. Win a division championship in their second season of existence, will they? Yeah, we'll teach those uppity Southwesterners.
The Diamondbacks come to Shea Stadium tonight for a three-game series with the Mets, two and a half games from the spot they held in the National League West at the end of last season and four and a half games behind the Mets in the wild-card race. They arrive not only in danger of failing to repeat their postseason visit but also surrounded by questions about their manager's future and their own. 
 "We're fighting off the wolves," Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing partner, said yesterday.
The wolves, in this instance, have press passes, the kind that entitle a holder to call for the dismissal of a manager. Manager Buck Showalter has his critics, but he is also the same fellow who presided over the fastest-ever division championship.
"I've chosen to take the high ground," Showalter said in a telephone interview, discussing the criticism he has recently endured. "I have a pretty good idea of what the agenda was there. I don't think it's worthwhile to address it. It happens to everybody. It's part of the job description. I live with it."
Showalter's managerial style invites scrutiny; it's easy to criticize. But his insistence on controlling everything that goes on in the clubhouse is part of the intense attention he pays to details, a characteristic that endeared him to George Steinbrenner until they underwent a messy divorce following the 1995 season.
Showalter is old school. He has been criticized for having coaches tell Diamondbacks players not to talk to players on the other team during batting practice, but players once upon a time were fined for fraternizing with their opponents. Umpires would sit in the stands during batting practice and note the numbers of players from opposing teams who talked to each other. The numbers would go into the league offices, and fines would be levied.
This is a different era, in which players are buddies, they earn millions more than their managers and they think they should have the right to do what they want, just like children everywhere. The high cost of baseball in this era has also made winning a requirement for continued employment. Sometimes even people who don't have a dollar invested in a club feel free to tell the owner what to do.
"When I first got here, I saw criticism of Jerry," said Showalter, who has two years left on his seven-year contract. "I said to myself, if they go after him, it's going to happen to all of us. We live in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world. Your job as manager is to win championships. If you don't or you're not moving in that direction, you're going to get questions."
The Diamondbacks, despite injuries to key players, have only four fewer victories than they had in the same number of games last season, but the San Francisco Giants have six more victories, accounting for the teams' reversal in the standings.
The 1999 Diamondbacks won 100 games, 35 more than their expansion counterparts. It was the biggest improvement, one season to the next, in baseball history. The division championship came with it. Given the grumbling in the desert, it was too much too soon. Maybe the Diamondbacks' followers would have prefered the loveable-loser kind of expansion team, as the Mets were in the early 60's.
Colangelo spent freely on creating a contender. Now even his economics have come under scrutiny. Much was made recently of a loan the Diamondbacks secured, with the assistance of Major League Baseball. The loan was reported to be for $20 million, which Colangelo said was incorrect.
Whatever the amount, the Diamondbacks won't be filing for bankruptcy anytime soon.
"If you look at what's happening on the financial landscape," Colangelo said, "with banks merging and consolidating, with our banking relationship, we needed to restructure some debt. We had to move some money over. That's what we're talking about here."
Then he added, referring to the Marlins' decimated 1997 World Series winners: "This is not a Florida. We don't have a for-sale sign up. We'll be just fine."
But they will be finer if they can overtake the Mets for the wild card or the Giants for another division title. Injuries to key players and poor production from others have undermined the Diamondbacks' defense of their title. If they don't gain a postseason spot, will Showalter's job be in jeopardy?
"I don't dwell on those things," he said. "You do the best job you can do and be yourself. I have a lot of confidence in our organization and they do in me. You try to have a thick skin. It's a challenge managers have to overcome."
Colangelo was initially perceived as giving Showalter a lukewarm endorsement to continue as manager, but yesterday he said: "Buck and I are fine. Buck knows that he is my manager. We invested a lot of money in a contract with him. We believe in him. He's made a major contribution. Why should I be responsive to a speculative story and give the so-called vote of confidence? It's insulting to be put in that position. He's my manager until he isn't. He knows he's accountable like everyone else and he accepts that."

HEADLINE: Despite Soaring Prosperity, Poland Still Isn't Sure of Itself

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BIALA RAWSKA, Poland

 BODY:
In the last 10 years, Urszula Malinowska and her husband have transformed their lives, turning a tiny farm and orchard into a wood-processing factory that employs 35 people.
In 1991, after failed farming ventures, they bought a used American machine to cut timber, a Wood-Mizer, and created a business of turning timber into lumber for the building boom that has transformed this area near Mszczonow, some 35 miles southwest of Warsaw. 
 Now, they have $500,000 a year in revenue, produce their own power and heat from the waste wood and sawdust, and are planning a more modern plant to work on more expensive woods for higher-profit furniture.
Mrs. Malinowska, at 48, could be a billboard for the new market economy that has taken hold in Poland, the largest and most successful economic transformation in central Europe. She is the active boss of one of two million small and medium-sized private enterprises in a country of 42 million people.
But like many Poles, she is not especially happy with the way things are, and she is likely to vote for the reformed Communists of the Democratic Left Alliance in parliamentary elections expected next spring, dumping the more conservative Solidarity alliance.
To Mrs. Malinowska, the changes have come with mixed blessings. "The great satisfaction is that we've built something new, and without permission from anyone," she said, as her workers took large pine logs and began to turn them into lumber.
"As owners, there is a great feeling of responsibility, and we work from 6 to 6," she added. "But there is a sense of achieving one's goals."
Still, she said, "there are lots of problems." Small businesses don't get much help from the state; the tax laws are complicated and contradictory; there is an effective state monopoly on the supply of lumber, given the difficulties of trade with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus; and with Poland still outside the European Union and membership probably four years away, she feels that "our Western partners take advantage of our weaknesses."
The sourness is widely felt by Poles, whose rapid progress is nonetheless falling behind their own expectations. While young people are full of confidence, many Poles still have a deep fear of being marginalized, of falling behind, both as individuals and as a nation striving to join the rest of Europe as an equal, said Jacek Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an independent Polish research organization.
"Poland is a country doing better than it feels -- it's doing better than it thinks it's doing," Mr. Kucharczyk said. Polls show that more than 50 percent of Poles think it's a better country than 10 years ago, and only 30 percent disagree, he said.
But change is still frightening to those who are over 40. And the current Solidarity government's big reforms -- to decentralize and streamline health care, education, pensions and provincial administration -- have caused enormous anxiety.
With more to lose, there is also a growing concern about personal safety and crime, and a feeling that the police are not keeping up with the problem.
Even the prospect of joining the European Union has raised considerable fear -- not just among the many farmers who fear European competition, but also among those who worry that Poland will give up some of its precious identity, after centuries of struggle to shape and preserve it.
What is the Polish nightmare? "To be the Mexico of Germany: proud, important, too big to fail, but deeply unbalanced next to a neighbor that is too rich and too big," one European ambassador said.
Poles are more pessimistic these days, said Halina Binczak, economics editor of the respected daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita. In polls, only about 8 percent of Poles think the reforms are going well. Five years ago, she said, 60 percent of households had trouble making ends meet. Today, it's some 40 percent. "Yet five years ago, people were more optimistic than now," she said. "Our aspirations are rising faster than our possibilities. People are less satisfied with what they have, even though they have more."
Yet the signs of new prosperity are all over Poland. In Mszczonow, a small town of some 6,000, there are scores of new shops -- bakeries, groceries, hardware stores, hairdressers -- that did not exist 10 years ago. The town has streetlights now, put up four years ago. A special kind of apple is being grown by farmers that feeds good, tart concentrate into blended juices; there is one large industrial park, called Europark, already in operation, with another soon to open.
On this main route near Warsaw, there are hundreds of trucks from all over Europe and the former Soviet Union. Servicing them are large gas stations, looking like modern palaces, with their cafes and small grocery stores attached. (And in a sign of the growing traffic, numerous prostitutes line up at intervals along the roadway.)
The roads are crammed with new cars. Poles have bought more than 500,000 new cars each year for the last four years, reflecting the prosperity and an explosion in consumer credit, but posing dangers for more inflation, already at 11.6 percent in July, a two-year high.
And they use their cars to shop at huge supermarket complexes in the suburbs, where Ikea rubs up against KFC and McDonald's and Carrefour and Geant superstores.
But for all this wealth, the infrastructure lags far behind. Warsaw traffic is bad, and there is barely a subway system, with only one short line. The telephone system, reluctantly changing from a state monopoly, is inefficient, compared with the Czech Republic's or even Romania's, and expensive.
There are few highways, and the two-lane roads -- effectively three-lane, with expensive cars zooming around buses, trucks and the little old Polski Fiats that can't go much over 60 miles an hour -- are often seamed and channeled, with heavy traffic punishing roadbeds built for less booming times.
Road fatalities are consequently a major issue, with large green and black signs displaying the number of dead and injured at particularly bad spots. A billboard campaign shows wrecked cars with large, one-word slogans: "Autoagresja" and "Autodestrukcja."
Like its roads, Poland's politics are messy and crowded, still driven by the ideologies of the battle, 20 years ago, against Communism: Reformed Communists versus the Solidarity coalition, which itself is a very broad church of some 30 parties. Although its roots are in a trade union, Solidarity is center-right in politics. Some of the best-known intellectuals associated with Solidarity, like Bronislaw Geremek, the historian and former foreign minister, formed the Freedom Union, further to the right. And then there are farmers' parties and some Roman Catholic parties that veer toward ultranationalism, exemplified by Radio Marya, a radio station supported by a vocal minority of Poland's priests.
But as everywhere in the former Soviet-bloc countries, patronage and corruption still play too large a role in politics, with parties and ministers often getting kickbacks from businesses and lobbyists for contracts or favors.
The Polish government itself asked the World Bank to look into corruption last year, and was told that the main problem is graft among legislators, ministers and judges.
Economically, everyone agrees, Poland's biggest problem is the deficit in the current trade account -- with imports, fed by new prosperity and credit, growing more rapidly than exports. The gap is now almost 8 percent of gross domestic product, said Ms. Binczak of Rzeczpospolita. The government has to do more, she said, to support exporters with credits and tax breaks or risk a currency crisis and a reduction in foreign capital flows that finance the budget deficit.
Even so, Polish exports have at least quadrupled in the last decade, with more than 70 percent of exports going to countries of the European Union and only 10 percent now going to Russia, said Witold M. Orlowski of the Independent Center for Economic Studies. The economy is growing an average of about 5 percent a year over the past several years, and the government estimates $12 billion this year in foreign direct investment, after last year's record $8 billion -- a serious vote of confidence by hardheaded foreign businesses.
Some diplomats and analysts are concerned that the minority Solidarity government, facing likely elections in the spring over the 2001 budget, will increase the budget deficit too much with populist spending, to try to fight slowly rising unemployment, estimated at 13.5 percent this year. But Ms. Binczak and others believe that the fundamentals of economic policy are set, in part by the markets and the pressure to join the European Union, and that the politicians will not want to disrupt them too badly.
"The overwhelming sense is that the Poles are going in the right direction," a Western ambassador said. "This is no longer a grimy little East European country trying to keep its head above water, but a country taking its place in Europe."
Agriculture remains the biggest structural challenge to a modernizing Poland -- and to its entry into the European Union. Some 25 percent of Poland's workers live in the poorer countryside, many of them on small farms. But of the country's 2.1 million farms, only half sell significant amounts to the market. The other half belong to subsistence farmers, whom no one wants to suddenly move into the cities. The European Union will help, but wants to contain the size of the subsidies.
Farmers, protected by socialism, are the ones most concerned by the new Poland, which they see as a land of high taxes, falling farm prices and rising prices for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and machinery.
In Skorzec, a tiny village about four miles south of Ciechanowiec, two farmers, Czeslaw Bojar, 59, and his neighbor, Kazimierz Murowski, 64, stopped work to chat and complain.
"When I bought my first tractor, under Communism, it cost 27 pigs," Mr. Murowski said. "Today, it costs 100 pigs." He stopped to scratch. "It's not that we liked Communism, but life was better for us then."
Mr. Bojar has six sons and worries that his farm, roughly 25 acres, will not be big enough for all of them, and that some will find themselves in the cities, unemployed. As for the European Union, he said: "I can't know the future, and people disagree. But when we join the E.U., it will be like a bulldozer and break down all the walls, and then who knows?"
Mr. Murowski said everything was comparative. "I remember how it was after the war, with everything destroyed and nothing to eat," he said. "Well, it's better to be poor in peace than rich in war."
Still, the farmers have cars, heat, telephones and television, a big change from 15 years ago, they admit, and their neighbors, with a new roof and siding on their house, are off working in Belgium, earning good money.
"When we were a Communist country, they said we'll be in heaven one day, and now they say it'll be even nicer that we're not Communists anymore," Mr. Bojar said. "And we, we still hope it will be better than it is."
Karol Szyndzielorz, a former journalist turned businessman, put it simply. "Poles cannot believe it, but it's true," he said. "Poland is now a lucky country."

HEADLINE: Air Rage

 BODY:
After a summer of record delays and frayed nerves, the nation's flying public is being told the situation is untenable and will be fixed. It is a tale we have heard before, as recently as a year ago.
Flight delays are up 10 percent from last year. This week Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called in the key players in commercial aviation to talk about ways to improve what is increasingly looking like a broken system. 
 There are some heartening signs that airlines, their unions and transportation regulators are genuinely ashamed of the endurance test flying has become. Some airlines have agreed to fly some of their short routes at lower altitudes to alleviate congestion in the skies, and are cutting back on their schedules to enhance their performance. In recent years, unrealistic peak-time scheduling by airlines at major airports has contributed greatly to delays.
But there are no quick fixes for a system strained to its limits by the estimated 178 million passengers who will have boarded an aircraft this summer in the United States. That figure is up 37 percent from 1990. Clearly, the longest economic expansion in American history is as responsible for the clogged skies as any other culprit. And thanks to the revolution in information technology, airlines have become increasingly sophisticated at auctioning off seats to leisure travelers that would otherwise go empty. Planes are thus more packed than ever, making travel all the less enjoyable.
Real, systemic relief for the nation's strained aviation grid is still a few years away, in the form of added runways at the busiest airports and a new satellite navigation system that will free pilots from having to stay within set flight lanes in the sky.
The Federal Aviation Administration has already become a more savvy and efficient traffic cop, though one bedeviled all summer by unusually bad weather. This June saw 19 "severe weather" days, compared with 5 in 1999. That helped make it the worst flying month ever, with more than 50,000 delayed flights, or 20.5 percent more than a year earlier. Because of the hub-and-spoke architecture of today's airline route systems, when things go badly in one part of the nation's air grid, it tends to affect traffic elsewhere.
United Airlines' labor travails this summer did not help matters either. Pilots at United, the nation's largest airline, turned down overtime and called in sick because of a continuing labor dispute, forcing the airline to cancel as many as 600 flights over a recent weekend.
Secretary Slater has set up a task force to look at ways to enhance the notoriously sloppy quality of information shared by airlines, regulators and consumers. This is no small matter, as anyone stuck at an airport and deprived of meaningful information will agree. Too often, passengers are treated like children incapable of handling the truth, or airlines massage facts to shift blame for delays. If nothing else, a passenger trapped in a hub-and-spoke nightmare is entitled to accurate information.

HEADLINE: U.S. Contends Muslim Charity Is Tied to Hamas

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The State Department has asked the Agency for International Development to withdraw its registration from one of the largest Muslim charities in the United States, saying it has ties to the terrorist group Hamas, government officials say.
Christopher Madison, a spokesman for the agency, said it had not officially heard from the department, but when it did, "the agency's officials will take appropriate action." 
 But the agency has started to review how it registers charities and relief groups that work overseas, a procedure that allows the groups to get United States government grants and contracts. The agency has also stopped listing registered groups on its Web site until the review is completed, the agency said today.
Officials said that the State Department's request was part of an effort to clamp down on charities and relief organizations suspected of being used to support Islamic terrorist organizations acting against American citizens. The effort was prompted by recent terrorist attacks and plots against Americans and American property.
Officials said the aid agency had asked the State Department to produce evidence supporting its concerns about the Muslim charity, Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, an Islamic relief group based in Richardson, Tex. Government officials say one reason they suspect the group is tied to Hamas is that it provides support to families of suicide bombers.
Israel, contending that the foundation was a front for Hamas, closed it and four other charities in May 1997. Earlier this year, the family of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Israel filed a civil suit against Holy Land, seeking monetary damages in what the suit contends is its support of Hamas-inspired terrorism.
A spokeswoman for the foundation, Dalal Mohammed, said she was surprised to learn of the State Department's request. "We're in close cooperation with A.I.D.," Ms. Mohammed said.
The charity, which says it raises about $6 million a year for the poor, mostly in the Palestinian Authority, has repeatedly denied an affiliation with Hamas or any terrorist group. It says it is the object of an Israeli vendetta, to deny charity to poor and needy Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
While Holy Land has not applied for federal grants, withdrawing its registration would prevent it from asserting, as it has in recent publications, that it has been "accepted and certified" by the aid agency.
The request for the revocation came last week from the State Department's counterterrorism office, which told the agency that the charity's work was "contrary to the national defense and foreign policy interests of the United States" and because it provided indirect support to Hamas, officials said.
A State Department official said an interagency committee was drafting new guidelines for vetting relief groups more meticulously to ensure that "bad groups do not get recognition or money from the U.S. government."
As a result of its review, the agency might decide to stop registering private charities altogether, one official from the agency said.
The registration procedures now are quite loose, the official said. None of the agency's eight requirements for registration specifically prohibits groups from supporting terrorism or engaging in activities that could damage American foreign policy interests.
"The foundation seems to have taken advantage of some very sloppy registration procedures," the official said. "That's why the requirements at the very least must be changed."
The agency approved the Holy Land Foundation's request for registration on June 29, despite the fact that the charity was included in a list of 30 Islamic relief groups that are the focus of government concern.
The State Department request is yet another political embarrassment for the independent agency, which reports directly to the secretary of state and which prominent senators and members of Congress tried to abolish several years ago.
Last December, the agency, also at the State Department's request, revoked two grants worth $4.2 million to the Islamic African Relief Agency, a charity based in Columbia, Mo. Government officials asserted that the charity had ties to Sudan, which the State Department has identified as a sponsor of terrorism.
Ahmed Mubarak, the organization's president, said at the time that the charity had "nothing to do with Sudan" and denied that it supported terrorism. Since then, the charity has challenged its suspension as unlawful.
The aid agency's handling of its registration procedures shows how difficult it is for the government to restrict groups it suspects of having terrorist ties without jeopardizing their civil liberties.
Government officials said their investigations could reveal evidence of terrorist ties that fell short of a "smoking gun" that could be used to prosecute such charities on charges of violating a 1996 law banning fund-raising by and contributions to groups that sponsor or support international terrorism.
According to government documents and interviews with officials, the government has been investigating the Holy Land Foundation since 1996. But no charges have been filed against the charity.
"Obviously, we can't deny a group registration or funding to a group simply because it is being investigated," said a State Department official.
"But in this case, we concluded that Holy Land's support for the widows and orphans of suicide bombers was inimical to the American-led peace process in the Middle East, and hence, to American national security and foreign policy objectives," the official said.
At the same time, a State Department official said the administration did not want to jeopardize the work of more than 6,000 legitimate Islamic groups operating worldwide, which provide emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places, often with the support of friendly states. Nor, he added, does it want to be publicly criticized as being anti-Muslim.

No Lasting Problems Seen For Mitsubishi in Japan
Despite the public humiliation that it had concealed customer complaints about defects for more than two decades, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's fourth-largest carmaker, is not likely to suffer a significant loss in sales or damage to its brand image in Japan, analysts say.
For one, analysts said, both Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru, and Daihatu Motors were forced to recall cars in the late 1990's, with little effect on sales. And despite the deception in Mitsubishi's case, there was no evidence that the defects had caused any fatal or otherwise serious accidents, further limiting potential public reaction to the recall of 620,000 cars and trucks.

HEADLINE: Lazio Distances Himself, by About 40%, From Bush Tax Cut Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: AMHERST, N.Y., Aug. 24

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio moved to distance himself from Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut plan today, offering his own package of business and personal tax reductions that by his campaign's calculation is nearly 40 percent smaller than the one Mr. Bush has made a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.
Mr. Lazio's proposal for the use of a projected $4.4 trillion, 10-year surplus, which he outlined in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce here, includes a call to allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax from their federal income taxes, much the way state and property taxes are now treated. His plan would affect the payroll tax that finances the Social Security Trust Fund. Mr. Lazio said that proposal, combined with a menu of tax cuts long advocated by Congressional Republicans -- like eliminating the inheritance tax and the so-called marriage penalty -- would save the average New York family about $3,000 a year in taxes. 
 He also proposed permitting parents to put aside up to $500, free of tax, to pay for primary and secondary education in parochial and other private schools.
"The idea that the surplus ultimately belongs to the American people is not conservative or liberal, it's not even Republican or Democrat -- it's just common sense," said Mr. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate. "And if I'm senator, New Yorkers will get to keep more of what they earn. My opponent believes there's no room in a $4.4 trillion surplus for meaningful tax relief for New York families. I believe simple fairness demands that we give taxpayers a break."
Mr. Lazio's speech today came in a week in which Mr. Bush has found himself defending the fiscal prudence of his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut, in the face of attacks by Democrats and polling data suggesting that the idea has not stirred much interest among voters. And in New York, Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has repeatedly sought to link Mr. Lazio to Republican tax cut proposals that she has said are too broad and has described as a threat to the nation's future prosperity. Mr. Lazio's response today suggested some concern in his campaign about that line of attack.
The 27-minute speech by Mr. Lazio, of Suffolk County, signaled, as well, a coming to life of a campaign that has been somewhat dormant for much of the summer.
One of Mr. Lazio's advisers said that he had intentionally kept a low profile while campaigning in order to raise money and to give himself time to become acquainted with issues, and in the belief that he benefited from keeping attention off himself and on Mrs. Clinton.
With Labor Day, the traditional start of the general election campaign, less than 10 days away, Mr. Lazio is moving into a new, higher-profile phase of his campaign; today's speech was the first in what aides said would be a series of addresses intended to flesh out his political portrait.
In addition to invoking an issue that Republicans have seized on in election after election over the past two decades -- tax cuts -- Mr. Lazio today seemed to be making a definite effort to move away from Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, if not the Republican presidential candidate himself. A campaign press release put the cost of Mr. Lazio's tax cut at $776 billion over the next 10 years. "By comparison," Mr. Lazio's campaign said, "George W. Bush's tax plan would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, and Al Gore's tax plan would cost around $500 billion over 10 years."
And Mr. Lazio, in a news conference, was notably cool to Mr. Bush's tax plan, which Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly criticized as excessive. "I am comfortable with the plan that I have laid out right now, in terms of raw size, the macro number," Mr. Lazio said. "I'm going to keep my options open on what Governor Bush's proposal is until we see what kind of revenues come in next year. I just prefer to make sure that we have a restrained approach that will allow a pay-down of the debt, will allow us to invest in the prescription benefit, and will give us the ability to have some enhanced investment in education at the same time."
Mrs. Clinton's advisers moved to tether Mr. Lazio to Mr. Bush's economic policies. They asserted that his estimate of the cost of his tax cut was grossly understated -- they put it at $1.24 trillion over 10 years -- and said it would undermine the country's economic health.
"Rick Lazio offers New Yorkers yet another reckless trillion-dollar tax plan that simply doesn't hold up," said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. "The Republican tax program would return us to the days of irresponsible budgets, ballooning deficits, and high interest rates."
Mrs. Clinton has proposed a far more modest plan of tax reductions that would total $496 billion, her aides said today. They would include a reduction, rather than elimination, of the marriage penalty and inheritance tax, and tax credits for such things as college tuition. She said that the nation's surplus first should be used to pay down the country's debt and to shore up the Social Security program.
The centerpiece, and most unusual aspect, of Mr. Lazio's plan today was to allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax from their federal income taxes. Such proposals have been raised in Congress before, but usually discarded, both because they would be hugely expensive and would offer more of a benefit to wealthier taxpayers in higher-income tax brackets.
The payroll tax affected, the one that finances the Social Security fund, is 6.2 percent this year for individuals on the first $76,200 of income; employers put in another 6.2 percent. Mr. Lazio said his proposal would cost the government $300 billion; Mrs. Clinton's aides put the figure at closer to $500 billion.
The remainder of Mr. Lazio's's tax-reduction program is made up of a number of more familiar Republican initiatives. Mr. Lazio called for cutting the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, increasing allowable I.R.A. contributions to $5,000 from $2,000, and eliminating part of the tax on Social Security benefits.
Mr. Lazio used his speech today to offer his own response to what has been a political complication for Republicans running for office this year: the state of the economy. Calling the country's financial health "a wave of economic prosperity unrivaled in human history," the congressman disputed the Democrats' claims of credit for it.
Instead, Mr. Lazio attributed the nation's economic well-being to, among other things, tax cuts initiated by President Ronald Reagan and actions by the Federal Reserve to control interest rates. And he reiterated his opposition to the economic program pushed through by President Clinton at the start of his presidency, which included tax increases to reduce the nation's deficit.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly invoked that legislation as a turning point.

HEADLINE: $55 Million MetLife Settlement

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The GenAmerica Financial Corporation, a unit of MetLife Inc., the leading insurer in the United States, said today that it would pay out $55 million in benefits to life insurance customers who said they were misled when they bought its life insurance policies.
The settlement is the latest in a series of payouts by United States life insurers that have been accused of misleading customers or of selling them inappropriate products in the 1980's and 1990's. 
 The GenAmerica settlement, made on behalf of its General American Life Insurance Company unit, covers 250,000 customers who bought whole life or universal life insurance policies between 1982 and 1996.
Holders contended that the policies did not yield as much as expected in dividends -- payments that mutual insurance companies make to their owners, the policyholders -- which meant that they had to pay more in premiums over the life of the policies than they had expected.
GenAmerica, which cut its dividend rate in the period as interest rates fell, said levels of dividend payouts were never guaranteed. The company denied the charges of misleading policyholders over policy performance.
"The decision to settle was a business decision," said Kevin Eichner, president of General American Life.
"Our resources are better spent serving our policyholders rather than defending lawsuits," he added.
In May, another MetLife unit, New England Financial, reached a tentative $172 million settlement of similar litigation.
MetLife, based in New York, bought GenAmerica for $1.2 billion in January.
Shares of MetLife fell 69 cents today, to $24.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: States Deregulate Energy at Their Peril

BYLINE: By Gregory Palast; Gregory Palast is a columnist at The Observer of London and the author of a forthcoming book, "Democratic Regulation."

DATELINE: PECONIC, N. Y.

 BODY:
While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, there was a real display of populism 100 miles to the south in San Diego. There politicians have enrolled two million citizens in a scary economic experiment. This year, San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices.
When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that homeowners' bills would fall "by at least 20 percent." In fact, bills jumped 124 percent this August over last. Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24 other states, New York included, have rushed to imitate California's lead. 
 Actually, Californians were lucky. Every hour of every day, San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool. On the first hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to $9,999 per megawatt hour. That's about 5,000 percent more than the once-controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse. According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids. In fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day.
One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to a single source, Daniel Fessler. In the early 1990's, Mr. Fessler, then president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures: the troubled England-Wales Power Pool.
How strange. Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity than Americans. That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200 to 2,000 percent.
In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years. The promise lasted several months, during which time five giant international electricity sellers -- all new to California -- imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain: "stacking," "cramming," "phantom scheduling" and other maneuvers designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year.
The deregulation bug is now winging eastward. New York City, for example, has succumbed to 43 percent average increases in Con Edison bills.
But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened. This month, thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott. The power companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses won't pay. Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school district and -- without a hint of shame -- Steve Peace, a state senator who sponsored the deregulation law.
The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's campaign. After all, it was Mr. Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace. And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas, which is widely expected to produce hefty returns for a former business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of GreenMountain.com, a power seller.
But while Mr. Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against "powerful forces," on this subject he's in a difficult position. Despite recent warnings from federal regulators about the California situation, the Clinton-Gore administration has promoted California-style deregulation as a model for the nation.
Someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it may not be good news for Mr. Gore. During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising.
Electricity is the first big United States industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules. For the first time, Americans feel the bite of real globalization, and don't like it one bit.

HEADLINE: Abuja Journal;
Nigeria's Showplace Awaits 'Big Man' From U.S.

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The street was wide open, with more lanes than cars, on a quiet afternoon here in Nigeria's shiny new capital. But somehow, Usman Muhammad, an excitable 28-year-old taxi driver, had gotten into a fight with a Peugeot immediately recognizable as a government-owned car.
"Government drivers, they are useless! Criminals!" Mr. Muhammad yelled, nearly colliding his jalopy with the Peugeot. "My friend, why are you driving rough?" 
 The Peugeot stopped at an intersection, where Mr. Muhammad's "friend" promptly used his right hand to form the equivalent of the Nigerian finger. "This Abuja," Mr. Muhammad said, somewhat deflated, "they are all driving rough."
He perked up, though, on seeing a Toyoto Corolla, which he has long coveted. "Once I buy that car," he said, "I go marry my wife." He would have it made, as he explained in Nigerian English: "Big man don come."
The biggest of the big men, President Clinton, is to arrive on Saturday in Abuja, a city that has long been home to government rough drivers and ordinary Nigerians with big dreams. Nigeria decided to move its capital from Lagos and create a new one a quarter of a century ago. But it was only in the last decade that the government moved here and Abuja grew from a town to be the capital of Africa's most populous nation.
The concentration of so many new government buildings, new villas, new hotels, new cars on new roads, in a country where every other city seems to teeter on collapse, has long fueled visitors' imagination, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the troubles in the oil-producing Niger Delta were said to have grown in recent years after youths from the region came here. Gaping at the gleaming new capital the country's oil had built, they returned to their villages with a militancy that has since pushed the delta to the brink of civil war.
Lagos -- a city that many Nigerians regard with the same kind of awe and loathing with which many Americans view New York -- was abandoned as the capital because it was too crowded, too dangerous, too closely linked to the Yoruba, the main ethnic group in the area. In a nation riven with ethnic cleavages, a new capital in a neutral zone, geographically in the center of the country, was needed, a symbolic home for all Nigerians. Abuja was born.
Still, telltale signs of the dominance by Nigeria's Muslim northerners dot Abuja. The new National Assembly building looks like a mosque. A gold-domed mosque sits in the middle of the city, not far from an unfinished church.
Mr. Clinton will spend his two days in Nigeria here with his host, President Olusegun Obasanjo. American officials rejected visits to the north and south, partly for security reasons, partly for political ones. Calls to the north and southeast would have angered those in the southwest. Any visit to a city other than Abuja would have been a slight to Lagos.
And so Mr. Clinton will remain stuck in the neutral zone that is Abuja.
In Lagos, whose residents look down on Abuja the same way New Yorkers do on Washington, the news came as a shock. If Abuja knows how to build beautiful roads, Lagos knows how to party. There is fine pepper soup in every neighborhood restaurant, the best musicians from the region, enough thrills to provide plenty of what some English-speaking West Africans call "life enjoyment."
There is not much life enjoyment here in Abuja, which becomes a ghost town on weekends when politicians leave to visit their villages.
"By leaving Lagos out of Clinton's itinerary, it's a big mistake," said James Uloko, 39, who works in public relations in, naturally, Lagos. "From Lagos, you can see all the colors of life in this country."
At a market here, Sylvester Ebere said he did not want any of that color. "I like Abuja for security reasons," he said, acknowledging that he had never set foot in Lagos.
Mr. Ebere, 23, moved to Abuja two weeks ago, looking for job opportunities he has yet to find. He said he had worked as a gardener for a British-owned company in Kaduna.
For now he is living with his brother, Joel, 28. They were selling products like skin cream , and share a $7-a-month cubicle on Abuja's outskirts.
Housing is the hardest part of living here, said Tony Njoku, 42, a businessman, who paid about $300 a year for a two-bedroom apartment 45 minutes from Abuja. Something comparable in the city itself could cost $2,500. "No common man is able to rent here," said Mr. Njoku, who moved here in the late 1980's when Abuja's population was around 15,000. Now it is an estimated 400,000.
It was in 1991 that Nigeria's former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, formally transplanted the capital here, some months after surviving a coup attempt in Lagos. Since then, in this country whose economy still depends almost entirely on the government, the center of gravity has shifted here.
Ibrahim Muhammad, 55, said he had come to Abuja for years to support his two wives and 23 children back home in the northern state of Jigawa.
"I usually go to some big men from my area, who are in government jobs, to ask for contracts," Mr. Muhammad said, explaining that he then sold the contracts -- to clean a road here or to cater some food there -- to a third party for a markup.
"But things are very difficult now," he said, adding that President Obasanjo's administration had cracked down on the freewheeling spending. "The officials no longer want to see us. They now prefer to give contracts to their girlfriends. You can hardly see them inside their cars with dark tinted windows."

HEADLINE: Mexican President-Elect Warmly Greeted in Washington

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Vicente Fox Quesada, the next president of Mexico a land he envisions far closer to the United States, with borders no more than lines on a map -- started laying out his vision to the present and future leaders of the United States today.
Mr. Fox, who takes office on Dec. 1, met with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore; he is to meet Gov. George W. Bush in Texas on Friday. At the White House, the State Department and the vice president's residence, he was congratulated for winning the fairest election in Mexican history on July 2, defeating the ruling party and ending its seven decades of often authoritarian and corrupt government. 
 President Clinton called the Mexican leader's victory "a truly historic affirmation of genuine democracy." A measure of good will -- rare among many of the two men's predecessors -- appeared to flow between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Fox.
"You're walking on clouds," President Clinton told Mr. Fox during their private meeting, according to aides. The thorniest issues dividing the two nations -- drugs, migration, trade disputes -- were discussed, but not debated, aides on both sides said.
Mr. Fox's vision of a future in which people and their possessions can move far more freely across the 2,000-mile border is not shared by official Washington, or by either presidential contender. That frontier has become a battle front, as the United States fights its long and often unsuccessful war against drug traffickers and illegal immigrants heading north.
Mr. Gore found the idea of open borders "clearly problematic," said his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, and Mr. Bush repeated today that he thought "we ought to enforce our borders."
Mr. Clinton said much the same thing. "Obviously, we have borders and we have laws that apply to them, and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans," he said. "But I think over the long run, our countries will become more interdependent."
Mexico has become the United States' second-largest business partner (Canada is No. 1, Japan No. 3). Trade between the two nations is expected to exceed $240 billion this year. And Mr. Fox believes that a growing economic integration will inexorably erode the border -- and the development gap -- in coming years.
Mexico, he says, can develop in the next two or three decades from a client trading with a superpower into a full-fledged partner, if it can answer questions like those he posed today: "How can we narrow the gap on income on both sides of the border? How can we in the long term equal the levels of development between our countries so that we become real friends, real partners and real neighbors?"
If the economy of Mexico grows stronger, if living standards and wages rise -- per-capita income is barely $5,000 a year, and 40 million Mexicans are poor by any standard -- then, Mr. Fox argues, there will be far less incentive for illegal immigration, which has risen to perhaps 150,000 cases a year.
"How can we build up the opportunities in Mexico so that our kids, 12- , 14-year-olds, don't have to leave home, don't have to move to the United States looking for opportunities?" he asked. Not by beefing up border patrols, he said, but building up Mexico.
"As long as we can have in each rural community in Mexico a school of high level," Mr. Fox said, "and we can have a job in those communities, then we will not have migration as we are having now."
Aides said Mr. Clinton expressed concern that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which reduced cross-border trade barriers dividing the United States, Mexico and Canada, had not raised real wages in Mexico. And they said that Mr. Gore had asked Mr. Fox's help in building support for free trade among environmental and labor groups, which have often viewed Nafta as a malevolent force.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Fox spent an hour talking, Mr. Fuerth said, touching on trade, the environment, human rights, democracy and two interwoven problems confronting Mexico: the international traffic that fills the enormous demand for drugs in the United States, and the official corruption that smooths the flow of the drugs.
Mr. Fox pledged to "attack corruption profoundly within government," beginning with Mexico's police and security agencies.

THE POLLS
 
A BOOST FOR GORE
New polls show Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed a significant postconvention boost in four crucial big states, overtaking Gov. George W. Bush in Minnesota and perhaps in Michigan and increasing his lead in New Jersey and California. 
 In Michigan, an EPIC-MRA poll showed Mr. Gore ahead of Mr. Bush by two points, but that lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. In a preconvention poll, he trailed Mr. Bush by eight points.
In Minnesota, a Mason-Dixon Poll gave Mr. Gore an eight-point lead over Mr. Bush. A July Mason-Dixon Poll had Mr. Bush ahead by three points.
The New Jersey poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gave Mr. Gore a 12-point lead. A New Jersey poll taken just before the Republican convention had Mr. Gore ahead by only four points.
In California, a Field Poll had Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush by 13 points. The previous Field Poll, in June, had him ahead by 11 points. Adam Clymer (NYT)
 
THE REPUBLICANS
 
NATIONAL MONUMENTS AN ISSUE
Dick Cheney suggested yesterday that some of the new national monuments created by President Clinton might be reviewed and rescinded if he and George W. Bush were elected.
"Of course, it's not my decision to make," Mr. Cheney said at a campaign appearance in Central Point, Ore. "It's the president-elect who has to make the decision. But I certainly expect we would review a lot of these decisions to see whether or not any action was appropriate."
He said Mr. Clinton had used his executive authority "willy-nilly all over the West" to create national monuments without considering the desires of the people who will be affected. Many fear that creating monument after monument could harm the West's economy by removing land from commercial uses like grazing, logging and mining. Mr. Clinton has created or added to 10 national monuments covering four million Western acres in his effort to carve out an environmental legacy.
Mr. Cheney said that as a congressman from Wyoming he helped get one million acres designated as wilderness -- but only after listening to all sides. "We need to strike a balance," he said. "We need an opportunity for all to be heard." (AP)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
A BIG FUND-RAISING NIGHT
Vice President Al Gore pulled in more than $1.25 million last night in a pair of fund-raising dinners in Washington for the Democratic National Committee. The first dinner drew 30 people, most of them Indian-Americans, who paid $5,000 each. With other contributions, the dinner yielded $250,000.
The second dinner drew about 60 people, most of them friends of Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who also attended. They each paid or raised varying amounts, with a maximum of $50,000, for a total of $1 million. Both dinners were served at the Mayflower Hotel, but the second was a Glatt Kosher meal, the pure form of Kosher food, blessed by a rabbi and provided by a restaurant, Dahan of Washington. Mr. Lieberman, in playful imitation of Mr. Gore at the convention, gave his wife an especially long kiss, and said, "I don't want you to think there's any kind of competition on this ticket, but I told Hadassah I'm not going to stop until we reach seven seconds, which is the current world record."

HEADLINE: Doing the Math of Air Delays;
Traffic Grows, but La Guardia Cannot

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Anthony D. Layne, the terminal duty manager at La Guardia Airport, looked through his van's swishing windshield wipers and sized up the traffic jam of jumbo jets idling before him on the taxiway.
"I think," he said, in a nice bit of understatement, "that things could get a little hairy out here today." 
 It was a summer Friday, one of the busiest days at La Guardia. Yet as summer Fridays go, this one was relatively tame. In the terminal, flight information screens flashed only a few delays. The Mimlitsches of Colorado Springs, Frank and Martina and their three children, were not even particularly upset about the long line at the American Airlines counter. They made it up to the ticket agent in nine minutes. "Not so bad," Mr. Mimlitsch said.
But while there was no air rage raging inside the airport, no teeming of crowds familiar to the veteran La Guardia traveler, there was a whole airport's worth of angry people teeming somewhere else: out on the tarmac, in their respective planes, which by early afternoon were lined up 25 deep waiting to take off. This situation meant that although most airplanes pushed away from the gates right on time that Friday, it was at least an hour, and sometimes more, before they were airborne.
It also meant that untold numbers of connections to final destinations were missed, dozens of gates at other airports were kept idle waiting on those late planes, dozens of other flights at those airports were delayed as a result and so on around the country, like a bad echo.
None of this was a result of anything extraordinary, just a few minor storms hovering near the New York region and a volume of flights that meant even the slightest delays quickly became big delays. And all this happened on a day of only average traffic: 846 takeoffs and landings on La Guardia's two runways, which on a very busy day handle 1,200.
But to spend a day at La Guardia in Queens is to examine through a magnifying glass the factors that have converged to make this summer the worst for airline delays in history, not only here but around the country, provoking a debate about whether the nation's air transportation system is overloaded.
La Guardia is a good case study not necessarily because of the way it is run or because of its delays, though it does often rank among the worst in the country for delays and long taxi times. It is a good example, instead, because it is probably the most extreme case of what many experts say is a chief cause of air travel problems: an airport infrastructure that has not kept pace with the increase in air traffic.
In the case of La Guardia, this is because it is hemmed in between Flushing Bay and the Grand Central Parkway, with little room to grow. Two oversized photographs hanging in the airport's Port Authority operations office tell this story better than any statistics can.
One picture is from 1964, when the airport's new main terminal opened. The other picture is an aerial view of the airport a few years ago, showing a virtually unchanged setting: a crescent with four arms stretching out behind it for jet gates; a tangle of taxiways; the same two runways, now slightly longer, reaching out toward the bay.
But there is one big difference in the pictures. In the 1964 photo -- taken when there were about 200,000 takeoffs and landings a year at the airport -- a couple dozen jets are parked at gates or moving toward the runways. In the recent photo, taken when the number of takeoffs and landings was more than 350,000 a year, it seems as if nearly every square inch of tarmac is covered with jets.
In addition, the airport's two runways now handle traffic coming from the Delta Air Lines terminal, built in 1983, and the US Airways main terminal and shuttle terminal, built in 1992.
Because La Guardia serves so many airlines, which fly to so many cities, it is like a finely calibrated instrument that can be thrown into disarray by the smallest disruption -- bad weather here or anywhere else, late arrivals, air traffic control glitches or bunching, when airlines schedule too many flights at once.
A $340 million renovation, which is nearing completion, has made the terminal much more comfortable and modern, adding food courts and enlarging the lower baggage area. Taxi space has also been improved over the years, but there is certainly no room to add what is most needed -- more runways -- so congestion has become more common.
Mr. Layne has seen tarmac traffic jams so many times that they no longer faze him much. One recent Friday, the culprit was what Mr. Layne refers to as popcorn storm cells, small clusters of turbulent weather, which were north of the city, causing only light rain at the airport, but forcing air traffic controllers to space out takeoffs slightly. Zipping around jets, Mr. Layne pointed toward the radio in his van, which was tuned to the channel used by the officials who direct traffic to the runways.
"The reason why you hear those long periods of silence on there," he said, "is because nobody's moving out here. They don't have anything to tell anybody."
Or as Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, put it: "La Guardia is getting kind of like the George Washington Bridge: a constant rush hour. There are peaks and valleys, but the peaks and valleys are getting a whole lot closer together."
Inside the United Airlines concourse that Friday, Stephanie Black, a church secretary from Ossining, N.Y., was suffering from the results of that constant rush hour. She had just put her 9-year-old son, Daniel, on a flight by himself back to Denver to be with his father. The jet pushed away at 11:29 a.m., a minute early. As she waited, it did not take off. And it continued to not take off. Thirty minutes passed. Then forty-five. Ms. Black needed to go back to work. At 12:20, the jet finally thundered down the runway.
"When he flew in here from Denver, his plane was two hours late," said Ms. Black, 29. "I'm sure he's in there tearing his hair out, probably asking the pilot if he can fly it himself."
Another reason that La Guardia makes an interesting laboratory for viewing flight delays is that it is one of the few airports in the country whose traffic is still limited by the Federal Aviation Administration's high-density rule, which was created in 1969 to prevent overtaxing the air traffic control system. The rule, which now has many exemptions, basically means that no more than 1,224 flights are supposed to take off and land during La Guardia's peak hours, from 6 a.m. to midnight.
But because of the exemptions and a steady increase in the number of flights being scheduled by the major airlines, the flight limit has not prevented the growth of traffic at La Guardia, especially in the last few years. A chart of all La Guardia aircraft movements -- those of big jets, commuter jets, private jets and propeller planes -- shows that last year, for example, there were 371,000 takeoffs and landings, up from 358,157 in 1998 and 345,647 in 1996.
Last April, President Clinton signed a law intended to expand service between New York and smaller cities by creating more slots for small regional jets, those that hold up to 71 passengers, to come into and leave La Guardia.
Critics of the law, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and officials in Queens, have sued to try to stop the addition of slots. They contend that the measure could add as many as 500 flights a day to the airport, swamping it, causing more delays, clogging traffic on the Grand Central Parkway and creating more noise in the skies.
David Z. Plavin, the president of the Airports Council International, a trade association representing major airport operators, said that La Guardia was among 22 national airports classified by the federal government as severely congested, meaning that they have 20,000 hours or more of delays a year, the equivalent, collectively, of waiting around for 834 days for your plane to take off.
Despite the growing outcry from passengers about those delays, the chances for La Guardia, or many of the other airports, to ever get off that list remain dim. In large part, this is because demand for air travel is expected only to increase, as flying becomes a more common form of mass transportation.
Airlines respond to that demand, Mr. Plavin said, not only with many more flights, but also, increasingly, with smaller planes, which are more economical for the airlines and yet mean more takeoffs and landings for the same number of people. The result is a constant and intensifying struggle between demand and the resources of airports and air traffic controllers.
"What I think we're seeing is a tension in the system of people wanting to have more frequency to places they want to fly and airlines obliging, but the system not being able to handle that as efficiently as we need it to," Mr. Plavin said. "It used to be that you had two flights a day between some major cities, and now there are maybe 10 or 20 or 30 by the same airlines. It's not just a matter of insufficient hardware and facilities."
Al Graser, the deputy director of aviation for the Port Authority, which has operated La Guardia since 1947, said that per square foot, La Guardia was still the most efficient airport in the country. In other words, though this may be cold comfort for the average traveler, the airport does a pretty good job with what it has.
And even if, by some magic, La Guardia could add a few runways and triple its taxi space, there would still be traffic jams like the one that rainy Friday, because the next choke point in the system is the air traffic control system, also overburdened from the region's other airports.
If the regional jets begin to pour into La Guardia as a result of the new federal law, said Mr. Graser, a former general manager of La Guardia, "hopefully they'll be prudent and move some of their traffic away from the peaks."
But any way you look at it, he said, "adding another 600 flights a day -- it just can't happen."

HEADLINE: Senate Chief In Trenton Urges Relief In Home Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Across the country, cutting taxes may not be the political weapon it once was, as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seems to be discovering on the presidential campaign trail. But in New Jersey, where property taxes remain the nation's highest per capita, the idea never loses currency.
The state already devotes $10.1 billion, or nearly half its budget, to one form of property tax relief or another. And today, the president of the State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a leading contender for the Republican nomination for governor next year, proposed increasing that relief by $400 million, both in higher rebates to homeowners and in greater state aid to municipalities. 
 Mr. DiFrancesco said at a news conference at the State House today that the added tax relief could easily be paid for by using the growth in state revenues, which he projected at $1.4 billion next year, and without cutting services or eroding the state's mounting surpluses.
His plan, which would have to be included in the budget negotiated next year, would not take effect until the fiscal year beginning in July 2001. It would include more than doubling the size of rebate checks for the elderly, under a program called NJ Saver, from $240, on average, to $500; indexing homestead yearly rebate checks to the rate of inflation, and raising the cap on such rebates from $500, to $750; and increasing a block-grant program of per-capita aid to municipalities, now at $33 million, by $100 million over three years.
Mr. DiFrancesco said it "would be the most significant tax relief program in one year in state history, without raising other taxes."
But Democratic lawmakers, who have been agitating for greater property tax rebates for years, pounced on it as a tacit acknowledgment that Republican legislators, along with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, had failed to do enough until now.
Assemblyman Joseph S. Suliga said Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal "borrows heavily from ideas that Democratic legislators have long put forward as antidotes to Governor Whitman's skewed fiscal priorities."
And Jon J. Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, said Mr. DiFrancesco's proposals were politically palatable but fell well short of what was needed to reduce the tax burden on middle-class homeowners. He said the state ought to look at new ways to tax "paper wealth" in addition to property.
But James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said Mr. DiFrancesco's plan amounted to "a positive incremental approach."

HEADLINE: The Humpty Dumpty of Scholarship;
American History Has Broken in Pieces. Can It Be Put Together Again?

BYLINE: By DAVID OSHINSKY

 BODY:
The writing of American history underwent a significant change in the 1960's and 70's, one that remains in place today. Not only did the Vietnam War set off a reaction against national institutions, especially the state, but the growth of "liberation" movements also led many women, blacks, gays and other groups to demand their own distinctive, "usable past." Increasingly, younger historians shifted their emphasis from the public life of the nation to the private lives of its citizens.
By the 1980's an explosion of historical categories -- race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality -- had supplanted the more traditional fields of political, diplomatic and intellectual history. Those formerly on the margins of American society now got the lion's share of attention. 
 But critics of the new history have worried about the fragmentation of the past, with each group telling its own story, on its own terms, in its own "authentic" voice. And even advocates wondered at times about the place of these categories in the larger scheme of things. How do they fit together? What does the research tell us about the overall culture or the exercise of power in public life? Where is the framework that connects the parts to the whole?
In 1994, the prestigious Journal of American History surveyed its members about the state of the profession. Those who responded -- mostly academic historians -- agreed that the greatest improvement in the field was the inclusion of "more diverse people from the past." Yet when asked to list the greatest weaknesses, the respondents placed "narrowness," "political correctness" and "divorce from the public" at the top of the list. Diversity, it appears, does not come cheap.
In a biting critique, the journal's respected editor, David Thelen, portrayed the new scholarship as "too obscure to appreciate and too remote from everyday life." The profession had reached a point, he warned, "where dazzling people with the unfamiliar and erudite was more highly prized than telling a good story or distilling wisdom."
Six years have passed, but the issues linger. Interviewed recently at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he teaches American history, Mr. Thelen still frets about his profession's divorce from the larger world. Yet he also claims to have widened his own focus in teaching and scholarship in terms that reflect the new social history. "It's difficult to view the nation-state as an agent of progressive change anymore," he says. "I'm trying to stress the more human elements of history. The ways that individuals experience events, interpret them and then remember them are essential to understanding our national culture and beliefs."
Some historians see a clearer pattern of progress in recent years. "Specialization is essential," says Linda Kerber, a history professor at the University of Iowa. "The grand old theories we inherited were fragile and poorly researched. They didn't match up to our present standards of evidence, and we needed to be specific in order to puncture their claims. Microstudies are really the building blocks of change."
And change, Ms. Kerber believes, means a more honest, complex and inclusive vision of the past. With a solid foundation now in place, she says, historians are beginning to ask the large questions that make good synthesis inevitable. "We're on the cusp of something extraordinary,"she says, "an explosion of knowledge that is revolutionizing the profession."
Other historians, including Eric Foner of Columbia and David Levering Lewis of Rutgers, are less confident. Mr. Foner, whose books on race, slavery and freedom reach audiences well beyond the academic walls, is concerned by what he sees as the continued reluctance of historians to impart broad meaning in their written work.
In the classroom, he notes, it's just the opposite: "We all do synthesis there. Events don't simply happen. We provide an interpretive framework that ties the new social history to larger themes of ideology and power. We give students a clear but contested narrative that makes sense of the major features of American history while highlighting the diversity of our experience."
Above all, Mr. Foner adds, "we stake out positions on the big issues and we defend them. When a student asks, 'Why did Andrew Jackson veto the bank bill?,' we don't stumble around and give 15 different scenarios. It seems so natural in the classroom, yet so very hard to do in print."
The failure to write boldly and clearly may help explain why commercial publishers -- not to mention the reading public -- are deserting academic history. Indeed, professional historians find themselves in an odd position today. Their subject is growing in popularity, yet their once considerable influence is on the wane. Fewer people are seeking their wisdom about the past.
With some exceptions, the most widely read narratives in American history are no longer written by academic historians; and even the freshest theories connecting America's past and present are appearing in the books of "outsiders," like the journalist Michael Lind's "New American Nation," published in 1995, and the economist Robert Fogel's "Fourth Great Awakening," released a few months ago.
This wasn't always the case. Grand narratives and big theories once dominated the writing of American history. From George Bancroft and Frederick Jackson Turner in the 19th century through Charles and Mary Beard, Richard Hofstadter and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in later years, the great historians combined elegant prose and sweeping synthesis in ways that are rarely seen today.
Turner wove the tale of an exceptional nation removed from the corrupting influences of Europe, a country where the frontier produced the perfect mix of abundance, individualism and equality. The Beards viewed American history in equally heroic terms, with "the people" battling the "special interests" for economic and political control.
In the 1950's, an influential school of "consensus" history emerged. Postwar historians were haunted by memories of Nazi genocide, the threat of Soviet expansion and the spread of McCarthyism. Wary of mass movements on the left or right, they stressed the beliefs and values that united Americans rather than the crises and upheavals that divided them.
Led by Hofstadter and his enormously popular books "The American Political Tradition" (1948) and "The Age of Reform"(1955), the more creative consensus historians worked the neighboring fields of sociology and political science. New theories of human behavior emerged linking McCarthyism to past extremist movements and charting the assimilation of immigrant groups into the mainstream culture.
There were dissenters, too. William Appleman Williams turned American exceptionalism upside down by portraying the nation as a greedy colossus searching endlessly for raw materials and foreign markets. Although some historians condemned him as a dangerous radical, there was, in fact, a large common ground. What united scholars like Turner and the Beards, Hofstadter and Williams, was their preoccupation with national history, their interest in how the United States was created, how it developed and, ultimately, how it should be judged. By focusing on large themes, they became valued participants in the public life and civic culture of their time.
Of course, the field of American history up into the 1960's was a simpler, more restrictive place resembling an old boys' club, with leading scholars training their successors in elite departments reserved mostly for Protestant white men. The writing naturally reflected this insulation. There was no violence on Turner's frontier, no slaves or Indians to muddle the story. Women rarely entered these historical narratives. Racial and ethnic tensions were often minimized or ignored. The new history of recent decades exploded this complacency.
So is there a way to combine the diversity and specialization of today's history with the grand narratives of the past? Can professional historians win back a broad audience?
It won't be easy. Mr. Lewis, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his 1993 biography of W. E. B. Du Bois, observes that mastery of the synthetic narrative is far more difficult than it appears. At its best, he says, "the well-told story about the national past should always be an argument, a thesis, an analysis disguised in the action and drama of its narrative." This is not, he declares, "a formula to be commended to all professional historians."
Yet it seems a formula worth trying. This past year Scott Sandage, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, taught a graduate seminar in American history. From the outset he stressed the importance of good writing, a clear thesis, solid organization, the telling of anecdotes and a smooth narrative flow. His message apparently got through. The final papers were quite readable, Mr. Sandage says. And he got an extra bonus as well. When the course ended, one of his students presented him with a plaque containing four well-chosen words: "It's the story, stupid."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The economy grew in the second quarter at a 5.3 percent annual rate, as consumer spending increased at the slowest pace in three years and businesses built up inventories, the Commerce Department said today.
The rise in gross domestic product, revised from a previous estimate of 5.2 percent, followed growth at 4.8 percent in the first quarter. The economy had grown in the final three months of 1999 at 8.3 percent, the fastest pace in almost 16 years. 
 "It looks like we are on a slower growth path," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist with MCM MoneyWatch in New York. Analysts had expected a revision to 5.4 percent.
Sales of previously owned homes fell 9.8 percent in July to 4.79 million units at an annual rate, the slowest pace since 4.76 million in February, the National Association of Realtors reported separately. Sales had risen in June to a pace of 5.31 million unit. The median home price rose to a record $143,300.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Signs of Slowing Economy Keep Share Prices Nearly Flat

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended little changed yesterday as a report showing plummeting home sales reinforced hopes that the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate increases was at an end.
Gains in I.B.M. were offset by weakness in consumer products makers like Coca-Cola, which was hit after Salomon Smith Barney lowered its sales estimates for the soft drink giant. 
 Signs of a slowing United States economy are a double-edged sword. On the one hand reduced economic activity can mean the Fed is less likely to increase interest rates further. A slowdown, however, suggests that corporate profits may be squeezed as growth in demand for products slips.
Sales of existing homes for July, keenly watched for signs of slowing in the inflation-sensitive housing sector, plummeted 9.8 percent in July, to an annualized rate of 4.79 million. Economists on average had been expecting a rate of 5.12 million.
"While the market was happy that the Fed did not raise rates on Tuesday, there is a concern that a slowing economy could affect corporate profits," said Richard Babson, the chairman and president of Babson-United Investment Advisers Inc. in Watertown, Mass.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that gross domestic product grew 5.3 percent in the second quarter, meeting economists expectations. The report's deflator index, closely watched as a gauge of inflation, also came in as expected.
"In terms of the stock market, it's not a change of great consequence," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics. "The bottom line is, the Fed is going to be content where they are, the general tone of the economy is not changed and we go forward."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.89 points, to 11,192.63, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,506.46. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,042.68.
Traders said the trading volume was thin.
I.B.M. gained $4.19, to $129, while Coca-Cola lost $1.94, to $56.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to a price of 100 7/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.72 percent from 5.71 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 108 12/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.66 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Lieberman Seeks 'Honest' Tax Cut Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: CLAYMONT, Del., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman accused Gov. George W. Bush today of distorting the Democrats' tax cut proposal, saying it was time for "an honest debate" on the subject.
Making his first solo campaign foray as Vice President Al Gore's running mate, Mr. Lieberman sought to take advantage of the trouble Mr. Bush has had in selling his tax cut plan, a central plank in his platform. The governor has proposed an across-the-board tax cut totaling about $1.3 trillion over the next decade, while the vice president has called for a targeted $500 billion tax cut package. 
 With polls showing that Americans are not clamoring for tax relief in a time of prosperity, Mr. Bush said this week that he had done a poor job of explaining his plan. To that end, he appeared on Thursday in New Orleans with the Bechac family, an in-the-flesh example of who, he said, would save money under his plan, but not under Mr. Gore's.
But Mr. Lieberman, who appeared before 300 cheering supporters at a community center here, contended that the Bechac family could save money under Mr. Gore's plan, and he pointed to an article in today's Wall Street Journal to support his contention. The article said the Bechacs could benefit under Mr. Gore's plan if they took advantage of college and retirement savings programs Mr. Gore has proposed.
"Our opponents' problem is they can't explain away the facts," Mr. Lieberman said. "I think it's good to have a debate on taxes, but it has to be an honest debate that accurately tells the American people what we would do.
"Governor Bush said that he had to do a better job of explaining his plan. With all due respect, the problem isn't explaining the plan. The problem is the plan itself."
Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, argued that the two proposals were not comparable, because the Gore plan would require families to set aside money in approved savings accounts for retirement and college to reap most of the tax benefits.
"You have to take a significant step before you're even eligible for Al Gore's tax relief," Mr. Bartlett said. "The clear difference here is under Governor Bush's plan it's plain and simple. You get a tax cut automatically and immediately."
The vice president's plan, he said, would benefit mainly accountants and lawyers who he said would be needed to guide people through its provisions.
Mr. Lieberman's remarks today were his sharpest yet at the Republican ticket, as he feels his way into the vice-presidential nominee's traditional role as his party's attacker. He has shown -- especially in his successful 1988 campaign to unseat Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut -- that he can be relentless and effective on the offensive.
The Democrats clearly see the tax issue as working to their advantage, and not just because Mr. Bush struggled this week to defend his plan. Cutting against the Republican orthodoxy that deep tax cuts are both good policy and good politics, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have attacked the Bush plan as a threat to the nation's economic health that would benefit mainly the rich.
Andrew Bechac makes about $40,000 a year as a teacher, and his wife, Margaret, stays home in Mandeville, La., with their two girls. Under Mr. Bush's proposals to award a tax credit of $500 per child and to reduce the lowest bracket to 10 percent from 15 percent, their federal income tax bill would drop to less than $500, a savings of about $1,600.
The Bechacs said they were saving for both college and retirement. Under Mr. Gore's plan, they could put up to $2,000 a year into approved savings accounts for those purposes -- which the Gore campaign has likened to 401(k) or Roth individual retirement account plans -- and save up to $2,300 on their tax bills.
Clearly enjoying his new celebrity, Mr. Lieberman rode the train today from Washington to Wilmington, near this old steel town. He strode up and down the aisles, greeted by smiles of recognition from riders.
One passenger, Lynn Imperiale of Nutley, N.J., said she was talking on her cellular phone with her mother, Marie Stefanelli, who is being treated for breast cancer. Mr. Lieberman took the phone and told Mrs. Stefanelli, "I'm praying for you."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Dutch Behemoth Invades America;
ING Group Makes Its Move in Virtual Banking and Insurance

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Nearly a year after Congress cleared the way for insurance companies to own banks and vice versa, most American banks and insurers are still on the sidelines, unable, analysts say, to see how to turn the new opportunity into profit.
But early in September, a big Dutch company that pioneered banking and insurance combinations in Europe, the ING Group, is planning to break into the American field with a stripped-down virtual bank that will eventually sell insurance. It hopes to become a model for getting the most out of both businesses. 
 The bank is part of a larger plan by ING, a financial services giant with operations in more than 60 countries, to build a brand-name empire in the United States. The company, whose American headquarters are here in Atlanta, has already amassed a stable of about a dozen insurance companies, including two big recent additions bought for nearly $14 billion. It says it plans to spend roughly $80 million -- a huge amount in the insurance world -- to unite everything under one umbrella and establish its name across North America.
Before Congress scrapped the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act and other laws that had kept insurance companies and banks separate, two American giants, Travelers Group and Citicorp, joined together as Citigroup in the kind of merger that financial services executives had long argued would better serve customers and add to their fortunes.
But since the bill became law last November, bankers and insurers have been waiting for signs that customers would rush to do their banking and buy insurance with the same company.
"Citigroup has had some success," said Tom Brown, chief executive of Second Curve Capital, a financial services fund, "but the jury is still out."
For European companies, however, the verdict is in. Banking and insurance combinations have been operating in Europe for more than a decade, some with considerable success. Whether ING can make it work here is far from certain, but it will not be for lack of effort.
"I think the U.S. financial services will eventually consolidate down to maybe 10 major entities," said Colin Devine, an insurance analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "ING is obviously serving notice that it intends to be one of the 10."
ING's newest addition, an online bank, will feature a savings account paying 6.5 percent interest -- triple the rate at most established banks, but about on par with Internet banks that require minimum deposits of $1,000 or so to open an account. ING Direct will have no minimums, no limits on withdrawals and no fees. The bank also plans to offer consumer loans, mortgages and certificates of deposit. Term life insurance and mutual funds, which ING now sells through its insurance outlets, will later be added to the bank roster.
To keep costs down, the bank will be run out of a renovated six-story warehouse in Wilmington, Del., where real estate and labor are relatively cheap. The bank will not offer checking accounts, which often are money losers. But it will electronically link checking accounts that customers have at other banks to their accounts at ING Direct, allowing them to transfer money in and out, much as banks now let customers electronically shift funds to and from brokerage houses.
Instead of branches, the bank will have a scattering of cybercafes where people can drop in to buy pastry and coffee, surf the Web and perhaps check on their digital accounts. Ewald Kist, the chief executive of ING, said ING came up with the idea of the cafes, which it has used with its online banks in Canada, Australia, Spain and France, because "people like to feel something, see something real." The first ING Direct Cafe in the United States is set to open in early October in Manhattan, at 49th Street and Park Avenue.
"We could have bought a bricks-and-mortar bank, but that would be nothing new for the U.S. market," Mr. Kist said. "We're not in competition with hundreds of thousands of banks. We're doing a new trick."
And, somewhat like beaters in a grouse hunt, ING will have 10,500 financial planners with insurance and brokerage licenses around the United States, the largest force of its kind in the country, to point out the virtues of the new bank to their customers.
Steve Wicker, a banking analyst at the Meta Group, a technology research firm in Stamford, Conn., said he thought the bank would "definitely make a dent in the market."
But other experts are skeptical. James McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in financial services and telecommunications, said he sees the bank as a niche player rather than as a challenger to big banks like Wells Fargo and Bank One.
Customers concerned primarily about high returns from a bank "are not loyal," Mr. McCormick said.
"And while this segment is not small," he added, "not everybody goes with a bank on that basis. So you have limited growth potential."
Still, ING's effort stands out as a bold attempt to capitalize on a new opportunity.
Since the company's formation through a merger of a bank and an insurer in the Netherlands in 1991, ING has been quietly selling insurance in America through regional companies like Life of Georgia. ING's insurance predecessor, Nationale-Nederlanden, had owned American insurance companies since the late 1970's. But you had to read the fine print to know that the companies were related or Dutch-owned.
ING's latest acquistions, ReliaStar Financial Services, a deal announced in May, and the nonhealth insurance units of Aetna Financial Services, announced in July, will make ING one of America's biggest insurers. Now it is planning to shed its cloak of anonymity.
"There is going to be a lot of noise about ING in the U.S.," Mr. Kist said. "We are a strong company, a world player, and we want to capitalize on that strong name."
Under the new strategy, all of ING's American possessions -- including its New York investment banks, ING Barings and Furman Selz -- are being tied together with the parent's name and its orange lion logo. For example, Equitable of Iowa, which the Dutch company bought in 1997, has become ING Equitable Life.
ING's expansion is the latest foray by European companies into the world's biggest market for financial services. Companies like Aegon, also based in the Netherlands; the Dutch-Belgian Fortis; AXA of France; and Allianz of Germany have been attracted to the United States by favorable economics and regulatory policies. And they are becoming substantial players. Early last year, for example, Aegon bought the Transamerica Corporation, a big American life insurance company. And in June, a unit of AXA, which already was a leader here, bought Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, the New York money management and institutional research firm.
Though proposed foreign acquisitions in some American industries, notably telecommunications, have stirred nationalistic concerns, there have been no such reverberations yet in the fragmented financial services business.
To European buyers, American insurance companies, which generally trade at lower price-to-earnings ratios than their European counterparts, seem like bargains.
Moreover, even with state-by-state regulation of insurance as well as some aspects of banking in the United States, and even with the European Union smoothing out the regulatory differences among its 15 member nations, the Europeans say that doing business in America is easier and less costly than it is in the patchwork of countries and languages that make up Europe.
Then, of course, companies that want to be truly global feel they must have a significant presence in the United States.
Another lure is that with more and more Americans responsible for managing their own retirement with 401(k) plans and the like rather than traditional pensions, the personal investment business is booming here far more than in Europe, where pensions are still primarily a governmental obligation. And like their American counterparts, ING and the other European insurers doing business in the United States are focusing more on investing these days than on insurance.
So the Europeans have been steadily picking off American companies. And many are still on the hunt. But ING, Mr. Kist said, is finished "with our shopping list for now."
The job at hand, he said, is to fit the pieces of the company's empire together to maximize economies of scale and to centralize different lines of business in headquarters around the United States. The old marble and glass Georgia Life building, for example, set on the edge of Atlanta deep in a hardwood forest, has been designated ING's command post not only for the United States operations but for those of Canada and Latin America as well. Des Moines will become the center for fixed annuities.
The whole idea of expanding ING's American operations, Mr. Kist said, was to be able to become a low-cost provider. "You need to be well priced and you need to have a presence in all the states," he said.
ING's American competitors have also been consolidating, but so far banks and insurance have largely remained separate. Banks have been reluctant to buy insurance companies, experts say, because they would have to tie up a lot of capital for generally sluggish returns. Most insurers cannot afford a bank big enough to give them a national network of outlets for insurance, and even some that could pony up the money say they regard banking profits as less predictable than those from insurance.
The industries, however, have been converging to some extent. Many banks have contracted with insurers to sell policies through their branches for a fee. And a handful of insurers have begun experimenting with banking, mostly aimed at their insurance customers.
The State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the biggest American insurer of cars and homes, has started offering a range of financial services online and through its agents. But unlike ING, State Farm is completely new to banking and it concedes it is just getting its feet wet. So is MetLife one of the biggest life insurers. On Aug. 16, MetLife said it was buying a small New Jersey bank, Grand Bank, and that it hoped to start up early next year -- perhaps, analysts say, with an online operation.
Right now, ING is the company to watch. Mr. Brown, the financial consultant and fund manager, said he expected that many competing bank executives would open accounts at ING Direct to "see how it's going and to be a fast follower if it succeeds."
But he is among those who see long odds. "In our experience," he said, "pioneers usually end up with arrows in their back."

European Central Bank Fears Weak Euro's Inflation Effect

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Europe is hardly in the midst of a major economic boom, but the European Central Bank is increasingly likely to hit the brakes as early as next week.
In a series of hawkish warnings, the central bankers have made it clear that they are alarmed about inflation and the depressed value of the euro compared with the United States dollar. Most analysts predict the central bank's governors will increase interest rates when they meet next Thursday, but many worry that the move could stunt growth without shoring up the euro. 
 "It is a self-produced problem," said Hans Meltzer, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research. "If the E.C.B. were as generous about inflation as Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, it wouldn't have a problem."
When the euro was introduced in January 1999, the European Central Bank announced that its goal was to keep inflation below 2 percent a year. Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and a governor at the European Central Bank, drove home the nature of European worries in a toughly worded speech today.
"The E.C.B. cannot be satisfied with the developments of the external value of the euro," Mr. Welteke said. Noting that the weak euro has led to sharply higher import prices, Mr. Welteke said the risks of inflation had increased measurably.
Since its introduction, the euro has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar. At its current value of about 91 cents, it remains near its all-time low of nearly 88 cents.
The euro's weakness stems primarily from the drawing power of the American economy, which continues to attract huge amounts of foreign investment and thereby generate demand for dollars. The weak euro has aggravated inflationary dangers because it has pushed up the cost of imports, most particularly of oil. With prices still near their highest levels in years for oil, which is purchased exclusively in dollars, European fuel bills have pushed up the prices of other products. As a result, Europe's annualized rate of inflation is now about 2.4 percent. On Thursday, the German government reported that prices in German factories increased in July at the fastest rate in nearly a decade.
But many economists argue that the inflation threat has been overstated. Mr. Meltzer of Deutsche Bank noted that most of the recent surge in prices stems from soaring oil prices rather than from more structural causes like rising wages. Stripped of oil and other volatile items, the core inflation rate is 1.3 percent. Many analysts are betting that central bankers will raise their baseline interest rates next week by one-half of a percentage point, from 4.25 percent to 4.75. That is still substantially lower than the United States federal funds rate of 6.50, , but it poses risks.
The most obvious risk is that it will stop Europe's current economic upswing, just as unemployment in Germany and France is beginning to sink below 10 percent for the first time in years. If economic growth does slow, the decline could drive the value of the euro down. Though currencies normally rise when interest rates are increased, the euro's biggest source of weakness is Europe's slower economic growth compared with that of the United States.
The currency risk was put into focus this week, when a closely watched survey of German business sentiment showed a sharp drop in confidence. The news quickly prompted some forecasters to conclude that German growth had peaked, and investors reacted by selling euros and briefly pushing their value below 89 cents.
In hindsight, many analysts said they believed that the drop in confidence was misleading and that the German economy, Europe's biggest, still had room to grow. The German central bank has predicted that growth will approach 3 percent next year, and the Deutsche Bank predicts it will go slightly higher.
But the fragility is clear. Recent data on Europe's trade balance showed that the weak euro continued to bolster exports by making them cheaper in world markets and that European imports were increasing. While part of that reflects exchange rate effects, Tony Norfield of ABN Amro theorized it might indicate a preference to buy imported goods.

HEADLINE: Few Options on Cheney Option Problem

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Can Dick Cheney find a way to have his money and still avoid a possible conflict of interest over his options to buy stock in the Halliburton Company, which he headed until the Republican Party chose him as its candidate for vice president?
The answer appears to be not with any certainty. Wall Street has a lot of products that use complicated derivative securities, and a cadre of people who design new ones, but tax experts say that none of them solve the problem of Mr. Cheney's having an economic interest in Halliburton -- at least not when taxes are considered. Perversely, the available strategies would leave him in a position to profit most if Halliburton's stock collapsed. 
 "It appears to me that the only sure ways out would be for Halliburton's board to change the rules or for Congress to change the tax law," said David M. Schizer, an associate professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in tax law.
The suggestion of a tax law change may not be completely frivolous. A highly technical change that would solve Mr. Cheney's problem has been proposed by the Clinton administration, Mr. Schizer said, but Congress has shown no interest in passing it.
Though this problem affects only Mr. Cheney, it may in the future affect many other executives who leave companies for public service. Stock options have become common, and rules that delay exercising them are in place at virtually all the companies that issue them. Successful corporate executives are likely to have a significant part of their wealth tied up in options that cannot be immediately exercised unless their companies waive rules that apply to other employees with options.
Mr. Cheney's problem stems from the fact that the Halliburton board, in allowing him to take early retirement to join the Republican ticket, did not change when he could exercise the options. As a result, he must either forfeit them -- thus giving up millions in potential benefits -- or hold onto them until long after a new administration takes office.
If he simply held them, every action by a Bush-Cheney administration would be scrutinized for whether it was helping Halliburton's stock price. That would be sensitive for any major company that has government contracts, but it would be particularly touchy for Halliburton, since the company is in the oil services industry and its stock price is heavily influenced by the price of oil, which could be affected by United States energy policy.
Mr. Cheney has said that if elected, he will sell his stock in Halliburton before he takes office, but he has not said what he will do with the options other than assert that he will avoid a conflict of interest.
Mr. Cheney has 400,000 stock options, of which 166,667 can be exercised this December, after the election but before the next administration takes office. He can exercise 133,333 options in December 2001 and 100,000 in December 2002.
The nature of options means that their value can soar or fall far faster than the price of the underlying stock. For example, at $53 a share, near Halliburton's recent stock price, the options expiring in 2001 and 2002 would be worth $3.5 million.
But if the price rose by $10 a share, a change of about 19 percent, the value of the options would leap 73 percent, to $6.1 million. If the price fell by $10, to $43, the value of the options would fall 66 percent, to $1.2 million.
If one ignores tax considerations, there are several ways that Mr. Cheney could lock in the current price, minus some transaction costs. He could, for example, do a "forward sale" of Halliburton stock, delivering it only after the options could be exercised.
Unfortunately, noted Robert Willens, a tax expert with Lehman Brothers, the tax treatment would vary drastically depending on the market price when the option was exercised.
If the stock rose a lot by the time he exercised the option, the result would be a lot of ordinary income, because profits from exercising employee stock options are based on the market price when the option is exercised. There would be a corresponding capital loss on the forward sale. But capital losses cannot be deducted from ordinary income above a $3,000 annual limit. If he did not have sufficient capital gains to offset those losses, he would face a large tax bill.
How big could that be? Suppose Halliburton stock price is $50 when he does a forward sale and it rises to $80 by the time he exercises the 100,000 options that mature in 2002. Not counting taxes, he would take in $11.50 a share -- the difference between the $50 price he is getting and the $39.50 a share that he must pay Halliburton for the stock. His profit, pretax, would be $1.15 million.
But the tax would be based on the difference between what he paid -- $39.50 -- and the $80 market value. So at the top federal rate of 39.6 percent, he would owe $1.16 million in taxes, $450,000 more than his actual profit.
Partly offsetting that would be a large capital loss on the sale, of $30 a share, or $3 million. But if he had no capital gains from other investments, he could deduct only $3,000 of that from his income.
On the other hand, if Halliburton's stock fell, he would have less ordinary income and a capital gain on the forward sale. That would leave him in a far better tax position than if the stock went up.
"The irony is that the derivatives position that leaves him with a neutral position pretax leaves him with an economic after-tax interest in the stock going down," said Mr. Schizer, whose article on issues regarding executive compensation, "Executives and Hedging: The Fragile Legal Foundation of Executive Compensation," appeared in the March issue of the Columbia Law Review.
Mr. Cheney could use other strategies, but each has its own tax consequences. Some would risk involving the "constructive sale" rules and force him to pay immediate taxes even before he realized any profits. And when the money came in after the options were exercised, the tax treatment would again vary markedly depending on whether the stock had risen or fallen in the interim.
Tax experts differ on whether the constructive sales rules would apply in this case. But since there appear to be no precedents, it would be risky for Mr. Cheney to assume they did not. An executive unconcerned about appearances and merely looking to lock in some profit from his options would avoid those rules by leaving himself with some exposure to the stock, for example protecting him from losses if the shares fell below $50 and relinquishing gains if they rose above $60. But if Mr. Cheney followed that course, he would still have a stake in Halliburton -- the very appearance of a conflict of interest that the tactics are intended to avoid.
Mr. Cheney might also borrow money under a contract that required him to repay the loan with the stock he would get when he exercised the options. But that could leave him with a large expense -- deemed interest expense under the tax law -- that might not be deductible unless he had a lot of other investment income. In that case, he would suffer at tax time if the stock had risen sharply.
All this could be avoided if Halliburton would let Mr. Cheney exercise the options before he took office. But that might anger other employees with options who did not have that right.
Halliburton conceivably could amend its plan to let Mr. Cheney sell his options to someone else or enter into contracts that would let him deliver the options, rather than the shares, when they can be exercised. Then the tax laws would be simpler and the tax effect much more predictable, Mr. Schizer said.
The Clinton administration has proposed a highly technical change in tax laws dealing with straddles, another strategy that Mr. Cheney might use. The proposal is aimed at what the administration considers a possible abuse of tax law now being used to shelter some income in transactions unrelated to Mr. Cheney's situation, and Congress has shown little interest in the measure.
But Mr. Schizer said the proposed change would effectively allow Mr. Cheney to offset his losses and gains from one strategy, no matter how large they were, and thus lock in his profits now, before and after taxes.
Yet another possible course Mr. Cheney could take would be to agree to donate the net profits to a charity after he was able to exercise the options. But there is a tax trap even in that strategy: the tax law limits the amount of charitable deductions to half of a person's income. Mr. Cheney might find that he had to pay taxes on some of the profits even after he had given them away. In that case, he could take deductions in future years but would have an immediate cash-flow problem.
Politicians often complain that the tax laws are too complicated. Mr. Cheney, in trying to decide what to do about his options, might learn just how accurate that complaint is.

HEADLINE: The Costs of Governing Less

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell University, is the author of "Luxury Fever."

 BODY:
With the money it takes from us, the government hires regulators who tell us we can't do things we want to do.Little wonder, then, that government is so often the target of profound hostility.
As Adam Smith recognized, his invisible hand theory -- that society as a whole does best when everyone pursues his or her own interests in the marketplace -- works only when each person's choices cause no harm to others. Yet many of our choices clearly do harm others. 
 For example, if you buy a car with unsafe tires, you put not only your own life at risk, but also the lives of others. Even so, the anti-government oratory of recent decades has denied a legitimate role for government action to promote safety in such cases.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration once maintained an extensive network of automobile repair shops through which it gathered data that provided early warning of potentially serious safety defects. This network would have sounded an alarm about the unusually high failure rates of one model of Firestone tires -- tires whose defects, we now learn, may have resulted in scores of deaths.
Unfortunately, the agency was forced to abandon its early warning network in the 1980's when the Reagan administration cut its budget by half, citing excessive regulatory zeal. Now, having stripped the agency of an important means of gathering safety data, look for congressmen in the anti-government movement to denounce it for incompetence during hearings on the Firestone scandal next month.
Some politicians insist that many safety regulations were unnecessary in the first place, since no company wants a reputation for products that kill; businesses simply need an opportunity to regulate themselves. For example, George W. Bush has backed legislation that leaves industrial polluters substantially free to regulate themselves in Texas, which now has the most polluted air and water of any state. But, in common with others in the anti-government movement, he has also advocated so-called tort reform legislation that makes it much more difficult for injured parties to pursue their claims in court, should the unshackled businesses fail to police themselves.
By far the most important item on the agenda of the anti-government movement has been to shrink government by cutting off tax revenue. Mr. Bush promises "to return tax dollars to the people who earned them," dismissing Mr. Gore and other critics as "people who think the bureaucrats in Washington know how to spend your money more wisely than you do."
These words resonate because they summon images of roads to nowhere in West Virginia and other vivid examples of pork-barrel waste. Yet waste is hardly the exclusive province of the public sector. In many parts of the country, private residences with more than 20,000 square feet of living space are under construction in record numbers. These houses typically have 10 or more bedrooms, each with a large bath; at least two kitchens; two living rooms; a ballroom; a media room; and a six-car garage.
Would Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, which would mainly benefit the wealthiest families, reduce waste? Although depriving the government of this revenue would undoubtedly eliminate at least some wasteful government spending, it would also stimulate the construction of even bigger mansions.
More troubling, it would make it harder for us to pay for public services we value. The SAT scores of entering public school teachers have fallen sharply since the 1960's, in part because teachers' salaries have fallen more than 20 percent relative to the average college graduate's. Government inspections of meat-processing plants have declined by almost 75 percent since the 1980's, despite the growing threat posed by E. coli bacteria and other lethal food contaminants. In other spheres as well, budget cutbacks of recent decades have created ripe opportunities for public investment.
Such investments would inevitably entail a measure of waste, just as the anti-government movement claims. But the additional private spending stimulated by Mr. Bush's tax cuts would also entail some waste. In the end, we must decide whether we want safer tires or bigger sport utility vehicles.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
In Speech, Bush Sets Goal of Free-Trade Agreements With Latin Nations

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech on United States policy in Latin America that was delivered on Friday by Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, at Florida International University in Miami, as released by the Bush-Cheney campaign.
Should I become president, I will look south, not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment of my presidency. Just as we ended the great divide between East and West, so today we can overcome the North-South divide. 
 This begins with a renewed commitment to democracy and freedom in this hemisphere -- because human freedom, in the long run, is our best weapon against poverty, disease and tyranny. . . .
The United States is destined to have a "special relationship" with Mexico, as clear and strong as we have had with Canada and Great Britain.
Historically, we have had no closer friends and allies. And with Canada, our partner in NATO and Nafta, we share, not just a border, but a bond of good will. Our ties of history and heritage with Mexico are just as deep. Differences are inevitable between us. But they will be differences among family, not between rivals.
To strengthen that bond, our two countries need a meeting at the highest level, shortly after the American election -- even before the new presidents of our nations are inaugurated. Should I be elected, I will use that November summit to keep Mexican-American relations moving forward.
We must talk about the availability and cleanliness of water on both sides of the border, about opening the promise of Nafta to small businesses and entrepreneurs, about economic development in areas of Mexico that send illegal immigrants to this country, about improving health and criminal justice in both nations.
Mexico is an emerging success story. Yet elsewhere in this hemisphere, democracy is still on trial -- threatened by the false prophets of populism.
I look forward to working closely with the nations of this hemisphere but recognize that they cannot be bullied into progress. We will treat all Americans -- North, Central and South -- with dignity. I will improve our bilateral relations and work with the Organization of American States to confront the problems of our hemisphere.
My administration will strengthen the architecture of democracy in Latin America -- the institutions that make democracy real and successful. The basics of democracy should be refreshed with programs that train responsible police and judges. We will encourage professional and civilian-controlled militaries, through contact with our own. The principles of free speech should be advanced through American media exchanges. We will create a new "American Fellows" program, inviting young men and women throughout the Americas to work for a year in various agencies of our government. We will encourage party-building and help monitor elections. These are ways to treat the symptoms of corruption and discord before they turn into violence and abuse of human rights.
To all the nations of Latin America I say: As long as you are on the road toward liberty, you will not be alone. As long as you are moving toward freedom, you will have a steady friend in the United States of America.
The health of a democracy depends on real economic gains for average citizens. And this requires Latin American governments to act for themselves: To lift the barriers of bureaucracy and overregulation that prevent the poor from creating legal small businesses. To give more priority and funding to universal education -- because no nation can afford to squander the talent of its people.
Our nation can be an ally in these efforts. The future of this hemisphere lies with the creation of millions of small businesses among the poor -- the surest path out of poverty.
But the poor in Latin America often have no access to small amounts of working capital -- to credit cards or bank loans -- that would help them buy something as simple as an oven to bake and sell bread. So I support what are called "microloans" -- small, no-collateral loans allowing the poor to build a business and employ their neighbors.
As president, I will ask Congress for $100 million dollars to help microcredit organizations that are working in Latin America. And I will ask the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank to add to this investment. We will apply the power of markets to the needs of the poor. We can also use the power of debt reduction to relieve poverty and protect the resources that sustain life in the Americas.
We will link debt reduction and the conservation of tropical forests. These forests affect the air we breathe, the food we eat, medicines that cure disease, and are home to more than half of earth's animal and plant species. Expanding the aims of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, I will ask Congress to provide $100 million to support the exchange of debt reduction for the protection of tropical forests.
In addition, we must recognize and promote the important role of American charities and churches and relief organizations in Latin America -- organizations which build housing, health clinics and schools.
Groups like Amigos de las Americas, which trains young people to be community health workers in the region. These are practical and effective ways for the wealth and compassion of America to help all the Americas -- and introduce many of our own people to their nation's neighborhood. . . .
If the United States cannot offer new trade with the nations of Latin America, they will find it elsewhere -- as they are doing already in new agreements with the European Union.
In the last few years, Mexico signed a trade agreement with the Europeans, while Canada has a new trade pact with Chile. All of this while, in Washington, time has been lost. European businesses and consumers are benefiting -- ours are not.
I don't fault our European friends for making these deals. We dropped the ball, and they're running with it.
But we must get back into the game, and here is how I propose to do it.
First, I will secure fast-track authority -- the ability to pass or reject trade agreements without amendment. Without it, as we have seen, America is slow to move, and other nations are unwilling to negotiate with us seriously. When the next president sits at the Americas Summit in Quebec next April, other nations must know that fast-track trade authority is on the way.
Our goal will be free-trade agreements with all the nations of Latin America. We can do so in cooperation with our NAFTA partners. We should do so with Chile, and Brazil and Argentina, the anchor states of Mercosur. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America, with such vast economic potential, and our relations must reflect this. We will also work toward free trade with the smaller nations of Central America and the Caribbean. We must be flexible because one-size-fits-all negotiations are not always the answer. But the ultimate goal will remain constant -- free trade from northernmost Canada to the tip of Cape Horn.

California Company Victim Of a Fake Press Release
A fake press release sent over financial news wires set off a 60 percent decline in the shares of Emulex, a California company that makes fiber optic communications equipment. The price recovered after the company disclosed the hoax and said its business was flourishing. Government and financial agencies are investigating the fake release. 
 The apparent motive for the fraud was to cause shares of Emulex to fall, enabling someone to profit by buying put options or selling the stock short. Put options rise in value when a company's stock falls; short-selling is another way to profit from price dips. Page A1.
 
Dow Jumps 9 Points, to 11,292.63
Stocks were mixed after new economic data suggested that the Fed might not have to raise interest rates further. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.89 points, to 11,292.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.85 points, to 1,506.46; and the Nasdaq slipped 10.60 points, to 4,042.68. C2.
 
U.S. Growth Put at 5.3% Pace
The economy grew in the second quarter at a 5.3 percent annual rate, as consumer spending increased at the slowest pace in three years and businesses built up inventories. Sales of existing homes fell 9.8 percent in July, to an annualized rate of 4.79 million. C14.
 
Concern About European Inflation
European central bankers remain worried about inflation and the weak value of the euro, and analysts say the concern heralds an interest rate increase next week. C3.
 
Tire Charges Possible in Venezuela
An official of Venezuela's state consumer protection agency said he would submit a report to the government that might result in criminal charges against Ford Motor and Firestone over the companies' handling of defective tires on Ford Explorers. The United States government is investigating at least 62 deaths linked to Firestone tires, most on Ford's popular Explorer sport utility vehicle. The Ford Explorer has been one of the best-selling models of cars in Venezuela in recent years, popular among affluent Venezuelans for its combination of ruggedness and luxury features. C2.
 
The Japanese tire maker Bridgestone said it earned 18.9 billion yen, or $176.6 million, in the first half of the year, down 48.5 percent from the period a year earlier, because of costs related to its extensive tire recall in the United States. C3.
 
Chief Executive at Azurix Resigns
Rebecca Mark resigned from her positions as chairwoman and chief executive of Azurix, a Houston-based water and waste-water treatment company, just a year after the company was spun off by Enron. C3.

HEADLINE: Trade Support Is Dwindling, Fed Chief Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 25

 BODY:
The protesters who gave voice to the risks and costs of globalization outside meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization over the last year did not make an appearance at the annual conclave of central bankers and economists from around the world that opened here today, but their influence was felt nonetheless.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, that pragmatism rather than ideology was driving the adoption in country after country of policies intended to help meet "the rigors of international competition." 
 But he acknowledged what he called "deep-seated antipathy toward free market competition" in some quarters, and warned that there could be a backlash should the stellar economic conditions of the last several years give way to tougher times.
The policy makers and analysts gathered here -- called the "pro-globalization elite" by one of the participants, Alice Rivlin, the former vice chairman of the Fed -- showed no inclination to back off from their general position that increased trade and a general reduction of the economic barriers between nations are good things.
Still, they were clearly concerned that the issues behind the protests surrounding globalization and trade -- lost jobs and wages, threats to labor and environmental standards, accusations that economic policy is being conducted for the haves rather than the have-nots -- could undermine support for the steady spread of free markets and democratic capitalism.
"While recognizing the efficacy of capitalism to produce wealth," Mr. Greenspan said, "there remains considerable unease among some segments about the way markets distribute that wealth and about the effects of raw competition on society," he said in opening remarks to the conference. "Thus, should recent positive trends in economic growth falter, it is quite imaginable that support for market-oriented resource allocation will wane and the latent forces of protectionism and state intervention will begin to reassert themselves in many countries, including the United States."
Mr. Greenspan did not suggest that the economy was about to slow, and he gave no hints about whether the Fed was likely to raise interest rates again this year after deciding twice in the last two months to keep monetary policy unchanged.
But he stressed again the key role that productivity-enhancing technological advances have played in the economy's strong performance, and he said it was "still difficult to find credible evidence in the United States that the rate of structural productivity growth has stopped increasing," a signal that he has considerable faith in the economy's ability to sustain high rates of noninflationary growth.
He also expressed frustration that even in the middle of the nation's longest business expansion, the momentum behind global economic integration seems to be slowing.
"Despite extraordinary prosperity, the ability to move forward on various trade initiatives has clearly come to a remarkable stall," he said in an apparent reference to the World Trade Organization's difficulties starting a new round of trade liberalization and the reluctance of the United States to extend Nafta to other Latin American countries like Chile. "I don't see the momentum picking up readily."
Michael Moore, the director general of the World Trade Organization, told the gathering, that it would be a mistake to ignore the sentiments of the protesters, and saidpart of the solution would have to be renewed political determination in the big industrial nations to press the case for free trade.
"Those who oppose us are not all fools and frauds," Mr. Moore said. "We need to assert our leadership on these issues."
Ms. Rivlin said policy makers had a responsibility to address the reality that "the bottom of the income distribution has not benefited from much of anything" when it comes to the globalized, technology-driven economy, and that income disparities were a potentially destructive economic force.
"We need to have better answers to those questions, even for the kids gathered in the streets," she said.
Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College, told the group that negative feelings about trade were closely linked to low job skills and educational levels, and that producing a better-trained, better-educated work force would help increase support for increased global economic integration.
But he said that policy makers had to recognize that there have been losers from increased trade, and that at least some of the protesters were acting consistently with their own economic interests in trying to slow globalization. As a result, he said, simply preaching the benefits of trade would not be enough.
"It's futile to instruct the unskilled in what their interests should be," he said.
Mr. Greenspan said any attempts to restrain market-driven capitalism carried a cost. For example, he said, laws in Europe that make it more difficult than in the United States for employers to lay off workers had contributed to the fact that Europe has lower levels of high-tech capital investment than in the United States. Since European employers will have difficulty reaping the full cost savings from productivity-enhancing investments, they choose to invest less, and less capital flows into Europe in search of high returns.
In fact, Mr. Greenspan said, Europeans have increasingly been investing their capital in the United States, where employers have an easier time cutting costs and where there are many opportunities to earn high returns. As a result, he said, European government's are adopting more market-oriented economic policies, like Germany's recent adoption of a business-friendly tax code.
"But it is clearly pragmatism, not ideology, that is the main driving force in these evolving views," Mr. Greenspan said. "The structural policy adjustments in Western Europe and Japan, not to mention the efforts in China and Russia to move toward market capitalism, are being motivated, for the most part, by the evident ability of market competition to elevate living standards."
