HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Bill Clinton's Center

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
With apologies to Art Buchwald, who had a similar dream in 1965 . . .
I awoke with a shudder the other morning from a terrible dream. I dreamt that George Bush had been re-elected last fall, and the country still had a President who was paralyzed by fear of the political right. 
 In the dream Bush caved in to right-wing opponents of civil rights laws. Under attack from them he withdrew his nomination of a personal friend, a law professor, to enforce those laws.
Bush tried to do something for the budget and the environment by setting realistic fees for grazing cattle on Federal lands. But ranchers objected, and Bush caved in again.
The wimp factor: That's what the dream brought back, memories of a President who did not have the courage of his convictions. Or did not have convictions.
Bosnia was the most painful part of the dream. President Bush went on wringing his hands and doing nothing. And the Serbs went on raping and killing and terrorizing the Bosnian Muslims to force them out.
Bush gave China most-favored-nation treatment for another year despite new accounts of Chinese cruelty toward political prisoners. He made only a dubious promise to impose human rights conditions next year.
Humanitarian pleas for Haitian political refugees got nowhere either. Bush kept turning the refugees back without giving them a chance to prove they were entitled to political asylum. He continued to hold H.I.V.-positive refugees in a Guantanamo prison camp.
The right won another victory in my dream, small but especially sweet for Jesse Helms. The Justice Department asked for reversal of a Federal judge's decision that the "decency clause" added to the standard for Federal arts grants violated the First Amendment.
If Bill Clinton had been elected, I thought, those things could not have happened. The censors and the opponents of civil rights enforcement would have lost their clout. Strong American leadership in the world would have supported human rights. The country would have seen change, vigor, courage . . .
Of course it is unfair to Bill Clinton to suggest by irony that George Bush might as well be President. Some things have changed. Mr. Clinton signed the voter registration and family leave bills that Mr. Bush vetoed. He did away with the infamous abortion gag rule.
Moreover, real choices are harder than campaign promises. China has economic power. Admitting Haitians, even victims of persecution, has political costs.
But there is something profoundly wrong with Bill Clinton's Presidency. No one knows that more than those of us who thought the country needed real change.
The Lani Guinier episode represented failure both political and moral. The bungling ended in an outright misrepresentation -- that Mr. Clinton's decision to withdraw her nomination had no political basis.
The result will embolden right-wing obstructionists. In the civil rights field, it will make more difficult reasoned discussion, long overdue, of the gerrymandered "minority districts" that trouble Professor Guinier.
And the Guinier affair was only the latest example of capitulation and chaos in this White House. The record is full of jobs dangled and then withdrawn. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago was asked to be Secretary of Transportation; he said yes, but then the job wasn't there.
To show he is moving to the center, Mr. Clinton has hired David Gergen. Mr. Gergen is a fine man, but he is not a substantive political figure -- a representative Republican, say. He is an opinion-shaper.
With 43 percent of the vote, Mr. Clinton should be near the center. But the way to have done that, to broaden his base, was to include moderate Republicans in his Administration at the start.
Mistakes can be corrected. What is worrying about Bill Clinton is the possibility that something fundamental is lacking in this very smart man. He may inadvertently have said it in his comment on dropping Lani Guinier: "This is about my center, not about the political center."

Cheer Up, Europe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Europe is entering the third millennium the same way it entered the second -- with the Christians kicking the Muslims out.
Many civilized Europeans are troubled by their New Barbarism. They are embarrassed at the way Turkish workers, denied citizenship, are being harassed in a Germany still arrogant about ethnic purity. 
 They are ashamed of their craven solution to the Balkan war -- with Bosnian Muslims being herded into refugee camps, where hatreds will fester and vengeance will be vowed.
That's one reason for the gloom pervading this continent. A more plebeian reason is that business is lousy. The unexpected price of German unity led to the albatross of high interest rates, which has aborted recovery.
On top of all that, the utopian promise of 1993 -- political as well as economic integration, creating global competition for the Asian and American markets -- has been dashed by the reality of nationalism.
No wonder Europeans are savaging their leaders. In France, Mitterrand is on his last legs, his Socialists swept from power; in Britain, Major has sunk lower in the polls than any Prime Minister since polling began; in Germany, Kohl ducks Muslim funerals to appeal to his resentful right; Italian politicians by the score have been charged with being in the pockets of the Mafia. By the 1995 G-7 meeting, Bill Clinton may be the veteran among rookies.
At such a low point, the poet Milton come to mind: "Hence, loathed Melancholy!" (Modern poets would render that as "Gedoutahere, Gloom!")
Consider all that Europe's nations have going for them.
Hard times are doing what hard times are supposed to do: force an end to business inefficiency long encouraged by government-protected featherbedding. In post-Socialist France, 20 of the biggest companies -- including Air France and Renault -- will be privatized, and despite the anguish of managers being fired, the slimmed-down companies will be competitive. Complacent German automakers, too, have been awakened to the real world.
On Europe's ideological front, there's little left of the left. The discredited notions of redistribution of wealth, reward for doing nothing, penalties for enterprise and success -- the ideas that undermined the profit motive and hold down standards of living -- are being abandoned even in Sweden. The complaining is heavy from the entitlement brigades, but the direction is right.
While concentrating on the ethnic problems caused by the cold war's end, too many of what Mr. Clinton at home calls "the preachers of pessimism" overlook the benefits: Spending on armaments, which are essentially unproductive, will continue to be cut. Fear of the Russians may have been a unifier, but the absence of the fear of a loss of freedom is an undeniable value.
Even the integration of Europe is now being approached with less messianic zeal. Monetary union hasn't worked. The good sense of the Danes resulted in a loosening of the bonds of political union; only because of new "reservations" of sovereignty did Denmark's referendum approve the flawed Maastricht treaty. As the Brits and others demand the same flexibility, the result should help the European Community without giving Brusselscrats the power to crush national diversity.
The business cycle will do its turn; animal spirits will revive; dejection will lift and prosperity will again be taken for granted. What then?
Then the nations of western Europe will have no ready excuse for denying opportunity to the former Soviet bloc; or for refusing to share their rights of full citizenship with longtime residents; or for unconscionably turning their backs on the victims of invasion, repression and genocide.
Today, in the grip of gloom, the tired leaders of Europe's nations have failed their first post-cold-war test in the Balkans and imperiled the continuance of the American presence here.
Tomorrow, on the rebound, Europe's new leaders will be called on to decide whether Europe will be the cradle or the grave of the "right to intervene" to defend human rights.
If so, they will find the American President as their ally in the advancement of freedom. If not -- if they let the coming prosperity's vain deluding joys bedazzle them -- they will justify the doubts of today's prophets of doom.

HEADLINE: Guatemala's New Chief Ousts Some Top Officers

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, June 7

 BODY:
The former human rights ombudsman who is Guatemala's new President, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, moved quickly today against the military high command, sweeping out some officers who played leading roles in the political turmoil of the last two weeks.
On his first full day as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, Mr. de Leon Carpio ordered the retirement of the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa, and the transfer of several other commanders. 
The new orders also promoted some officers who were said by diplomats to have challenged the seizure of almost dictatorial powers by former President Jorge Serrano Elias on May 25 and to have pushed successfully for Mr. Serrano's overthrow.
But as his new Defense Minister, Mr. de Leon Carpio named Gen. Roberto Perussina, a senior officer viewed by some diplomats and Guatemalan military analysts as a leader of the harder-line faction within the army.
In making the changes, Mr. de Leon Carpio seemed to try to capitalize on both the wide popularity with which he took office early Sunday and the sudden weakness of military leaders who intervened and reversed themselves several times in the political crisis.
As the so-called Attorney General of Human Rights, Mr. de Leon Carpio forged a reputation as the Guatemalan official most willing to challenge the power of the armed forces, accusing soldiers and officers in cases of serious abuses. But analysts said it was unlikely that the military would strike back against the new President now because the former high command had drawn significant opposition from within the officer corps by supporting Mr. Serrano.
"There's no doubt that this situation is not only difficult but strange," Mr. de Leon Carpio said in an interview today.
"Now, taking the position of President of the republic and the responsibility of Commander in Chief of the army, there is no doubt that the army will have to accept it," he added.
General Garcia Samayoa and other members of the military command initially supported Mr. Serrano when he dissolved the Congress and suspended the Constitution two weeks ago. But under strong internal and international pressure, they forced him from power on June 1 in a move that was praised by political and business leaders and others, including Mr. de Leon Carpio.
The next day, General Garcia Samayoa reversed himself again, backing the attempted succession of Mr. Serrano's Vice President, Gustavo Espina Salguero. But late Friday, the military command once again bowed to public pressure, turning against Mr. Espina, and ultimately allowing the inauguration of Mr. de Leon Carpio.
The new Government was warmly welcomed today by Latin American and European countries and by the United States, which promised to renew the economic and military aid it suspended after Mr. Serrano's moves two weeks ago.
Meanwhile, officials in Panama announced that Mr. Serrano had taken refuge there. Although there were unconfirmed reports that he had been granted political asylum, Guatemalan prosecutors said they would continue to seek his extradition to face charges that include corruption and violating the Constitution.
Guatemala news reports this morning had predicted that the Defense Ministry would go to Gen. Mario Rene Enriquez, the military's Deputy Chief of Staff and an officer with a reputation for being relatively open and democratic.
General Enriquez was promoted to Chief of Staff. But the more powerful Defense Minister's job went to General Perussina, a more senior officer who had been the Chief of Staff. Despite his reputation as a hard-liner, some military analysts said that General Perussina was also an opponent of heavy military involvement in political affairs and that his promotion might have been a concession to the military hierarchy.
Perhaps more important than General Garcia Samayoa's retirement, the analysts said, was the transfer of the powerful head of the presidential military staff, Gen. Francisco Ortega Menaldo, to a remote army garrison. General Ortega was said by many observers of the military to have been a crucial supporter of Mr. Serrano's seizure of power and of the brief move to seat Mr. Espina as President.
General Ortega was replaced by Col. Otto Perez, who was widely said to have been removed from his post as chief of military intelligence because of his strong opposition to the actions of Mr. Serrano.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Answer: Cut Entitlements. Question: But How?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Like a weed run rampant, entitlement programs are taking over the Federal budget, and unless they are brought under control, politicians and economists agree, no hope exists for lowering the deficit in the long run.
The issue dominated the House debate on President Clinton's budget last month and is sure to be a main element of the debate in the Senate later this month. 
 But controlling entitlements -- Government programs like Social Security and welfare that make automatic payments to everyone who is eligible -- is no easier than stopping the spread of kudzu in the Carolinas, since it involves choices no politician wants to make.
 
Why It's So Hard
 "Cutting entitlements sounds painless," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist. "But when you examine the specifics, you realize this is the third rail of American politics."
Here is why it is so hard: The only politically realistic way to slow the growth in entitlement spending is to reduce the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, the main Government health programs. The only way to do that is to rein in the overall cost of health care. The only practical way to do that is to overhaul the whole health-care system.
And, as the deliberations of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform have shown, changing the health-care system entails raising taxes, which is exactly what the lawmakers who say they want to lower the deficit by reducing entitlements want to avoid.
But that has not stopped politicians from advocating cutting or freezing entitlements, the political equivalent of a Potemkin village. It was a central feature of the Presidential campaign of George Bush last year and of the economic views of his budget director, Richard G. Darman. Prominent senators of both parties favor such steps in principle.
 
'Suggesting Big Savings'
 Last month, as the price of support for his economic plan from some recalcitrant Democrats in the House, President Clinton agreed to new budget rules that would force the White House and Congress to respond if spending for entitlement programs rose beyond official projections.
Most of this, say economists and budget analysts on both the left and the right, is simply political hot air.
"It's a way of suggesting big savings that will never be delivered," said Stuart M. Butler, the director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization.
The only responsible way to advocate reducing entitlement spending, Mr. Butler said, is to say precisely which programs would be cut and by how much -- something politicians rarely do.
There are dozens of entitlement programs, including prominent ones like Social Security, food stamps and farm price supports and obscure ones like money for witnesses in Federal trials and subsidies to farmers who agree not to cultivate environmentally sensitive land.
What they have in common is that the money is spent each year without the annual review accorded programs that need new appropriations from Congress. Altogether, they will cost $770 billion this year, more than half the Federal budget and four-fifths of all the spending, not counting what goes for the military or interest on the debt.
 
Running Rampant
 More than two-thirds of all this entitlement money, $528 billion, will be spent on only three programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And only two entitlement programs are actually running rampant: Medicare, which covers the medical costs for the elderly and the disabled, and Medicaid, the state-Federal health program for the poor.
Social Security is growing no faster than the general growth in the economy, and the increases in the taxes that support it in the 1980's more than made up for rising benefits being paid out to retirees.
Many of the other entitlement programs, including food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare programs, have failed for years to keep pace with inflation and the growth in the eligible population.
In fact, even if the Government abolishes food stamps, welfare, farm price supports, child nutrition programs and veterans' pensions -- an extreme step that no one is advocating -- entitlement spending would still be a higher percentage of the Federal budget in 1998 than it is now, unless Medicare and Medicaid costs are reduced.
Spending on Medicare and Medicaid rose from $48 billion in 1980, or 8 percent of the budget, to $196 billion last year, or 14 percent of the budget. If nothing is done to change the law, the cost of the two programs will more than double by 1988, to $405 billion, or 22 percent of total spending, according to Congressional Budget Office projections.
 
'Sea of Red Ink'
 And by 2003, the Federal budget deficit, now about $300 billion, will have grown to nearly $700 billion, "making the current sea of red ink look more like a puddle," Mr. Reischauer said.
Letitia Chambers, a public policy consultant here who specializes in budget matters, said that all the political talk about limiting entitlement spending masked the true problem. "The real issue," she said in an interview last week, "is that Medicare and Medicaid have gone through the roof."
Actually, those programs have grown less than health-care costs generally in recent years, although Medicaid spending doubled from 1989 to 1992 largely because the recession caused so many more people to become eligible.
President Clinton has proposed cutting Medicare by about $50 billion over the next five years, and the Senate Finance Committee is prepared to cut an additional $31 billion, said the panel's chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. But the cuts will not come cheaply.
Many cost-cutting measures in the Government's health programs alone have been counterproductive. For example, when the Government has put limits on Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors and laboratories, they have generally responded by charging patients more when the patients are covered by private insurance. The effect has amounted to a hidden tax on the general public in the form of higher insurance premiums.
"The way health care works these days," said Stanley E. Collender, a budget specialist at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, "if you cut Medicare and Medicaid, you and I are going to pay for it, pure and simple."
This does not mean entitlements cannot be cut. For example, Social Security payments to the wealthy could be withheld, or cost-of-living increases in retirement benefits could be abolished. Medicare premiums for outpatient care could be increased substantially, or upper-income retirees could be asked to pay more of their hospital bills out of pocket.
But such steps would be so unpopular that they would amount to political suicide for many who voted for them.
So rather than talking about the specifics, politicians embrace the word "entitlement."
The word used to be a euphemism for welfare, but now it mostly refers to benefits enjoyed by the general public. Eighty percent of entitlement payments do not take account of the recipient's income.
By making benign-sounding proposals like freezes or caps, politicians avoid the risk that voters will tally up what the proposals would cost them personally.
Mr. Bush advocated such proposals. And that is the stand taken by Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a Texas Democrat, and most Republicans in the House and by Senators Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican, and Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Democrat, among others.
"It's as if they're proposing holding back the tide," said Mr. Butler of the Heritage Foundation.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
American consumers increased their borrowing for the ninth consecutive month in April, bringing their total debt to a record high, the Government reported today.
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent, to $754 billion, the Federal Reserve said. 
 April's gain followed a 4.7 percent rate advance in March and a 7.4 percent rate increase in February. The last decline in consumer credit came last July, which marked the 14th drop in 20 months.
During the recession, consumers reduced their borrowing and sought to pay down debts, but since last summer they seem to have been less leery of taking on added debt.
But economists say consumers could turn cautious again without continued improvement in the job market. The nation's unemployment rate in May was 6.9 percent, down from 7 percent from February through April and an eight-year high of 7.7 percent last June.
In April, the biggest gain in credit outstanding came in the revolving credit category, which includes credit cards. It rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.5 percent, following an identical increase in March.
Auto borrowing increased at a 1.9 percent annual rate after a 2.3 percent increase a month earlier. Other kinds of consumer loans rose at a 1.2 percent annual rate. This category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations.
The Fed's consumer credit report includes all household debt not secured by real estate. It does not include home-equity loans or real estate.

HEADLINE: U.S. Gives Trade Plan To Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration presented the Japanese Government a broad proposal today to open Japan's markets by setting specific targets for imports of goods and services from the United States and other countries.
But while the proposal calls for the two countries to work out numerical benchmarks for opening the Japanese market for everything from cars to computer chips, senior Administration officials said at a briefing today that the proposal explicitly ruled out any automatic retaliation if the targets were not met. 
 In recent weeks, Administration officials have left the impression through their tough anti-Japan oratory that they would aggressively enforce any numerical targets agreed to by Japan. But Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown have steered clear of actually calling for the targets to be legally enforceable.
 
 
Kantor Cites 'Commitments'

Still, Mr. Kantor has gone out of his way to label as "commitments" the various benchmarks agreed to by the Japanese Government during the Bush Administration. In one case, Tokyo officially acknowledged in 1991 the expectation of the American semiconductor industry that foreign computer chips would capture 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of last year. Japanese auto makers also said when President George Bush visited Tokyo last year that by 1994 they would increase their purchases of American auto parts to $19 billion from $9 billion in 1990.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said this evening in San Jose, Calif., where it is based, that it continued to support the position of Mr. Kantor that the foreign market share for computer chips in Japan should average 20 percent for all of 1993. Daryl Hatano, the association's trade specialist, said that the American industry lacked confidence in the durability of recent American inroads in the Japanese market. "At this stage in the game, we still need the Government's attention," he said.
The foreign market share in Japan rose to 20.2 percent in the 1992 fourth quarter from 15.9 percent in the 1992 third quarter, he said. "There's not a lot of confidence yet that that is sustainable," Mr. Hatano said. The chipagreement is in place until 1996 but the only numerical target was for the 20 percent level by the end of 1992.
 Sensitive to recent Japanese accusations that American officials are trying to manage trade, the plan offered today, which was worked out in four months of interagency wrangling, represented a victory for proponents of a less confrontational approach to trade disputes.
At a briefing today, senior Administration officials went out of their way to avoid any suggestion that they would restrict Japanese exports to the United States or try to force Tokyo's hand to open its markets. "This is not put in the spirit of making any kind of threat," said one of the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
But Administration officials were also sensitive to any suggestion that they were backing down from their previous tough talk. While no automatic retaliation is envisioned, the new plan would not restrict the Government's ability to use existing American law, which does provide for trade restrictions against countries that violate past agreements. For example, the Government has restricted imports of Italian wine coolers because it says Europe restricts various food products from the United States.
 
Not Legally Binding
 The benchmarks the Clinton Administration is proposing for Japan would, however, not be legally binding commitments by the Japanese and therefore would not be subject to automatic retaliation by the United States.
But in referring to the retaliatory power that the American Government can use under its existing laws to punish Japan for violating previous trade agreements, a senior Administration official said, "Of course, if we have to use it, we will use it."
The proposal has a few similarities to Bush Administration policies in that it seeks broad changes in the structure of the Japanese economy, ranging from opening it up for more foreign investment to streamlining its convoluted retail system, which tends to exclude foreign goods. The new approach differs by proposing numerical benchmarks for measuring progress in a wide range of disputes, and in setting a succession of deadlines for progress.
 
Combining Issues
 It also differs by combining structural issues with industry issues in a way that the Bush and Reagan Administrations did not try. For example, the proposal calls for negotiations on foreign car sales in Japan that would include structural issues like the Japanese car dealer system. That system is heavily influenced by Japan's car makers, who have been accused of using it to keep American cars out.
According to people with a detailed knowledge of the American proposal, it calls for Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world to be reduced within three years to a range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent of Japan's economic output. Japan's current surplus, using a broad measurement that includes services and foreign aid, is about 3 percent of its economic output.
If the Japanese agree to adopt the benchmarks, the United States said it would keep its market as open to international goods and services as it is now. It is also promising to follow President Clinton's five-year plan for cutting the budget deficit in half, measured as a percentage of the nation's economic output, the Administration officials said.
The Japanese Embassy had no immediate reaction.
 
Facing a Deadline
 The mild American oratory at today's briefing was consistent with a softening of American and European criticisms of Japan in the last two weeks. The world's industrial powers are racing against a self-imposed deadline of early July to strike a broad compromise on lowering import tariffs and other trade barriers, as part of world trade talks involving 114 nations. Japanese trade negotiators have taken an increasingly conciliatory stance in these talks, which are under the auspices of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The heads of state from the world's seven leading economies are scheduled to meet on July 7 in Tokyo. The senior Administration officials said today that they hoped that President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan would announce there that they had agreed on a framework for the coming trade negotiations between the two countries.
A meeting between Japanese and American trade officials to outline the framework for the talks between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Miyazawa is scheduled for Friday in Washington.
The Tokyo meeting is also the target for a likely compromise on market access in the GATT talks. By deferring a bilateral confrontation with Japan while seeking the global trade deal, the Clinton Administration is closely following the example of the Bush Administration.
The Bush Administration started a very similar framework of American-Japanese trade talks in 1989 while emphasizing a global deal. But the world trade talks broke down in December 1990, leaving the Bush Administration with neither the global deal nor much progress on bilateral trade frictions.
The approach presented today does not represent all of the Administration's demands on trade but is its proposal for how to go about resolving trade disputes. Besides the targets for the size of Japan's surplus with the rest of the world, today's proposals would set goals on foreign access in a handful of specific industries.
At today's briefing, the senior Administration officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House has scheduled a much larger briefing on Tuesday, when a few more details of the plan will be officially released.
The senior Administration officials said today that the United States was calling for trans-Pacific trade negotiations to be divided into five categories, which they refused to identify. They will not do so on Tuesday either, a senior Administration official said, because the Administration does not want to negotiate with the Japanese in the newspapers.
 
Several Areas Covered
 But people familiar with the American proposal said today that the first category would cover compliance with existing trade agreements, while the second would cover trade in autos and auto parts. The third would cover regulated industries like banking and insurance, and the fourth would consist of government procurement issues, like the persistently low purchases of American-made supercomputers and construction engineering by the Japanese Government.
The last category, vaguely named economic integration, would cover issues like patent protection. American companies have long complained that it is more difficult for them to receive patents for new inventions in Japan than it is for Japanese companies to get patents here. It would also cover Japanese support for new technologies. The Japanese Government would be asked to identify all new industries that it is assisting, allowing the United States to insist that these industries not be protected from international competition until they were strong.
The Administration briefed a few members of Congress on Friday about the new plan. Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who advocates more confrontational trade policies, said he was satisfied with the approach. "For the first time it has more than talking in it, for the first time it talks about specifics, like cutting in half" the overall Japanese trade surplus, he said today.

HEADLINE: Striking Coal Miners Fight To Protect Shrinking Power

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., June 3

 BODY:
It was just before midnight, an hour very dark and still in the mountains south of Charleston, and a dozen men were gathered around a fire on the picket line at the Hobet 21 Mine.
The strike by the United Mine Workers of America was in its third week, and a certain domesticity had settled in: The men had built a sturdy picket shack and stocked it with food and drink. They had adopted a stray dog and named it Striker. They had become enough of a fixture along U.S. 119 that motorists honked their horns, and many stopped with firewood and food. 
 Still, it was a lonely outpost, and it was manned mostly by miners in their 40's and 50's. In their camouflage fatigues, the semiofficial uniform of U.M.W. members on strike, they resembled nothing else so much as aging, weary soldiers. And they talked like men in a long, grim war -- a war against layoffs and mine shutdowns, against the growing tide of nonunion coal, against the hard economic trends of the Appalachian coal fields.
There have been many strikes and mine wars in this region, but no one underestimates the United Mine Workers' current struggle. The union's "selective strike," which began May 10 and has steadily expanded, now covers about 9,000 miners in five states and is widely expected to grow.
 
Memories of John L.
 But the days of John L. Lewis, when miners could lay down their tools, let the stockpiles dwindle and threaten to paralyze the American economy, are gone. While coal still generates about 55 percent of the nation's electricity, the union controls only about 30 percent of coal production. In the current strike, the union is battling to hold on to its remaining power, and the miners are fighting for the remaining jobs. Getting a share of the jobs in new, nonunion mines is a central issue.
The U.M.W. now claims about 70,000 working members nationwide, down from 120,000 a decade ago. "Our forefathers toughed it out for the benefits we've got today," said Danny Hoover, a third-generation miner who is 45. "We don't intend to lose them."
Voices chimed in from the dark. "We're not dumb hillbillies," one miner called out. "You can't raise a family on a McDonald's salary," said Jerry Selbe, sitting solemnly by the fire.
U.M.W. members, who long prided themselves on their image as the shock troops of American labor, are squeezed by several trends. Employment in the union's traditional strongholds, like southern West Virginia, has eroded in recent years with the steady increase in mechanization and productivity. Here in West Virginia, coal-mining employment has dropped by more than 50 percent in a decade, which helps account for an unemployment rate of 11.7 percent, highest in the nation.
Coal-mining employment has always been cyclical, but this time the factories of Detroit, Akron and Cleveland no longer provide the escape that they offered thousands of Appalachian men in the past.
Some miners do head South for construction work during layoffs. "I've spent my lifetime leaving here," said Doug Samson, a miner on the picket line at Sharples, W.Va.
But roots run deep in the coal fields, and many miners keep coming back. "Look around you," Kenny Smith, a 44-year-old miner who is a son and grandson of southern West Virginia miners, said on a gentle spring afternoon in the mountains. "To me it's hard not to understand. This is home."
 
The Precious Jobs
 This makes the remaining jobs in the mining industry all the more precious. According to the U.M.W., the average union miner is 44 years old and working in a mine with only seven years of production remaining. The stakes for the union as an institution are equally high, as it seeks to at least stabilize its membership.
Richard L. Trumka, the union president, asserts that the coal operators are trying to "box in" the U.M.W. and shift new production to nonunion subsidiaries. He also says the companies reneged on a 1988 agreement to give U.M.W. members three of every five newly created jobs; Mr. Trumka asserts that this pledge should apply to the companies' nonunion affiliates.
Trying to adjust to the times, the union has hired Frank Greer, President Clinton's media consultant, and mounted an advertising campaign in newspapers and on radio to plead its case: "You work hard. You raise productivity 200 percent, cut costs and increase profits. You lose your job. Something is wrong."
Spokesmen for the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the principal bargaining group for the coal companies, dismiss the notion that there is some master plan to box in the union. In modern, complex corporations, they say, some affiliated companies will inevitably be union, and some will not. They say they have gone the extra mile in the current talks by offering the U.M.W. three out of five new jobs in nonunion affiliates, after the first 40 percent of the workers are hired.
 
A Form of Suicide?
 "What we haven't done is agree that every job be given to the union," said Tom Hoffman, a vice president of Consol, an energy company, and spokesman for the operators' negotiating committee. "I think it boils down to the company wanting to take the best people, and I don't know that you want to be locked into an antiquated system of seniority and job classification that restricts your ability to hire the best people."
Mr. Hoffman also argues that the U.M.W. may be practicing a form of "suicide" by its "selective strike" against unionized operations. "In 1993, customers have numerous ways to get coal from numerous sources not controlled by the U.M.W.A.," he said.
The union's five-year contract with the coal operators association expired in February. After negotiations broke down last month, Mr. Trumka called the strike and made targets of additional companies each week.
"We have to give them credit for being relatively innovative in the way they're pursuing this negotiation," said Rafael Villagran, a coal industry analyst with Lehman Brothers. "The U.M.W.A. can't shut down a country the way they used to be able to do, but they can still invoke a creative strike mechanism to try to hit bottlenecks in the industry and have a selective impact on regions."
 
Poker and Horseshoes
 While the positioning takes place in Washington and Pittsburgh, the miners walk the picket line; they play poker and horseshoes, they whittle and brood.
"Everything you ever worked for is at stake," Ray Goodman, a retired miner, told Jerry Perry on the picket line at a mine on Buffalo Creek one recent afternoon. Mr. Perry, a third-generation miner with 24 years in the industry, seemed well aware of the stakes.
"Over all these years, it's been the miners that's made the companies what they are," said Mr. Perry, who is 53. "We've been faithful to the mines. We've worked and produced."
What if his mine is worked out in seven years? he asked. "I'll be 60, 61 years old; too early for early Social Security, too old to be hired on a new job. This is what we're fighting for right now: for job security, that when I get up to this position here, that I ought not just be thrown out to the dogs."
Most of the miners on the picket line these days boast of their productivity; they are sensitive to the image that unionized miners acquired in the late 1970's, when a young work force engaged in a wave of wildcat strikes over issues like local grievances and gasoline rationing.
Mr. Trumka asserts that the huge productivity gains feed the miners' sense of injustice. "The question they always ask, and the question that echoes in my head, is, 'What did I do wrong?' " the union president said.
But Ralph Barbaro of Energy Ventures Analysis, a consultant for the coal and natural-gas industries, said that nonunion mines typically retained a competitive edge, both in wage and benefit costs and in productivity. "I think their membership will continue to shrink," Mr. Barbaro said of the union.
According to the coal operator's association, the average annual employment cost for a U.M.W. miner in 1991 was about $67,800 -- $41,800 in wages, and the rest in medical, pension and other benefit costs.
On the picket lines, the miners talk about the forces they see arrayed against them. They grumble that 12 years of Republican Presidents have rigged the game against them, made it harder and harder for unions to organize and strike. They talk of their hopes for a more sympathetic hearing from a Democrat in the White House, although they say they have yet to sense it.
But in almost every conversation during a reporter's three days of traveling the picket lines, the miners offered an affirmation of faith. "The union was in our fathers, and I would say it'll be in all of us until we die," said Patrick Browning, who works in a surface mine on Buffalo Creek.
Still, the changes are coming so rapidly, and so deep. At the headquarters of U.M.W. District 17, the district's president, Bob Phalen, said: "People ask me all the time, 'When is the coal industry coming back?' The coal industry hasn't gone anywhere. They're setting production records every day."
He added: "I've always said modern technology is great. But sooner or later, someone has to figure out what do you do with people."

HEADLINE: Senate Repeals No-Fault Insurance Law

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 7

 BODY:
The state Senate gave final legislative approval tonight to a repeal of Connecticut's 20-year-old no-fault automobile insurance law, which critics say has led, despite the statute's intent, to higher premiums and clogged courts.
The repeal measure -- which still requires approval from Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who has not said whether he will sign it -- would replace no-fault insurance with a modified tort system that proponents said could cut premiums on a basic automobile insurance policy by more than 19 percent. 
 It would also, they conceded, put more disputes over car accidents back into the courts, by requiring that responsibility be established before claims are paid. But the bill also creates a new fast-track adjudication system aimed at settling those additional cases through arbitration and nonjury trials for claims of $75,000 or less.
 
Eliminates 'Stacking'
 It also eliminates the practice known as "stacking," under which a person who owns more than one car can combine the insurance benefits for each car for a higher payout. Insurance companies have argued for years that stacking policies has artificially fueled insurance costs.
Currently 14 states, including New York and New Jersey, have no-fault insurance systems. Connecticut's bill, if it becomes law, would mark only the fourth time that a no-fault insurance state has repealed its statute, according to the American Insurance Association, a trade group. One of those states, Pennsylvania, repealed no-fault, then went back.
"No-fault hasn't worked," said Senator George C. Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford who sponsored the bill. Mr. Jepsen said he had no illusions that car insurance premiums in a state with high incomes, expensive cars and expensive health care could ever be made cheap. "But what we have before us today takes a reasonable, intelligent step," he said.
The 28-to-8 vote in the Senate sends the bill on to Governor Weicker. Before signing it, he said he would analyze it to make sure the bill meets a series of tests, including whether the savings are passed onto consumers in a "real and measurable" way, whether it leaves people better insured, and how it could affect highway safety.
The House of Representatives passed the bill last week by a 142-to-7 majority. Overriding a veto by the Governor requires 24 votes in the Senate and 101 votes in the House.
 
Shifting Costs
 Proponents of the bill contend that the heart of the no-fault system -- a $5,000 basic medical coverage provision that every motorist in Connecticut is now required to buy -- is not effectively managed to control costs. Under the Legislature's bill, those medical costs will instead be paid through drivers' health insurance policies -- in other words, in most cases by their employers, who generally have already moved to curb costs through health-maintenance organizations and other approaches.
Opponents said that shifting those costs to employers' medical plans would provide little savings, and that many more people who are unemployed or who have no health insurance at their job could be left vulnerable if injured. The bill allows people otherwise not covered by health insurance to continue to buy the basic coverage through their automobile policies for an extra charge. It would not require that coverage, however, as the current law does.
"The estimated savings in this bill are balanced on the backs of those who can afford it least," said Senator Donald E. Williams Jr., a Democrat from Thompson.
 
Refinements Are Likely
 The local insurance industry, including giants like Aetna Life and Casualty and the Travelers, both based here in Hartford, has reluctantly accepted the bill as the best compromise available. But the insurers say that it is a stopgap measure at best and that a complete overhaul similar to what New Jersey did three years ago -- a choice system that allows policy holders a menu of no-fault and tort options -- will likely be the next step.
"This is not the last act," said David F. Snyder, counsel to the American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group. "Costs in Connecticut will continue to rise -- the origin of high costs is litigation and you will have more of it, not less."

HEADLINE: Latest Version of Supreme Court List: Babbitt in Lead, 2 Judges Close Behind

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
President Clinton continued today to wrestle with his first Supreme Court appointment. The latest version of the President's short list has Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt as the top contender to fill the seat of Justice Byron R. White, who is retiring, with two Federal appeals court judges, Stephen G. Breyer and Gilbert S. Merritt, also in the running.
"Stay tuned," Mr. Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden. "I have not made a decision yet, but I'm working on it." 
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Clinton had not yet interviewed any candidates and was not expected to make his choice until the end of the week at the earliest.
"The search has been narrowed," Ms. Myers said. "The President is reviewing the results of the vetting process. There is more than one candidate at play here."
For nearly three weeks, White House spokesmen and the President have said that the nomination was imminent, but each time it has been delayed for various reasons: some candidates high on Mr. Clinton's list dropped out, unexpected political crises arose and some names that were floated generated quick opposition.
Mr. Clinton has apparently become gun-shy after so many mishaps with appointees, and he now seems determined to find the perfect Supreme Court candidate, one who will be easily confirmed, reflect well upon him and not bring any surprises.
With this in mind, the White House has recently been floating names of possible nominees. Over the weekend, for instance, several news organizations reported that the President had settled on Mr. Babbitt for the Court seat, and the Interior Secretary's spokesman, Kevin Sweeney, told reporters this morning, "I think it's going to happen."
But only hours later, the White House made it clear that Mr. Babbitt's was not the only name on the President's list, although several officials said he probably had a definite edge over the other candidates. Now if Mr. Babbitt is not chosen, it could raise awkward questions about why.
In fact, that has already happened. Today the President was asked in the Rose Garden, "Why are you backing off Babbitt?"
"I'm not backing off on anybody," he snapped. "I haven't made a decision yet."
 
Losing a Good Thing
 While the President admires the 54-year-old Mr. Babbitt, Mr. Clinton has still not given him the nod yet for several reasons. For one, Mr. Babbitt has emerged as a star of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet, and the President is not eager to lose him without having a clear idea who might take his place.
Mr. Babbitt's political handling of environmental issues, which has won praise from environmentalists and business groups alike, is politically important for Mr. Clinton's standing in the West, where the President won one-third of his electoral votes.
Some environmental groups even have started lobbying the White House against the Babbitt appointment -- because they are so fond of him.
"Babbitt is uniquely suited to be Secretary of the Interior," said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, a leading environmentalist group. "He has the political skills to pursue both economic growth and environmental protection, and while there is no doubt that he might make a great Supreme Court Justice, there are other alternatives for the court. But there are not other people with his stature and leadership skills who would be appropriate for Interior."
Mr. Babbitt, a former Governor of Arizona who also served as the state's attorney general, fits Mr. Clinton's desire to have a moderate-to-liberal nominee with a record of being able to build coalitions with conservatives, who now dominate the Court. That is a reputation Mr. Babbitt earned in Arizona, where he had to govern in cooperation with a Republican-dominated Legislature.
 
The Other Contenders
 Judge Breyer of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, is a stranger to the President but is well regarded as a legal thinker. Althought he was nominated for the court by President Jimmy Carter, Judge Breyer has a great deal of support among Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, has spoken out in support of his nomination, as has the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas.
Judge Merritt, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, was appointed to the bench by Mr. Carter. He is considered a moderate who would generate some Republican support. But reports of his possible nomination two weeks ago drew the ire of one Jewish organization.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which monitors issues involving the Holocaust, criticized Judge Merritt for ordering an inquiry into the Justice Department's handling of the extradition of John Demjanjuk, who was convicted of Nazi war crimes by an Israeli court.
As for a possible Babbitt nomination, Senator Dole put Mr. Clinton on notice today that it might not be clear sailing. Asked about the ease with which Mr. Babbitt might be confirmed, he said: "I don't know enough about Bruce Babbitt's legal qualifications. I know he's a nice person. We've got some of our staff checking to see what he's done, to see what he's written."
He added: "I prefer to have somebody who has circuit court experience. I was sort of supporting Stephen Breyer. Is he still in the mix?"

HEADLINE: Stock Prices End Lower Across the Board

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower across the board yesterday, despite a late afternoon comeback that briefly took the Dow Jones industrial average into positive territory.
Among the weakest sectors were banking, technology and gambling. 
 Financial stocks, despite a firm bond market, continue to show weakness amid worries about higher interest rates and their impact on earnings.
Citicorp fell 1 3/8, to 26 3/8, while Bankers Trust fell 1 3/4, to 69 7/8; Chemical Bankdeclined 1 5/8, to 35 1/2.
Among technology stocks, Advanced Micro Devices fell 4 1/4, to 23 3/4, after a court reversed an arbitrator's earlier award giving it permanent royalty-free rights to clone Intel's popular 386 computer chip. Intel, the apparent victor, was up 1 3/4, to 58 1/8.
 
 
Andrea Electronics Soars
 Investors in Andrea Electronics were easily identifiable, They were the ones smiling. The stock soared 16 1/4, to 53 3/4, with trading halted for an order imbalance because raders could not keep up with large volume of buy orders.
Andrea Electronics said Friday that it "was right on track" in bringing to market by the third quarter a line of machines, including one to suppress street noise on pay phones.
The Dow fell 13.01 points, to 3,532.13, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaling 236.9 million shares. Declining issues outnumbered gainers by 11 to 7.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.40 points, to 694.61, while the American Stock Exchange composite was off five-hundredths of a point, to 440.90.
Some traders thought investors were approaching the market with extra caution ahead of Friday's release the May Producer Price Index, the next inflation indicator. Caught off guard last week with strong employment numbers, investors do not appear to be committing themselves to any strong moves and may be content picking individual stocks for now, analysts said.
"I still suspect a rally in the market could come as early as Tuesday," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane, Charlotte, N.C. "It may be a little early to suggest that investor money is on the sidelines, and of course interest rates are still reasonably stable."
A.T.& T., which is raising evening long-distance charges, rose 3/8, to 62 1/8.
Advanced Technology Labs and Acuson, which make ultrasonic medical equipment that could become more popular under cost-conscious health-care changes, were up 3/4, to 17 1/4, and 1 3/4, to 12 1/2, respectively.
 
 
Snapple Advances
 Snapple Beverage rose 5 3/4, to 62 1/4. The stock had fallen 5 percent since Emanuel Goldman, the Paine Webber analyst, reduced his rating to neutral on May 28, calling the stock overpriced. Yesterday, Mr. Goldman changed his rating to attractive after seeing April supermarket data last week that indicated continuing growth for Snapple.
Traders said Apple Computer was not as fortunate, falling 4 1/8, to 50 3/4, after Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter lowered his third-quarter estimates and reduced numbers for the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years. Bear, Stearns also said its estimates for the computer company were under review.

HEADLINE: Protection of Region's Open Spaces Urged by Planning Group

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The planning group that more than half a century ago proposed the system of parkways that today unites the New York region has concluded that it is now critically important to identify and protect broad corridors of woods, open space and sparse development that still survive 40 to 100 miles from New York City.
The group, the Regional Plan Association, said that vast expanses of open space, previously considered invulnerable, are now threatened. A decade of frenetic development has claimed farmland, forests and verdant private estates from northern Connecticut to southern New Jersey, it said. 
 The Regional Plan Association is a private body without governmental authority or other means to carry out its proposals. But for 65 years its ideas for shaping the region have been embraced, at least in part, by Federal, state, city and county governments.
The association is to present its recommendations at a meeting of planners, environmentalists and government officials in Manhattan today. Its report consists largely of a map, identifying corridors of land, reservoirs and watershed areas that it says should be treated by the states, counties and municipalities as "regional reserves."
 
Threat of 'Urban Sprawl'
 These unspoiled areas "encompass the region's most important scenic, biological and water resources which are now being threatened by urban sprawl," the Regional Plan Association said.
The most critical open space corridors it identified are an area extending from the Litchfield Hills of northern Connecticut to the Delaware River in central New Jersey, New York's Catskill Mountains, the Pine Barrens of Long Island and the Pinelands of southern New Jersey.
 
Effect of Weak Economy
 The group maintained that its proposal for open-space planning had gained urgency even as the recession slowed the development trends that encroached on the rural and exurban landscape in the 1980's.
"For the moment, development pressures have lifted," said Claude Shostal, president of the association. "But developers are still speculating in land investments, and the pressure on our open space will certainly be there."
But the group said the weak economy in the New York region and elsewhere had made the goal of open-space preservation more difficult, because Federal money for land acquisition, which flowed into the region during most of the last 30 years, is sure to dwindle.
It said government agencies, environmentalists and developers must coordinate more closely to assure that new construction in the most sensitive open-space corridors is limited.
The Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group financed by foundations and corporations, is offering no method of buying land. Nor does the group offer any assurance that long-running disputes between the states, counties and municipalities over land use and planning can be resolved.
But as the only large planning organization that seeks to coordinate land use across the region, the association has a long record of influence over public policy. Its professional staff, based in Manhattan, includes planners and land-use experts.
One critical source of support for open-space advocates that seems certain to dwindle is Federal financing for land acquisition. The group said the amount of park land in the region doubled between 1960 and 1990, mainly because of huge outlays from Washington.
More than $300 million flowed into the region for land acquisition during that period. Now, because of the recession, and longer term constraints on Congress to reduce the budget deficit, "I see little the Clinton Administration can do," Mr. Shostal said.
 
Role for Private Groups?
 Where land acquisition is required, the group said, non-government land trusts and other private groups may be asked to play a larger role. But it added that most of the open-space corridors it is seeking to protect are already interspersed with state or Federal park land, and the challenge facing the region now is to coordinate development plans so it leaves as much open space as possible intact.
One critical area, the group said, is the Long Island Pine Barrens, the wide expanse of low-lying undeveloped dwarf pine plains along the spine of Suffolk County. Faced with proposals for more than 200 development projects, environmentalists on Long Island have waged a bitter series of lawsuits, which culminated in May with a tentative agreement in which the developers said they would not build on half of the 100,000-acre corridor.
 
Sterling Forest on List
 Another area that ranks high on the list of threatened tracts, the group said, is Sterling Forest, a heavily wooded 17,500-acre tract in Rockland County where a Swedish Insurance Company wants to build a small new city of 35,000 residents. The tract lies at the center of the Hudson Highlands, one of the "regional reserves" that are identified by the Regional Plan Association as most critical to the region.
New York State officials say a deal is being negotiated in which the state would buy -- for an undisclosed figure under $50 million -- three quarters of Sterling Forest, allowing the Swedish company to build on the rest.
At the Regional Plan Association, analysts said both areas provided examples of the approach that might be necessary to preserve as much open space as possible for the region.
"We are not suggesting that there be no development," said Robert Pirani, the association's director of environmental projects. "But we need to identify what areas are most critical for the region, and see that development goes around these resources instead of destroying them."

HEADLINE: Attacks in Los Angeles Fly on Eve of Election

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 7

 BODY:
On the eve of what many people say could be a watershed election Tuesday, the two candidates for mayor of Los Angeles called each other liars and racists today, keeping up their personal attacks to the end in a close race.
The volley of accusations by the two candidates, City Councilman Michael Woo, 41, and Richard Riordan, 62, a millionaire businessman, have come in two televised debates and a joint television interview since Sunday. 
 Their continuing mutual attacks and failure to articulate a broad vision for the city have wearied many voters, who are hoping for strong leadership at a time of crisis in the economy, race relations and public safety.
The election has aroused little enthusiasm, and the strongest emotion voiced by a number of voters today was disappointment at the candidates and the tone of the campaign.
"We watched exactly 30 seconds of the debate last night, and we are avid political activists," said Sydney Weisman, a public relations executive. "The minute the attacks started, we said, 'Never mind.' "

HEADLINE: Judge Allows Dredging To Continue

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 7

 BODY:
A Federal judge held today that a permit for ocean disposal of dioxin-tainted silt from Newark Bay was flawed, but he rejected pleas from environmentalists that the dredging and dumping be halted.
The judge, Dickinson R. Debevoise of United States District Court here, said that the Army Corps of Engineers, which granted the permit to port officials, had failed to show that the dioxin existed only in trace amounts, less than 1 part per trillion. Federal law permits ocean disposal of dioxin only in trace amounts. 
 But a permit can be issued under an exception for economic hardship, and the judge strongly suggested that such an argument could prevail because failure to dredge the port's container-ship berths in Newark and Elizabeth would imperil waterfront commerce by forcing huge cargo ships to call elsewhere. It was the real and potential impact of such losses, the judge said, that persuaded him to rebuff attempts to halt the dredging, which began last Wednesday and will continue for a month.
 
Conditions Imposed
 Judge Debevoise ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take steps within 15 days either to establish that only trace amounts are being dumped or to seek a hardship waiver from the Secretary of the Army. He also barred the Corps from issuing any similar permits until it could apply the court's directives uniformly.
Hugh H. Welsh, a lawyer for the Port Authority, said that the agency would probably be able to prevail on either point raised by the judge but that "we'll have to study our alternatives." Under the permit, the port may dredge up to 460,000 cubic yards of sediment, dump it at sea and cap the material with three feet of fresh sand.
But Gordon L. Litwin, a lawyer for the environmental groups, said that up to 5 percent of the dredged material would escape the cap and, as a result, dioxin contamination would be measurably more than a trace.
 
Conservationists Disappointed
 The ruling was a disappointment for the coalition of conservationists and fishermen's groups that has been fighting the permit for three years. They contend that dioxin, a highly toxic industrial byproduct, should not be deposited at the Corps' 80-year-old Mud Dump, six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., amid some of the East Coast's richest fishing grounds.
Although they acknowledge that the port needs to be dredged to remain competitive, they say that dioxin, even in small amounts, could imperil the health of humans as well as of fish and wildlife and ruin New Jersey's commercial and sport fishing industry.
Although conservationists have called for alternatives to ocean dumping, including the construction of artificial containment islands or storage on land or in empty freighters, port and Government officials say that these are still too expensive and that decontamination techniques have yet to be perfected.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rebound for Treasury Bond Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday in a rebound from the sharp decline that occurred Friday after the Government reported a suprisingly large increase in nonfarm payroll jobs in May.
But trading yesterday was very light, which means the rise in prices could have been exaggerated. When trading is thin, action by a few speculators and traders can move prices much further than would occur with normal trading volume. 
 "There was not much volume behind this, so the bounce is a little suspect," said Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
 
Prices Edge Higher
 In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond due in Feburary 2023 was up 13/32 as the yield dropped to 6.87 percent, from 6.91 percent Friday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. The prices of intermediate Treasury notes also rose, but not as much.
The major concern in the market right now is inflation and whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates to signal that it will not allow the pace of price increases to pick up.
There may be an answer to that question by the middle of next week because the Labor Department releases the Producer Price Index on Friday and the Consumer Price Index next Tuesday. If the increases are small, the Fed may not take action. But if they continue at the 4.3 percent annual rate that the Consumer Price Index showed in April, the Fed may be forced to respond quickly. Based on current forecasts, the May price increases are expected to be smaller than the average for the first four months of the year.
 
Bill Rates Rise
 The fear of Fed action was reflected in the weekly auction of Treasury bills yesterday, where the average discount rate rose for the fifth week in a row. The average rate on three-month bills rose to 3.14 percent, the highest since the 3.15 percent at the Jan. 4 auction and up from 3.08 percent last week. The rate on the six-month bill was 3.30 percent, the highest since the 3.38 percent on Dec. 26 and up from 3.22 percent last week.
Traders are not sure yet how much support prices of long-term securities are getting from the weekend's indications that the Clinton Administration is amenable to a deficit-reduction compromise with Senate Democrats that would mean more spending cuts and fewer tax increases.
Bond investors generally favor spending cuts over tax increases because they are a more reliable way to reduce the Federal budget deficit. But it is possible that such a revision, while passing the Senate, might run into trouble in the House, where some members may oppose the deeper spending cuts.
The House gave initial approval to the President's program by a narrow vote of 219 to 213 at the end of last month. If a compromise plan is approved in the Senate, the House and Senate would work out the differences in a conference committee and both houses would then vote on the revised proposal, adding to the uncertainity of the outlook for the program.
 
Other Markets
 Both the municipal and corporate market should be active this week. In the municipal market, $5 billion to $7 billion of issues are expected to be sold this week, according to Bloomberg Business News.
Prices of actively traded municipal bonds were little changed yesterday. There was a new wrinkle for the tax-exempt market in the budget talk over the weekend. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said that he did not think that a proposed 36 percent top tax rate should be retroactive to Jan. 1, which is the case in the plan approved by the House.
In the corporate market, the International Business Machines Corporation, with Morgan Stanley & Company as the lead underwriter, is planning to sell $1.5 billion in bonds, one of the largest corporate offerings ever.
The bonds are part of the company's effort to raise about $3 billion. A third of that sum was obtained in the recent sale of preferred stock.
Some of the money raised could be used to pay the severance costs for the thousands of employees that are leaving the company as I.B.M. seeks to cut costs. The company already expects that more than 25,000 employees will leave voluntarily or involuntarily.
Following are the results of yesterday's action of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Slightly Lower After Traders Take Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in lethargic trading on world currency markets yesterday, under pressure from profit taking.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery settled at $375.70 an ounce, off $2.80 from Friday. The Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at a late bid price of $373.50, down $2.80. 
 Analysts said the dollar was poised for a technical correction following its sharp rise on Friday, when the currency got a boost from an unexpected surge in May employment.
When trading began in Europe, the currency was hit by profit taking, which continued as activity shifted to domestic markets, Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said.
 
Waiting for Monthly Reports
 But he described trading as "very apathetic," since there was no fresh news to move the market. Mr. Donney predicted activity would remain relatively light until Friday, when the Government is scheduled to issue reports on producer prices and retail sales, both for May.
"These are the pivotal events the market is looking at right now," he said. Investors will be looking for additional evidence that shows a firming economy to back the employment report. A strengthening economy gives the Federal Reserve more room to raise interest rates, which typically bolsters the dollar by enhancing the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Mr. Donney said that trading in the dollar had "good underlying tone." He said many traders expected the dollar to perform better "once we get through this sleepy little correction we're having."
In New York trading, the dollar settled at 107.25 yen, down from 107.75 yen on Friday. The dollar also slipped to 1.6205 German marks, down from 1.6260 marks. Meanwhile, the British pound rose in New York to $1.5220, from $1.5090 on Friday.
Silver prices also declined. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.405 an ounce, down from $4.434 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Big Banks' Goal: Higher Ratings

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Over the last few months, the Chase Manhattan Corporation has presented its 34,000 employees with a four-page pamphlet detailing the bank's mission for the turn of the century: to be world class, balanced, financially strong and big. Amid those broad goals, however, there was one strikingly concrete objective: By 1995, Chase wants to raise its credit rating to the pristine double-A. Now it is triple-B, the level just above junk bonds.
Chase is not alone in this ambitious goal. After waves of bad loans starting with the developing-country debt crisis in the mid-1980's to the real estate collapse of 1990, America's largest banks are trying to recover their financial strength. And like Chase, several other large banks have publicly set goals for raising their credit ratings. 
 When it merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in 1991, for example, the Chemical Banking Corporation said it wanted to raise its rating from triple-B to double-A by 1994. And at Citicorp's annual meeting last April, John S. Reed, the chairman, said the bank also wants to be rated double-A by 1995. Now Citicorp is rated triple-B by some credit rating agencies and single-A by others.
 
 
Pragmatic Reasons
 There are pragmatic reasons for these goals: higher-rated companies borrow money at lower interest rates. And more important for large banks like Chase, many corporations will not buy the most profitable bank services, such as interest rate swaps, from any but the highest-rated banks.
But for the large New York banks, which have been forced to cede leadership in the industry to stronger and more aggressive regional competitors, such as Nationsbank, regaining a double-A rating has important symbolic value as well.
A double-A rating "is one more measure that this place is back to good health," Thomas Jones, chief financial officer of Citicorp, said.
This sterling report card will be harder for the banks to get than they think. Over the last year, the leading rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service Inc., the Standard & Poor's Corporation and a handful of smaller competitors, have already started to upgrade the banks to single-A because they have raised capital and showed that the worst of their loan problems are behind them.
But the standard for a double-A is higher and more qualitative. "To get a single-A, an institution needs a good franchise, a clean balance sheet and to be well run." said Christopher T. Mahoney, associate director of financial institution ratings at Moody's. "To get a double-A is more difficult."
Moody's only rates four banks double-A -- the Republic New York Corporation, the Wachovia Corporation, NBD Bancorp and America's most creditworthy bank, J. P Morgan & Company. "Those are exceptional institutions that have gone through the worst banking crisis in history substantially unhurt," Mr. Mahoney said. "They are not only clean, they never got dirty."
In recognition of these difficulties, Chemical has partly backed off its initial goal of a double-A rating by next year. Now it says it wants its lead bank subsidiary, Chemical Bank, to be rated double-A and it would be content for the holding company to be rated single-A. In the United States, holding companies have lower ratings than their subsidiary banks, which are protected by Government deposit insurance.
Indeed, some banks shy away from the cost of earning a higher rating. To raise more capital, for example, a bank may have to sell so much stock that it will dilute its existing shares.
 
 
Bondholder Perspective
 "For the rating agencies, more equity capital is always better because they have the perspective of what gives the best protection to the bond holders," E. Michel Kruse, the chief financial officer of Chase, said. "For us, capital is better up to a certain point. Then it eats into shareholder return."
Because of this the big banks do not aspire to be triple-A, and many large regional banks, including BankAmerica and Nationsbank, are content with their single-A ratings.
Citibank, Chase and Chemical are more interested in a double-A rating than these other institutions because they are trying to attract business from the largest corporations and investors who are more sensitive to credit ratings than local customers. (Since bank deposits are federally insured up to $100,000, most consumers have no need to be concerned with credit ratings.)
"The nature of wholesale banking has changed radically over the last 10 years," Tanya S. Azarchs, financial institutions director with S.& P., said. Banks don't lend much money to large corporations, she said. "The money is in trading and cash management and for that you need a double-A." Cash management is a service that helps companies move their money between operations around the world and may involve very large uninsured deposits.
 
 
Derivative Products
 The most lucrative new business is the rapidly growing market for derivative products, such as swaps. These are custom-made financial contracts that help companies and investors manage their risk from financial markets. But since since banks sell derivative contracts that offer protection for as long as five years, their customers want to make sure the bank won't fail.
"Most big companies have written policies as to what banks they are allowed to enter transactions with, and a lot of them cut off at double-A," Mr. Kruse of Chase said. This has given the banks meeting this criteria, including J. P. Morgan, Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse, a substantial advantage.
In fact, before it merged with Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover calculated that it lost $100 million in pretax income from higher funding costs and lost business when it was downgraded to triple-B. And the new Chemical figures it can raise earnings by at least $150 million as a result of the upgrade to double-A, according to Peter Tobin, the company's chief financial officer.
In the late 1970's, Citicorp and Chase were both rated triple-A, but they were lowered to double-A in the early 1980's in recognition of the new competition from Wall Street and foreign banks. Along with Chemical, they fell to single-A in 1987 when they began to recognize their losses on loans to Latin American countries. And they fell to double-B in 1990, as the collapsing real estate market caused their bad loans to skyrocket. (S.& P., which was less worried about the effect of the real estate crisis on banks than Moody's, kept Citicorp at A-.)
 
 
Rate Cut Cited
 The picture began to brighten at the dawn of the Persian Gulf war in January 1991, when the Federal Reserve sharply cut short-term interest rates, which substantially increased the banks' profit margins. Since then, the banks have raised their capital ratios through retained earnings and by selling new stock. Moreover, the real estate market, while still low, has stopped its free fall, allowing the banks to begin selling off their bad loans and foreclosed properties.
Curiously, Citicorp's rating did not fall as low as that of Chemical and Chase, but rating agency analysts say it will not be upgraded as fast as the others either. While Citicorp had far more troubled real estate loans than any other bank, its credit rating was a notch higher because it had a greater diversity of earnings sources, including highly profitable foreign currency trading and retail banking in developing countries. Now the bank has not been as active raising capital as the other banks.
"Citi needs to establish some credibility" in its commitment to improving its financial position, said Robin Monro-Davies, the managing director of IBCA Ltd., a London-based bank rating agency. "Their capital is still 1.5 percentage points lower than anybody else and they are still not paying a dividend."
As the condition of the banks improves, their meetings with the rating agencies are becoming more confrontational. Some bankers openly complain that the agencies were much quicker with the downgrades than they are with upgrades.
But the agencies are unapologetic. "Most institutions think, 'If we get our financial ratios back to where they were when we were double-A, we will be double-A again,' " Mr. Mahoney of Moody's said. "That is not going to happen. The bar is getting higher."
 
 
Not All Business Is Equal
 One reason is that the large New York banks that increasingly rely on trading and other nontraditional services that are inherently less stable and thus less creditworthy than large regional banks, according to the agencies. "If you have 15 percent of the California retail banking market, no one can take that away from you," Mr. Mahoney of Moody's said. "If you have 15 percent of the foreign exchange business, anyone can take that away from you." As a result, "We see an institution such as Citi or Chase or Chemical as a natural single-A holding company," he added.
Moreover, the analysts worry that the current good times for the entire banking industry will not continue when the present wide gap between short- and long-term interest rates narrows. The traditional business of taking deposits to make loans will continue its long-term decline, as more corporations borrow money by selling securities and individuals save through mutual funds. Banks are trying to compensate by getting into these and other new businesses, and by buying other banks to cut costs and further reduce competition.
While some of these moves may make the surviving banks stronger, credit rating agencies worry that banks will make mistakes as they try to expand. "The good news is that the institutions are more diversified," Deborah J. Perry, associate director for financial institutions at Moody's, said. "And the bad news is that since this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the banks may be tempted to take extra risk."

HEADLINE: World Health Official Says AIDS Spread Could Be Controlled

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 7

 BODY:
The AIDS epidemic that is galloping through much of the world could be curtailed if known preventions measures were more widely applied and if an additional $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion a year were spent in developing countries on AIDS prevention, a World Health Organization official said here today at the ninth international AIDS meeting.
The extra money would represent an increase of about 1.5 percent over current health-care budgets in developing countries and would translate into the cost of one soft drink for every person in the world, said Dr. Michael H. Merson, who heads the W.H.O. program on AIDS. 
 The greater efforts would "save millions of lives, billions of dollars and immeasurable pain and suffering," Dr. Merson said. By the year 2000 it would be possible to cut in half the number of people who otherwise would be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, he said.
W.H.O. says 14 million people are now infected with H.I.V. Unless more drastic action is taken, the number is expected to rise to 30 million to 40 million people by the year 2000, Dr. Merson said. With the suggested increase in spending for AIDS prevention, Dr. Merson said, the number of new adult infections during the remainder of this decade would drop from 20 million to 10 million.
"Either we pay now or we pay later," Dr. Merson said.
 
Seeking Early Intervention
 Dr. Dean T. Jamison, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles and the World Bank in Washington, said the W.H.O. figures were reasonable cost estimates.
Developing countries now spend about $170 billion each year on health care. The World Bank will soon argue in its annual report for substantial increases in international aid to health, with a large share going to AIDS, Dr. Jamison said.
One main conclusion of the report is that "intervention early in an epidemic is vastly more cost effective than waiting until the epidemic is more established," Dr. Jamison said.
The World Bank concluded, however, that "the sheer magnitude of the epidemic in terms of the number of people infected or dying, either today or even a decade from now," did not give AIDS a greater claim on the health dollar than the many other diseases affecting the developing world, like heart disease and cancer.
 
Criticism of W.H.O.
 The call for increased efforts comes as the World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations, has been under intense pressure to improve its AIDS program. Hiroshi Nakajima, a Japanese doctor, was re-elected head of W.H.O. last month despite opposition from the organization's major donors over what they say is Dr. Nakajima's poor management style in AIDS and other fields.
Dr. Merson's predecessor, Dr. Jonathan Mann, resigned in 1990 as head of W.H.O.'s global AIDS program, citing differences with Dr. Nakajima, and is now a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. He and others have urged W.H.O. to apply what has been learned from pilot projects worldwide. Dr. Merson seemed to agree today, saying, "We must waste no time in scaling up the interventions that we know work."
Because the AIDS epidemic is a series of smaller epidemics, each driven by different factors and forces, there can be no single blueprint for preventing H.I.V. infection, Dr. Merson said.
He said there was a consensus about six key steps, including these:
*Promoting condom use in the general population through advertising and the involvement of pharmacists and other local merchants.
*Promoting condom use by prostitutes and their clients.
*Treating standard sexually transmitted diseases, because they can increase risk of H.I.V. infection.
*Increasing AIDS information and education in schools and through the media.
*Maintaining a safe blood supply.
*Operating needle exchange programs for people who inject drugs.
Dr. Merson cited a report by Dr. Don Des Jarlais of Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, who said at the meeting that controlling the spread of H.I.V. among intravenous drug users, once called impossible, was a realistic goal. Early intervention has prevented H.I.V. epidemics among drug users in four cities -- Glasgow, Scotland; Lund, Sweden; Sydney, Australia, and Tacoma, Wash. In those cities, H.I.V. rates among drug users have stayed below 5 percent for at least four years, Dr. Des Jarlais said.
W.H.O. estimates that investing $2.5 billion a year would save nearly $90 billion in direct and indirect costs by the year 2000 and additional savings for the 21st century, Dr. Merson said, "a return any company would be happy to achieve."
The money could come from several sources, he said, including the developing countries themselves and increased donations from the developed countries and the private sector.
 
Research on Immune System
 In another talk, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said today that scientists do not know whether an immune system damaged by H.I.V. can regenerate.
"We can't assume it will occur spontaneously," Dr. Fauci said.
Newer research has shown that there are many and overlapping phases of H.I.V. infection and that the search for therapies must take the complexities into account.
"We must dissect the various phases of H.I.V. disease to determine the feasibility of using agents that might block certain aspects of activation of H.I.V. without compounding immunosuppression" resulting from the disease, Dr. Fauci said.
One drug that deserves further study as a blocking agent at certain stages of H.I.V. is cyclosporin, which is widely used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, Dr. Fauci said. French researchers tried cyclosporin for AIDS patients in 1985 but ran into difficulties with the French health ministry, which publicized the research before trials were conducted.
Recently, German researchers studied the results of transplant patients who were infected with H.I.V. through contaminated blood transfusions or organs. In those who had not received cyclosporin, Dr. Fauci told the conference, the development of AIDS was "significantly" greater than in the group of H.I.V. infected patients who had received it.
In laboratory experiments, cyclosporin and AZT blocked H.I.V. infection for much longer periods than either drug alone.
The evidence is not there to recommend treating H.I.V.-infected people with cyclosporin, but, Dr. Fauci said, "strategies should be developed to at least determine the feasibility" of using cyclosporin and similar drugs to inhibit activation of H.I.V. without aggravating the immune suppression.

HEADLINE: Ghost Town Where Byzantines Mined Gold

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
ARCHEOLOGISTS exploring a ghost town in the remote eastern desert of Egypt have discovered the remains of what almost certainly was a major gold-mining operation for the Byzantine Empire. The stark granite cliffs surrounding the town were the source of a rich supply of the metal that gilded the icons and lavish art of early Christianity.
The site, called Bir Umm Fawakhir, should give scholars a rare look at the conditions of ordinary people in Byzantine Egypt, a poorly understood period from A.D. 330, when control of the Roman Empire shifted to Constantinople, until the Muslim conquest in A.D. 642. 
 Archeologists have generally neglected the period, concentrating instead on the temples, tombs and other splendors of the ancient Pharaohs. Historians studying Byzantine Egypt have had to rely on tax rolls, legal and religious documents, textiles, art and churches, which give a limited view of most individuals' lives.
In announcing the discovery, Dr. Carol Meyer, an archeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, said that Bir Umm Fawakhir was one of only two Byzantine villages known in Egypt, and by far the better-preserved one. The partial walls of granite cobbles are still standing, and they outline the ruins of more than 200 houses in the central village. There remain wells, streets and quarries, as well as outlying settlements, some with more than 40 structures.
Pottery fragments show that the site, about 60 miles east of Luxor, near a road between the Nile River and the Red Sea, was an active settlement of miners and other workers in the fifth and sixth centuries. Some of the designs included Christian crosses. Labels painted in red on wine jars were in Greek. One of the first words the archeologists deciphered was the Greek word for sweet, presumably referring to the quality of the wine.
The ruins lie on the hot, sandy floor of a narrow, isolated valley, a bleak and arid moonscape surrounded by steep granite cliffs. The sides of the cliffs are pitted with gold mines, usually shallow shafts or trenches following a vein of quartz containing gold.
 
Desert Settlements Full of Surprises
 Among the artifacts found in explorations last January was a granite pounding stone that had been used to crush gold-bearing quartz. Written accounts of mining practices at the time describe workers using mills to grind stone into a powder from which gold was then washed.
"It was a wonderful find," Dr. Meyer said. "The pounding stone was surrounded by chunks of white quartz that a worker had crushed and then just walked away from. It was sitting there just as it had been left more than 1,000 years ago."
The site had not been entirely unknown. The archeologists noted that looters had gone through a cemetery. Earlier travelers had left brief descriptions of the ruins, which were thought to be from the Roman period. There are remains of a Roman watch tower still standing, and some old accounts mention a Roman-period temple, which the archeologists have not identified. But scholars were surprised to find flourishing Byzantine settlements, because they had assumed, based on Byzantine accounts, that there were no large post-Roman settlements in the eastern desert, only some nomadic tribes.
The wonder is that there was any town at all in this desert, where there is no vegetation, save for some thorn bushes, and summer temperatures regularly reach 120 degrees. The Romans had dug wells that still provide water. But everything else needed to keep a community going had to be hauled in from the Nile Valley.
The implications of such a large gold-mining community are not yet clear to Egyptologists. It could be, Dr. Meyer said, that Bir Umm Fawakhir shows that the economy of Byzantine Egypt was stronger than previously thought.
"Scholars have thought that people's lives at this time were pretty miserable, because of a declining economy and an increasing tax burden," she explained. "This community shows that there must have been more economic strength, because the leaders were able to arrange for the support of a fairly large town in the desert."
 
Enormous Need for Gold
 Terence Wilfong, an Egyptologist at the Oriental Institute who accompanied the expedition, said the effort to exploit the desert gold "implies there must have been an enormous need occurring at this time." One possible reason was that insurrections and other upheavals were apparently interfering with gold mining in Nubia, the more usual and accessible source for the Egyptians.
Another reason, Mr. Wilfong suggested, was that with the rise of Constantinople as the center of Christendom came a flourishing of religious art. Egypt was one of the major sources of gold to embellish this art.
It is not yet certain, Mr. Wilfong said, whether the laborers at Bir Umm Fawakhir were slaves, prisoners, military personnel or paid workers. Documents of that time make no mention of slaves working in the mines, and the lack of enclosing walls and other preserved security artifacts would seem to indicate that no slaves or prisoners lived there.
From the preliminary survey, Dr. Meyer said, most of the houses in the settlement were two- and three-room dwellings, with some clustered to form complexes with as many as 19 rooms. Many rooms had stone benches. In future excavations, the archeologists want to sample discarded material buried beneath the floors of these houses or in the mounds of trash outside, searching for coins, bones, fabrics and other evidence of what it was like to live and toil in a gold-mining village of Byzantine Egypt.

HEADLINE: Settle Down -- and Toughen Up

 BODY:
Well, it was quite a weekend, wasn't it? The talking heads, the pollsters, the Democrats in Congress all unloaded. Call it The Weekend Everyone Gave Up on Bill Clinton.
It's worth remembering that there have been other watershed moments in the annals of Presidential haplessness. There was the time people realized that George Bush was not going to perform the Presidency that Peggy Noonan had written for him. There was the moment when we realized that all the Reagan jokes were true. "It's true hard work never killed anyone," quoth the Gipper when teased about his naps, "but I figure, why take the chance?" 
 But even if the experience of White House wobbles is not entirely new, this business with Mr. Clinton has a spooky feeling all its own. So perhaps it is time for everyone to put heads on desks and give the classroom time to settle down. Clearly, things have gotten badly out of hand. But in the respirant hush of nap time, it may also be possible to assess what's happening to the Clinton Presidency and how it might be put back on track.
First and foremost, a moment of silence might give Mr. Clinton a chance to commune with the fact that if he is going to be principal of this rowdy school, he's got to quit acting like a substitute teacher. The growing doubts about his Presidency have less to do with ideology than with leadership. It's true that the polls show that people increasingly see him as a "liberal" and not the "new Democrat" he pledged to be. But what really seems to be troubling people is that Mr. Clinton is not projecting strength. He ran as the guy who could take a little of this and a dash of that and figure out how to make things work. But instead of he being the one who makes things happen, things keep happening to him.
Whether his troubles are those he could never have predicted (the wacko stuff in Waco) or problems that are going to be there regardless (Bosnia) or campaign promises he finds difficult to keep (the middle-class tax cut) or things he might have avoided by paying more attention (the savaging of his stimulus package), there has been a pattern of random accident that is scaring people.
Sometimes complex Washington situations yield best to simple solutions. The first counsel here is to be patient, to sit among the wreckage for a while. At first, people will feel sorry. Then they will begin to suspect Mr. Clinton knows something. Then a hopeful nation will see in some modest bit of good luck the plottings of a renascent political genius.
But Mr. Clinton has to slow the accident rate enough for this to happen. Toward that end, in all seriousness, it is time to get a staff that is more gifted at damage control than damage creation.
It may be that everyone around Mr. Clinton is full of wit and virtue. The point is that the nation does not think they know what they're doing. It is time to bring on the gray eminences, and it would not hurt for them to be Democrats -- new ones, old ones, whatever -- but Democrats, just to indulge the voters who thought they were kicking out the Republicans for good cause.
Once that happens, Mr. Clinton could listen to the Congressional Democrats who say the town meeting has become a quagmire. The format projects Mr. Clinton as a man with a channel-surfing mentality, who can talk knowingly about a hundred things when he ought to be talking powerfully about one or two things.
One thing to talk about is getting the economic program through the Senate. Then it would be about time to show the country what his health care reform looks like. If the Task Force is not ready -- well, Washington is a big town. It is full of experts who could probably turn out something pretty credible on a crash basis.
All this assumes Mr. Clinton realizes that while he may prefer conciliation to conflict, Congress does not. Deep in their hearts, senators and representatives believe in threats, bullying and revenge. The question is whether the President is going to do it to them or they to him.
Bill Clinton is smart enough to know that this crisis is more about him than his policies. "This is about my center, not about the political center," he said the other day. The question is whether he is tough enough to act on what he knows. Only a month or so ago, for example, Mr. Clinton, struggling even then, conceded publicly that his problem was a lack of "focus." But this honest self-analysis did not produce focus.
How urgent is it that Mr. Clinton settle down and toughen up? He has lots of time to accomplish a transformation, but probably very little to get one started. What is now an aura of disorganization will begin condensing soon into immutable political reality. From Mr. Clinton's point of view, it is not exactly time to panic. But no reasonable person would want it to get any worse.

HEADLINE: What Makes Energy Tax Scary

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Bipartisan Disservice" (editorial, May 21), on the proposals by Senators David Boren, Oklahoma Democrat, and John Danforth, Missouri Republican, to cut taxes and spending from President Clinton's proposed budget, was not clearly thought out where you touch on the Administration's plan to tax energy by British Thermal Units used.
You maintain that the Clinton-backed energy tax hurts oil-producing states like Oklahoma and Louisiana, and that the Boren-Danforth approach would shift the burden from South to North. 
 The reduction of Federal welfare outlays proposed by Southern oil-state senators would harm large urban areas, as you point out, but these are not all in the North. And how do you explain that senators from Maine and Missouri support the proposals? These are not oil-producing states, and Maine is way up North.
You say a general energy tax is "hardly terrifying." It certainly terrifies all industries that are large fuel consumers. Steel producers might as well shut down most of their plants. (The aluminum and airline industries, thanks to their fine lobbyists, have squiggled out of this one.) Equally disadvantaged will be those United States exporters for whom transportation forms a large percentage of their f.o.b. (free on board export ship) costs, such as rice, grain and coal producers. Our trade balance will get even worse.
The public is not yet terrified of the B.T.U. energy tax because it has not been told the truth. The truth is that this tax would affect all of us intimately, in our jobs and in our kitchens and bathrooms; it will drive up inflation, and the poor will be hurt most. It terrifies me.
If, after cutting Government waste, we really need to raise more money from fuel, a gasoline (not diesel) tax at the pump would produce none of the above ills. It would curb undesirable atmospheric emissions, reduce road accidents and congestion, and give public transport a needed boost. It would not hurt the transportation of goods by air, road, rail or water. Thus our economy would remain competitive.

HEADLINE: Answer: A Value-Added Tax

BYLINE: By Lester C. Thurow; Lester C. Thurow is dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Equity or efficiency arguments can be made for each of President Clinton's tax proposals. But there are also legitimate problems with each of them.
Opening up a large gap between the maximum personal income tax rate (a proposed 40 percent) and capital gains tax rate (28 percent) creates an enormous incentive to get back into the loophole business. 
 While no one likes to pay taxes, all tax increases are not created equal. Each vested interest opposing the President could probably agree on one thing. They would rather see a general value-added tax (commonly called VAT) than the tax President Clinton has proposed for their sector.
The President should propose a VAT large enough to replace the current corporate income tax and Federal payroll taxes, like those for Social Security and Medicare, for both the employer and the employee, and also large enough to raise whatever is desired for deficit reduction and additional health care spending (if that is required). Social Security benefits would still be determined by earnings, but the taxes to pay for them would be collected when individuals spent their money, not when they earned it.
Here's how the VAT would work: It would collect revenue based on the difference between the selling price of a product and the price of components purchased from other suppliers. To make the tax progressive, the first $4,000 in personal spending should be exempted, giving a family of three a $12,000 exemption. The tax payments on this $12,000 would be returned through lower withholding payments or an end-of-year refund.
With the additional exemption of state and local government purchases, a 14 percent VAT would raise enough revenue to replace the corporate income and payroll taxes. For every $42 billion needed in additional revenue, the VAT rate would need to go up by 1 percentage point. Fifteen to 25 percent VAT's are common in Western Europe.
Getting rid of the corporate income and payroll taxes would create a huge incentive to invest in plant and equipment and add employees. Capital and labor would be much cheaper to employ. Exports would go up and imports down. Payroll and corporate income taxes wouldn't have to be built into the prices of U.S. products, and VAT payments could be rebated on exports and collected on imports. The President desperately needs an economic stimulus program, and this would give him one without having to make the deficit worse.
To have a world-class future standard of living, Americans must build a tax system with strong incentives to shift spending from consumption to investment. The VAT offers broad incentives to reduce consumption; it is not focused just on one sector. It creates jobs. It is a way to tax the underground economy: Drug dealers never pay income taxes, but they would pay a VAT when they spend money. The high-income elderly can be taxed on consumption, making it unnecessary to impose higher income taxes on their Social Security benefits.
Traditionally, liberals have objected to the value-added tax on the ground that such consumption taxes bear more heavily on low-income families, who have to spend a larger proportion of their income. But by replacing the payroll tax and adopting a $4,000 personal exemption, a VAT lowers tax burdens at the bottom.
Conservatives have objected to VAT on the ground that it is too "good" a revenue collector and would encourage Government liberals to spend. But from their perspective, a VAT is much better than what the President proposes. Maximum income tax rates would not have to be increased. It is a good conservative principle that individuals should pay taxes based on what they take out of society (consumption), not on what they put in (the income they earn from work or investments).
Political experts have proclaimed the VAT unpassable, but that judgment was made when large, more onerous tax increases weren't on the political agenda. I suspect that now that President Clinton has softened Congress up, he might find it easier to get a value-added tax approved by talking about removing two horrible taxes, the corporate income and payroll taxes, than he would to get his current tax proposals enacted.

HEADLINE: Cost Cutters Shouldn't Target Elderly Widows

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your longstanding commitment to defending the rights of those without access to political power deserves the commendation of all of society. In editorials and columns, your newspaper has championed women, minorities, the less affluent and the disadvantaged. However, a group that is overwhelmingly composed of older women, many of them members of minority ethnic elements, is being subjected to unfair treatment by the Federal Government. I refer to the future survivors, almost all widows, of retired Federal employees. 
 Budget resolutions from both houses of Congress will change the method of calculating survivor benefits so that future survivors will suffer a reduction of almost 10 percent in their annuities. The survivor benefit is not a magnanimous freebie, but is bought and paid for by each retiree who elects to suffer a 10 percent decrease in pension income for as long as he or she lives to provide for the surviving spouse.
The average survivor benefit is no more than $13,000 a year, so this reduction will cause real hardship.
It is difficult to conceive of a more ill-advised attempt to cure the country's economic ills than by penalizing elderly widows. Is any other group so vulnerable and yet so severely dealt with by the budgetary powers? Your voice and that of others dedicated to ethical threatment for all should be heard on behalf of a group that needs support.

HEADLINE: What Makes Energy Tax Scary;
It Will Create Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There are at least two aspects of the energy, or British Thermal Unit, tax that seem to be missing in the debates on the subject:
(1) The tax will create jobs, rather than lose them and will not necessarily lead to inflation because, as it becomes economically disadvantageous to waste energy, we will insulate our homes better. Then, reduced energy consumption will reduce pollution and the needs for extensive and expensive emission controls. Also, we will build, rather than merely talk about, high-speed rail lines in high-density traffic corridors. Insulating homes, building tracks and railroad cars will provide new jobs. Jobs come and go: we now produce very few horse-drawn carriages, full-fashioned stockings or vacuum tubes. 
 (2) The tax need not be regressive if graduated tax credits or rebates are given to those with correspondingly low incomes.

HEADLINE: When Americans Are No Longer No. 1

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "New Tally of World's Economies Catapults China Into Third Place" (front page, May 20): In proposing to abandon measuring the size of national economies by current exchange rates in preference for purchasing power equivalents, the International Monetary Fund replaces one imperfect method with another. 
 The first reflects a country's international purchasing power, a reality experienced daily by American tourists ordering a coffee in, say, Italy or Japan, and experienced even more harshly by poor African countries when the dollar-denominated price of oil goes up. The second method, as its name suggests, measures equivalent domestic purchasing power and is therefore much less affected by wildly fluctuating changes in currency values -- but also disguises the fact that, when, say, the dollar loses value, the United States does indeed suffer a decline in its international purchasing power.
Surely, it is preferable for agencies like the I.M.F. to publish both measures, and not just for comparative gross national products, but also for labor productivity rates, the "human development index," and so on, since the selection of one method over the other can radically alter the lists -- as in China's promotion from 10th to third place in national economies, according to the new I.M.F. measure.
Finally, if North American economists abandon exchange-rate measurements, they ought not to be surprised if others decline to follow suit. During a recent visit to Japan, I was asked by some distinguished business editors: "Why is the Clinton Administration trying to force a rise in the value of the yen? Doesn't it realize that if Japan steadily revalues to, say, 80 yen to the dollar, we will possess the biggest economy in the world? What will the Americans do when they are no longer No. 1?"
My reply that such a fact would be disguised from Americans because we would measure national economies solely through purchasing power equivalents brought bewilderment to the editors. Are we creating here yet another example of how different countries will look at things in different ways?

HEADLINE: Haiti's Premier Quits After Four Ministers Refuse to Step Down

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Marc Bazin resigned today, saying that the refusal of four ministers to step down after their dismissal had made governing impossible.
Mr. Bazin, appointed by the ruling military nine months after the coup that overthrew the the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said the actions of the four ministers gave him no choice. 
"A change in the Government is necessary on account of the pressure and threats made against personalities that I have chosen to be part of my new team," his resignation letter said. "I was in an impossible position."
[Father Aristide, in Managua for a meeting of the Organization of American States, told The Associated Press that Mr. Bazin's resignation might mean he could return to his country within days.]
The ministers of Finance, Commerce, Information and Public Works were dismissed on Friday but announced on Monday that they would not leave their posts, saying that would breach an agreement signed last year to form a "consensus" government of anti-Aristide politicians.
The military high command met today to discuss the matter, but made no public statement. The Senate met and called upon Mr. Bazin to remain in office as a caretaker until he can be replaced.
Joseph Nerette, who was named provisional President after the coup that toppled Father Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991, declared he was ready to take the reins again. The Supreme Court president, Emile Jonnaissant, 80, was also mentioned as another possible replacement.
Mr. Bazin has come under increasing pressure in recent days as negotiations aimed at returning Father Aristide broke down and the Clinton Administration froze the assets of many said to have been involved with the coup.
Mr. Bazin is blamed by many for the rapidly deteriorating state of the country's economy. Some 300 demonstrators voiced their opposition to the former World Bank official in downtown Port-au-Prince on Monday.

HEADLINE: Angelenos Vote A Conservative As New Mayor

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8

 BODY:
Richard Riordan, a conservative businessman, was elected Mayor of Los Angeles tonight, ushering in a new political era after the 20-year leadership of Tom Bradley and his coalition of blacks and white liberals.
Mr. Riordan, 62, defeated Michael Woo, a liberal City Councilman, in a hard-fought, nonpartisan race in which personal attacks drowned out serious debate over the future of this city as it struggles with its evolving multi-ethnic identity and with the aftermath of last year's riots. 
 "I think it's great," Mr. Riordan exclaimed as he watched the returns this evening. Mr. Woo conceded defeat late tonight as the vote stood with Mr. Riordan ahead 54 percent to 46 percent.
Mr. Riordan's victory came despite the endorsement of Mr. Woo by President Clinton, who visited Los Angeles shortly after traveling to Texas where his separate endorsement also failed to help a Democratic Senatorial candidate, Bob Krueger, in a race won by Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a Republican.
Mr. Riordan, the first Republican Mayor in more than 30 years for this largely Democratic, liberal city, has his electoral base in the San Fernando Valley, a predominantly white area. His election comes at a time when minorities, particularly the fast-growing Hispanic community that makes up about 40 percent of the population, is beginning to exercise greater political muscle.
Though about two-thirds of the city's population is now made up of members of minority groups, more than two-thirds of voters are white.
The main issues in the campaign were public safety and the economy, and Mr. Riordan's most striking pledge was to lease Los Angeles International Airport and privatize some city services to pay for more police.
He pledged to convene on his first day in office, on July 1, the heads of various law enforcement agencies to find ways to put more police officers on the streets immediately.
These public-safety concerns reflect in part the new realities of Los Angeles, particularly the concerns of the white community, following the 1992 riots, which infused the city with a new sense of insecurity.
In a televised debate Monday night on the eve of the vote, Mr. Riordan described his vision like this: "When I leave as Mayor, I want the city to be clean and safe. I want children to be educated so they have the skills to compete in our society. I want the environment to be clean, and I want every citizen of L.A. to be proud to be an Angeleno."
Although he has never held elective office, Mr. Riordan, a self-made millionaire, philanthropist and lawyer, has for a long time been a power broker in Los Angeles. A self-described "rescuer" who has helped restructure ailing companies, he campaigned under the slogan "Tough Enough to Turn L.A. Around."
He has campaigned as an outsider, and his placards imitate those of Ross Perot with their blue lettering and red star. But he has served on government commissions and has been a major contributor to most of California's major politicians, both Republicans and Democrats.
He poured $6 million of his own money into the campaign, flooding the city with advertisements and glossy, carefully targeted mailers to emerge from relative obscurity to lead a field of 24 candidates, along with Mr. Woo, in last April's first round of voting.
Unaccustomed to the limelight, Mr. Riordan has appeared somewhat awkward on the stump and often fumbled his words in three televised debates with Mr. Woo, an articulate, rapid-fire debater who attacked him with almost every sentence.
Mr. Riordan voiced relief today that the bruising campaign was over. "We won't tolerate that kind of campaigning," he said as he awaited the results of the vote. "I think it's so bad it discourages anybody from running. You need somebody to be as tough, maybe a little crazy, as I am to withstand it."

HEADLINE: Immigrants Both Renew and Unsettle Chinatown

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The elderly man, influential and well known in Chinatown, stood in the front room of his office on Mott Street and hovered between the desire for full disclosure and the need for discretion.
He talked about illegal immigrants, like the ones who came ashore in Queens on Sunday morning. He worried that they faced years of misery and hardship here, that they would contribute to a loss of control in the community, a lessening of the influence of the old guard. Some of them, he said, would inevitably be tempted by gang membership, already a growing problem in Chinatown. 
 It was his mention of gangs that made him not want to talk anymore.
"People are scared," he said.
"Who knows who's behind this, what kind of international gang?" he continued, alluding to the smugglers of the latest illegal immigrants from Fujian Province who are now in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "I get my name in the newspaper. Is the Government going to protect me? Tomorrow I'm not here. For what?"
 
A Web of Emotions
 The mood in Chinatown after a ship carrying nearly 300 illegal immigrants went aground off Queens on Sunday was mixed and complicated, just as Chinatown itself has become in the last several years.
Unease was easy to detect. There was sorrow too, especially for the six people who died trying to swim ashore from the grounded freighter. They were, after all, only trying to do what many thousands who now live in Chinatown have done before them -- start a new life in America.
Above all, perhaps, there was a tip-of-the-iceberg feeling, a pervasive belief that the spectacularly failed arrival of nearly 300 illegal immigrants on Sunday was only a small part of a broader pattern. It was a reflection of the fact that this colorful part of New York has been going through rapid and sometimes unsettling change.
"The history of Chinatown in less than 25 words?" said David S. Chen, the executive director of the Chinatown Planning Council, a state-financed agency that provides social services to many new immigrants. "Growth, complexity, more complexity and diversity."
 
On the Surface
 To the average outsider who comes for the occasional meal, Chinatown has an entirely deceptive simplicity as the place of Chinese culture in New York, the home to thousands of little shops with exotic signs and restaurants. Chinatown is the place of storefront Buddhist Temples, martial arts parlors and dozens of associations -- often grouped by surnames like the Li Family Association and the Eng Family Association -- that typify the extended welfare systems of traditional Chinese life.
But beneath the surface, Chinatown is, and always has been, a place in constant flux. More than anything else, Chinatown has long been a kind of transit center, the place where Chinese immigrants -- especially those with little money, no English and not much formal education -- come first, before making some money and moving away, to be replaced by new arrivals.
"Nobody wants to stay in Chinatown," said Simon Wong, a reporter for The United Daily News, a Chinese language daily. "But even though people leave, Chinatown continues to expand because the numbers of new immigrants, both legal and not, are so high."
Before American immigration laws were changed in 1965, total immigration may have been a hundred or so people a year. Now, China and Taiwan each have quotas of 20,000 legal immigrants a year. Hong Kong is allowed to send 5,000. Many of these immigrants come first to New York with a result that the overall Chinese population in New York, perhaps 70,000 or so in the mid-1960's, has soared to more than 500,000 today. And that is just legal immigration. "The numbers are astonishing," said Mr. Chen of the Planning Council.
 
Emerging Chinatowns
 Given that growth, it is not surprising that several Chinatowns have emerged in lower Manhattan and several others in Queens and Brooklyn.
One of the several Chinatowns is the older, more established place, the original Chinatown of before World War II, which was largely settled by people from a single Chinese county, Tay Shan, in southern Guangdong Province. This is the Chinatown west of the Bowery and south of Canal Street, relatively posh and glittery, the tourist attraction and gourmet center, where venerable institutions like the Chinese Benevolent Association, an umbrella group for some 70 social services agencies and family associations, still wield influence.
"Of course we feel sorry for the ones who died," said Victor Loui, the secretary of the association, speaking of the events over the weekend. But, Mr. Loui allowed, there were some feelings of resentment mingling with the sorrow among the older Chinatown residents. The new arrivals, he said, are reputed to work for such low wages that they drive down the wages of others.
"And then, they have to pay off big debts," Mr. Loui said. "And when the smugglers who brought them here want their money, some of them are forced into something illegal, women as prostitutes for example. Some of the men maybe will be forced to rob or whatever. Because if they don't get enough money to pay the smugglers, they can be beaten or even killed."
Another Chinatown is farther to the east, a spill-over Chinatown on the other side of the Bowery, a bit rougher, more unkempt, more Wild West than the older quarter of Mott Street.
 
Places for New Arrivals
 There in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge are a few dingy storefronts with names like Hong Kong Employment Agency and Asia Employment Agency, which everybody in Chinatown knows as the gathering places for new arrivals.
Every day, the men stand three or four deep in airless rooms beneath strips of fluorescent light bulbs trying to push to the counter where female agents have job openings at $3 an hour in the back rooms of restaurants and in garment factories.
It is widely believed in Chinatown that Fujian, a coastal province across a narrow strait from Taiwan, is probably the source of more Chinese immigrants, especially illegal ones, than any other region. Nobody seems to know how many there are in New York, or how many came legally, but among other residents of Chinatown the Fujianese have a reputation.
"They are very tough and they work very hard," said Mr. Wong of The United Daily News. What he did not say, but what is commonly believed is that there are whole new networks of Fujianese associations that operate parallel to the older Cantonese establishment of Chinatown. The Fujianese are also seen as the most likely recruits for underground groups.
The Fujianese are in a sense at the bottom of the complicated social and economic ladder of Chinatown. At the top are earlier immigrants who have made fortunes or who are highly educated professionals who came to the United States from Taiwan and Hong Kong to earn degrees from Harvard and Yale and who do not so much live in Chinatown as visit the district for the marriage of a daughter or to shop or to see their lawyers.
"There are the ones who come by plane," said Mr. Chen of the Chinatown Planning Council, "and those who wade ashore."
 
No Single Pattern
 There is no single pattern, no easy generalization about the lives they lead after they come to this country, Mr. Wong said. A number of them, unable to pay their debts, end up in the criminal underground. Some end up murdered. More commonly, they work very hard for several years, living several to a room, spending very little money, saving what they can, until they can start a small business of their own, sometimes in Chinatown, often in the suburbs or out of state.
Directly beneath the Manhattan Bridge on East Broadway is the Rong Cheng (Glorious City) Flower Shop, whose owner is said to represent a success story among recent immigrants from Fujian, supplying bouquets for wedding parties and other celebrations. One assistant inside the tiny, narrow shop, gave his name simply as Lin and said he regretted coming to the United States, which he did about one year ago from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province.
"Life is hard here," he said, speaking in Mandarin Chinese. "America is not a good place."
But a visitor to the shop, who gave his name as Tony, seemed to be a success story. Tony, who was dressed in Banana Republic khaki, said he came from Fujian 10 years ago and at first worked in a garment factory. Now he has interests in a restaurant and a factory.
"I'm happy," he said. "I got a business. I made some money."

HEADLINE: Nonbanks' Community Role Will Be Target of U.S. Study

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The Treasury Department is planning to study whether money market funds, consumer finance companies and automobile financing companies should be required to follow the Community Reinvestment Act, which calls on financial institutions to lend money to poor communities, a senior Treasury official said today.
Frank N. Newman, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, said that as nonbanking institutions like money market funds play a larger role in the economy, it was important to determine what their "community responsibilities" should be. 
 "We're talking about a substantial amount of funds" being moved from banks and thrift institutions to money market funds, Mr. Newman said. "We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars."
Some day, Mr. Newman said, money market funds and other nonbank institutions might become so powerful in some communities that they could drive local banks out of business, thus denying those communities a main source of loans.
The nation's banks and savings and loans welcomed the study. These financial institutions often complain that it is unfair that they have to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act when many of their nonbank competitors do not.
"The banking industry is out there alone carrying the social agenda of America's lending institutions," said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, which has 6,000 member banks. "But we are controlling a smaller and smaller share of the deposits."
Joann Barefoot, a banking consultant in Columbus, Ohio, said, "The market increasingly is being taken by nonbanking entities, both on the credit and deposit side. If the banks are the only ones who have to follow the Community Reinvestment Act, we're going to have a shrinking share of the market place covered by the act."
But the study was worrisome to companies that specialize in money market funds, automobile loans and consumer finance. Several officials from these industries said the decision to carry out the study showed the prejudices of Mr. Newman, a veteran of the banking industry who used to be vice chairman and chief financial officer of the BankAmerica Corporation, the California-based banking company.
 
 
Housing Loans Cited
 Officials from money market firms said they were unsure how the Community Reinvestment Act could be applied to them, noting that money market firms do not usually make housing loans. Several banking experts said that these money market firms might, for instance, be required to invest some of their money in community development banks that aim to help low-income and moderate-income communities.
"I don't know what it means for us," Diane Coffey, a spokeswoman for the Dreyfus Corporation, said. "Our money funds do not do this kind of thing right now. We're not structured to do it, but obviously we will examine it."
Some officials also suggested that it would be unfair to require them to adhere to the act because unlike banks and savings institutions, they do not benefit from deposit insurance.
The Community Reinvestment Act states that a financial institution has an obligation to meet the credit needs of its community, including low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods.
Mr. Newman said he had not yet concluded whether nonbank industries should be required to adhere to the act. He noted that he did not know what requirements might be placed on money market firms and other industries being studied.
"You could make the argument that it's the private sector, and if the Government wants to steer funds into a particular community, the Government ought to do it itself," Mr. Newman said. "Or you could argue that the flow of funds through the economy is fundamental to opportunities for development," and that the Government should make sure that these funds are made available to needy communities.
He said that whatever he ultimately decided, he did not want to place undue burdens on any of the industries to be studied.
Under the Community Reinvestment Act, when a bank or savings institution does business in one city, it is deemed to have lending obligations to that city. But, banking experts said, when a corporation like Fidelity Investments draws money from around the nation, it is not clear what obligations such concerns should have to communities around the nation.
 
 
New Legislation
 Several banking experts said that the Administration would need new legislation to require money market firms, consumer finance companies and other nonbank institutions to comply with the act.
Banking experts noted one peculiarity in Mr. Newman's study: it would look at consumer finance companies, which often make loans to poor communities shunned by most banks.
But Richard Ferlauto, a community development expert at the Center for Policy Alternatives, said, these companies often make loans in poor communities at much higher interest rates than in other communities. He suggested that this would be a violation of the Community Reinvestment Act if such concerns were brought under the act.

HEADLINE: Housing Agency's Problems Deepen As U.S. Rescue Effort Proves Futile

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 8

 BODY:
A year ago, the Bush Administration announced at a news conference that it was taking control of this city's troubled public housing agency, the nation's fourth largest. The Federal officials promised to transform the agency into a model of efficiency and provide a national blueprint for rehabilitating other distressed urban housing agencies.
But the rescue mission was, by all accounts, ill conceived and a failure. And late last month the Clinton Administration quietly returned the agency's management to local authorities -- even though it was in even worse shape by many measures than it was before the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development intervened. 
 In 12 months of Federal management, the vacancy rate, already embarrassing, increased from 22 percent to 24 percent of the agency's 22,000 units. Maintenance work has slowed, the amount of unpaid rent has increased, construction projects have been postponed and the agency's cash reserve has fallen from $6 million to $1 million.
 
Action but No Plan
 Of the agency's 79 top jobs, 60, including that of executive director, are either vacant or held by interim officials. Meanwhile, the waiting list for apartments is growing steadily -- and now exceeds 8,000 families.
Housing experts said the reorganization failed because Federal officials never really had a plan at all. "Neither H.U.D. nor anybody else had a fully developed plan for the agency," said David Gilmore, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Authority.
Mr. Gilmore examined Philadelphia's problems last year, when the Housing Department sought to hire him as executive director of the agency here. He declined, he said, because the agency was prohibited from offering a multiyear contract.
Instead of making improvements, most public housing experts here say, Federal managers simply let most services deteriorate. The results can be seen clearly at the Mill Creek Housing Development -- three 16-story beige brick buildings and several blocks of two-story row houses in a downtrodden section of West Philadelphia where there is more broken glass than grass.
 
Complaints Go Unheeded
 Balconies on the high-rise buildings are enclosed with chain link fence, and razor wire covers first-floor windows. The floors are unadorned cement, the walls are painted cement blocks and as in nearly all public spaces in the building, there is an overpowering stench of urine. The elevators rattle and continually break down, tenants say.
Brenda Barr, 25 years old, lives with her boyfriend, Vince Dennis, 29, and her three small children on the seventh floor of one high-rise. There is one working fluorescent lamp in the narrow public hallway, and live electric wires dangle below a second, broken fixture. In Ms. Barr's apartment, the dingy yellow walls have not been painted in at least four years, and her repeated complaints about a bathroom leak have gone unheeded.
Ms. Barr, who subsists on a monthly welfare check of $316 and pays $197 a month for her two-bedroom apartment, had nothing good to say about the Federal managers who ran her housing development. "They didn't do nothing here," she said.
Two of the four apartments on the seventh floor have been vacant for almost a year. Ms. Barr said that she had complained about drug addicts' using the vacant apartments and that it had taken workers six weeks to board up the empty units.
 
A Matter of Politics
 Although the Housing Department can take over any local housing authority it subsidizes, Federal officials have taken partial or full control of only six housing authorities in the last 25 years.
The impetus for the takeover of the Philadelphia Housing Authority seemed to be more politics than a particular crisis. The Housing Department announced its plan on May 21, 1992, just a week before hearings by the House Subcommittee on Employment Housing and Aviation on contentionsthat the agency had been lax in overseeing the housing authorities here and in Washington.
The subcommittee hearings raised serious questions and offered some disturbing answers about how the Housing Department managed its $6.2 billion-a-year public housing program. Agency officials defended the department at the hearings, saying among other things that the agency had an obsolete data collection system and that the department did not have a large enough staff to handle the work with the 3,100 public housing agencies across the country.
One paradox of the Government's failure in its takeover of the Philadelphia agency is that even Federal officials were unable to make a local housing agency operate efficiently under cumbersome Federal regulations. Federal officials, for example, failed to meet deadlines for submitting a grant application and, as a result, lost $50 million for renovating units here.
"If ever there was a bureaucracy of the highest order producing nothing, it's H.U.D.," said Elton Jolly, an experienced administrator who was appointed by the Housing Department to reorganize the housing agency here. Mr. Jolly, who had no previous experience in public housing administration, is now serving as the agency's interim executive director until the position is filled.
The Housing Department, which provides nearly two-thirds of the Philadelphia agency's annual budget of $150 million, justified the takeover by saying that 13 years of audits showed rampant Democratic patronage, corruption and flagrant mismanagement.
Those audits dating back to the 1970's found that Philadelphia's housing agency was a dumping ground for incompetent and often corrupt political appointees. The agency, for example, received more than $1 million in Federal subsidies for operating nonexistent apartments and its 627 maintenance workers were able to make basic repairs to only 25 apartments a year.
In mid-May, nine former agency employees, including the former director of maintenance, were indicted in Federal court here on charges that they had received illegal payments totaling $535,000 from six contractors, who were also indicted. Nearly all are expected to plead guilty.
Michael A. Smerconish, the Housing Department's former regional director here who began the reorganization effort and oversaw it for nine months, acknowledges that it failed because of poor planning, among other things.
"Our shortcoming was in the fact that we focused exclusively on personnel, and to focus too much on that was to fail at everything," he said. "But I think it was an insurmountable task, given the limited resources we had to address the problem and institutional resistance to change from both H.U.D. and the Philadelphia housing authority."
Under Mr. Smerconish's direction, the city agency sought to replace most of its 1,700 workers, nearly all of them political appointees without civil service protection. "I prioritized personnel over the delivery of services because if I had focused on services, it would have been undermined by an incompetent staff," he said.
But Mr. Smerconish's hiring plan ran into major political problems, when the agency's executive search firm recommended replacing many black managers with white ones. Tenant groups protested and ultimately, the agency put a freeze on new hiring.
 
Concern in Congress
 Officials in the Bush Administration say the reorganization could have worked, but it was not given a chance. Bill Dal Col, the chief of staff to former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, said, "If the plan is deemed a failure, it should not have been turned over until it was corrected."
Housing officials in the Clinton Administration have said little about the Bush Administration's initiative here and why they ended it. Terrence R. Duvernay, Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said in a recent interview, "I will personally go to Philadelphia to review where we are and make recommendations for how we address the problem."
Members of Congress say they will ask the Housing Department for complete review of the Philadelphia takeover. Representative Collin C. Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment, Housing and Aviation, said his panel was "concerned that H.U.D. is returning the agency without fixing any of the problems we identified last year."
The failure of the Federal takeover came as a great disappointment to many tenants. "I had truly hoped that things would be better when H.U.D. took over, but everything's worse," said Nancy Carroll, a tenant leader in northwest Philadelphia.
With the Federal managers gone, the housing authority's Board of Commissioners has regained control of the agency, picking up where they left off a year ago in apparent disarray. The board has four political appointees, who chose a tenant representative as its fifth member.
Peggy Jones, the tenant representative on the board, said of her colleagues, "The four knuckleheads on the board don't know what they want to do about anything."

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Backs Military Spending the Pentagon Never Sought

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
A Senate committee followed the House today in approving $1.2 billion in military spending that the Pentagon had not asked for.
With no extended argument or questioning, the Appropriations Committee sent to the Senate floor a measure that also includes $400 million of the $19.3 billion in economic-stimulus spending President Clinton asked for last winter. 
The committee heeded the standard admonition of its chairman, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, to "refrain from offering controversial amendments," and no challenges were offered to any important provision.
But two other Democrats, Senators Frank J. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said they would fight the additional Pentagon spending when the $1.9 billion catchall appropriations bill is considered by the full Senate.
Mr. Lautenberg contended that the military spending would add to the deficit even though neither the Administration nor the Pentagon requested it. But Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who heads the defense appropriations subcommittee, announced, "I'll discuss this with Senator Lautenberg later."
Mr. Inouye broke down the spending, saying $750 million would go toward relief efforts in Somalia, $295 million for health insurance costs, $100 million for Air Force operations over Iraq, $71.6 million for repairing storm-damaged Marine bases, $23 million for aid to Kurds in Northern Iraq and $10 million for "higher education in the international arena."
 
Pentagon Has Other Plans
 The Pentagon told Congress it could meet the $750 million in spending for Somalia by transferring money from other programs, but some senators said they had not been aware of the position.
The House Appropriations Committee had been irritated by the Pentagon's plan, which called for forgoing $274 million worth of new executive jets and small transports, largely for use by the National Guard and reserve forces. The planes are built in many states, including Mr. Byrd's West Virginia, and Congress usually increases such Pentagon requests.
When the measure was before the House last month, the Clinton Administration called for its passage, though it did not mention the Pentagon money at all. Instead it cited money for Small Business Administration loans, a part of the President's stimulus package, as a reason for supporting the bill. But today the Senate committee voted no money for the loans while keeping the Pentagon money intact.
Today, Dee Dee Myers, President Clinton's spokeswoman, said she was not familiar with the bill or the justification for the Pentagon spending.
Barry Toiv, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said tonight that it was essential that the Somalia operation be paid for. He said: "We would have preferred that it be done the way the Administration proposed. However, Congress wants to do it differently."

HEADLINE: The Woman in Command in Warsaw

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 8

 BODY:
In a country where women are reverentially greeted by men with a kiss on the hand, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka has surprised most Poles, and perhaps even herself, by surviving for the last year as a popular national leader through tough economic and political times.
Her Government fell nearly two weeks ago after losing by one vote a no-confidence motion called to protest her tight budget. But Ms. Suchocka stays as Prime Minister until September elections, which she could win, and in an interview on Monday she showed in her firm yet cautious manner how a woman has succeeded in a position of power in such a male-dominated society. 
 Displaying little of the combativeness of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to whom she is often compared and of whom she keeps a framed photo in her office, Ms. Suchocka, 47, said she would continue to run the country in a way that pleased the Western financial institutions.
"While I am still in office, that is sure," she said, underscoring the importance of recently concluded agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 
Disappointed by Community
 And she will continue to press the European Community for faster acceptance of Poland into its markets and political forums. So far, she said, she is disappointed by the community's foot-dragging.
"I sent a letter to the 12 chiefs of the European states and I described what Poland expects from the European countries," she said, speaking in Polish in her office furnished with gleaming reproductions of Biedermeier furniture. "What's important now are new forms of aid. Not only the technical aid that was accorded to us four years ago."
At the same time that Ms. Suchocka (pronounced sue-HUT-skuh) is eager to push Poland into the Western European embrace, she must also watch Poland's eastern flank with the former Soviet Union, where she said she was concerned about the "extremely difficult economic situation."
The West, she said, has not found the right way to help the former Soviet Union. "Just giving credits, just giving money does not solve the problem," she said. "What's more it can even increase tensions between Russia and the former Soviet states and all this creates very complicated problems."
 
Balkan War 'a Lesson'
 Ms. Suchocka said it was not a matter of Washington's being more aggressive in granting aid but rather "finding more effective forms of aid." Otherwise, she said, conflicts like those in the former Yugoslavia could break out in the former Soviet Union.
"It must be seen as a lesson," she said of the Balkan war. "We must have certain means and ways of resolving the problem before it breaks out."
A constitutional lawyer with a reputation as a conciliator, Ms. Suchocka was chosen as a dark horse prime ministerial candidate last July when her predecessor, overwhelmed by political bickering, was unable to form a Cabinet.
Few people outside Parliament had heard of her and even she confessed later that she was shocked at being asked.
She was immediately confronted with industrial strikes. By standing firm, she eventually prevailed, setting the stage for international financial agreements that had previously eluded Poland. She has often said Polish workers must learn that losing a dismally paid job in a state company should provide a challenge of finding more satisfying work at a better salary.
 
Opposed to Abortion
 Ms. Suchocka is a social as well as a fiscal conservative. She has never married, and her single status makes some educated Polish women with families believe she is too far removed from social issues to fully comprehend the economic difficulties of impoverished families.
Further, these women assert, she might not hold such conservative views on abortion if she had seen more of everyday life in the cramped housing of Poland's cities. She is a practicing Roman Catholic -- more than 90 percent of Poles belong to the Catholic Church -- and she holds firmly to the church's views on abortion.
She voted for a bill this year that forbids abortion except when a mother's life is threatened or when in the first three months of pregnancy the fetus is found to be defective. She voted against her own party's amendments that made some exceptions.
But on Monday, Ms. Suchocka suggested that it would be best if the church, which in the post-Communist era has gone so far as to promote some political candidates, stayed out of the nitty-gritty of the coming elections.
"I hope that the church will be restrained in these elections in involving itself in the support of political parties," she said.
 
High Popularity Ratings
 But it is not yet clear which tack the church will take.
"There is a searching of a place for the church in the new social and political conditions," she said, adding that the behavior of the church in the September elections would be important for its future role.
While there is a vague physical similarity between Lady Thatcher and the younger Ms. Suchocka, she lacks the go-for-the-jugular instinct of the former British Prime Minister.
Does she want to be Prime Minister after the September elections? "I am unable to answer this question at this moment," she said. It all depends on the results, she said, manifesting the moderation and even modesty that seems to be at the heart of her popularity ratings, which were as high as 76 percent earlier this year and still stand at 66 percent.

HEADLINE: True to Style, Mayor Tells Boston He Will Get His Way as Envoy to Vatican

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 8

 BODY:
People here have been telling Ray Flynn stories since the popular, populist Mayor announced at a tearful news conference outside his Gate of Heaven church in March that he would leave by early July to become Ambassador to the Vatican.
But now the latest one, already being proclaimed a Ray Flynn classic, is unfolding: the former Providence College basketball star goes one on one with the State Department over his job description, and wins. 
 After creating a brief flurry of suspense for his beloved Bostonians -- especially the eight candidates campaigning hard for the Mayor's job -- Mr. Flynn received assurances from the President late today that he would have the authority to take his human rights campaign to poor countries around the world, as he had planned.
So the Mayor, who has been saying since Sunday night that he might stay on at City Hall, will be going to Rome after all. And, in typical Ray Flynn style, he called a news conference -- in the West Wing of the White House.
 
'Ray Being Ray'
 "Everyone was calling, saying, 'Can you believe Ray?' " said Elaine Guiney, the campaign manager for Thomas Menino, who will take over as acting Mayor when Mr. Flynn resigns and hopes to win the job permanently in November's nonpartisan election. "It's Ray being Ray. At this point, he should be on about page 12 of the newspaper. But he's a lame duck at the center of attention."
Mr. Menino, after 20 years of watching Mr. Flynn at work, proclaimed himself awed. "He's like Michael Jordan and Larry Bird," he said. "You think he has no more moves left, and he gives you another one. It's vintage Ray Flynn."
This is a Mayor who is famous for his daring front-page exploits -- pulling old ladies from burning buildings, getting smuggled into the Gdansk shipyards on a flatbed truck for a meeting with Lech Walesa when Solidarity was under siege in Poland, outmaneuvering Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the Congressman, during Bill Clinton's campaign visit so that the news was dominated by Ray and Bill drinking beer together at a working class Irish pub.
Just last Thursday he was strolling across the Boston Common after yet another ceremony in his honor, telling a reporter how excited he was about going to Rome. "I want to go to Sudan and Somalia," said Mr. Flynn, the son of a longshoreman and a cleaning woman who still lives in the working class Irish immigrant neighborhood of South Boston, where he was reared. "Northern Ireland, Peru, Cambodia. I want to really focus on the issues of AIDS and poverty."
 
Informal Politician
 Mr. Flynn, who would rather shoot baskets with kids in Roxbury than sit behind his desk, or fraternize at places like the Ritz Carlton (when he did show up there, in February, he was ushered out because of his un-Ritz-like garb, a Red Sox cap, and polo shirt with no jacket), said he would not be spending a lot of time at formal state dinners.
The drama began in a meeting with the Mayoral candidates late Sunday night, two days after The Boston Herald quoted unnamed State Department sources saying that the Mayor was treating the job "as a two-year junket," and suggesting that his requests for increased funds for travel and entertainment had gone way beyond normal for Ambassadors.
Piqued, Mr. Flynn said he might not take the job after all. If he was not going to have the authority and money to travel to poor countries and hot spots around the world, he said, he was not interested in the job.
 
Back on Page 1
 Suddenly, the Mayor, who is known as the master of the Saturday news release, was back on the front page.
"Those comments riled him as they would rile anybody," said Arthur Jones, a White House spokesman and Mr. Flynn's former press secretary.
Mr. Jones said Mr. Flynn had apparently been seeking to define what he would be doing as the ambassador to the Holy See. "I think this was all about clarification," Mr. Jones said.
 Now, official statements released by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the White House today indicated victory for Mr. Flynn. Referring to him as "a close friend and a national figure in social justice," President Clinton said he had "the highest respect for the Mayor's ability as a powerful advocate on issues of conscience and social and economic justice throughout the world."
Mr. Christopher said, "The President and the department often need a special emissary to promote America's humanitarian goals, and we know Mayor Flynn would be able to deliver the message forcefully and persuasively."
At his news conference, Mr. Flynn proclaimed that he had not been worried about the travel budget for the Ambassador's job.
"It was never a question of money," he said. "I just wanted to be able to make a contribution to advancing the United States' interest in concerns over economic justice." At issue, he said, was "whether I had the authority and the support of the President and the Secretary of State to visit countries around the world, particularly ones that are suffering human neglect."
Mr. Flynn's nomination to the Vatican job has not officially arrived at the Senate yet.
 
Pit Bull Confrontation
 Just last Thursday Mr. Jones had been recounting the story of the Mayor and the pit bull. It was July 14, 1987. The Mayor's police radio crackled with the report of a hostage situation in Roxbury. "We sped to the scene of course," Mr. Jones said. "The word comes down that the guy has a pit bull. We heard the worst: the guy was a killer; maybe there was even a chopped-up woman in the refrigerator. I'm there with all the reporters. Then someone said, 'Flynn went in.' "
The man brandishing a shotgun at his front door seemed to know the Mayor. "He said, 'Ray Flynn, is that you, I saw you playing basketball in Providence,' " Mr. Jones said. "They start having a conversation. The door is open. The dog is there. The deputy police superintendent went for the rifle, and the Mayor went for the dog. He pinned him against the wall with the fence gate."
The three-hour police siege was over. And the Mayor had made the evening news yet again. Asked about the pit bull incident on Thursday, Mr. Flynn grinned. "That was a great day," he said. "I wasn't afraid of the gun. I was afraid of the dog."
 
There Are Some Critics
 After nine and a half years at City Hall, Raymond L. Flynn has his critics, of course, who blame him for failing to improve the troubled public schools and carp that he should have spent more time managing the city, say, than holding news conferences and schmoozing on the streets. But in the rush to farewell, at least up until Sunday night, there has mostly been an extraordinary outpouring of affection.
After 16 years of Kevin H. White, "Kevin Deluxe," the debonair Mayor of the Downtown, Ray Flynn was the plain-spoken Mayor of the Neighborhoods. "Millionaires don't need mayors," he said in an interview last week. "Poor people do."
This Mayor was on the scene -- a fire in Mattapan, a funeral in Dorchester, last month's street fight between black and white youths outside his alma mater, South Boston High School, where 35 years ago in this sports-crazed town he was "Flynnzo," a three-sport hero.
Whatever the particular components of his style, it has worked for Ray Flynn in Boston from 1983 to 1991, when he was re-elected, with 75 percent of the vote, until now. Mr. Flynn, who as a state representative in the 1970's opposed forced busing to integrate the public schools, but as Mayor has been widely credited with diminishing racial divisions, won an overwhelming majority in the black community in the last two elections.
In a 1991 Boston Globe poll, 43 percent of the voters said they had met Mr. Flynn. That wasn't good enough for the Mayor, who is 53 and runs marathons. "That poll's a lie," he snapped the other day. "There aren't 43 people in this town who don't know me."
 
Small-Town Mayor
 To spend a day with him is to see Boston as a small town, where at least half the 600,000 residents seem to be friends of Ray. At a park in Dorchester he and eight black men who all said they knew him reminisced about the days when a teen-age Ray Flynn played for the Bruins, a semipro basketball team out of Roxbury.
"You could shoot," said another ex-Bruin, Rudy Cabral.
The next stop was Doyles's, an Irish institution in the multi-ethnic Jamaica Plain neighborhood, where the Mayor downed a bowl of vegetable soup and greeted by name, among others, Stanley Pailbin, a lieutenant detective, Dan Howlett, a sub-contractor, and Peter Fallon, a retired construction worker.
Another of his friends, 15-year-old Stephen Byrd, who hustles candy after school at Doyles's, pulled a chair up to the Mayor's table.
 
Teen-Age Constituent
 "So, when are you leaving?" asked Stephen, who had no way of knowing that six days later thousands of other people would be wondering the same thing.
"Are you making A's and B's?" asked the Mayor who, with his wife, Cathy, has raised six children.
This was the Mayor of Boston? The smiling, blue-eyed man in the Providence College jacket seemed like television's version of a public official, maybe Andy from Mayberry?
On the other hand, Ray Flynn is not exactly unmindful of his image.
Heading back downtown in his station wagon, with a basketball in the backseat, he popped a cassette of Irish melodies on the tape deck, and began to sing. "I sang this on '60 Minutes,' " he said between choruses of "A Mother's Love's a Blessing."
Now more than ever, many politicians here -- particularly the eight Mayoral candidates -- say they just hope Ray Flynn leaves by mid-July, as planned. But this afternoon, plenty of his constituents were still hoping he would decide to stay.
"He's everywhere," said one of them, Michael Wilson, who works for the Department of Public Safety. "He's in my neighborhood. He's in your neighborhood. He's on TV. He's a hands-on guy."

HEADLINE: Russia Will Formally Seek Full Status in Trade Group

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
As part of an effort to integrate Russia into the world economy, President Boris N. Yeltsin is expected on Friday to present an application for full Russian membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 111-nation, Geneva-based group that oversees world trade, a senior official of the organization said today.
In a telephone interview, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Moscow would probably not become a member for at least a year, and perhaps not for several years. He suggested that the changes it would have to make to meet GATT standards would undoubtedly accelerate the nation's transition to a market economy. 
 Western officials said GATT membership would be a boon to Moscow because it would carry with it preferred trading status with other members of the organization.
 
Looking at Russia Positively
 "You have potentially a very dynamic, highly competitive economy," the GATT official said. "At the same time, you have a market that ultimately would represent a huge opportunity for companies in other GATT countries."
In an interview, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said Washington was working with Moscow on its application. "It's part of moving from a command economy to a market economy," he said. "You set up a system of tariffs. You regularize trade. You have a system of rules that people can rely on. It makes it more comfortable for other nations to deal with them in trade."
There are no detailed requirements for admission to the organization as a full member. It is generally required that a commitment be made to removing most trade barriers, but it is not mandatory to have a market economy. Poland and Romania, for instance, were members while they were still Communist.
In 1990, the Soviet Union was granted observer status, and two years later, Russia took its place as the Soviet successor state.
 
Tariffs, Accounting
 Before Russia can be admitted, GATT officials are expected to ask hundreds of questions over a period of months. These are likely to touch on Russia's tariff structure and other trade barriers, its accounting system, agricultural reforms and subsidies to industries, among other matters.
Mr. Yeltsin is to present the application for full membership on Friday when GATT's Director General, Arthur Dunkel, visits Moscow. Then on June 16, GATT is expected to designate a working group to deal with the Russian request for admission.
GATT officials said that as a result of Moscow's application, they expected many of the 14 other former Soviet republics to soon apply for membership. They said it was impossible to know exactly how long it would take for Russia to be admitted.
China is not a member. It applied in 1986, but its chances dissolved in June 1989, when Chinese troops, on instructions of top political leaders, put down democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds.
GATT officials said that they now expect China to become a member next year.

HEADLINE: CLINTON BACKS OFF PLAN FOR NEW TAX ON HEAT IN FUELS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
Warned by leading Democratic senators that he was probably facing defeat, President Clinton backed away today from his proposal for a new tax based on the heat content of fuels.
Later, Democrats in the Senate met for more than two hours over lunch to try to forge a compromise that would be acceptable to the White House and could command a majority in the Senate. No consensus was reached, but senators said afterward that a different form of energy tax was still likely. 
 This change of position is by far the biggest concession the President has made in his economic plan. But if the rest of the plan is enacted more or less intact, it will be considered a major political victory for the new Administration.
 
Met Vigorous Opposition
 The Clinton proposal was vigorously opposed by energy-intensive industries, like petrochemicals, that believe their products would lose a competitive edge in international markets, and by states where those industries are concentrated.
The new version of the energy tax, like the old one, is expected to apply to all forms of fuel, but it would be smaller. Different forms of taxes under consideration would affect various businesses and regions differently.
As recently as last weekend, Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers insisted publicly that a tax based on the number of British thermal units generated by different forms of energy was an essential element in his economic plan. A B.T.U. is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree Fahrenheit.
 
Doesn't Want 'Name Game'
 But at a picture-taking session this morning before he met with Congressional leaders from both parties, Mr. Clinton carefully avoided saying he would insist on a such a tax.
"I don't want to get into a name game here," he asserted in answer to a reporter's question about where he stood on a B.T.U. tax.
At a news briefing afterward, the President's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, clearly following the instructions of her superiors, said over and over again every time she was asked about a B.T.U. tax that Mr. Clinton was "committed to a broad-based energy tax."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said tonight, "It will not be a B.T.U. tax."
Today's statements were in sharp contrast with what officials said in public over the weekend. For example, after meeting with the President on Sunday morning, Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, said, "We want to maintain a B.T.U. tax," and he called it "one of the basic principles of the Administration's program.
Mr. Clinton had said for months that his energy tax was essential because it was the fairest and most environmentally sound way to raise revenue to lower the budget deficit.
The change in course apparently followed Mr. Clinton's meeting Monday evening with his main economic advisers and Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. Mr. Mitchell, the majority leader, and Mr. Moynihan, the chairman of the Finance Committee, are the most important Democratic Senators on tax and budget matters.
According to an official who was there, the Senators told the President that prospects for Senate approval of the fuel tax in the form he proposed it were "extremely gloomy."
Mr. Clinton, the official reported, said little and mostly listened. But at one point he was said to have emphasized how important it was for him to win Senate approval of his budget plan before he goes to Tokyo early next month for the meeting of the heads of state of the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
The B.T.U. tax Mr. Clinton offered would raise $72 billion of the $250 billion in additional taxes the President has proposed for the next five years. Most of the remainder would come from higher tax rates on wealthy individuals and corporations.
 
What Kind of Tax?
 The alternative proposals now under consideration are expected to raise somewhat less money than Mr. Clinton proposed, in part to answer objections that the Clinton plan is too heavy on tax increases and too light on spending cuts.
These are examples of the kinds of broad energy taxes that might replace the B.T.U. tax:
*An ad valorem, or sales tax on fuel. This would require consumers to pay in taxes a certain percentage of the cost of energy, whether gasoline, electricity or whatever. This would be the simplest tax to collect.
*A volume tax. This would place a tax, for example, on each gallon of gasoline, each cubic foot of natural gas and each ton of coal consumed.
*A carbon tax. This would tax each form of energy on the basis of its carbon content or the pollution it emits, a step many environmentalists favor.
When the economic plan was being drafted, Mr. Bentsen favored an ad valorem tax, and Vice President Al Gore supported the B.T.U. tax.
Mr. Gore's position won out in Administration councils because it was believed to encourage more reliance on clean sources of energy and thus to be more environmentally sound.
Mr. Clinton also said often that he picked this form of tax because it seemed to treat all regions of the country evenly.
 
An Unworkable Measure?
 But the B.T.U. tax immediately came under sharp attack, and the House of Representatives, with the Administration's approval, included so many exemptions from the tax in the bill it approved last month that many economists and accountants said the measure had become unworkable.
Mainly, the complaints came from companies that produce energy-intensive products like petrochemicals, steel, class and cement. Politicians representing states and districts where such companies are important employers said they feared that the tax would make American products uncompetitive in international markets.
Senators and Administration officials said they were nowhere near a consensus on what approach to take now. Some senators said they favored a tax just on gasoline. Others supported one on all transportation fuels, which would also include, for instance, diesel and jet fuel.
But those measures seem too narrow to meet the President's concern that the tax be "broad-based."
A carbon tax is also believed to be unlikely, mainly because of the opposition of lawmakers from regions where coal is produced. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is one such lawmaker, and his support is critical to the President's chances.
 
A Working Lunch
 The winners and losers under a sales tax or a tax on volume would depend to a large extent on the specifics of the proposal. But environmentalists are less enthusiastic about a sales tax because they say it would be difficult to write it in a way that rewarded the fuels that pollute least and penalized those that cause the most pollution.
All this was kicked around at length at the Democratic senators' lunch today. Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Moynihan spent much of the day sounding out individual senators.
Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who holds a swing vote on the Finance Committee, said, "Everything's under consideration, but there have been no decisions."
At the lunch, strong opposition was raised to Senator Moynihan's proposal for an additional $35 billion in cuts in Medicare over the next five years. The Clinton budget already includes $50 billion in reduced Medicare costs.
"It would be a tremendous burden on the elderly in this country," Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, said afterward.
 
Bradley Offers Opinion
 Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, suggested that instead of cutting Medicare to pay for lower energy taxes, the Senate should eliminate some of the tax breaks in the bill approved by the House and supported by the President. Three such breaks alone -- a less rigid minimum tax, new writeoffs for investors in real estate and more generous deductions for equipment purchases by small businesses -- would cost the Government about $20 billion in lost revenue over five years, Mr. Bradley said.
Several of the more conservative Democratic Senators met at noon in the office of Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma and issued a statement saying the budget should include more spending cuts than tax increases, more discipline in controlling spending on benefit programs and no B.T.U. tax.
Mr. Boren has led the fight against the Clinton fuel tax, and this evening he issued this statement: "I am encouraged that there is a growing momentum to kill the B.T.U. tax. As more attentionis focused upon this tax, the more people see that it is unworkable and unfair.

HEADLINE: Behind Dinkins Budget: Recovering From Gamble

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In the end, the election-year budget that Mayor David N. Dinkins hoped would demonstrate his managerial mettle came a year too soon.
The staffs of the Mayor and the City Council were still working last night, five days into their final round of negotiations, trying to resolve the last details of the city's spending plan for the fiscal year starting next month. But the budget's thrust is clear: it will feature about $300 million in spending cuts and a retrenchment in some services not likely to endear Mr. Dinkins and other political leaders with voters this fall. 
 The $31.4 billion plan proposed by the Mayor and now being modified in talks with Council leaders represents a sharp contrast to the somewhat more expansive budget they were able to put together a year ago.
That budget put a decisive end to nearly three years of unremittingly dismal fiscal developments in the city. It stabilized spending, and even added a few relatively inexpensive but innovative programs, including new health clinics in poor areas, longer library hours and opening school buildings for after-school programs.
The budget won praise last year for the Mayor from fiscal experts and Wall Street, and the new programs it contained have become centerpieces in his standard political campaign speech, vital elements in the case he presents for re-election.
 
A Calculated Gamble
 So why was last year's budget relatively bountiful, at least in the context of a crushing four-year recession? And why, only 12 months later, is this year's budget so difficult to balance?
As in most matters governmental, chance and design each played a role. In effect, some elected officials say, the Dinkins administration took a calculated gamble a year ago, choosing to build up a budget surplus last spring to stabilize the city's finances during the current fiscal year and to allow them to add a few new programs that would put the Mayor's stamp on local government.
The Mayor and his senior aides took the unconventional step of crafting an election-year budget in his third year -- and not in his fourth, as he was beginning his re-election campaign -- in recognition of his low standing in the public-opinion polls and in the hope that the economy would turn around this year.
But the economy did not swing around, and other events also intervened to make it first difficult and then impossible for Mr. Dinkins to avoid spending cuts now in the midst of an election year.
Last January, for example, the Mayor reached a modest, 8.25 percent, 39-month labor settlement with 19 municipal unions, a raise that may barely keep pace with inflation. But it will still cost the city more than $400 million in the coming fiscal year.
 
Source of Great Strain
 The Dinkins administration also said, around the same time, that because of the prolonged recession, the city's property-tax revenues would be more than $400 million lower in the coming fiscal year than currently. Together, those two developments have caused great strain on the budget for the coming year.
But factors much more directly within the Mayor's control also contributed to the current fiscal distress. "I believe the seeds for the mess today were sown a year ago," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances.
One prime reason that Mr. Dinkins was able to stabilize the city's finances a year ago and add some new programs was a surplus of $566 million in the fiscal year that ended last June. That surplus has been used in the current fiscal year.
The surplus occurred for many reasons. Among them: the city did not use $150 million in general reserve funds and received $146 million more in tax revenues than expected.
 
Transfers From the State
 But the surplus was cobbled together, as well, because the administration invoked a number of accounting measures, including the calling in of $106 million in claims from the state. Mr. Proctor contends that the accounting changes, while perfectly legitimate, could have been used any time. By invoking them last year, he said, the administration in effect bulked up the size of the surplus and created an unrealistically rosy view of the city's fiscal condition.
"Much of last year's surplus came from one-year transfers from the state," Mr. Proctor said.
Those budgetary calculations reflected a broad political gamble, some politicians believe. After having been battered, both politically and personally, by two and a half years of spending cuts, hiring freezes, layoffs and other grim fiscal developments, Mr. Dinkins and his advisers decided to pull out all the budgetary stops a year before he would seek re-election, the elected officials say.
The budget approved in May 1992 buoyed the spirits of the Mayor, his aides and his commissioners, and it no doubt helped lift Mr. Dinkins's standing in polls. But it also left the Mayor with hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time revenues from the surplus to finance recurring city programs, making him more vulnerable to having to cut back spending now unless other new revenues could be found this spring.
Some mayoral aides denied that they had made any special political calculations in the spring of 1992 or that they took extraordinary actions to build up the size of the surplus last year. They acknowledged that the city's improved fiscal condition last year had allowed them to craft some small but significant new programs -- allowing Mr. Dinkins finally to begin leaving some legacy on city government besides shrinking the work force and cutting spending.
 
Waiting for Washington
 Mayoral advisers also admitted that, starting last fall, they had hoped that two things would make budget deliberations easier this spring: the anticipation of a small economic upswing and the presence of the first Democrat in the White House in 12 years. The upturn did not occur, and Mr. Clinton has not yet delivered new Federal aid for the city.
The Mayor, structuring his argument narrowly, in recent days has blamed Republicans in Congress for the lack of additional Federal money. He also has blamed Republicans in the State Senate for his inability to win most of the $280 million in additional state aid he was seeking.
But fiscal critics view the debate in broader terms. They fault the Mayor for not taking more aggressive action to confront the City Hall's underlying financial problem -- expenses are growing faster than revenues -- by eliminating services that the city's tax base can no longer afford.
"They concentrated on filling budget gaps with one-shot measures as they came along," said Charles Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group. "They did that again last year, but they've run out of one-shots just as the new fiscal year approaches."

A Peek Behind the Smile At Rough Journey's End

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
THE photograph on the front page of The Times on Monday showing a huddled mass of Chinese certainly evoked hard passages and disorientation. It showed the illegal refugees looking out in grayness at the grounded steamer that had carried them 17,000 miles to Jacob Riis beach. But there in the left-hand corner was a laughing face. Wet and cold, a man was plainly laughing.
For months he traveled on a tramp steamer where close to 300 people ultimately gave up sharing a single toilet. He has arrived in America with nothing more than his clothes and they were soaking wet. He may not have realized it when the picture was taken, but at least six of his fellow passengers died in the last leg of the voyage through the waters of Queens. 
 We don't know the man's name, but if he is like most of the illegal Chinese refugees who preceded him, he is a poor man from a rural village who has amassed mountains of debt to pay for the journey. He is separated from friends and family and surely he knows he faces years of grinding labor at minimum wage or below before he can free himself of obligations.
So why is he laughing so robustly?
While he was at sea there came news reports about zooming and prodigious economic growth in the China from which he was fleeing, reports like one from the International Monetary Fund saying that China's economy is four times larger than anyone had thought and that it now ranked third in the world behind the United States and Japan. The people on the ship had no access to news, so the laughing man couldn't have heard that.
Nor is he likely to be aware of other reports about how bad things are in New York, reports like the one last week that described unemployment among the city's youngest job seekers as worse than it has been in a quarter century and twice what it was two years ago.
"None of that would make any difference to any of these guys," said Lawrence Zheng, a Chinatown businessman, who knows other people who came as human contraband. "You know why the guy is laughing? Because he has won."
As Mr. Zheng explained it, the laughing man and the others who swam to shore with him, were most likely villagers who, despite boom times, earned no more than $30 a month.
The cost of the illegal passage, he said, was about $30,000. "In the past you had to put up half before you left, but now there is so much competition from different agents you need only 10 percent," Mr. Zheng said. This down payment was either borrowed from family members, who might look on a relative in America as a lifeline for the future, or from usurers.
"Money in Chinese banks earns 7 or 8 percent interest, but if you lend it to people for passage the rate is around 30 percent," said the businessman. He said the illegal immigrants usually send back the money in cash installments of less than $2,000 through the Bank of China.
"When a man like your laughing man first comes, he is a slave," said a Chinatown social worker, who asked to be identified only as Pearl. "He earns maybe $200 a week and works 15 hours a day every day, usually in restaurants." Such refugees are fed at work, which enables them to send back almost all their wages except for $80 a month used to pay for beds in crowded cribs where people sleep in shifts.
The drudgery seems to be from another time, recalling turn-of-the-century slum life as portrayed by Jacob Riis -- for whom the beach where the Chinese landed was named -- in "How the Other Half Lives." But the Chinatown section of that classic offers nothing to explain the laughing man. Instead, its pages contain surprisingly racist passages noting that the Chinese "are a constant and terrible menace to society" and that "the severest official scrutiny, the harshest repressive measures are justifiable in Chinatown, orderly as it appears on the surface."
It is possible, of course, that the laughing newcomer, now in detention awaiting immigration hearings, did not know of the rigors ahead. According to Christopher Kiu, the executive secretary of Asian Americans for Equality, a housing advocacy agency, people often come with fairy-tale images. "They heard that the streets have gold on them," he said. "They find they have to work harder than they thought and some older ones even go back, losing face and money."
Mr. Zheng said he had heard of some people returning, but he said he thought that most found a better life. "For more than 95 percent things work out. They pay back what they owe in three or four years and become free. I think most know how difficult life will be when they arrive."
So why was the wet man laughing on the shore of America?
Perhaps he was deceived about what lies ahead. Perhaps he felt he would be getting more than just the blanket in which he was wrapped. Maybe he was crazed by the trip. Or, perhaps he just knows things about opportunity and desperation that people who have been here longer may have forgotten.

HEADLINE: Reviving Ailing Retail In Downtown Hartford

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 7

 BODY:
In the eerie darkness, one can still make out the splendor of the former G. Fox & Company, once the grande dame of Connecticut department stores.
Above the faded mauve rugs gleams the playful splendor of Art Deco. Wooden and aluminum strips run side by side along the wall; elaborate swirls of aluminum still sweep alongside a silver escalator. 
 The question for Hartford is what to do with all this grandeur.
After the store closed in February, the city bought the building and an adjacent parking garage from the May Company for $1. It hopes to find a new use that will help revive the city's downtown retail industry.
So far, two large developers have approached the city with proposals for discount centers on the lower floors of the 11-story building; several community groups have proposed moving arts companies or a historical museum into the building, and a city task force is studying options.
Hartford is not alone in struggling with both the decline in downtown retailing and the vacant department stores that symbolize the problem.
From New Haven to Newark to Syracuse, downtown department stores have been closing, and their hulking buildings often remain empty for years, said James W. Hughes, associate dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
 
Combinations That Work
 Such stores are the victims of both the sprawling suburban malls and people's changing shopping habits, said Lawrence A. Alexander, director of the Downtown Resource and Development Center in Manhattan.
"It's not that downtown is weak," said Mr. Alexander, whose group publishes studies and newsletters on downtown issues. "It's that people are not that interested in shopping in department stores any more."
He added: "People over 60, they say, 'We're losing our heritage.' All they've really lost is a commercial entity."
Today's downtowns, Mr. Alexander said, rely less on retail and more on offices, culture and government. Mr. Hughes agreed, pointing out that complexes that combine retail and cultural attractions have worked in several cities, like the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan, Harborplace in Baltimore and Faneuil Hall in Boston.
 
New and Different Anchors
 "That's sort of what downtowns can do if they have historical assets," Mr. Hughes said. "They can take on this kind of touristy-cultural kind of thrust."
Downtown's new anchors -- anything from a college to a medical center -- are often in former department stores, said Richard Bradley, director of the Washington-based International Downtown Association.
The Portland School of the Arts in Portland, Me., is now in the former Porteous Department Store, he said. And De Paul University has a campus on State Street in Chicago in the former home of Weibolt's Department Store. In Bridgeport, Conn., a community college will soon be moving into a failing downtown mall.
Mr. Bradley said it was also common for a city or other nonprofit entity to buy a building for development. That allows them to use the revenue from the retail portion to cut costs for less profitable enterprises.
Hartford is weighing just such an approach, but the economics could present a problem.
 
Economic Assessments
 William M. Russell, vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty and co-chairman of Hartford's retail task force, said the city would have to borrow to renovate the 1917 G. Fox building before it can be used again.
"You don't do that with art schools and music schools that are barely going to be able to pay their expenses, let alone pay a high-priced rent," Mr. Russell said. "There is plenty of room to do everything. We need to find the basis on which the rest of these can stand."
Mr. Bradley said that mixed uses have worked elsewhere, but he emphasized that it was difficult for one-time department stores to remain primarily retail.
"It just doesn't fit in today's market," he said. "It's kind of a dinosaur, and retail today is run by gazelles, if you will."
Yet not all cities are convinced that downtown retailing is dead.
New Haven, for example, is planning a $400 million upscale retail complex to fill the gap left by its two closed department stores, Macy's and the Edward Malley Company, which closed in 1982. Like Hartford, it is hoping for state aid -- in New Haven, up to $100 million -- to make the plan work.
Howard J. Stanback, Hartford's City Manager, said that some retail was essential for the tax base.
"If it works anyplace, it should work in Hartford," Mr. Stanback said. "Here you've got a block of over one million square feet of space with a store that's off Interstate 84 and Interstate 91. And you've got all these people in the region. I'm not sure any downtown can do it, but I think this one can."
Nevertheless, downtown Hartford continues to lose retail stores. Wilson H. Faude, executive director of the Old State House, a historic site in the middle of downtown, moved his office and small gift shop a year ago into an adjacent mall called the Pavilion at State House Square while the State House undergoes renovation. Since then, 13 stores have moved out of the mall, he said.
Of the 18 stores left, 12 are small food establishments -- a coffee shop, an ice cream store and the like -- catering to the downtown lunch crowds.
"I'm the anchor tenant, they say," Mr. Faude said.
Mr. Faude said that more radical solutions for saving cities -- like a reduced sales tax in Connecticut's largest cities -- must be tried.
"One of the things our cities need to understand: No one has to stay here. Not Pratt & Whitney, not G. Fox, not Travelers. The Old State House," he said, motioning to the building behind him, "I can't move. Everybody else can move."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It Won't Rely On Japan Market Target

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration's new trade proposal to Japan will include plenty of numerical targets, Clinton officials said today that they were trying to avoid relying on the numbers that bother the Japanese most: targets for the market share of imports.
Japanese officials and some economists have denounced market share targets as managed trade since the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, began suggesting an aggressive use of them recently. 
 The best example of a market share target is a provision in a 1991 agreement between the United states and Japan in which the Japanese officially acknowledged the expectation that 20 percent of semiconductors sold in Japan should be foreign-made by the end of 1992.
 
Other Measures Planned
 While market share targets may still be used for a few industries, the Administration plans to pursue an array of other measures for foreign access to the Japanese market, Administration officials said today.
While precise targets have not yet been chosen, the approach would include measures like monitoring the number of Japanese car dealers who agree to sell American cars to more "qualitative" goals like making American, Japanese and European laws similar for the production of certain goods, the officials said.
The stance represents a slight shift of emphasis but not an about-face by the Administration. When it was announced in March that Japan had met the computer chip target for 1992, Mr. Kantor endorsed the use of market shares but also said that the United States would continue to use other measures of market access. These would include the extent to which Japanese consumer electronics and computer makers consult American chip makers before designing new products.
Some business executives say that the Clinton Administration is now discouraging them from even asking for market share targets, so as to avoid having to turn them down. "They haven't been encouraging using market shares as indicators," one lobbyist said. "It seems to ring so many chimes on the Japanese side."
 
Not So, Administration Says
 But a senior Administration official denied that any such signal had been sent. "We haven't been discouraging anybody," from seeking such targets, the official said. "What we're saying is, it makes sense to have multiple benchmarks."
At a White House briefing today, senior Administration officials said that while the plan did not include any explicit threat of automatic retaliation, it did not represent a softening of the American stance toward Japan. The officials said that the plan would not prevent America from continuing to use domestic laws that now provide for retaliation if past trade agreements are broken.
One of the senior officials also addressed the longstanding complaint of some economists that reducing Japanese trade barriers would not reduce the United States trade deficit. The line of reasoning is that the deficit reflects differences in the two countries' savings rates.
In response, the senior official said that the United States wanted Japan to reduce its overall trade surplus with the world to 2 percent of its economic output from 3 percent by increasing Government spending there. Most economists believe that this would increase Japan's demand for imports, although it is unclear how big the increase would be.
The White House briefing was held on condition that the officials not be identified because the policy was not being explained by the actual Cabinet-level negotiators, such as Mr. Kantor. Their aides conducted the briefing.

HEADLINE: Yielding, French Accept Farm Pact

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 8

 BODY:
France today accepted part of an agricultural agreement between Europe and the United States that it had vowed to veto, opening the way for progress in broader, and long-stalled, world trade talks.
At a meeting of European Community foreign ministers in Luxembourg, the recently installed center-right Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said it would drop its objection to a major point in the deal reached in Washington in November. 
 That agreement substantially reduced production in European Community countries of oilseed crops like soybeans, which make up a vast part of world agriculture and are used in vegetable oils and animal feed. The United States has complained for a number of years that it is losing its share of world markets to subsidized oilseed products from European growers.
 
Sharp Tactical Reversal
 "We gave our accord on the oilseeds," the French minister for European affairs, Alain Lamassoure, said today.
The agreement by Paris represented a sharp reversal of the new Government's early position. Last month, Mr. Balladur had said that anyone wishing to press France into rapid action on trade talks would be disappointed.
Nonetheless, the French change of heart was only partial. The Government maintained its reservations on another aspect of the November accord, which calls for a 21 percent reduction in the tonnage of subsidized European grain exports over six years.
Mr. Lamassoure said this would be discussed in the broad trade talks being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. France is known to be seeking concessions in other areas, including wider access to American markets for its banks, in exchange for agreement to all aspects of an eventual GATT farm accord.
Diplomats said that France's main European partner, Germany, had put strong pressure on the Balladur Government to end its obstruction of trade talks.
With European economies deep in recession, Bonn feels that a breakthrough in the six-year-old tariff talks -- widely known as the Uruguay Round -- is vital to reviving business throughout Western and Central Europe.
In addition, France last month secured an agreement from the community, increasing by about 30 percent the amount of money paid to farmers who are required to take 15 percent of more of their land out of production. At the time, the French Agriculture Minister, Jean Puech, said the deal would allow France to adopt "a more open attitude in international talks."
Under the agreement last November with the United States, the European Community said it would take 15 percent of land used for oilseed crops out of production in the first year and a minimum of 10 percent permanently.
 
Farmers Predictably Outraged
 Today, French farmers objected strenuously and predictably to the change of position. The National Center of Young Farmers called the decision a "a serious strategic error." The Socialists, who governed France last November and signed the Washington agreement, said France had surrendered to the United States. The party is now the chief opposition group in Parliament.
Although the French farm lobby is vocal and politically influential, it appeared that the Balladur Government had decided to try to make progress in the broader GATT talks before the meeting next month in Tokyo of the leaders of the world's seven major industrial nations.
Other European leaders welcomed the French move today. Prime Minister John Major said in London that the decision "removes one of the roadblocks toward moving to a comprehensive GATT agreement."
There have been many similar, and ultimately unfounded, expressions of optimism about the GATT negotiations in the past. But for the moment, there appears to be some new political will on both sides of the Atlantic and in Japan to seek compromise rather than further confrontation.
This possibility of compromise was in a sense foreshadowed last week in talks here among the trade and finance ministers of leading industrial nations under the sponsorship of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
A measure of optimism, if not harmony, prevailed. The two-day session certainly had its share of less-than-friendly sparring over basic trade issues by the United States and Japan.
But those disagreements were minimized in a final statement that somewhat innocuously noted the two trade rivals' positions, while pointedly declining to adopt their characterizations of managed trade, closed markets or other elements of their adversarial relationship.
Officials of national delegations, in particular Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's special trade representative, said then that they were optimistic about soon reaching a breakthrough in what have been the halting efforts to lower international trade barriers.
The officials said that by next month, they expected to achieve a consensus on the elimination or reduction of tariffs on hundreds of products, and that such agreement would presumably lay the groundwork for a comprehensive international trade treaty, something that has eluded negotiators in various forums for decades.
It was not clear, then or today, what concessions the Clinton Administration, the Japanese and the Europeans might be required to make to reach such an agreement. Still, Mr. Kantor expressed a kind of exuberance.
"We are at least within striking distance, he said last week, "of the outline of the largest market-access package in history."

HEADLINE: Big Board Stocks Continue Their Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Like a staggered prizefighter, the stock market came off the floor a number of times yesterday, trying to rally but still closing lower for lack of buyers.
Many of the stocks that declined on Monday, like technology and gaming issues, continued their losses, but others, like banks, found support among investors looking for bargains. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.59 points, to 3,510.54. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 240.6 million shares, slightly higher than Monday but still off the pace of recent weeks.
 
 
Widespread Weakness
 Weakness was widespread. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.65 points, to 245.15, as losing issues outnumbered gainers by a ratio of slightly more than 2 to 1. The American Stock Exchange index lost 3.72 points, to 437.18; the Nasdaq composite dropped 6.87 points, to 687.74, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.98 points, to 444.71.
Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company sees the market in a defensive posture. "A couple of large sell programs really accentuated the feeling in the market yesterday," Mr. Jarrett said.
Looking ahead to the release Friday of inflation numbers for May, he said: "We, the market, tend to anticipate the worst, and as humans discount the event by making strategic shifts in and out of portfolios. But when it happens, it's usually not as bad as we first imagine it to be."
A weak bond market also worked against stocks yesterday, as the 30-year Treasury bond fell in price, as did other maturities.
Gaming stocks, which had been on fire lately, showed signs of weakening yesterday as traders began to suspect that they were overpriced.
Oil stocks attracted attention amid meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva this week and negotiations between the Administration and Senate leaders over President Clinton's energy tax proposal.
Apple Computer, down 7.5 percent on Monday over concerns that earnings would fall below analysts' estimates, lost 1 1/4, to 49 1/2, as several analysts dropped their ratings and earnings estimates.
 
 
BankAmerica Shares Slip
 BankAmerica, the most actively traded issue on the Big Board yesterday, also fell victim to ratings and earnings estimate changes by analysts, losing 3/4, to 41 1/4. Traders said Prudential Securities lowered the rating and earnings estimates on Monday because of the drag California's economy was having on BankAmerica's results.
Shares in Deluxe fell 6, to 39 5/8, after the check printing company said it would close 16 of its 60 printing plants and cut 8.5 percent of the division's 10,300 employees and take a restructuring charge for the quarter.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
As Yen-Buying Accelerates, Dollar Falls to Another Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell to another record against the Japanese yen yesterday, losing ground despite the apparent efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan to support it.
Still, the dollar gained ground against several other leading currencies as traders sold European denominations to buy more yen. 
 Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded contract for gold for August delivery slipped 10 cents, to $375.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for spot gold at $373.75, up 25 cents an ounce.
Dealers said that the session was characterized by huge yen-buying beginning overnight in Asian markets. The purchasing of the Japanese currency continued throughout the European and domestic sessions, dominating trading.
 
Dollar at 106.33 Yen in Japan
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 106.33 yen, down 1.14 yen from Monday's close, another postwar low. And in New York, the dollar dropped to 106.40 yen, against 107.25 yen on Monday.
Traders said there were indications that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan stepped in, as they reportedly have in recent days, to buy dollars in an attempt to stem the currency's decline. The dollar appeared to stabilize, but the intervention was not considered to be substantial enough to actually lift the dollar much off its lows.
Much of the yen-buying came at the expense of the European currencies, and the dollar was caught in the crossfire, said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ABM-AMRO Bank N.V. "There is a big repatriation of funds back to Japan," he said. While the economic situation in Japan seems precarious, Mr. McCarthy said that relative to other countries "Japan doesn't look so bad as, perhaps, Germany, and it's neutral against the U.S."
 
U.S. Reports Anticipated
 Mr. McCarthy said currency traders would need more evidence that the United States economy was improving before they stepped in and bought up dollars. Such evidence could come Friday, when the Government is scheduled to report on producer prices and retail sales, both for May.
The dollar also rose to 1.6250 German marks in New York, from 1.6205 marks on Monday. The British pound, meanwhile, fell to $1.5201 from Monday's $1.5220.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Not Pleased by U.S. Proposals

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8

 BODY:
Japanese officials said today that they would reject proposals made by the United States regarding trade relations because the proposals included numerical targets for reduction of Japan's trade surplus and for increasing imports of specific products.
American officials, at a briefing in Washington on Monday, said that although the proposal would set numerical benchmarks, there would be no automatic retaliation against Japan if the targets were not met. But if that was meant as a concession to Japan, it did not seem to have registered here. 
 "I think it is especially important that we make clear that the Japanese Government cannot accept this point," Foreign Minister Kabun Muto said at a news briefing today, reiterating Japan's oft-stated position that setting numerical targets would lead to "managed trade."
 
No Promises Made
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said it would be "unrealistic" for Japan to promise to reduce its trade surplus by a specific amount by a specific date, as called for in the American proposal. "Because it is a free economy, no one can control exports or imports," he said.
Japanese bureaucrats were poring over the proposal they received this morning from the United States. They said the proposal consisted of a one-page outline devoid of many important details.
A meeting of American and Japanese officials is scheduled for Friday in Washington to begin negotiations on establishing a framework for trade between the world's two largest economies. The goal is to reach a basic agreement before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo in early July.
 
Possible Compromises
 Whether Japan will relax its opposition once negotiations begin, as has happened on occasion in the past, remains to be seen. Some experts have said there may be room for Japan and the United States to agree on some broad policy goals. Japanese officials have, for instance, said that their nation's huge trade surplus was undesirable and should be reduced.
The American proposal calls for Japan's current account surplus to be reduced to 1 to 2 percent of Japan's economic output in three years; it is now about 3 percent of output. It also calls for an increase in Japan's imports of manufactured goods by about a third. Benchmarks are also expected to be set for imports of specific products like autos.
Tatsuya Terazawa, deputy director of the Americas division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan had not yet received any explanations from Washington about how the United States would enforce the numerical targets. Senior Clinton Administration officials said the proposals did not include automatic retaliation if the targets were not met. Because of a lack of information on this aspect, Mr. Terazawa said the ministry could not comment.
Other officials said that it would be difficult to agree to any targets, even if they were nonbinding. Once a numerical target is mentioned, they said, it tends to take on a life of its own and becomes a source of friction.
The semiconductor agreement between Japan and the United States set an expectation that foreign companies would achieve 20 percent of Japan's computer chip market, but specifically said the 20 percent was not a guarantee.
Nevertheless, Japanese officials have repeatedly complained, the United States treated the number as a commitment by Japan and was considering imposing sanctions on Japan until the 20 percent goal was unexpectedly met late last year.
 
Friction Over Autos
 Japanese automobile manufacturers agreed during President George Bush's trip here in 1992 to try to buy $19 billion worth of American auto parts by the fiscal year that ends in March 1995. Japanese officials have recently complained that the United States is regarding what had been a voluntary plan by the private sector as a Government-backed pledge.
Others here say that it would be foolish for Japan to agree to targets that it cannot control. The trade surplus, for instance, is a result of actions by private companies and by other nations, not just Japan.
"We are not in control of all of the variables," said one Foreign Ministry official. He said that the American trade proposal included a pledge that the United States would work to reduce the Federal budget deficit, but that the American Government did not set a specific target for itself.
"There's an asymmetry already there," he said.

Adventures in Spoletoland: Conservative but Not Bloodless

BYLINE: By ALEX ROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., June 6

 BODY:
Spoleto Festival U.S.A., held annually here, is troubled by difficult questions in its 17th year. Has this multi-disciplinary event lost its edge, its experimental thrust? Will it overcome internal squabbles and financial crises? Could it survive without the guidance of its 82-year-old founder, Gian Carlo Menotti?
A single weekend's visit did not provide ready answers. For the moment, the festival seems to be on reasonably firm musical ground; there were solid productions of two unjustly neglected operas, some attractive programs of chamber music and a brand-new children's opera by Mr. Menotti. Crowds were large, concessions brisk, publicity relentless. 
 The contemporary programming, however, was discouragingly limited. Mr. Menotti is a composer of conservative bent, and the festival's new musical director, Steven Mercurio, apparently reflects his tastes. The three "20th-Century Perspectives" programs were dominated by traditionalists like Ned Rorem, David del Tredici and Stephen Albert. Works by Peter Lieberson ( "Raising the Gaze") and Roberto Sierra ("Piezas Caracteristicas," a brilliant fusion of simple intervals and sophisticated rhythm) provided balance, but these "perspectives" could have been far wider.
 
'Der Zwerg' by Zemlinsky
 Still, even if the festival has become less adventurous, it has found rich territory to explore. The American premiere of "Der Zwerg" ("The Dwarf," also known as "The Birthday of the Infanta"), a 1922 opera by Alexander von Zemlinsky, was an important gesture on behalf of music that had previously been consigned to obscurity. Minor political imbroglios notwithstanding, it was the festival's major news.
Zemlinsky, a protege of Mahler and the teacher of Schoenberg, is a composer who perpetually needs to be re-introduced. Although he died utterly forgotten just outside New York City in 1942, his European associates -- Schoenberg, Berg, the philosopher and critic Theodor W. Adorno, even Stravinsky -- kept his name alive, and in the last decade his instrumental works have slowly been edging into the repertory. His operas are still essentially unknown, at least in the United States.
With Zemlinsky, it is best to avoid breathless superlatives. No lonely iconoclast, this composer compulsively echoed Brahms, Strauss, Mahler, even the young Korngold. But Adorno argued in his 1959 essay on Zemlinsky that the very reticence of the music, its stylistic equivocation, becomes a virtue. In an age when composers were storming triumphantly toward various dead ends, Zemlinsky evolved an intricate and subtle style from an approachable late-Romantic idiom.
Lacking a voice indisputably his own, Zemlinsky asserts himself through a sort of musical conjuration. He draws the listener on with a certain amount of patter and setup, with stylistic allusions and orchestral illusions, then suddenly lets forth a flash of lyric splendor. His magical fragments of melody, gliding across a rich but delicate instrumental texture, had a crucial influence on the atonal Romanticism of Berg.
"Der Zwerg" is perhaps his most immediately arresting score. Georg Klaren's libretto is based on Oscar Wilde's "Birthday of the Infanta," a parable of innocence and intolerance. On her birthday, a young Spanish princess is presented with a singing dwarf who, having never seen himself in a mirror, thinks himself very handsome. When the truth dawns and the princess spurns him as a mere toy, he falls dead of a broken heart. Zemlinsky, not handsome himself, identified strongly with his subject; the merriment is colored darkly at the edges, and the tragic end is cruelly concise.
The problem is that the story does not quite furnish enough material for a full evening's entertainment; both libretto and score have a few empty stretches. When the Hamburg Opera revived "Der Zwerg" in 1981, it cut and revised the text to sharpen its impact: the opera was even renamed after the Wilde story. In this version, the opera has been heard repeatedly in Europe. Mr. Menotti, who directed the production, unfortunately reverted to the longer and more diffuse original, while retaining the "Infanta" title.
Mr. Menotti's staging was straightforward: an ornate interior with a light-suffused courtyard at the back. One might have wished for a more sumptuous decor to match Wilde's catalogues of royal extravagance, but the story was served. Friday night's cast was led ably by Robert Brubaker, who overcame the demands of the dwarf's lyric-dramatic tenor line with only a few struggles. Mary Dunleavy captured the icy innocence of the Princess, and Marie Plette gave emotional intensity to the compassionate maid Ghita. The Spoleto orchestra, under Mr. Mercurio's direction, played with admirable commitment.
Will this belated American premiere further advance the Zemlinsky cause? "Infanta" would certainly make a strong double bill with Zemlinsky's other Wilde one-acter, "A Florentine Tragedy." The composer is well represented on recordings; the Koch-Schwann label has released the two Wilde operas and also the sharp-edged bourgeois satire "Kleider Machen Leute," and Capriccio has superbly documented the lush fairy tales "Es War Einmal," and "Der Traumgorge" and the dazzlingly eclectic "Kreidekreis," a response to the atmosphere of the Weimar years. All do justice to Zemlinsky's remote, seductive voice.
 
'Comte Ory' by Rossini
 While its Zemlinsky production preserved the composer's original version, Spoleto's "Comte Ory" replaced a French libretto with an Italian translation. It's not a wild leap; Rossini pillaged material from his own "Viaggio a Reims" in concocting "Ory," which is indisputably opera buffa to the core. But the switch seemed to peel away a layer of subtlety from Rossini's final comedy.
Spoleto's production, directed by Giulio Chazalettes and designed by Ulisse Santicchi, is a handsome and vivid affair. The first act takes place amid masses of greenery and earth tones, the second in the high-vaulted bedroom of a medieval castle. Stretching an already improbable scenario, Mr. Chazalettes chose to eroticize the encounter between the Countess and the Page in the dizzying, climactic trio; a gauze bed curtain is the instrument of confusion as the lascivious Ory, dressed as a nun, makes love to his own page by mistake. (The page, of course, is played by a woman; Rossini was gleefully testing the limits of convention.)
On Saturday night, the young cast was superb. Jan Grissom sang the Countess with a light but lucidly beautiful soprano tone, and Charles Workman had no trouble with the high tenor reaches of Ory. John Hancock, a baritone, delivered the jester role of Raimbaud with tremendous enthusiasm, stealing all his scenes. Victoria Livengood was boyishly compelling as the page Isolier. Michele Patzakis, Jane Gilbert, Thomas Hammons and Curt Peterson filled out the cast, and the Westminster Choir proved adept at physical comedy. Robert Duerr, a talented young conductor, drew a sharp performance from the Spoleto orchestra.
 
'Singing Child' by Menotti
 Finally, there was Mr. Menotti's "Singing Child," which had its premiere on May 31, and which I saw on Saturday afternoon. This 48-minute portrait of a child neglected by his wealthy parents follows in the footsteps of the ever-popular "Amahl and the Night Visitors," which remains a masterpiece in the field of American children's opera. The subject is something short of universal, but Mr. Menotti's dramatic instincts are reliable even on a small scale. Two members of the American Boychoir, William Cole and Harold Haughton, winningly played the unhappy boy and his imaginary singing friend; Maria Fenty gave comic breadth to the role of the nasty baby sitter.

HEADLINE: ON THE SET WITH: Sylvester Stallone;
All Right Already, No More Mr. Funny Guy

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
JOEL SILVER, the producer and maestro of those Lethal-Weapon-Die Hard-Predator action movies, bounds over to Sylvester Stallone on a glittering, futuristic movie set at Warner Brothers studios in Burbank.
"How's it going, big guy?" Mr. Silver asks.
The big guy grunts in reply. He has just pumped iron for 90 minutes. He has had his standard breakfast of a protein drink mixed with eight egg whites (but only two yolks) and a half cup of oatmeal and some rice. He drinks mineral water all day. 
 "I'm like a race horse," the 46-year-old movie star said later. "You eat the same thing, you get a similar kind of performance."
Mr. Stallone's latest adventure film, "Cliffhanger," is No. 1 at the box office, although it will most certainly be overtaken by Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic, "Jurassic Park," which opens this weekend. No matter. Sylvester Stallone is back on top after years of trying, in vain, to break away from the Rocky and Rambo movies that made him unusually rich, which he likes, and an unwitting symbol, which he detests.
"I ended up becoming very defensive," Mr. Stallone said, walking around the set of his new movie, "Demolition Man," which takes place in a weird 21st-century Los Angeles in which there is no crime and everyone is polite and refrains from smoking, drinking and using bad language. "The down side was, I, Sylvester Stallone, became synonymous with mindless, monosyllabic violence. I was reduced to this prehistoric, bestial caveman. People were taking this fictional character and putting him in realistic situations. It was like defending your religion -- you could never win. And the more I protested, the more foolish I looked."
He continued: "Remember when Reagan bombed Qaddafi? He said, 'After seeing Rambo, I know what to do.' And then Saddam used it in his bunker. He said, 'This is not Rambo.' Can you imagine? It became synonymous with a mindset. I became a . . . symbol. I was always worried when I traveled abroad. There were always a lot of threats. When I went to Cannes they said I'd be dead. When I would go to third world countries, it was not so pretty."
And did it hurt him in Hollywood, which takes its politics and causes so seriously?
"Silently, I think it did," Mr. Stallone said. "I don't think people would vocalize it because 'Rambo' was a commercial idea, but politically I wasn't invited to the more genteel events. I didn't realize how liberal the Hollywood community was. And if you're a Republican you really stand out. And I was a Republican by association. When I went to the White House -- that did it. I had been there under Carter. But when it was under Reagan -- ooohh." He waved an admonishing finger.
For "Demolition Man," the movie star is dressed in form-fitting black shirt and trousers for his role as Sgt. John Spartan, who is on the hunt for a psychopathic criminal played by Wesley Snipes. He seems to enjoy the camaraderie of the movie set, joking with the crew and actors. Now and then, he wanders off alone to his big trailer to make phone calls, to read the script, to rest.
Mr. Stallone's arms and muscles are, well, awesome. Yet he seems thin, with not a sliver of fat. "I'm exactly 5 feet 10 1/2 inches and I weigh 176," he said, seated on a chair on the set and waving as Mr. Snipes, in a blond wig, walked past. "When I'm doing a movie I eat the same thing every day. For lunch, it's tuna salad or chicken salad and cole slaw. That's it. For dinner it's either veal and rice, fish and rice or steak and rice. It gets boring, boy, does it get boring."
"Every morning I crawl out of bed," he went on, "I sit there and think, 'Do I really need this?' And I drag myself to the gym in my garage. It's not fun. I hate it. I work out alone. Weights. I got 25 different complicated machines and you're all alone and you're stiff and you still got sleep in your eyes and every bone in your body hurts and you look at the machine and you know there are 390 or 400 pounds on it and the heaviest thing you've been lifting for eight hours is a pillow. I do not like it."
Well, of course, there are compensations for all that heavy lifting. He earns $12.5 million to $15 million a picture.
Mr. Stallone was married 10 years and had two children before divorcing Sasha Stallone. He was briefly married to Brigitte Nielsen, and now his companion is Jennifer Flavin, a model. He lives in the style of a 1940's movie star, with homes in Malibu and the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles and a newly purchased mansion in the Coconut Grove area of Miami, where he plans to spend a lot of time.
"I'm not too bullish about L.A.," he said. "L.A. has some problems that are really unique unto itself and I don't they're reversible. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Ecological problems are horrific. There's organized gang warfare that makes Al Capone seem like a choir boy. People are being polarized -- black, white, Hispanic. And it's gotten to a point where everything has to be so politically correct, so diluted. Everyone is walking on eggshells. I don't think it's a place conducive to peace of mind."
Mr. Stallone -- "Sly" to virtually everyone -- moves before the cameras on the set of "Demolition Man." The director, Marco Brambilla, who is making his debut, is a youthful, Milan-born film maker who has spent years in Canada and the United States making commercials. Everyone is given cloth coverings for their shoes to keep the floors glistening on the sci-fi set.
Outside, on the sun-drenched lot, Mr. Stallone walks past his white Mercedes toward his trailer. He signs an autograph for a tourist, poses for a picture and kids around with a teen-age boy.
"I joke around on the set, deliberately," he said. "I know I can't play funny roles in movies. I tried and it didn't work. I don't see myself as Rocky or Rambo. I see myself, sometimes, as a funny guy. There's a different side to my personality. But when I tried to extend that image on screen I brought too much baggage with me. So I put my creative ego back in the suitcase.
"Some of it is obviously physical. Woody Allen wouldn't be believed as Rambo."
Mr. Stallone's career has been framed by Rocky and Rambo. In 1976, as an unknown, he wrote the screenplay for "Rocky" and starred in the movie. In 1982, with "First Blood," he portrayed John Rambo, a grunting, angry ex-Green Beret who flees a false arrest by some small-town cops. The Rocky and Rambo characters spawned a total of six sequels, and Mr. Stallone became an international star and director.
But Rocky and Rambo also imprisoned him. Efforts to do something different, in comedies like "Rhinestone" (1984) with Dolly Parton, "Oscar" (1991) and "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot" (1992), were major disappointments.
"I appreciate people reminding me that they were bombs," he said. "I don't look at them as bombs so much as eye-openers into the impact films have in stereotyping individuals. I'm a stereotype. I can't break away from that."
He attributes his inability to reach beyond adventure movies to his tough-guy style, his Noo Yawk accent and his thick muscles and voice. "My voice is deep, too deep for comedy," he said. "It's a dark voice. Definitely too low. Voices are like fingerprints, from Cagney to Bogart. They never lost it. My voice is instrumental in categorizing me."
Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger began taking over the action genre.
"Yeah, I think we're competitive," he said. "We've talked about this. We're kind of like Ali and Frazier. LaMotta and Sugar Ray. Arnold and Sly. Arnold's been nice. He was very complimentary at the opening of 'Cliffhanger.' I'm going to his movie this Sunday." (Mr. Stallone is partners with Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose new movie is "Last Action Hero," and with Bruce Willis, among others, in the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.)
In "Cliffhanger," Mr. Stallone gives a restrained, even vulnerable, performance as a National Park Service ranger fighting an evil international bunch on a snowy mountaintop. The film, shot in the Italian Alps, has generally earned positive reviews.
That film's success is, he says, a validation. "It's a wake-up call for me," he said. "I've got to do what audiences expect me to do. Let's face it, there was a bond between me and Rocky and Rambo. Over the years, it became difficult to tell the fictional and real characters apart. When I try to exert some artistic leverage and show the other side of my personality, it's rejected. O.K., I accept it."
Mr. Stallone's next film after "Demolition Man" will probably be what he calls an erotic drama and adventure, tentatively called "Fair Game." He is working on the movie with Mr. Silver.
As he discussed the new venture, he knew he sounded like a character out of "The Player," the scathing movie about Hollywood in which every new movie is succinctly characterized with references to previous movies.
"The new movie," he said, laughing, "is 'Body Heat' on wheels."

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Diary

 BODY:

DEAR Diary:
Walking along Sixth Avenue, headed for CBS the other morning, I was confronted by a gray-haired woman in a raincoat and carrying an umbrella. She said, "You're Frank Field and you said it was going to be a nice day and that the dark clouds would clear."
I said, "Yes, it is going to be a nice day and the dark clouds will clear."
She said, "No, they won't."
I said: "Yes, they will. Trust me."
She replied: "I'll bet you a dollar they won't. It's going to rain."
I said: "O.K. You have a bet." With that we went our respective ways.
I had forgotten all about the incident until a few days later, when I opened a letter and a dollar fell out. There was also a note: "Enclosed find $1 for the bet we made yesterday concerning rain. I lost! I am not a deadbeat." It was signed, "The gray-headed lady you met."
I am going to send the lady a thank-you note and tell her I knew she wouldn't welsh on the bet and I am going to contribute her dollar to a charity. -- FRANK FIELD

Dear Diary:
The scene was my local video store in Greenwich Village, where I asked for a film just released on tape, a movie it seemed everyone but me had seen.
Clerk: "Howards" what?
Me: "End."
Clerk, scanning computer screen: Nope. But we've got "Howard the Duck" and Howard Stern.
Me: No thanks. I can wait. I've waited this long. -- BILL HARTFORD

Dear Diary:
Reading about the paint-smeared fur coats that demonstrators recently wore to protest the showings of fall furs, I considered how New York attitudes had changed from those of the city I knew in childhood.
Back then, it would not have seemed possible that women would protest the wearing of fur coats, which were the sine qua non of status.
My mother, who grew up poor in the Bronx, married a guy who made lots of money and liked to show her off. Dad always got the best and lots of it for his smart-mouth doll. Eventually the walk-in closets were so full that the doors flew open without warning. So some nice outdated coats and stoles found their way up to the Bronx, to my grandmother and the aunts.
My grandmother kept Mother's furs carefully. (We might be poor again and need to sell them.) She sewed threadbare sheets into protective dust-covers for them. She wore them only on holidays, for picture-taking, or when she was bidden downtown to dine with Mother and Dad.
My grandfather was a frequently unemployed cartoonist, and those furs had been a long time in coming to her. Grandmother was not about to give them over to the coat-check girl. She clutched the furs tightly, and carefully folded them inside out. She had the bearings of a duchess, but she knew the value of things.
Dad was a well-known sports figure and it embarrassed him to be seen with a woman who looked like a million but acted as if someone were going to steal her coat.
Dad told Mother, so Mother told Grandmother: "Take it easy. Act rich. Be casual. Drape the furs. Be theatrical. Think Barbara Stanwyck, Lizabeth Scott, Bette Davis."
Next monthly dinner, Dad chose Dinty Moore's, a former speakeasy in the theater district. The maitre d'hotel led the way to my parents' table and behind them marched my unhappy, martyred little grandmother. Her head high, her fist clutching the collar of her mink coat with great purpose, she trailed it behind her, cutting a swath through the sawdust. -- SHEILA SHIKI y MICHAELS

Dear Diary:
This morning, at the tail end of rush hour, a Manhattan-bound No. 5 train pulled into Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn. A little dog trotted through the open door, spotted a comfortable place under a seat and settled down.
A few minutes later, the train drew to a stop at Brooklyn Bridge. The doors opened, the dog looked up matter of factly and exited the train.
"I suppose this is where his office is," one rider said.
I say: Listen, it's a dog-eat-dog world. -- BONNIE HILLER

 	 	 		. . .	 	Place: A bookstore in a Huntington, L.I., mall.
Dramatis personae: Sales clerk and her customer.
Customer: Where would I find Dorothy Parker?
Clerk, hesitantly: Dorothy Parker?
Customer: You know, the Round Table.
Clerk: The Round Table? Pause. Then, triumphantly: Oh, of course! King Arthur! Try the history section, over there.
Dorothy, alas, was nowhere to be found. -- ELLIE FLINKER ADIEL

HEADLINE: The Golden Venture, Plus 100,000

 BODY:
The four-month nightmare voyage of the Golden Venture ended Sunday morning when the tramp freighter dumped its starving and frightened cargo of nearly 300 Chinese immigrants into frigid waters off one of New York City's most popular public beaches. Six passengers died from drowning or exposure, several had to be hospitalized and the remainder were sent to detention centers to await Federal hearings.
But for the estimated 100,000 illegal Chinese immigrants who arrive each year, mostly to New York, the nightmare typically goes on and on. The $3,000 down payment they make to "snakehead" smugglers before departure -- several years' earnings for a typical Chinese -- covers barely a tenth of what they must ultimately pay to travel huddled below deck for months without adequate food or sanitation. The remaining money must be paid off through years of indentured servitude -- virtual slavery -- in Chinese restaurants and sweatshops. 
 For the immigrants, it's a cruel deception of the hopes that lured them from China in expectation of a "golden land" of easy affluence. For New York area law enforcement officials it's an explosive problem, as the Asian gangs and freelance criminals profiting from this human traffic grow increasingly rich, brazen and violent. And for Washington it's another warning -- after the Haitian fiasco -- that America's ad hoc asylum policies have slipped out of whack with post-cold-war realities.
Given the probable size of recent illegal Chinese immigration, the numbers of indentured laborers in the New York area must be huge indeed, certainly reaching the tens of thousands. City, state and Federal labor inspectors must make greater efforts to uncover scandalous labor conditions now masked by the terror of victimized workers, language barriers and an insular Chinatown culture. Specifically that will require recruitment and training efforts aimed at increasing the number of inspectors and law enforcement agents who speak the Chinese dialects used by most of the new immigrants.
Cracking down on the gangs and immigrant brokers will be especially difficult, given their decentralized nature. But it must be done. Almost weekly now, new reports surface of immigrants held hostage in warehouses. And last month's deadly shootout in Teaneck shows the escalating potential for tragedy. Trafficking in humans is now said to offer easier profits than trafficking in drugs, and the penalties faced by those caught are much lighter, an anomaly that needs to be corrected.
Finally, well-intended Federal asylum policies have unwittingly encouraged widespread illegal Chinese immigration. Four years ago George Bush ordered that asylum be granted to those who left China to escape Beijing's harsh rule of one child per family. That claim could plausibly be made by hundreds of millions of Chinese who would not otherwise be considered political refugees.
The vast majority, perhaps 95 percent, of illegal immigrants from China enter the U.S. undetected and never see a Federal immigration officer. But of those who do, virtually all now claim asylum, and an astonishing 80 percent of those claims are approved, many times the percentage for other national groups. When word of the lenient new American policy got back to provincial China, departures for the U.S. began to surge dramatically. By some indicators there has been a tenfold increase in just the past two years.
One answer on the Federal level would be to subject these asylum claims based on the single-child policy to stricter standards of proof that actual persecution might take place. Another would be to expedite the hearings while preserving due process. Asylum claims now take about 18 months to evaluate, during which many claimants simply disappear into the general population. Washington could also work with Chinese authorities to publicize the indentured servitude and bleak prospects facing illegals in the United States, thus deflating the false hopes that fuel the boom in smuggling of human cargo.
It's unrealistic to pretend that illegal immigration from China, or anywhere else, can be completely halted. Economic incentives at both ends of the traffic are just too powerful. But it should be possible to reduce it to the more manageable levels that prevailed before 1991. The alternative is not just tolerating more Golden Ventures. It's tolerating slavery, in New York, in 1993.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Increase As OPEC Meets in Geneva

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures rose yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but finished off the day's highs as a result of continued disagreement among members of OPEC over limits on production.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting in Geneva to set third-quarter production levels and to allocate member quotas. 
 Light sweet crude oil for July delivery settled 11 cents higher at $19.65 a barrel. July heating oil was 0.13 cent higher at 53.71 cents a gallon. July unleaded gasoline was 0.03 cent higher at 56.15 cents a gallon, and July natural gas was 9 cents cent higher at $2.129 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Energy futures gained in early trading on reports from Geneva that Saudi Arabia would insist on compliance with OPEC quotas and that more oil should not be put onto the market. That was a reversal of the Saudi position on Monday, when the country's representatives said they would accept some tinkering with production quotas.
 
Kuwaitis Reject Plan
 The Kuwaitis said they would refuse to accept a 200,000-barrel-a-day increase in their third-quarter quota, which has been suggested as a way to pacify Kuwait. It is pushing for an increase of 400,000 barrels a day in its current supply quota of 1.6 million barrels a day.
The emirate, rebounding from the Persian Gulf war damage to its oilfields, wants to earn extra money to pay off the $50 billion costs of the conflict and rebuild its oil industry.
Recent reports estimate that the dozen nations of OPEC increased pumping last month. In May, the nations pumped 600,000 barrels a day above the current crude ceiling of 23.6 million barrels a day, according to the reports.
Jim Turner, an analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in New Jersey, said that despite the market's higher close, it settled in a downtrend. He noted that although the expiration of the July contract was weeks away, investors were bailing out in large numbers.
"To be in a spot month during an OPEC meeting is gambling," Mr. Turner said.

Jim Turner, an analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in New Jersey, said that despite the market's higher close, it settled in a downtrend. He noted that although the expiration of the July contract was weeks away, investors were bailing out in large numbers.
"To be in a spot month during an OPEC meeting is gambling," Mr. Turner said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Increase As OPEC Meets in Geneva

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures rose yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but finished off the day's highs as a result of continued disagreement among members of OPEC over limits on production.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting in Geneva to set third-quarter production levels and to allocate member quotas. 
 Light sweet crude oil for July delivery settled 11 cents higher at $19.65 a barrel. July heating oil was 0.13 cent higher at 53.71 cents a gallon. July unleaded gasoline was 0.03 cent higher at 56.15 cents a gallon, and July natural gas was 9 cents cent higher at $2.129 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Energy futures gained in early trading on reports from Geneva that Saudi Arabia would insist on compliance with OPEC quotas and that more oil should not be put onto the market. That was a reversal of the Saudi position on Monday, when the country's representatives said they would accept some tinkering with production quotas.
 
Kuwaitis Reject Plan
 The Kuwaitis said they would refuse to accept a 200,000-barrel-a-day increase in their third-quarter quota, which has been suggested as a way to pacify Kuwait. It is pushing for an increase of 400,000 barrels a day in its current supply quota of 1.6 million barrels a day.
The emirate, rebounding from the Persian Gulf war damage to its oilfields, wants to earn extra money to pay off the $50 billion costs of the conflict and rebuild its oil industry.
Recent reports estimate that the dozen nations of OPEC increased pumping last month. In May, the nations pumped 600,000 barrels a day above the current crude ceiling of 23.6 million barrels a day, according to the reports.

HEADLINE: Whitman Pursues 'Family Business'

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 8

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman tonight won both the Republican nomination for governor and a place in New Jersey political history.
In her quest for the governor's office, Mrs. Whitman has presented herself as a political outsider. In truth, given her family background, it would have been surprising if she did not go into politics. 
 She was exposed from childhood to a circle of powerful people and every recounting of her biography includes the story of how, at the age of 14, she sold lemonade to raise money for the 1960 Presidential campaign of Richard M. Nixon, the father of two of her childhood friends.
 
Challenges Bill Bradley
 Nearly 30 years later, when Mrs. Whitman decided to buck the odds and to challenge the seemingly invincible Democratic Senator Bill Bradley, the reclusive Mr. Nixon helped raise money for her campaign.
While contacts like these gave her a head start, she built her campaign for governor from the ground up, crisscrossing the state this year in a leased 1992 Mercury Sable, locking up endorsements from many county leaders before her opponents got on the road at all.
The 46-year-old is an adroit politician whose strongest asset is an affable style. That has helped offset the elitist image that her Republican primary opponents tried to paste on her, not the least by reminding voters that she has never held a job in the private sector.
Tonight at Mrs. Whitman's victory celebration in East Brunswick, her brother, Webster B. Todd Jr., suggested that such criticism was off the mark.
"Politics really is the family business and she's continuing a job in the family business that she started with dad and Eisenhower when she was just a little kid," said Mr. Todd, a Montana rancher and former member of the New Jersey Assembly.
That family business will get even more family involvement soon if Mr. Todd, a volunteer adviser to his sister's primary campaign, takes on a bigger role in the fall race, as many people expect.
Mrs. Whitman's father, the late Webster B. Todd, was Republican state chairman for a decade, a major figure in the national G.O.P. and an adviser to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Her mother, the late Eleanor Schley Todd, was a Republican national committeewoman and leader of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.
Mr. Todd was a building contractor whose projects included Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall and historical Williamsburg, Va. It enabled him to amass a personal fortune, which he frequently used to bankroll Republican campaigns and which gave his children the luxury to dabble in politics and public service.
Her marriage to John Whitman, a financier, placed her in another equally impressive political family and sphere.
Mr. Whitman is the grandson of Charles S. Whitman Sr., the governor of New York from 1914 to 1916. His father, Charles S. Whitman Jr., was a Circuit Court judge in New York.
John and Christine Whitman have two children, 16-year-old Kate and 14-year-old Taylor.
Mrs. Whitman graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in government, and went to work for the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity and later the Republican National Committee.
 
First Bid for Office
 In 1982, she made her first bid for political office, a seat on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders, the governing body for the county. She won and was re-elected in 1985, serving a total of five years before Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her in 1988 to serve as president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
Still, she was largely unknown outside of Republican circles when she decided to run against Mr. Bradley in 1990. She easily won the Republican nomination, in a large part because most better known politicians thought it foolhardy to challenge the immensely popular Mr. Bradley, a former National Basketball Association star player and a Rhodes Scholar.
Focusing her campaign on Mr. Bradley's refusal to comment on a $2.8 billion tax increase pushed through the Legislature by a fellow Democrat, Gov. Jim Florio, Mrs. Whitman came with two percentage points or less than 59,000 votes of beating the incumbent.
It immediately propelled her into statewide prominence and made her the favorite to capture the G.O.P.'s gubernatorial nomination in 1993.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 12, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on Wednesday about Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican nominee for governor in New Jersey, misstated the term served by her husband's grandfather, Charles S. Whitman Sr., as Governor of New York. It was 1915 through 1918.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Post Modest Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday in light trading, accomplishing little more than making up the losses of the day before, traders said.
"There seems to be a pattern of reversing the previous day's move when we are in a thin market" and there is no new economic data to trade on, said Alan Levenson, the money market economist at UBS Securities. 
 "It is like the third week in August," he added, referring to the light trading of the summer doldrums. "To say that it is quiet is an understatement."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond due in February 2023 was up 14/32 point, to 1033/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.88 percent. On Tuesday, the price of the bond fell 16/32 and the yield rose to 6.91 percent.
The price of the two-year Treasury note was up 2/32, which pulled the yield down to 4.28 percent, reversing the 2/32 -point decline the day before.
 
 
No Major Economic Data
 There were no major economic data released yesterday. And it did not appear that the efforts in Washington to reach a compromise on the President's deficit reduction plan had any significant impact on the market because it was still too early to tell what the outcome of negotiations would be.
The focus continued to be on the next two inflation reports, the May Producer Price Index, which will be released tomorrow, and the May Consumer Price Index, which will follow on Tuesday.
It appeared that forecasters were not expecting the kind of bad news on inflation that jolted the bond market last month, when the April consumer price report showed that inflation this year was running at an annual rate of 4.3 percent. If these forecasts are right, the Federal Reserve may be able to hold off for another month on deciding whether to raise short-term interest rates as a signal of its determination to resist rising prices.
Mr. Levenson was expecting a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Producer Price Index for finished goods and a three-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index. "These are fairly benign numbers," he said, adding that the risk is that the Producer Price Index would be higher while the Consumer Price Index would be lower.
Michael A. Strauss, the chief economist at Yamaichi International, said he expected the Producer Price Index for finished goods to rise one-tenth of 1 percent and the Consumer Price Index to increase by two-tenths of 1 percent. He said that the cut in brand-name cigarette prices last month would not help lower prices in May because the prices of generic cigarettes had risen and seasonal adjustment factors were likely to make tobacco prices a little higher.
Neither Mr. Levenson nor Mr. Strauss expected that the increases in the two key inflation barometers would be enough to force the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. The Fed has indicated recently that it has shifted its position to a bias toward higher interest rates because of the sharp rise in inflation during the first four months of the year.
 
 
Retail Sales
 Mr. Strauss said that in the end, retail sales data for May, which will also be released tomorrow, might be more important than the inflation figures.
He expected sales to rise by about 1 percent, in part because of the recent rebound in automobile sales. If the number is at this level it could be another strong indication that the economy in the second quarter is growing at a 3 percent annual rate rather than a pace closer to the nine-tenths of 1 percent creep for the first quarter of the year.
Proof that the economy is moving ahead at this faster pace would make the inflation data -- even if subdued -- a little more troublesome. With an economy picking up momentum it would become less likely that inflation could slow enough in the second half of the year to take the worry on prices out of the market.

Fed Approves Acquisitions by Bank of Boston

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board allowed the Bank of Boston Corporation yesterday to buy two New England banks, even though three Fed governors publicly objected to the approval of one acquisition.
The board had initially voted June 1 to reject Bank of Boston's bid to acquire the Multibank Financial Corporation, a chain of local banks based in Dedham, Mass., with $2.36 billion in assets. But the board reconsidered the proposal after the Bank of Boston, which has $32 billion in assets, agreed to raise $170 million in new capital.
 
Revised Application Opposed
 Three Federal Reserve governors, David W. Mullins Jr., Edward W. Kelley Jr. and Lawrence Lindsey, abstained from the vote on the Multibank acquisition. They later released a sharply worded dissent saying that the Bank of Boston should not have been allowed to modify its capital plan after the application was submitted. 
 The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and three governors -- Wayne D. Angell, John P. LaWare and Susan Phillips -- voted for the Multibank acquisition. All seven voted to approve the Bank of Boston's purchase of the Society for Savings in Hartford, which has $2.4 billion in assets.
In their dissent to the Multibank purchase, the three governors wrote, "Our abstention reflects our strong dissatisfaction with the way in which this application was considered."
The Bank of Boston "had ample opportunity prior to the time that this matter was scheduled to make changes to its proposal," the three dissenters said. Allowing banks to change proposals after the board has considered them "would encourage applicants to submit marginal proposals and then attempt to negotiate an acceptable proposal directly with the board."
The Bank of Boston has been recovering from severe problems stemming from the New England recession. The bank reported losses of $394 million in 1990 and 27 million in 1991. But it earned $263 million last year.
Both Multibank and Society for Savings were also hurt by the region's poor economy, although their condition has also been improving.
 
Capital Level a Concern
 Bank of Boston reported Tier 1 Risk adjusted capital of 7.15 percent. Tier 1 capital is one of the key measures of financial strength used by the regulators. While that level is more than the 6 percent minimum, the bank ranks 46th of the country's top 50 banks in Tier 1 capital.
While the two purchases would not greatly reduce the bank's capital, the Fed said in a statement, they would lessen the Bank of Boston's "capacity to serve as a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries."
"New capital should be maintained to meet the unexpected problems in BBC's subsidiary banks if necessary," the Fed said.
Charles K. Gifford, Bank of Boston's president, said that he did not think "we were by any means undercapitalized before the $170 million" in new capital. But he said that the new capital would further strengthen the Bank of Boston's reserves. He declined to comment on its dealing with the Federal Reserve.
Lawyers and investment bankers familiar with the deal said that the Federal Reserve staff asked the Bank of Boston to modify its proposal to include more capital and that bank officials refused, agreeing only after they learned of the initial rejection of the application. It is unusual for banks to learn of rejected applications before they are made public and more unusual for the bank to be allowed to change its submission.
 
A 'Board Tradition'
 "It is board tradition that once a proposal is submitted it can't be modified or changed," said Michael Bradfield, a partner with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and a former general counsel of the Federal Reserve. "The board doesn't want applicants testing it."
The issue is more one of style and personality in the relations between the bank and the Federal Reserve than one of financial substance.
"Experienced acquirers know how to deal with the Fed," said a lawyer familiar with the Federal Reserve. "If you get the hint, you take it. You don't take a chance for $50 or $100 million," he said.
The new capital, while only modestly adding to the bank's cushion against problems, has little additional cost for the bank. Bank of Boston reported total capital of $3.6 billion at the end of 1992. It plans to issue $70 million in preferred stock and $100 million in subordinated debt that will carry combined interest cost of about $12 million a year, investment bankers estimated.

HEADLINE: Budget Talks With Mayor In a Standoff

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Four days after the City Charter deadline for adopting a new budget, talks between the City Council and the Dinkins administration degenerated yesterday into a schoolyard standoff. The two sides spent the day finger-pointing and saber-rattling, but failed to make progress on the three main issues dividing them.
The Council Speaker said the standoff was the Mayor's fault for leaving City Hall the other night when, in the Speaker's view, a deal was at hand. But the Mayor's staff said the Council had derailed the deal by insisting on last-minute concessions that the Mayor could not accept. 
 Both sides resumed talks last night to try to put a deal back together.
Under the City Charter, the Council is required to adopt a budget by June 5 to leave ample time to prepare for the start of the new fiscal year on July 1. But in fact the city misses the deadline far more often than it makes it, with no practical effect. Several fiscal experts said last week that it did not worry them if the Council missed the deadline, as long as the added time leads to a better budget.
 
Service Cuts Debated
 The dispute in recent days has focused not on the bulk of the city's mammoth $31 billion spending plan but on a disagreement over service cuts affecting less than 1 percent of the budget, a philosophical dispute over a new agency for the homeless and an institutional battle over who will oversee a new quasi-public corporation to build health clinics.
For six days, the two sides have been trying to find a way to fill a $300 million budget gap that opened up because Mayor David N. Dinkins had been too optimistic about how much Federal and state aid to count on.
Before the talks stalled early Tuesday, negotiators agreed to a package of $250 million in savings from some modest spending cuts, delays in programs, revenue re-estimates and a partial hiring freeze, Council and administration officials said.
But the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the Mayor could not agree on the last $50 million in spending cuts necessary to close the gap. Complicating matters, the Council insisted that the adminstration find other revenues or alternative savings that would allow lawmakers to restore nearly $40 million in cuts to parks, centers for the elderly, day care and other high-profile services.
Another major sticking point has been a new agency for the homeless proposed by the Mayor. So far, the Council has refused to approve the new agency, which would cost $8 million to start up and would replace several divisions in the Human Resources Administration, unless Mr. Dinkins agrees to restore some of the cuts that Council members hold dear.
The Council has also raised objections to another of the Mayor's pet proposals: the Primary Care Development Corporation, a quasi-public entity that would use city-guaranteed bonds to build 30 new health clinics.
Mr. Vallone, who has long advocated that the Council oversee public corporations like the Water Authority and Economic Development Corporation, has insisted the Council have some say in how the new agency operates. The corporation would use $17 million in city taxes to start up.
With no accord in sight yesterday, Mr. Vallone threatened that the Council would pass its own budget on Monday if a compromise cannot be forged by then. In response, Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said Mr. Dinkins could use an arcane part of the City Charter to rule that the budget was out of balance and force the Council to cut spending or raise taxes.
Mr. Vallone said the negotiations had suffered a serious setback at 1:20 A.M. on Tuesday, when Mr. Dinkins abruptly broke off negotiations with the Council and walked out of City Hall. Moments earlier, the two sides had been close to an agreement, the Speaker said, but the Mayor destroyed the momentum of the talks.
"I really believe this would have been over and done with by 5 in the morning if all the principals had remained," Mr. Vallone said.
But a senior mayoral aide said the Council had caused the breakdown in talks. Earlier in the evening, the Mayor had agreed to restore $40 million in proposed cuts and the Council had said it would approve the new homeless agency, the aide said.
But that deal was scuttled when the Council refused to budge on its request for oversight over the health corporation and suggested giving the homeless agency only $2 million. Mr. Dinkins interpreted those proposals as signs that the Council was not negotiating in good faith and broke off the talks, the aide said.
Mr. Vallone said yesterday that the Council was willing to approve the new agency on the condition that it could be dismantled after two years if the Council finds it lacking. He said the funds could be negotiated. He also said he favored taking the health corporation out of the budget and passing it in separate legislation later.
But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the two sides remained far apart on how to cut the final $50 million needed to balance the budget. Mr. Dinkins's current position is that he will not talk about restorations until the Council agrees to find the last cuts to close the deficit. "We have said the first job for all of us is to get to $300 million," Mr. Steisel said.
Marc V. Shaw, the Council budget director, said both sides were meeting last night to try to resurrect the accord that fell apart. "What we're tring to do is to put back together the deal that almost occurred," he said.

HEADLINE: Tirana Journal;
'Hallelujah' Is Heard in the Arch-Atheist's Temple

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania

 BODY:
If Enver Hoxha, Albania's dictator for more than 40 years, is turning in his monumental grave on a hillside above this capital, it would not be surprising.
On the steps of the spectacular marble-and-glass structure resembling a winged pyramid that was built to honor the man who made Albania the only country that outlawed religion, men and women who said they came from the Foursquare Gospel Church of Los Angeles were laying hands on shattered limbs, blind eyes and aching bodies the other day, and with many a "Praise the Lord!" and "Hallelujah!" prayed for healing. 
 True, the police barred their way into the building on the ground that the crowd seeking to enter was too big for the former Hoxha Museum, now the Hall of International Culture. And the police finally made the members of various groups of reborn Christians from the United States, Canada, Romania and the Netherlands, who held several days of meetings devoted to healing through faith, disperse from the steps.
But their outdoor rallies met no obstacles, and the many disabled people who gathered at the former shrine of atheism proved by their presence the effectiveness of religious propaganda in post-Communist Albania and the completeness of the break with the past, in which Albania ranked with North Korea as the most dogmatic and reclusive of Communist nations. The gatherings also bore witness to the inadequacy of medical services in this deprived country.
Albania's last census, before the Italian invasion of 1939, showed the population to have been 70 percent Muslim and virtually all the rest Orthodox or Roman Catholic. Religious practice in this land of 3.2 million people is reviving today; most Albanians questioned say they consider themselves nonpracticing Muslims.
Many here still call the Boulevard of the Martyrs of the Nation, on which the former museum stands, Stalin Boulevard because of the larger-than-life statue of the dictator that adorned it. Today, a privately owned coffee bar has been erected in front of it, hiding its empty pedestal. Across the street, where Lenin's likeness once towered, the pedestal has been decorated with a tribute from a spray can to Pink Floyd.
The boulevard runs through the center of this city of 200,000 from the vast square on which stands the Tirana Hotel, a grim example of the massive, featureless Communist architecture of the 1960's, to the university, a specimen of the Fascist style that dominated in the 1930's, even before Italy occupied Albania.
In the Communist era, the broad avenue about half a mile long was the image of Hoxha's Albania. There were the statues and soulless buildings housing the all-powerful party leadership, the Government, the Presidency and the feared Ministries of Internal Security and Defense.
There were neither houses in which people lived nor shops. There was no private trade -- just as there were no lawyers, because Albania's Communist society was deemed so perfectly just that they were not needed.
Police officers and soldiers bearing automatic rifles at the ready kept pedestrians at respectful distances from the houses of power. The rare cars in a country that had no privately owned vehicles conveyed the leaders between villas and offices.
The buildings still stand, and armed soldiers still guard the ministries. But they no longer inspire awe.
In midafternoon on these warm days, pedestrians take over the boulevard. Young and old, whispering lovers and boisterous teen-agers, humanize the charmless thoroughfare by being themselves despite a setting that was meant to intimidate.
The end-of-day promenade had not stopped in the Communist years, but the flow of strollers was kept at a distance from the halls of the mighty by the guards, and this cast a pall over gaiety. Albanians say the scene was monotonous because of the virtual uniformity of dress in a country that offered modest, dark or white clothing in a few standard models.
Nowadays, strollers treasure eccentricity in dress and carry the messages of the T-shirt culture.
Albanians marvel at what seem to them multitudes of private cars, mainly old vehicles that failed safety checks in other countries. But cars are still few enough for the curbs on both sides to be lined with people sitting to chat.
Along the sidewalks, private dealers lay out small quantities of illegally imported candy bars, cookies, soft drinks and beer and sacks of dried pumpkin seed. The poverty of this largely unemployed city can be measured by perhaps 20 sellers waiting until late in the evening with a stock whose total value, for the length of the boulevard, would fall short of three digits in dollars.
Comza Gjeci sells rarer goods. On sheets of newspapers, he displays books -- novels of Albanian and foreign writers deemed publishable by the former authorities and, even rarer, books from earlier days in foreign languages that Albanians kept, often hidden because the old leaders considered them "bourgeois."
The 63-year-old retired teacher and his wife, whose joint monthly pensions total less than $30, share their two-room apartment, plus a small room rented nearby, with their three grown children and their families, 10 people in all. None have regular jobs. Mr. Gjeci does not want to sell his own books yet, he said, so he buys books others are forced to part with in this time of need.
"When I take their books, it seems to me I take their hearts," he said.

HEADLINE: Administration Rethinking Mental-Health Coverage

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Concerns about cost have forced the Administration to reconsider its initial plan to provide open-ended, comprehensive insurance coverage for treatment of mental disorders under President Clinton's health program.
The cost and scope of mental health benefits have become a subject of impassioned debate inside the Government and have generated some tension between Tipper Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Administration officials say. 
 Mrs. Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, has led those arguing for generous benefits without limits on the number of visits to psychiatrists and psychologists. Mental health experts working for the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform generally agree with Mrs. Gore, who has training in psychology and advised the task force on mental health issues. But Mrs. Clinton, the head of the task force, recently expressed doubt about "the political and financial feasibility" of such extensive coverage.
In view of concerns about the overall cost of Mr. Clinton's plan and the cost of mental health benefits in particular, the White House has drafted alternative proposals that would limit coverage for psychotherapy sessions and hospital care of people with mental disorders.
 
Fighting Discrimination
 Mrs. Gore has repeatedly opposed such limits. "We're fighting to end discrimination against diseases of the mind, to treat mental illness on a par with physical illness," she told the American Psychiatric Association last month.
Aides to Mrs. Gore said she still hoped to convince President Clinton that generous insurance coverage for the treatment of mental disorders, drug addiction and alcoholism would not cause overuse of those services or an explosive increase in costs.
Indeed, the staff of the task force concluded that treatment for depression and other emotional disorders ultimately saved money by increasing workers' productivity and reducing homelessness, crime and the need for costly hospitalization.
A senior White House official called the open-ended benefit "better health policy" but added, "The actuaries' initial estimates indicate that it has a significantly higher cost, and we want to be very conservative."
Data from the United States and Canada suggest that people make limited use of mental health services even when generous insurance coverage is available. Dr. Darrel A. Regier, chief epidemiologist at the National Institute of Mental Health, said that half of the people using such services reported seven or fewer visits to mental health specialists in a year, while 80 percent had 25 visits or fewer.
Dr. Marvin Margolis, a psychoanalyst in Detroit, said: "It's just too painful. Most people with serious emotional problems avoid long-term psychoanalytic treatments because they find it too disturbing to confront unconscious conflicts that originated in early childhood. They prefer short-term treatments that provide support, counseling and advice."
Richard C. Surles, the Mental Health Commissioner of New York State, said that only 6 percent of the state's 2.8 million Medicaid recipients used mental health services last year.
"Claims that a comprehensive mental health benefit will break the bank are not correct, based on our experience, and our Medicaid program has the most liberal mental health benefits in the country," Dr. Surles said.
Under the proposal recommended by Mrs. Gore, described in confidential work papers from the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, treatment would be guaranteed to all people with a diagnosable mental disorder that "poses a serious risk for functional impairment in family, work, school or community activities."
The disorder would have to meet criteria in the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association.
Robert O. Boorstin, a spokesman for the task force, said mental and physical illnesses should be covered under the same rules. But he said, "There's a real problem because health economists and actuaries disagree over how much mental health benefits will cost."
Because of the uncertainty about cost and financing, Administration officials are considering several alternatives that would set limits on mental health coverage.
Under one proposal, they said, mental patients would have hospital coverage for 30 days at a time, with a maximum of 90 days a year. For a certain number of visits to the office of a psychotherapist, perhaps 10 or 15, patients would have to pay 20 percent of the cost, the same proportion as for the treatment of physical illnesses. But for additional visits, patients would have to pay 50 percent of the cost.
Federal officials are also considering limits on rehabilitation services, which help people with severe mental illnesses adjust to life in the community. Chris Koyanagi, a lobbyist at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, said: "That's a very short-sighted approach. Without such services, people deteriorate and need more expensive and intensive care in hospitals."
The proposal for comprehensive coverage assumes that existing Federal and state mental health programs will be blended. Moreover, it assumes that state and local governments will maintain current levels of spending in a new health-care system to be designed largely by the Federal Government.
"The current state and local investment in alcoholism, drug abuse and mental health services must be retained in the new system to make it financially viable without a major infusion of new Federal funds," the work papers say.
But state officials have balked at turning over state revenues to the Federal Government. To pay for comprehensive mental health care without the state money, the Federal Government would have to set higher premiums for employers and employees, raising new obstacles to political acceptance of the President's plan.
Dr. Bernard S. Arons, leader of the mental health team working for the White House, said state and local government agencies spend $16 billion a year on mental health and drug-abuse services. If that money is available to pay for benefits under Mr. Clinton's plan, Administration officials say, the Federal Government could set a premium of $300 a year for mental health benefits, representing 10 percent of the total premium of $3,000.
But, they said, if the state money is not available, the premium for comprehensive mental health services would more than double, to $700 a year, and the overall premium would be $3,400.
Small-business lobbyists have told the White House that they are concerned about the cost of such benefits.
Leslie J. Aubin, a health-policy analyst at the National Federation of Independent Business, said: "Mental health coverage is very important for some people. But if you include a high level of mental health coverage, you run a risk that the package of benefits will become too rich. If it becomes too rich, it's not affordable any longer."

HEADLINE: U.S. Experts Say 'Safe Havens' Won't Help Much

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
American intelligence officials have told the White House that the plan to create "safe havens" for the besieged Muslims in Bosnia would do little in the long run beyond creating six impoverished refugee compounds with limited law and order and no economic future, a senior Clinton Administration intelligence analyst said today.
And the official said there is little hope of restoring a single Bosnian state along the lines of the plan developed by Lord Owen and Cyrus R. Vance. He added that the most likely outcome is the partition of the country into Muslim, Serbian and Croatian areas. 
 The bleak assessment of Bosnia's future came as as Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with European Community foreign ministers in Luxembourg and restated American support of the "safe haven" plan in an effort to create the impression of Western unity on policy toward the Balkans.
The plan was endorsed by the United States and its allies after Mr. Christopher, on an earlier trip, failed to persuade the allies to go along with the Administration's plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims and use air power to protect them.
 
A Way to Slow the Killing
 The Administration and its allies have portrayed the safe havens as a way to slow the killing while the West uses economic pressure to roll back the Serbs' gains and persuade them to go along with the peace plan negotiated by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen.
Under the "division of labor" worked out by the allies, the United States would use air power to protect ground forces sent by European and other nations to defend the enclaves.
But the senior Administration official, who spoke to reporters today on the condition of anonymity, painted a generally pessimistic picture of the proposals that had been put forward to bring peace to Bosnia.
He said the plan for six safe havens was at best a stopgap measure, and would not stabilize the situation in Bosnia over the long term. And he declared the Vance-Owen plan to be essentially dead.
"I think the view that Vance-Owen as now written is not viable is probably fairly broadly shared," the senior official said, referring to the assessments sent by American intelligence analysts. "And the view that safe havens involve extrordinary problems of managing refugees over the long run without logistical support is also probably broadly shared."
Both views have been communicated to the White House and other top decision makers, the official added.
In some ways, the comments by the senior official did not depart radically from Administration policy. The Administration has always described the safe haven plan as a short-term expedient and has begun to talk about the need to "build on" the Vance-Owen plan instead of implementing it as drafted.
But Clinton Administration spokesmen appeared to be concerned with the vivid way in which the senior official described the drawbacks of the safe haven plan, as well as his assessment that the partitioning of Bosnia was the most likely outcome.
The official, for example, described the safe haven plan as a "polka dot solution" that would lead to the creation of six burgeoning refugee camps plagued by crime, animosities between long-term residents and the influx of new Muslim refugess.
By creating safe havens, he said, the West will "wind up owning six little West Banks in Western Europe with enormous problems."
Trying to bring food to the camps past Serbian forces under the restrictive rules of engagement used by United Nations peackeepers would be a problem, and the enclaves would have no economic future, he said.
"If it is the short run, I think the polka dots may save some lives," the official said. "The problem is that you wind up owning these areas which are totally dependent on logistical support, on the tolerance of the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia."
"You can't create a viable economic economy inside a polka dot," the official added.
Discussing the economic leverage that the West says it is counting on to force the Bosnian Serbs to go along with the Vance-Owen plan, the official said that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has failed to follow through on his commitment to seal the Serbian border with Bosnia to deliveries of all but relief supplies.
Lord Owen cited the Serbian leader's comments in arguing against the Clinton Administration's plan to arm the Bosnians. But the senior official said that Belgrade was not moving to cut off supplies of fuel and war material.
"There was some change in the early stages, but it has not been a big change," the senior official said.
Addressing military options, the official said that the White House's proposal to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government and protect them with air power did not have a high probability of success and would still leave the Serbs as the dominant military force.
With the Europeans opposed to lifting the arms embargo, Western nations unwilling to put in a large number of ground troops, and economic sanctions providing only limited leverage, the senior official said that the most likely outcome for ending the fighting would be the partition of Bosnia into Serbian, Muslim and Croatian areas. Two or three of the larger Muslim areas could become a Muslim state, the official said, adding that such an enclave would have more "viability" than a safe haven and could create a de facto alliance with Croatia as a balance of power against the Serbs.
A spokesman for Mr. Christopher denied that there had been a change of policy, saying that the Administration still believed in safe havens and in building on the Vance-Owen plan.

Mr. Coen, in his semiannual presentation of the outlook for ad spending in this country and overseas, cut his estimates for the year a second time, and, for good measure, lowered his final figures for 1992. 
 "The media marketplace is more up than down, but not quite as strong as we expected," Mr. Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., told an attentive audience yesterday at the University Club in midtown Manhattan.
"Directionally, it's going where we had expected," he added, "but irregularly, not in a smooth way."
Mr. Coen, perhaps the most widely followed prognosticator of ad spending, trimmed his domestic estimate for this year to $139.3 billion. That represents a 6.1 percent increase from his final 1992 total of $131.3 billion, revised downward from the $132.7 billion he had projected in December.
Last June, Mr. Coen initially estimated 1993 ad spending at $143 billion, then sliced that six months later to $141.2 billion.
Mr. Coen's forecasts represent more than just a Madison Avenue version of the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil's annual shadow play over whether spring is nigh. The ebb and flow of ad spending often reflects, and sometimes foreshadows, the direction of the nation's economy.
In this case, Mr. Coen said, the primary culprit in retarding the growth of ad spending has been an abrupt mood reversal among consumers, whose optimism after the Presidential election has dissipated.
Among advertisers, he said, "that has created a need to sit on your hands." Even so, Mr. Coen said he was "more optimistic about the second half of the year improving than I was a month ago," adding, "I hope I'm right."
One reason for Mr. Coen's optimism is that in the first quarter of 1993, many major advertisers increased spending in national media, albeit intermittently. Those advertisers account for nearly 50 percent of the money spent in national media, and include restaurant chains, manufacturers of personal-care products and pharmaceutical companies. Another reason is that spending in local media climbed during the first quarter, particularly in radio and television.
A rosy outlook by Mr. Coen, who has been tracking ad spending trends since 1948, is not surprising. His forecasts usually exceed actual spending totals, a discrepancy especially noticeable since the mid-1980's.
"He's typically optimistic," said one person at the presentation, Karen R. Ficker, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore, voicing the general sentiment. She called Mr. Coen's newest estimate "probably more in line" with how the year would turn out.
Mr. Coen's domestic estimate of $139.3 billion breaks out at $80.4 billion to be spent in national media, up 5.8 percent from 1992, and $58.9 billion in local media, up 6.5 percent. The total would represent 2.26 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 2.21 percent in 1992, 2.23 percent in 1991 and the peak of 2.42 percent in the boom year of 1987.
His estimate of a 6.1 percent rise in American ad spending also compares with a consensus forecast that the gross domestic product would increase by 5.7 percent this year, versus 4.8 percent in 1992 and 2.8 percent in 1991. And it would mean that the growth in ad spending would outpace an expected rise this year in the Consumer Price Index of 3.2 percent.
Outside the United States, Mr. Coen predicted that ad spending in 1993 would grow 4 percent, to $169.6 billion from $163.1 billion in 1992. If that is correct, it would be the first time in nearly a decade that the growth rate for ad spending in the United States would exceed the rate in the rest of the world. Mr. Coen attributed that to lagging economies in nations like France and Japan.
And if his forecast holds, it would bring ad spending worldwide to $308.9 billion this year -- topping $300 billion for the first time.
In a preliminary prediction for 1994, Mr. Coen projected total ad spending of $149 billion in this country, up 7 percent from his revised 1993 estimate. He also projected overseas spending of $181 billion, up 6.5 percent. That brings his total estimate for next year to $330 billion, an increase of 6.7 percent from his 1993 estimate.

HEADLINE: A Talk With Bhutto: Is Her Sure Touch Slipping?

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan

 BODY:
Benazir Bhutto sat in a stuffed armchair in her office in Islamabad, her eyes flaring at times in anger, her voice harsh with frustration and irritation.
Once beloved by Pakistani voters, once a darling of Washington, once Prime Minister, she has seen her political fortunes evaporate like a puddle on a scorching pavement. 
 On May 26 the nation's highest court wrenched control of the Government from the indirectly elected President, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and restored to office the popularly elected Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and Parliament, an act that did much to improve the reputation of the pliable judiciary.
Much of Pakistan shouted in joy, but not Benazir Bhutto. Not the Benazir Bhutto who was dismissed as Prime Minister in 1990 for corruption and incompetence, much the same grounds cited when Prime Minister Sharif was expelled from office in April.
 
Maelstrom of Intrigue
 "We don't know," she said, "how the judges can pick and chose between parliaments they like and prime ministers they like and parliaments they don't like and prime ministers they don't like. After all, there were the same grounds of dissolution offered both at that time and this time."
Her words turned frosty. "All I can say is, the Supreme Court never gives a verdict which is in accord with the popular mood of the country."
Since Mr. Sharif was restored to power, Pakistan has plunged into a maelstrom of political machinations, maneuvering and intrigue. What it means for the nation, however, remains murky.
In many ways, the political conflict here is more a collision of powerful personalities than a matter of divergent policies and ideas.
Mr. Sharif, for example, is faced off against President Ishaq Khan, who dismissed Mr. Sharif's Government two months ago. Ms. Bhutto had been a bitter enemy of the President, but then jumped into his camp, deciding that her antipathy to Mr. Sharif was more intense.
 
A Stolen Agenda?
 Much of Ms. Bhutto's frustration stems from what she says is Mr. Sharif's theft of her agenda, particularly the privatization of state-owned banks and other companies. But in fact, Mr. Sharif has moved far more aggressively toward liberalizing the economy than Ms. Bhutto had ever suggested.
Then in another turnabout, the newly returned Mr. Sharif recently offered Ms. Bhutto an olive branch during an emergency session of Parliament, and a startled Ms. Bhutto said, tentatively, that she would try to work with the Prime Minister.
With all this came a steady drumbeat of rumors of a military coup.
"There is a period of instability ahead," said Arif Nizami, the editor of The Nation, a national daily based in Lahore, "because Ghulam Ishaq will not accept defeat. As long as he won't resign, he's the center of political crisis."
Since her ouster as Prime Minister, Ms. Bhutto has struggled to pull together her Pakistan People's Party and to challenge the growing influence of Mr. Sharif. She did so as the leader of the largest opposition party, and as the aggrieved daughter of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged in 1979 on a murder charge after being deposed by the military.
 
Bhutto's Political Missteps
 Ms. Bhutto has remained the largest crowd-puller of any politician in Pakistan, yet in the two months since Mr. Sharif was dismissed she has floundered politically.
"She's lost whatever leverage she had," said Ahmed Rashid, a journalist in Lahore. "Every step she's made has been wrong, beginning with joining the President."
"I don't see where she can go," said a Western diplomat here who once viewed Ms. Bhutto quite favorably. "Just about everything she's done recently has backfired. She seems desperate to me."
A tall, striking woman in an Islamic country that discourages women from working, much less taking an active part in politics, Ms. Bhutto captivates crowds. While Mr. Sharif is an uninspiring orator and a rather stodgy campaigner, Ms. Bhutto injects drama and energy into her political rallies. Yet her sure touch may be fading.
Perhaps nothing stunned Pakistanis as much as Ms. Bhutto's decision to support President Ishaq Khan's decision to remove Mr. Sharif and call for new elections. This act, the third time in five years that a president had removed a prime minister, and the second time Mr. Ishaq Khan had done so, was seen by many as a blow to this country's effort to leave behind 25 years of military rule.
 
The Interests of Democracy
 But Ms. Bhutto, who had labeled the dismissal of her Government undemocratic and unconstitutional, this time found the President's actions in the best interests of democracy. "The democratic way to resolve this was to go to the people," she said in April.
Mr. Ishaq Khan is a 78-year-old bureaucrat who has weathered military dictatorships, ferocious political infighting and a spell as Chairman of the Senate. Regarded as the consummate survivor, he became acting head of state after the death of Mohmammed Zia ul-Haq in an air crash in August 1988 and that December was elected President by parliamentary vote.
He is expected to run successfully for a second five-year term this year. He has become the single most important defender of Pakistan's nuclear program, refusing to let the elected politicians negotiate over it with India, the United States or the United Nations.
Although the presidency was intended largely as a ceremonial post, Mr. Ishaq Khan has used the powers created by the revised Constitution of 1985 to thwart Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif.
Prime Minister Sharif emerged from a family of business people, his father rising from ironmonger to industrialist in Lahore. He was the chief minister of Punjab for 10 years before becoming Prime Minister after elections in 1990.
Ms. Bhutto had managed to cobble together a workable coalition in Parliament and in 1988 became the first woman to lead an Islamic country. Educated in the United States, she quickly won American support and for a time pushed a program of modest economic liberalization. After her Government was deposed, she insisted Mr. Sharif was leading an illegitimate Government.
But her political judgment, once so sure, has faltered.
Last July, Ms. Bhutto tried to force new elections by threatening the resignation of the 42 members who supported her in Parliament. But with 217 members, the resignations would have meant little, so she quietly shelved the plan.
At the end of November, she called for a series of rallies as she traveled by train across the country, rallies that were to be so huge that Mr. Sharif would be forced to call new elections.
But when the crowds at many stops proved smaller than she had expected, she suddenly called off this "long march," and the exercise dribbled into inconsequence.
 
A Battle Over the Army
 In January, President Ishaq Khan appointed a new head of the army, Gen. Abdul Waheed, over the opposition of Mr. Sharif. The Prime Minister, incensed that the President would override his objections so blithely, sought an alliance with Ms. Bhutto to strip Mr. Ishaq Khan of his constitutional powers to appoint the army's leader and to dismiss the Government. These powers are enshrined in the Eighth Amendment Bill of 1985, a legacy of military rule.
In a gesture of political conciliation and expediency, the Prime Minister offered Ms. Bhutto the post of chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament, which she accepted. As the month wore on, back-room deals were hatched, with Ms. Bhutto reportedly offered new elections in exchange for her votes in Parliament. In February, Ms. Bhutto flew to London to give birth to her third child.
Then, convinced he had a deal, Mr. Sharif declared that he would begin efforts to strip the President of his powers. Ms. Bhutto remained silent, and stayed in London. The political test of wills continued until Mr. Sharif was dismissed.
Ms. Bhutto, silent throughout, had returned the day before the dismissal. The next day she declared her support for Mr. Ishaq Khan. The President, with whom she had been a bitter enemy for two years, graciously put her husband, Asif Zadari, in the caretaker Cabinet.
Now, though Ms. Bhutto seems to be making at least small signs of reconciliation with Mr. Sharif, the resolution of the political battles is far from clear.
"I feel very uncomfortable going back to such a Parliament," she said in the hours before the assembly gathered. "After all, I have never accepted its legitimacy."

HEADLINE: Bolivian Assured of Presidency as Foe Concedes

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, June 9

 BODY:
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada was guaranteed the presidency of Bolivia today when his chief rival, a former dictator, conceded defeat in Sunday's elections.
A Sanchez de Lozada presidency is certain to step up Bolivia's free-market policies, which include low inflation and privatization, efforts that he initiated in 1985 as Planning Minister. 
 But perhaps more important, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, a mining entrepreneur, has promised to elevate the political status of Bolivia's large Indian population. His vice-presidential running mate, Victor Hugo Cardenas, is an Aymara Indian, and his presence as the No. 2 political leader is expected to endow Bolivia's Indians with new political muscle.
"You have troubles with violent indigenous movement around the continent," Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said. "Here we are putting more power in their hands and creating a nonviolent indigenous society."
Mr. Cardenas, an educator, aligned his indigenous-based party with Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's Nationalist Revolutionary Movement last year. Mr. Cardenas, seen as an intellectual among the Aymara Indians, was born in a mud hut along Lake Titicaca.
At a victory celebration on Monday night, his wife, Lydia, wore the traditional dress of Aymara women, the small bowler hat, multilayered skirt and a shawl. This was in stark contrast to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada and his wife, who are often referred to as the gringo and the gringa, because he speaks Spanish with an American accent, having been raised in the States.
Bolivia's indigenous groups often live in deep poverty, eking out a subsistence growing potatoes and other root vegetables. A United Nation study last fall found that 97 percent of Bolivians in rural areas live in poverty, the worst rural poverty in the world.
In addition to an anticorruption campaign, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada promised Bolivia's Indians, who make up more than half of the country's seven million people, that he would give them more political power, let them use their native language in schools and work for social equality.
"Around the continent governments worry that indigenous groups are fertile ground for extremist, terrorist groups," he said. "We are trying to make sure that doesn't happen here."
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada credited his running mate with bringing in crucial Indian votes in the rural areas to earn him 36 percent of the popular vote, compared with 21 percent for the former dictator, Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez of the Patriotic Accord alliance.
Since no candidate received more than 50 percent, the new Congress has to choose a new President when it convenes on Aug. 6. General Banzer, as well as most other parties, has instructed his delegates to support Mr. Sanchez de Lozada as President.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's strength will obviously be his innovative economic thinking, which he showed in 1985 in dealing with an inflation rate of 25,000 percent.
Although the Bolivian public bristles at the word "privatization," Mr. Sanchez de Lozada prefers to call it "capitalization." His plans would sell as much as 49 percent ownership in Bolivia's state oil company, airline, railroads and electric power plants to foreign investors and give them management control. But the remaining ownership he would distribute free to the Bolivian public in the form of tradable stock.
"We are talking about a major redistribution of income equal to one-half of our gross national product," he said. "We are getting the Government out of these businesses, giving ownership to the Bolivian people without getting rid of the market economy."
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said he would also rethink Bolivia's drug policies.
"There is a national consensus building here that drugs are doing a great deal of damage to the Bolivian society," he said. "Before people didn't consume it, so it was he West's problem. But now they are consuming it and seeing the effects in rising crime. It is a high priority item. And I think we feel now it is truly a Bolivian problem."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
When Soros Speaks, World Markets Listen

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Once again, George Soros is putting his mouth where his money is. He published a letter in The Times of London yesterday saying that the German mark is bound to fall, causing Europe's mightiest currency to do just that.
Mr. Soros has no seat on the boards of the German Bundesbank or the Federal Reserve, but central bankers might well envy his power to make currency markets rattle and quake. 
 Yesterday was the third time in recent months that the timely disclosure of his investments helped increase their value. "It's a new way of making money," David C. Roche, a London-based strategist for Morgan Stanley, said. "A combination of judicious investment at the bottom of a market and a publicity coup."
 
 
A Soros Market
 Yesterday, the mark fell against the dollar, as traders in the United States and Europe agreed that it was a Soros market. In New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6358 marks, from 1.6250 marks on Wednesday. Earlier in Europe, the dollar jumped to 1.6390 marks, from 1.6225.
Previously, investors also rushed in to buy gold and gold stocks after the disclosure in April that Mr. Soros had taken a large stake in Newmont Mining. Just last week, the announcement of his venture with the British Land Company to buy British property set off a rally in real estate stocks.
Mr. Soros manages the Quantum Fund, which has billions of dollars -- and billions more through borrowing -- to deploy in any of the world's markets. He reportedly earned more than $1 billion last September betting against the British pound and other currencies that fell sharply when they fled the European Community's system of fixed exchange rates.
A spokesman for Mr. Soros refused yesterday to comment on his current investments, saying only that his letter stood for itself.
With his latest position, Mr. Soros baldly confronts Helmut Schlesinger, chief of the Bundesbank and prime defender of the German currency. "I expect the mark to fall against all major currencies," Mr. Soros said in a lavishly displayed letter of article length in yesterday's Times of London.
The Bundesbank is determined to keep the costs of German unification from reviving inflation and eroding the value of the currency. To bolster the mark, and throttle inflation, the central bank has kept interest rates high, making German currency and investments relatively attractive.
But Germany's recession has become so serious that Mr. Schlesinger's retirement in a few months will produce an abrupt change, according to Mr. Soros. To stimulate the economy, he said, "Short-term interest rates will have to be lowered, whether the Bundesbank likes it or not."
Mr. Soros said that German bond prices would then rise in marks, but fall in value once exchange rates are factored in. "For the sake of full disclosure, I am talking my book," or promoting the value of his investments, Mr. Soros said parenthetically.
European leaders have railed against speculators like Mr. Soros, with one French official even speaking of beheading. As the global trading of currencies, for commerce as well as investment, has reached $1 trillion a day, the central banks' efforts last fall to defend their currencies succeeded primarily in handing large chunks of their reserves to the speculators.
 
 
Defends Activities
 Mr. Soros, a native of Hungary, defended his activities in his letter, first noting that his investment profits financed his charitable work in Eastern Europe.
"I do not seek profits in Eastern Europe and I do not act as a philanthropic institution in the financial markets," he said. "I try to avoid speculative activities that could prove wantonly destructive, but I see no reason to abstain from moves that would happen even without my participation. Of course, in making such judgments, I am no more infallible than the central banks."
In London, the hub of currency trading, many others take his side. "Most of us in London are absolutely delighted," Thomas J. Berger, manager of the Blanchard Short Term Global Income Fund, said. "We think the dollar will move ahead against the mark. We're happy to have him on the team."
Currencies could bounce much more with the release of United States producer prices tomorrow and consumer prices next Tuesday. Steven Bell, an economic advisor to Deutsche Bank Research, said that renewed inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates, further raising the value of the dollar against the mark.
The unemployment report out last week suggested a strengthening economy that might also foster higher interest rates. The exchange rate promptly jumped, more than after Mr. Soros's remarks yesterday -- evidence, he might say, that he is ultimately following the markets rather than leading them.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Dollar's Other Gains
 By The Associated Press
Along with rising against the German mark, the dollar posted other gains and held its ground against the Japanese yen yesterday.
Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, said the dollar's strength against most major currencies reflected signs of growth in the American economy. These included the May employment report and sharply higher new home sales.
Yet trading remained subdued yesterday in advance of tomorrow's producer price report, a key measure of inflation. A report showing moderate or light inflation could hurt the dollar since the Federal Reserve would be less likely to raise interest rates to control inflation, traders said. Higher rates would make the dollar more attractive overseas.
Financial markets in Japan were closed yesterday, a national holiday, for the wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito. In New York, the dollar closed at 106.45 yen, up from 106.40 yen late Tuesday.
The British pound, meanwhile, fell to $1.5155 in New York, from $1.5201 on Tuesday. The decline was attributed in part to a speech by Norman Lamont, Britain's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he harshly criticized Prime Minister John Major's leadership.

HEADLINE: Liberals Fight Clinton Plan To Ease Tax on Companies

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
For many large companies, the best news about President Clinton's economic package is a little-known, frighteningly complex provision that would ease requirements for companies to pay a minimum tax when their profits fall to zero.
But the bad news for these companies is that Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, and some liberals are making a last-ditch effort to scuttle this provision, which, according to Congressional estimates, would cut corporate tax payments by $8.9 billion over the next five years. 
 The Administration proposed relaxing the alternative minimum tax on companies -- and the House of Representatives approved such a relaxation -- after several major corporations made it their No. 1 lobbying priority. Officials from Chrysler, Bethlehem Steel, Champion International and other capital-intensive companies assert that the minimum tax discourages new investment and penalizes them unfairly when hard times squeeze their profits.
"This is probably the best piece of the package for us," said Gary L. Millenbruch, Bethlehem Steel's chief financial officer. "It's something we've been working for."
Senator Bradley and some liberals counter that proposals to reduce the minimum tax are thinly veiled efforts to put loopholes back into the tax code when lawmakers are straining to find ways to slice the budget deficit.
"The tax was established to provide a measure of a corporation's true income and to insure those with real income paid real taxes," Mr. Bradley said. "The carve-out proposed would effectively gut this principle. It would distort sound tax policy and cost taxpayers $8.9 billion payments for no sound economic purpose."
He and his allies, liberal lobbying groups, fault the proposed change not only because it is expected to cost many times more than the $1.3 billion the Administration originally estimated, but also because it could largely wipe out the minimum tax. According to officials with the Joint Tax Committee of Congress, the minimum tax, before the proposed changes, is expected to collect about $10 billion over five years.
The alternative minimum tax on corporations was enacted in 1986 after many lawmakers became embarrassed that scores of corporations were paying no income tax, largely as a result of generous depreciation provisions enacted in the early 1980's.
 
Some Payment Required
 By requiring many companies to use less generous depreciation rules, the tax made hundreds of companies pay some tax even though they had minimal or no tax obligations under the standard corporate income tax.
"The theory behind the tax is that there are various tax breaks out there, but if you use them too much, then you're going to be hit by this other tax," said Jane Gravelle, a tax economist with the Congressional Research Service.
Mr. Bradley is working to persuade his colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to keep as much of the minimum tax as possible, but he faces heavy industry opposition. At the same time, another powerful member of the committee, David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat who is a fierce critic of the President's economic plan, says that easing the minimum tax will do more than anything else in the package to create jobs.
Companies pushing to relax the minimum tax argue that it was originally aimed at companies that avoided corporate income taxes by milking arcane tax loopholes, like safe-harbor leasing, to the maximum. But critics of the tax say that it now hits companies that made heavy modernization investments in recent years but have seen their profits decimated by recession and slow growth.
 
'Harsher' Than Intended
 "Far more companies are paying the alternative minimum tax than had been contemplated when it was passed," said Gillian Spooner, national tax director at KPMG Peat Marwick. "It's hitting manufacturers far more harshly than had been intended."
Tax experts say that the winners under the proposed changes include auto makers, steelmakers, commercial airlines and paper companies. Officials from companies benefiting from the changes have been among the most vocal corporate supporters of Mr. Clinton's economic package.
Some Democratic supporters of the tax wonder why Mr. Clinton wants to cut the revenues from the minimum tax by twice as much as former President George Bush would have. Mr. Bush made a proposal to scale back the minimum tax, which became part of an economic package that the former President vetoed because it contained some tax increases.
Several Administration officials said Mr. Clinton proposed greater cuts in the minimum tax than his predecessor because he was so eager to spur investment. "We had an assignment to put together a package that would stimulate investment," a Treasury official said. "This was on the list of obvious things to do for capital investment."
The new minimum tax rules would apply only to future investments.
 
Aim of Clinton Plan
 Mr. Clinton's proposal aims both to reduce the minimum tax burden and to simplify the tax. Under current law, in addition to calculating their regular tax burden using the standard accelerated depreciation rules, companies must do an alternative set of tax calculations based on two less generous, but still complicated sets of depreciation rules. Corporations must pay the minimum tax when their tax burden as defined by regular corporate tax calculations falls below their tax burden as defined by the less generous minimum tax.
The Administration's proposal would simplify tax preparation by requiring companies to use one set of depreciation rules rather than two sets. In addition, the new depreciation rules would be more generous because they would state that equipment has a shorter life for depreciation purposes. For example, steel-making equipment could be depreciated over seven years, rather than 15 years under current minimum tax rules.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold and Silver Prices Fall In Advance of Inflation Data

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold and silver prices sank yesterday ahead of Government reports on wholesale and retail prices that some traders expect will show a tempering of inflation last month.
Gold for August delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell $2.60 an ounce, to $373 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. And July silver dropped 5.3 cents an ounce, to $4.345. 
 "It was another erosive session, with Mideastern syndicate selling in Europe setting the tone before we got some support from banks," an analyst said.
Gold has ridden a wave of speculative demand, in part based on a general feeling that inflation was returning. Inflationary pressures are traditionally a signal to investors to hedge their holdings in precious metals.
 
Slower Inflation Seen
A number of traders expect the Government to report tomorrow that its Producer Price Index rose one-tenth to two-tenths of a percent in May, a significant cooling down from April's jump of six-tenths of a percent. A report on the Consumer Price Index is scheduled Tuesday.
"The market is looking for Friday's data to provide a clue to the next direction," an analyst said. "The market has turned a bit more cautious because we're a bit overbought."
Oil prices stagnated after reacting the previous two days to inconclusive events at the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July crude eased 1 cent, to $19.64 a barrel.
Unleaded gasoline prices retreated after Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute data showed a rise in domestic gas supplies. July unleaded dropped 0.49 cent, to 55.66 cents a gallon, while July heating oil rose 0.15 cent, to 53.86 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Trade-Law Study Sought

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, asked an independent Federal agency today to perform a two-year review of American trade laws that restrict imports sold at unfairly low prices or with foreign Government subsidies.
The results of the study by the agency, the International Trade Commission, are likely to be disputed. 
 Many economic studies by academics have concluded that American antidumping and antisubsidy laws help a few industries at the expense of the nation's economy. But the laws are popular in Congress, and a succession of Administrations has avoided official studies of their economic effects.
Mr. Kantor's predecessor during the Bush Administration, Carla A. Hills, officially asked for the study shortly before leaving office in January. Don E. Newquist, the commission's chairman and close ally of many members of Congress, objected soon after Mr. Kantor took office, contending that his agency lacked the staff to perform the study. Mr. Kantor today confirmed Mrs. Hills's original request, but gave the commission an extra six months for the study, until June 30, 1995.

HEADLINE: Irishman to Lead GATT, With Mandate for a Pact

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 9

 BODY:
Peter Sutherland, an Irish lawyer with a strong record of fighting trade protectionism, was named today to be the new Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with the mandate of bringing long-stalled trade liberalization talks to an early conclusion.
Unsurprisingly, perhaps, he was at first reluctant to take the job. Arthur Dunkel, the former Swiss diplomat whom he will succeed at GATT headquarters in Geneva on July 1, has known little but frustration over the last seven years as he tried to nudge the 111-nation organization toward a global trade package. 
 Mr. Sutherland, though, on the eve of his appointment, had something to celebrate. With France dropping its objections, European Community foreign ministers on Tuesday approved a deal with the United States limiting the production of oilseed crops like soybeans. This removed one major obstacle to a global trade agreement.
In a statement today, Mr. Sutherland said his priority was "a quick, comprehensive and far-reaching conclusion" to the talks. He noted that for progress to be made, "we will need deeds, not words," at the meeting in Tokyo next month of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
When the so-called Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations began in the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este in 1986, the goal had been to conclude an agreement by December 1990. Instead, the talks collapsed, at what was to have been a final session in Brussels, over disagreement between the European Community and the United States on trade in farm products.
Since then, the agricultural disputes have not been fully settled, and issues like market access and intellectual-property rights have arisen and must be resolved. The prospects for a broad agreement to liberalize $200 billion in world trade have been further dampened by the recession gripping economies in much of the industrial world.
Mr. Dunkel, who has been GATT's Director General since 1980, twice agreed to stay on past announced retirement dates, hoping to complete the Uruguay Round. And though his job gave him no executive power, he struggled endlessly to find the consensus needed for an agreement. Now this is Mr. Sutherland's challenge.
 
Selection Process
 The 47-year-old lawyer, who was Ireland's Attorney General from 1981 to 1984, was the first choice of both the Europeans and the United States. When he initially turned down the job, two aspirants from Latin America stepped forward.
Mr. Sutherland in time agreed to move to Geneva and take charge of GATT, requiring European and American officials to persuade the two Latin Americans -- Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia and Julio Lacarte-Muro of Uruguay -- to step aside. Mr. Sutherland was formally selected today.
His appointment is generally popular because, as the community's competition commissioner from 1985 to 1989, he was a strong advocate of free trade, helping reduce barriers within the community and combating monopolies and cartels.
He has served as chairman of Allied Irish Banks, a major financial conglomerate, and of Shannon Aerospace P.L.C. since 1989.
The GATT position is initially for two years, with an option to extend his contract for four years beyond that. He will be the fourth European to lead the organization since it was created in 1948.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses in a Credit Pinch

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 5

 BODY:
Anthony Dolphin is just the kind of borrower every banker in Massachusetts is looking for. Rodman Forter is not.
Both men manage small businesses in Massachusetts: Mr. Dolphin, a computer hardware repair company in Springfield; Mr. Forter, a machinery manufacturing company in Middleboro. Both companies need credit to emerge from the financial upheaval that has gripped the state through the trying recession and its stagnant aftermath. 
 The vastly different reactions they get when they talk to bankers -- five banks have expressed interest in one company, none in the other -- illustrate the two-tiered credit system that seems to be emerging in Massachusetts as the economy struggles to shake off the credit squeeze of the last few years.
The shortage of credit in Massachusetts was one hallmark of an economic downturn that involved many banks whose shaky portfolios of loans both contributed to the slump and were made even shakier by it. The process has been mirrored to varying degrees around the nation.
Alleviating the credit squeeze has been a top priority of banking regulators since the Clinton Administration took office, and it still preoccupies local politicians and business groups in Massachusetts even as they say economic conditions are finally improving. The Administration's bank examiners, seeking to free loans for the small businesses that are considered important engines of growth, have told bank examiners not to be so strict in auditing banks.
And the banks have been given new tools intended to make lending cheaper and easier: they can, for example, assemble pools of small-business loans that require less rigid documentation than usual, and they can increase the amount of real estate collateral used to back commercial loans without having to obtain the usual property assessments.
The pressure is on to do even more. On Thursday in Washington, members of the New England Congressional delegation will meet with top Federal regulators and local business groups to assess the progress so far.
"Despite the fact that the banks say they have money, a lot of people can't get their hands on it," said Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Banking Committee and has closely followed the credit problem in his state.
"The biases created over the past few years are such that everybody has to jump through hoops," he said. "It's a terrible price for small businesses to pay for the banking problems."
Mr. Forter, for example, who is president of the Read Corporation, finds little receptivity in the banking community. His company is shifting its product line away from the construction business and toward environmental services, with an earth sifter designed for use by landfill operators. The company's existing loans, once held by the Bank of New England, which has since failed, are now part of the loan pool being liquidated by the Recoll Management subsidiary of the Fleet Financial Group.
"We are not bankable in the traditional sense," said Mr. Forter, who this month will submit new proposals to refinance his equipment loans.
 
Entrepreneurs' Venture
 The situation is different at Mr. Dolphin's company, the Springboard Technology Corporation, which is a spinoff of the Digital Equipment Corporation. When Digital, which is restructuring, wanted to get out of the business of repairing disk drives and other computer memory devices, Mr. Dolphin and his fellow entrepreneurs decided to run it as a small business, with Digital as a big customer. All five banks he spoke to were "extremely receptive to the proposal," he said.
The two stories can be found across the state: from Back Bay to the Berkshires, banks are flush with cash to lend and companies are eager, but not always able, to borrow it.
Bankers interviewed in communities across the state said that the efforts to loosen regulation have made little practical difference, at least so far. If anything, the bankers said, their lending standards are higher than ever, making it hard for some borrowers to qualify for loans.
The regulatory changes are widely viewed as being of only marginal value, especially at smaller banks, although they might help the bigger banks in the state, which have introduced special programs to emphasize small-business lending.
 
Seeking the Causes
 The reason for the banks' caution probably lies in the causes of the credit squeeze, which was largely not a result of regulatory strictures.
Studies by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston suggest that what really caused the credit problem was the weakening capital condition of the banks after real estate markets in the region had collapsed. When regulators ordered the banks to shore up their capital, the lenders had little choice but to call in loans.
Now the banks are in much better financial health, said Richard F. Syron, president of the Boston Federal Reserve.
But small borrowers continue to feel the pinch. One reason is that it can be relatively expensive for banks to process a small loan. Regulatory changes might help there. But another reason is that the small companies emerged from the credit squeeze shakier than ever, and the banks more cautious than before.
David R. Danker, vice president for commercial loans at the Springfield Institution for Savings, said his bank's caution was still dictated partly by continuing attempts to shore up its portfolio, which continues to have "a fairly high nonperforming-loan ratio." The bank is under orders from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to shed loans that cannot be repaid.
"The criteria we use now have gotten more conservative, and the balances of people who come to us are not as strong," he said. "It is difficult to meet the needs of people who come to us."
People's Bank of Holyoke has money to lend, said James S. Thompson, its senior vice president. With $430 million in assets, it is the second-largest mutual savings bank in the western part of the state. It would like to have between 75 and 80 percent of those assets in loans, and right now the figure is at the low end of that range, he said.
But he said regulatory changes were not likely to make lending any easier. "The basket of loans is not particulary attractive to us, although it might be to somebody else," he said, commenting on one of the new tools made available by regulators. "Appraisals -- we still want the full-blown appraisal. So the effect on us has been kind of minimal."
 
A Troubled Category
 Although some sound borrowers are beginning to appear, Mr. Thompson said, weaker companies remain hard to serve. "And those who are in Recoll find it virtually impossible," he said, referring to companies whose shaky loans were assigned to the liquidation subsidiary of Fleet after it acquired the assets of the failed Bank of New England. "You have to have some really solid reason to lend to them -- a turnaround in profits, new collateral."
Kerry Stackpole, an official of the Smaller Business Association of New England, said, "Having your loan in Recoll was a scarlet letter."
The Read Corporation offers an example of what a difficult situation that can be. Mr. Forter said the company had probably borrowed too much from the Bank of New England, taking out a working capital line of credit, an equipment loan and real estate debt. But it had always made its payments until the bank failed and the debt was handed over to Recoll. Then the working capital line was frozen, Read could not make all its payments, and Recoll wanted its money back.
Read has been told to pay off the equipment loan by October, which means seeking refinancing.
"We would dearly like them to disappear," Mr. Forter said bitterly. "They are a loathsome crowd to deal with. But our ratios are still not traditionally acceptable to bank lenders. I can't say I have given up on banks, but I am not really optimistic."
He said he would be approaching alternative lenders, like commercial financing companies.
 
Shift in Attitude
 Even the stronger companies, which weathered the recession and expect to be able to borrow again, are looking at their banks differently.
Channing L. Bete Jr., the head of the Channing L. Bete Company, a specialized printer in South Deerfield, said he was worried when his main bank, the Springfield Institution for Savings, was under orders from the F.D.I.C. to shape up.
"At that time, we could not have found another bank in New England," he said. "We are now looking for a national money-center bank to backstop our local bank.
"The bank comes in and checks you out," he said, describing the new relationships between banker and borrower. "But for the last three years, we have been checking the banks out. We call them in and they explain their financial condition to us."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
If The Fed Tightens, The Casualties May Be Jobs -- And Clinton.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
GOOD news: Some 425,000 workers were added to payrolls in April and May, the largest two-month increase in many a moon. This bright figure, only slightly tarnished by the fact that fully half of the increase was a product of computerized revisions in Labor Department estimates, have pushed the "consensus" forecasts for the economic growth to a solid 3 percent in 1993.
But don't book that second honeymoon at the Ritz just yet. The May increase barely brings employment back to the June 1990 peak. And in spite of the fact that labor markets are slack and unemployment remains a demoralizing 6.9 percent, the anti-inflation wolves at the Federal Reserve are baying for blood. If they persuade the Fed to tighten credit, there is a chance Americans will not see the better side of 6 percent joblessness before Bill Clinton is freed to pick out the carpet pattern for his Presidential library. 
 Confused? Join the throng. "Government officials are perplexed by the ambiguities," David Hale, an economist at Kemper Financial, diplomatically confirms. There is just no precedent for fine-tuning the economy in the midst of a long, agonizing restructuring of both industry and the Federal budget.
While the last revision in the job-counting equation changed the estimates more than usual, the figures are still credible, concludes Janet Norwood, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who earlier headed the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the additional jobs discovered by the computers do not change Ms. Norwood's view that this water glass is half empty.
"It's taken 27 months to recover the jobs lost in the recession," she notes -- three times longer than it took to go down the slope. With entry into the labor force likely to pick up in coming months and industries ranging from defense to financial services still handing out pink slips by the tens of thousands, Ms. Norwood remains "very worried about the pace of job creation."
Seen through the lens of circa-1970's Keynesian economics, the $50 billion fiscal tonic prescribed by a covey of Nobel Prize-winners before the election makes almost as much sense now. Indeed, many of these economists think President Clinton flubbed an opportunity to sell Congress on insurance against slow growth by presenting his stimulus program as an old-fashioned jobs (translation: pork barrel) bill.
But it is also possible that the on-again, off-again recovery is on for good -- that employers who have been making do with overtime are now being forced to hire workers or lose orders. Plugging the April and May job figures into a standard computer model of the economy, Mr. Hale points out, yields a forecast of 4 percent growth for the next 12 months -- a lusty pace by contemporary standards and about as much as anyone believes possible without encountering bottlenecks.
Of course, if the American economy is already shaking and baking, it is time to do something about inflation before it is factored into business and labor psychology. That, at least, is the view of a hard-line minority of Federal Reserve Board governors and regional bank presidents who sit on the Fed's policy-making open market committee. "There's a wing of the open market committee that is looking for a reason to put on the brakes," said Robert Hall of Stanford University -- a wing eager to drive inflation back below 2 percent at first opportunity.
In May the committee responded to three months' worth of data that implied producer prices were rising at a 4 to 5 percent pace by leaking its "bias" toward raising short-term interest rates. And while the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, presumably remains reluctant to rain on Bill Clinton's parade, the bias will probably translate into action if May inflation figures show more of same.
What makes this inclination to tighten credit in the absence of crystal-clear inflation signals even more problematic is that Congress is poised to tighten fiscal policy. Higher taxes and cuts in spending would, of course, advance the worthy cause of deficit reduction. Arguably, it would even serve the cause of economic expansion by proving Washington is serious about deficits, thereby lowering long-term borrowing rates for business.
But that is speculation. What is not speculation is the fact that deficit reduction will temper demand for goods and services while the economy is running at least 3 to 4 percent below capacity and several million people who want full-time jobs cannot find them.
It is possible that time will make the choices less agonizing. Mr. Hale guesses that the May Producer Price Index will settle back to the 2 percent range, allowing the Fed to put off any change in monetary policy until the fall. It is also possible, though, that the Fed will feel compelled to play tough cop on the inflation beat.
With hindsight, one could say that the Federal Reserve's reluctance to accommodate growth in 1990 cost George Bush a second term. With foresight, one might wonder whether a similar stand will cost Bill Clinton his chance for an extended lease on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

HEADLINE: CLINTON NOW SEEMS PREPARED TO DROP ANY WIDE FUEL TAX

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Barely a day after giving up his demand for a $71.5 billion tax on the heat content of energy sources, President Clinton seemed close today to retreating from his fallback position as well: that any substitute for that tax must cover the gamut of fuels, from oil to electricity to natural gas.
Instead, Senate and Administration officials said, Mr. Clinton's aides were looking closely at a proposal by Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat Louisiana, to replace the heat tax with a $40 billion tax on gasoline and other transportation fuels and $30 billion in Medicare cuts through the fiscal year 1998. 
 Mr. Breaux's proposal -- effectively a sales tax totaling about 7.3 cents per gallon of fuel -- would cover everything from truck diesel to jet kerosene to the high-test used in automobiles. It differs sharply in structure from Mr. Clinton's proposed tax, which would have covered a wider range of fuels and was based on the heat content of fuel as measured in British thermal units and not on the fuels' cost.
 
The Same, Yet Different
 At least in some cases, the effect on consumers would be substantially the same. For example, the B.T.U. tax would have resulted in a 7.5- to 8-cent increase in the cost of a gallon of gasoline.
An energy tax is among $250 billion in proposed tax increases and new taxes that Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are studying this week, in preparation for a vote next week on that and other parts of Mr. Clinton's five-year budget package.
The transportation tax was not the only option that senators and Clinton aides reviewed in a day of back-to-backroom meetings and limousine shuttles between the Capitol and the White House. But for the moment, they said, it was easily the hottest one.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton's budget director, Leon E. Panetta, said the White House had not endorsed any substitute for the B.T.U. tax and might not until July, after the Senate has passed the budget package and begun working with the House on a final version that suits both chambers of Congress.
 
Hoping for Momentum
 "The key right now is to move the process forward," Mr. Panetta said. "Whatever it takes to move the process forward, we'll encourage."
Speaking of the Finance Committee's deliberations, he said, "We are kind of standing aside in this process."
Administration officials and several senators nonetheless said that Mr. Breaux's plan was the starting point of today's discussions, and that Mr. Clinton's long-stated position -- that he will take nothing less than a "broad-based" energy tax that spreads the burden over most fuels -- is now more a matter of semantics than reality.
Mr. Breaux's transportation tax "isn't as broad as a B.T.U. tax, but it's broader than a gas tax," one Administration official said.
Asked whether Mr. Breaux's proposed transportation tax meets the Clinton definition of "broad-based," the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, replied, "That's one of the questions we'll be considering."
Senators and some Senate aides agreed privately that Mr. Panetta and the White House had handed the reins on the tax issue to the Finance Committee but largely because they had lost control of the debate in the preceding weeks.
Today's meetings were variously attended by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and his deputy, Roger Altman; Senator Mitchell; Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Finance Committee; Mr. Panetta; the White House chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, and a clutch of oil-state senators and Congressmen.
 
'Whole Range of Options'
 Earlier today, President Clinton told the Business Roundtable: "Senator Breaux has some ideas that he wants to float, and some others have some ideas. I think you'll have plenty of time to react to them. A lot of them want to rely more on a broad-based transportation tax, but that also has some economic difficulties if you -- even if you raise less money."
Another Administration official said that a formal decision on a replacement for the B.T.U. tax (a B.T.U. is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree Fahrenheit) could be delayed as long as possible, in part to shorten the amount of time lobbyists and politicians would have to whack away at it.
The politics of the B.T.U. and transportation taxes reflect crucial differences. Many lawmakers from farm states and heavily industrial states, along with farm and manufacturing lobbies, argued that the B.T.U. tax would cost jobs and give foreign competitors an edge.
Manufacturers prefer a gasoline tax, but Western and farm-state senators oppose it because their rural constituents must drive farther and more often -- and use more gasoline -- than do city dwellers.
Mr. Moynihan's committee is supposed to approve a package of some $250 billion in tax increases and lesser cuts in Federal benefit programs by a week from Friday.
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Moynihan acknowledged tonight that Mr. Breaux's transportation tax was under study, but they stopped short of endorsing it. Other Senate and Administration officials, who refused to be identified, said the proposal was high among the alternatives, in no small part because it would satisfy political forces who hold some of the keys to the budget's fate.
Among them are two of the 11 Democrats on the Finance Committee, David L. Boren of Oklahoma and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who have publicly criticized the B.T.U. tax, and whose votes are essential if the budget is to make it to the Senate floor.
Today, Mr. Conrad called Mr. Breaux's plan "better not just for my section of the country, but for the economy as well," although he withheld judgment on the Senator's proposed cuts in Medicare. Aides to Mr. Breaux said that Mr. Boren, who has waged a ceaseless battle against the B.T.U. tax, seemed "favorably disposed" to the Breaux plan.
For their part, Administration officials conceded that Senator Breaux's proposed transportation tax was a far cry from the B.T.U. tax, which had covered coal, electricity, natural gas and petroleum to varying degrees, but that it was the best vehicle they had for the moment.
The B.T.U. tax already had been so gutted by special interests, who obtained exemptions for industries and for certain types of fuels, that it was not all that far from a fuel tax anyway, they said.
Some House Democrats who voted for the B.T.U. tax last month under duress were enraged when they discovered the White House had backed away from it.
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico said the White House could lose 40 to 50 House votes if a final compromise bill included a smaller tax like a transportation fuel tax and deep new cuts in social spending. "The bill will be in danger if we continue to cut Medicaid and Medicare and continue trumpeting the victory of big business and big oil," Mr. Richardson said.
 
What Long-Range Effect?
 At first blush, a transportation tax might seem unacceptable to oil-state lawmakers, like Mr. Breaux, who are embracing it. But, in fact, economists say, the relatively minor increase that it would impose on the cost of fuels would do little to dampen demand for oil. And because the tax would fall entirely on consumers, the large manufacturers and oil drillers who complained loudest about the B.T.U. tax have no cause to oppose the Breaux proposal.
One economist and energy expert, Philip Verleger of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, predicted that the demise of the B.T.U. tax would be a particular boon to the Northwest, where hydroelectric power would escape taxation, and in the Midwest, where heavy industries are concentrated.
Small refiners who supply residual fuel oil to utilities and industry would also gain from the tax's demise, he said.
Mr. Breaux's proposal to reduce Medicare expenses got a far more muted reception than the tax plan. The Senator suggested that the $30 billion in revenues lost by moving to a smaller energy tax could be regained by cutting Medicare benefits to the well-off, reducing inflation adjustments for hospital costs and other changes.
But participants in the budget negotiations said today that the Finance Committee was unlikely to propose anywhere near that amount of cuts in Medicare and that some of the lost revenues might well be made up by cutting spending on programs like transportation, education, space exploration and science.

HEADLINE: U.N. COUNCIL PLANS TO ORDER FULL BAN ON OIL FOR HAITI

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 9

 BODY:
The United States and other United Nations Security Council members have decided to impose a mandatory worldwide ban on the supply of oil to Haiti as part of a new campaign to restore to power the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Plans for enforcing the blockade, which also applies to arms supplies, have not been worked out yet, diplomats said today. But the resolution imposing the ban, which is expected to be approved formally next week, will be adopted under Article 7 of the United Nations Charter, which allows the Council to enforce its orders. 
 American officials said they expected that once the resolution is approved, European nations that have been supplying 90 percent of Haiti's oil will stop doing so. The United States has imposed an oil embargo on Haiti since the end of 1991 in line with the recommendation of the Organization of American States, which had called for a total trade embargo.
 
Easy to Monitor
 Some diplomats said that given the ease of monitoring oil shipments to Haiti, enforcing the ban would not be a major undertaking. Most oil enters through the harbor of Port-au-Prince.
In another repercussion of Haiti's turmoil, the Clinton Administration said today that it would comply with a Federal court ruling and free 158 political refugees who have been detained at an American naval base in Cuba since they fled Haiti. The Administration had sought to bar those Haitians from entering the United States because most of them tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. [Page A12.]
The United States has told other Council members that it is studying plans to send American warships to the Caribbean to police the new trade ban against Haiti, one of the world's poorest nations. A senior diplomat said that if the United States sends ships to enforce the ban, other maritime nations will also be asked to do so.
Diplomats in Haiti have long said that only a worldwide ban on oil imports would have a meaningful impact on the Haitian military, which up to now has survived the much less comprehensive embargo imposed by the O.A.S.
Enforcing the oil ban raises a potential problem because Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. It is unclear what steps the Council will take to prevent oil from being smuggled by road into Haiti from the Dominican Republic.
In addition to banning deliveries of oil and weapons, the Security Council also plans to order all nations to freeze overseas bank accounts and other financial assets belonging to Haiti's rulers.
The United Nations mediator for Haiti, Dante Caputo, the former Foreign Minister of Argentina, has announced that he will make another attempt to negotiate Father Aristide's peaceful return to power at a meeting of Haiti's political leaders, which he plans to hold here next week.
"The moves are complimentary," Mr. Caputo said at a news conference here. He said his strategy will be to put pressure on Haiti's rulers through the Security Council embargo at the same time that he promotes a "national dialogue" aimed at securing the return to power of the country's first democratically elected ruler, who is a Roman Catholic priest.
Today's moves come only a day after a new power struggle broke out in Haiti involving the dismissal of Prime Minister Marc Bazin, apparently on the orders of the military leaders. Mr. Bazin was thought to have been forced out after he tried to reassign two ministers chosen by the army.
In calling for mandatory Security Council sanctions against Haiti, the United States is backed by France, Canada and Venezuela, which have been working together informally to resolve the political crisis gripping the island since the military overthrew President Aristide in 1991.
 
Approval Is Expected
 Diplomats say they expect the embargo to be approved without major dissent, although China may abstain. While there is no civil war under way in Haiti, they argue that the exodus of refugee boat people is destabilizing for the Caribbean region as a whole, justifying Security Council action. They also point out that the Security Council has taken action in the past against countries where there was widespread violation of human rights, as is the case in Haiti today.
The proposed embargo as well as the seizure of assets would replace the largely ineffective voluntary trade embargo that the O.A.S. imposed on Haiti after Father Aristide was forced to flee in September 1991.
While the United States and other O.A.S. members could ban their companies from selling oil to Haiti, the governments of European and other countries that do not belong to the organization had no legal basis for stopping their citizens from doing business with Haiti's current military rulers.
About 90 percent of Haiti's oil supplies now comes from Europe, most of it from the Netherlands. Haiti is believed to have enough oil to last through July. And diplomats here want the Security Council to enact the new embargo rapidly to prevent the country's current leadership from building up stocks.
The United States, France, Canada and Venezuela decided to press for an oil embargo against Haiti after Mr. Caputo's mediation efforts collapsed last month when the military authorities rejected his proposals for Father Aristide's return.
In inviting Haiti's "main political forces" to a renewed dialogue at the same time that the Security Council moves to impose sanctions, Mr. Caputo made clear today that representatives of the military would not be taking part in the talks and that all those who came must accept in advance that Father Aristide is "the legitimate, constitutional President of Haiti."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Aristide Hopeful on Embargo
 MIAMI, June 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- Father Aristide said here today that he believed that a United Nations embargo on oil shipments to his country would quickly lead to a toppling of the military leadership that ousted him.
Combined with the resignation of Prime Minister Bazin on Tuesday, he said at a news conference, an international oil embargo would further isolate and weaken the military and its few civilian allies. He described the country as near "a social explosion" because of worsening economic conditions and said he stood by his statement on Tuesday that he would return to Haiti "within weeks, perhaps within days."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Elects a Conservative As Mayor and Turns to a New Era

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 9

 BODY:
Los Angeles entered a new political era today as its conservative Mayor-elect, Richard Riordan, outlined plans to use his skills as an entrepreneur to bring the city out of its economic slump and social turmoil.
The first Republican to lead the city in a generation, Mr. Riordan, a self-made millionaire of 63, campaigned with promises to lure more businesses and hire more police officers, sweeping aside the coalition of blacks and white liberals that had sustained the retiring Mayor, Tom Bradley, for 20 years. 
 Reaching out from his base of white conservatives in the San Fernando Valley, Mr. Riordan also appealed to some middle-class Hispanic and Asian voters as he defeated Michael Woo, a liberal City Councilman, by 54 percent to 46 percent in Tuesday's vote.
The election of a white conservative who had never before run for office aroused concerns among leading blacks, almost all of whom supported Mr. Woo as they sought a mayor who would address some of the social concerns dramatized by the 1992 riots.
 
'Rhetoric of Toughness'
 "There is a great deal of apprehension and uncertainty among many in the black community about his rhetoric of toughness," said John Mack, regional director of the Urban League. "It is important that he reaches out and makes it clear that he intends to be mayor of all the people and that he will not work to the detriment of South-Central."
But some political analysts said that rather than pushing social issues higher on the agenda, the riots in South-Central Los Angeles had created an atmosphere of insecurity in which a law-and-order candidate like Mr. Riordan offered broad appeal.
"In the short term, the events of last year had exactly the opposite outcome of what people expected: they really strengthened the forces of order," said Raphael J. Shonenshein, author of "Politics in Black and White" (Princeton, 1993), a study of Los Angeles politics. The author is a professor of political science at California State University at Fullerton.
Following a bitter campaign in which both candidates poured their resources into attack advertisements, there was a sullen air to Tuesday's balloting, with many voters telling poll takers they were selecting "the lesser of two evils."
 
An Electorate Divided
 The voting was also characterized by the racial and economic divisions that have riven this city since the riots. An exit poll conducted by The Los Angeles Times found that most of Mr. Riordan's supporters were white, and that Mr. Woo won most of the minority votes. Close to two-thirds of this city's 3.5 million people are members of minority groups, but a majority of its voters are white.
According to initial figures from the Elections Division of the Los Angeles City Clerk's office, Mr. Riordan won 302,786 votes and Mr. Woo got 259,820, for a turnout of 44 percent of registered voters. The preliminary figures point to a turnout higher than anticipated and higher than any of those that elected Mayor Bradley. They indicate that Mr. Riordan cut well into Mr. Woo's core constituency.
Illustrating a sharp ideological divide, Riordan voters said by a 2-to-1 ratio that the problems of minorities and the inner city are problems of personal responsibility rather than problems of racism and economic imbalance, while Woo voters said exactly the opposite by the same 2-to-1 ratio.
 
An Official Roadblock
 At a news conference today, Mr. Riordan acknowledged the need to reach out to the many constituencies in this fast-changing city where minority groups are jostling for their shares of a shrinking economy.
"I will take steps immediately to unite this city," he said. "My government will involve Democrats, Republicans and independents, people of every race, creed, color and sexual orientation." Mr. Riordan's four-year term begins July 1.
One of the roadblocks facing him comes with the office: Los Angeles has a weak mayoral system in which department heads are autonomous and protected by Civil Service rules. Voters on Tuesday defeated a measure that would have given the Mayor more authority over them.
But Mr. Riordan voiced optimism about his ability to lead the sluggish and fragmented branches of government, with whom he has worked during his service for the city.
 
The Business Approach
 A venture capitalist worth an estimated $100 million who has served on a number of city commissions and has been a power behind the scenes in city government, Mr. Riordan made it clear that his approach will be fundamentally that of a businessman.
Asked what he would do for the Hispanic population that now makes up about 40 percent of the city, he said, "The first thing we have to do with the Latino community as well as other communities is make Los Angeles safe, because businesses do not want to come into a war zone."
He said he would meet today with Police Chief Willie L. Williams and with the head of the police union, which endorsed him for mayor, in a first step toward implementing his promise to put 3,000 more officers on the street by the end of his term.
Despite concerns about public safety, voters have twice in the past year defeated measures to pay for more police officers. Analysts have raised questions about the feasibility of Mr. Riordan's stated plan to pay for the officers by leasing out Los Angeles International Airport and turning some city services over to private groups.
 
To Meet the Governor
 Mr. Riordan said his second order of business, on Thursday, would be to travel to Sacramento to meet with Gov. Pete Wilson and legislative leaders to lobby against a huge proposed reduction in state funds for cities.
"It is bad, bad, bad for the State of California to desert the City of Los Angeles," he said. "To abandon Los Angeles as a war zone is going to hurt the state."
He also implied that he would lobby in Washington for Federal funds. He said that although President Clinton had endorsed Mr. Woo in the campaign, the President's chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, had telephoned him this morning to congratulate him.
The Mayor-elect acknowledged that government was a more collegial enterprise than private business and said: "I've got to share power with the City Council and with other citizens of this city. I feel comfortable doing that."
At a separate press conference, Mr. Woo attributed Mr. Riordan's victory to the $6 million of his own money that he poured into the campaign, to the success of the public-safety issue and to an anti-incumbency mood in which Mr. Woo was seen as the City Hall insider and Mr. Riordan as a can-do outsider in the mold of Ross Perot.
 
Anti-Incumbency Mood
 Political analysts here also saw an anti-incumbency mood in the defeat of the two City Council incumbents who ran for re-election. Altogether, four of the Council's 15 seats were contested this year, and all four will now be filled by new members.
One of these is Jackie Goldberg, a former member of the Los Angeles school board who will be the first openly homosexual member of the City Council. Another is Richard Alarcon, who will be the first Hispanic member from the San Fernando Valley, where the Hispanic population is increasing rapidly.
"I think the whole deck has just been thrown up in the air," said Joel Kotkin, a political analyst with the Center for the New West.
Though his campaign slogan was "Tough Enough to Turn L.A. Around," Mr. Riordan's demeanor is avuncular, as he smiles and fumbles slightly for words.
His supporters say he is far from the conservative demagogue portrayed by Mr. Woo in his bruising negative campaign, and they point to his philanthropic work and participation in attempts to improve the city's crumbling school system.
He has donated thousands of dollars to set up educational programs for minority youngsters and was the only white member of a leadership group called 100 Black Men.
Mr. Riordan did gain the support of a key Hispanic politician, City Councilman Richard Alatorre, and of Stan Sanders, a black lawyer who ran for mayor in the first round of voting last April, in which Mr. Riordan and Mr. Woo emerged the leaders. When Mr. Riordan left town for his mother's funeral in the last week of the race, these two men campaigned as his surrogates.
A graduate of Princeton University and the University of Michigan Law School, Mr. Riordan came to Los Angeles in 1956 to join a law firm. He became a venture capitalist, engaging in restructuring insolvent companies, and built a fortune out of a modest inheritance.
In an interview during the campaign, he said: "All my life I've been a rescuer. There is a vacuum of leadership. I am going to fill it."
He is once divorced and is separated from his second wife. He has three daughters.
He said today that he planned to remain in his book-filled $6 million home in the Brentwood area, rather than moving into the official Mayor's mansion. His mind turning again to economic matters, he said he might convert the mansion into a "capital of the Pacific Rim" to lobby for Asian business.

Democrat Wins Panetta Seat
 By The Associated Press -- In other elections Tuesday, voters along California's central coast elected a Democratic state Assemblyman, Sam Farr, to fill the Congressional seat Leon E. Panetta left to become President Clinton's budget director. Mr. Farr won easily, taking 52 percent of the vote to the 43 percent by a Republican lawyer, William Campbell.
In Arkansas, no one won the majority needed to win the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, a post that has been vacant since Jim Guy Tucker succeeded Mr. Clinton as Governor. Two Little Rock lawyers, Nate Coulter and Tom McRae, will compete for the nomination in a runoff June 22. The winner will face a Republican Baptist minister, Mike Huckabee.
In Montana, voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to impose the state's first sales tax, which had been advocated by the Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican.

HEADLINE: Whitman and Florio Attack As New Jersey Battle Begins

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 9

 BODY:
The morning after winning the Republican gubernatorial primary, Christine Todd Whitman began her general election race today by breaking bread with her Republican rivals at a "unity brunch" and revamping her campaign staff, putting her brother in charge.
And she went after the man whose job she wants, Gov. Jim Florio, accusing him of playing politics by flirting with tax cuts in an election year. 
 Governor Florio, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary, wasted no time attacking Mrs. Whitman. His workers began the day slipping fliers under pressroom doors in Trenton attacking her economic program, the centerpiece of her campaign.
Those skirmishes were a preview of what will certainly be a focus of the fall campaign: New Jersey's troubled economy, and who has the vision and experience to deal with it.
Mr. Florio will argue that the $2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through in 1990 was a nasty, but necessary, dose of fiscal medicine. Mrs. Whitman will argue that he should not be so proud of an economy in which the jobless rate was recently the highest in the nation, at 9.1 percent, although it has since fallen to 7.4 percent.
In a speech during the brunch in nearby West Windsor, Mrs. Whitman attacked Mr. Florio for hinting that he would support a $100 million tax cut this year.
"In an election year, the Governor should resist the cynical call to promise tax cuts for purposes of re-election when the money isn't there," Mrs. Whitman said.
 
Mixed Reviews of Choice
 With that remark, Mrs. Whitman started down the tricky political path that she must walk to attack the Democratic Governor without at the same time damaging and alienating the Republicans who control the Legislature. Although the intended target was Mr. Florio, her barb also hit senior Republican legislative leaders who support the push for the election-year tax cut.
Later at a news conference, Mrs. Whitman said she did not mean she would rule out supporting such a tax cut.
"If they say the money is there and they are able to identify the cuts, of course I would back them up," she said.
Mrs. Whitman also said her brother, Webster B. (Danny) Todd Jr., would become her campaign manager and oversee the day-to-day operations. In the primary race, he was an untitled volunteer though one with unquestioned influence over the candidate and the campaign.
Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian and Virginia Littell, chairwoman of the state Republican Party, praised Mrs. Whitman's choice of Mr. Todd.
But a senior Republican Party official said some other Republican leaders worried about Mr. Todd's inexperience and tried to persuade Mrs. Whitman not to turn over complete control of the campaign to her brother, a member of the State Assembly from 1968 to 1970 who has spent the last several years in Montana as a rancher.
"She is convinced that this guy won the primary for her," the party official said. "If that's so, he is the same guy who squandered a 30-point lead at the beginning of the campaign down to less than a 10-point lead by Primary Day."
At the news conference today, Mrs. Whitman said she was confident that her brother was the person for the job.
 
New Chief Spokesman
 "He is someone who knows New Jersey very well, politics very well and me very well," she said, "and that is a dynamite combination."
Mrs. Whitman also introduced a new chief spokesman, Carl Golden, who worked for former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. He will replace Joseph Justin.
Mr. Kean was appointed a campaign co-chairman, a symbolic unity gesture, and Mrs. Whitman said Ed Rollins, the man who ran Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" Presidential campaign, would continue as chief campaign strategist.
"We anticipate that Jim Florio is going to run a terribly nasty campaign," Mr. Rollins said. "We've got a long, hard fall campaign ahead; I expect a real donnybrook."
The revamping of the Whitman campaign, which one aide said would also include the replacement of the present political advertising agency, Russo Marsh & Associates of Sacramento, Calif., and Washington, resulted from evaluation of a primary effort that was successful despite itself. Mrs. Whitman started the race in February with polls showing her 25 percentage points ahead of her closest challenger, former State Attorney General Cary Edwards.
By last night, when the last votes were counted, that lead had slipped to seven points, enough to guarantee a comfortable victory but evidence of general disarray in the last days of a campaign that had been under way for three years.
With 99 percent of the state's 6,002 precincts reporting, Mrs. Whitman had 159,666 votes, 40 percent of the total. Mr. Edwards won 131,017 votes, 33 percent; former State Senator Jim Wallwork won 95,959 votes, 24 percent. Trailing far behind were two other candidates who each accounted for 2 percent of the total: Charles P. Hoffman, with 6,742 votes, and J. Patrick Gilligan, with 6,047 votes.
Governor Florio made it immediately clear that there will be little surcease from the pounding that Mrs. Whitman took in the primary.
"We've taken some lumps over the past three and a half years," Mr. Florio said last night. "Now it's our turn at bat."
James Carville, Mr. Florio's chief political strategist, said in a telephone interview from San Francisco, where he was giving a speech, that the Florio campaign would emphasize both his accomplishments and her liabilities.
 
Homestead Rebates
 "One of the Governor's great advantages," Mr. Carville said, "is that his opponent apparently doesn't have the foggiest notion of what's going on in the homes and businesses of New Jersey."
In the closing months of the campaign, Mrs. Whitman was battered by her opponents for a series of gaffes that underscored their attempts to portray the multimillionaire candidate as someone with no understanding of the problems of the middle class.
In one incident, Mrs. Whitman said, in reference to the state's homestead rebate program, which returns up to $500 to taxpayers, that, "It may seem funny, but $500 is a lot."
In another, she explained her failure to vote in school budget elections by saying that she sent her children to private schools and should not tell parents of public schoolchildren how to spend their money.
In the interview today, Mr. Carville said: "Well, it's not that she's a patrician that will hurt her. It's that she is a 'Let 'em eat Oat Bran' type of person."
Her statements, Mr. Carville said, indicate a lack of concern over "things like having a family budget and the future of the public school system."
 
Building Toward a Blitz
 Mrs. Whitman's primary opponents also criticized her for taking a farmland assessment on family-owned property in Somerset County, reducing her property value assessment by millions of dollars.
Mr. Florio faces liabilities of his own, chiefly anger over the tax increases that he pushed through the Legislature in 1990.
The recent resignation of his chief of staff amid a Federal inquiry into whether state bond business was improperly steered to certain bond houses could also have a negative political impact.
Mr. Carville noted that the Governor had issued new regulations requiring bids for state bond business and had recommended restrictions on campaign contributions from bond houses, although his campaign has so far continued to accept them.
"I think the Governor has acted decisively, changing the way they issue bonds, but I don't know how it will play out" in the campaign, Mr. Carville said.
Campaign aides on both sides indicated that the summer months would feature preliminary skirmishing, with each side husbanding the bulk of the nearly $6 million it has to spend for a television advertising blitz in the final weeks before the Nov. 2 election.
On top of that, early indications are that the Republican and Democratic Party organizations will spend even more -- the Democrats as much as $10 million, the Republicans $7 million to $8 million in "soft," or general party, advertising to help their candidates.

HEADLINE: Democracy's Doldrums

 BODY:
A book entitled "Giants of the Democratic World" would be exceedingly short, briefer even than "Gems of English Cookery." Nobody can recall when so many leaders have found so little public favor. Not only are incumbents of various brands unpopular. They are also generally smaller than life. Europe as a whole fits the writer Jane Kramer's description of Austria: a grand opera performed by understudies.
Bill Clinton, whose 36 percent approval rating is the lowest for any President after four months, can take cold comfort from the advice of a fellow sufferer. During a White House visit, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada urged the President to "wear unpopularity as a badge of honor." But proud defiance did not save Mr. Mulroney, who in February stepped down as party leader as his Progressive Conservatives plunged to a 21 percent approval rating, chiefly due to economic miseries. 
 Nor can Mr. Clinton find much solace in the plight of Britain's John Major, whose Conservatives were re-elected just 14 months ago. Mr. Major's approval rating dipped last month to 21 percent owing to a weak economy and clashes over European integration; it was the lowest registered for any Prime Minister since polling started in the 1930's. Insouciance is Mr. Major's method of dealing with adversity. He was planting delphiniums when he shrugged off new Gallup findings that voters saw him as tired and weary. He later offered this take-it-or-leave-it response: "I am fit. I am well. I am here -- and I'm staying."
The broad pattern has distinctive twists. In Italy, revulsion over widespread corruption has deepened disenchantment. Age helps explain the setbacks of France's Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, who was drubbed in parliamentary elections and is now a lame duck, forced for two years to share power with his rivals. Germany's Christian Democratic Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has been unable to quell right-wing violence or to deliver on promises of painless unification with eastern Germany.
But mingling with local circumstances are common sources of electoral discontent. No leader has yet come up with a remedy for persistent underemployment and listless economies. As the cold war has vanished, so has the unifying potential of a common adversary or a great enterprise. Pursuing consensus, politicians appear to tread water -- a complaint rarely uttered about Margaret Thatcher.
Personal charm and weak adversaries have enabled Spain's Felipe Gonzalez to hang on for a third term as Prime Minister, though his Socialists failed to retain a majority in Sunday's election. But in Spain, too, voters complain of 21 percent unemployment and political drift. Democracy is in the doldrums, for the two reasons that humbled George Bush: a sense of economic decline and neglect of "the vision thing." Hence the special dismay about Mr. Clinton's faltering start, and the widespread hope that he may soon do better. As the old saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats.

HEADLINE: Human Rights for Women

BYLINE: By Geraldine Ferraro; Geraldine Ferraro is a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. world conference on human rights.

 BODY:
What to do about Bosnia? Development? At its world conference on human rights in Vienna, which begins today, the United Nations will wrestle with these issues. Women's human rights are at the center of both of them.
Women's human rights? Yes. In New York, U.N. diplomats from a world outraged about the Balkan carnage, including the systematic rape of countless women, have argued about what to do. And elsewhere in the U.N., diplomats are looking a year ahead toward a world conference on population and development, where women hold the key. 
 Several years ago, women's rights advocates worldwide began to turn up at the same conventions, seminars, university settings, diplomatic receptions and refugee centers. They had many different problems. But as they listened to one other, they saw they had at least one concern in common that no international organization was talking about: violence against women. Female infanticide. Genital mutilation. Wife murder. Sex tourism. Rape. Assault. Discrimination in health care. Barriers to political, social and economic equality that make millions of women less than third-class citizens.
As they talked, the women made a global connection: these weren't scattered "women's problems," not "minor" abuses that some governments had passed to a study commission and forgotten. The women recognized gender-based violence as a matter of fundamental human rights.
Although the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights nominally includes women, the icon of human rights abuse has been a man behind bars, tortured for speaking his mind. Abuse unique to women has been dismissed -- as traditional practice, as too common to worry about, as less important than other things. These are family problems, men say, and the family lies beyond international jurisdiction.
Some nations argued recently in Geneva that human rights are not universal -- that the concept of such rights shouldn't apply to poor countries struggling to develop. At a preparatory meeting for the conference, which is aimed at strengthening human rights, they accused the industrialized North of using charges of human rights abuses as an excuse to avoid giving aid. Development, they said, is a human right, too, much more important than trivialities like the right to vote. Not to mention the rights of mere women.
When women are beaten, raped and killed, as if it didn't matter, they are denied full humanity -- and beings who are less than fully human cannot be allowed to take part fully in government, business, development.
When little girls get less food, less medical care, less education and more work than little boys; when women can't travel, marry or leave home without some man's permission; when rights to vote, meet and speak out are circumscribed; when children and property belong legally only to men; when women are denied the right to control their bodies, how can women be fully human?
The systematic rapes in the former Yugoslavia have aroused the world. The quieter rapes, the quieter abuses, that go on daily have aroused at least half the world, the female half. How can any nation call itself civilized, how can any nation develop properly, until it recognizes the talent of half its population? The Tailhook scandal, the Anita Hill story, show that America is not beyond this blindness.
Slavery was a national and "family" custom and torture has been a traditional practice. The world now condemns them. Women's rights are also human rights. In Vienna, the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights will press the conference to recognize this for the first time and to denounce abuse of women as abuse of human rights.
The campaign, involving more than 800 women's human rights groups, wants the conference to recommend that women's concerns be integrated into every level of U.N. operations. A liaison should be appointed to make sure women's human rights are considered in every U. N. project, and women's status should be studied in every nation's human rights report.
If this happens, governments will have to act on rights abuses that do not occupy the spotlight daily. And women will be freer to make their full contribution to economic growth.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Polish Thatcher

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Next to Hillary Clinton, the most powerful woman in politics today is Hanna Suchocka. This is true despite the fact that the Government headed by the first female Prime Minister of Poland -- and the first woman to lead the nation since Queen Jadwiga in the 14th century -- was recently overturned by a single vote.
Her former Minister of Justice, whom she fired the week before for his habitual tardiness, claims he did not oversleep. He says he left a wake-up call with the hotel operator, who rang him; he told his wife to call him from home, which she did; and he set his alarm, which duly rang. Despite this tintinnabulation of bells, he just did not make it to the Parliament in time for the confidence vote, and the Government fell. We all have mornings like that. 
 The result is a wonderful forward fumble. The old Polish Parliament was a wrangle of 29 splinter parties, many nibbling at Ms. Suchocka's market reforms, deficit reduction and privatization of industry. The no-confidence voters did not expect to win, and even if they did win, expected the usual reshuffling of the old deck.
When Sleepyhead failed to show up and the naysayers upset the Government, President Lech Walesa surprised them all by seizing the chance to dissolve Parliament and to call new elections, keeping Ms. Suchocka (pronounced sue-HUT-skuh) in place as caretaker.
Here's the beauty part: A new law on the books raises the threshold for proportional representation, limiting the parties to a half-dozen or so. The upshot will be a more stable government; the betting is that the Prime Minister whose popularity rating is in the 70's (about that of Mitterrand, Major and Clinton combined) has a good chance of emerging with a stronger hand for reform.
This handsome, matronly, unmarried lawyer of 47 has the unmistakable presence of a head of government. A social and fiscal conservative, she came from a small village, worked her way up the Communist-approved democratic opposition and allied herself with Solidarity. An admirer of Margaret Thatcher, she prefers "Ms." to "Madame" and says: "I am not linked with any feminist movement. But there exists some kind of women's solidarity."
Jane Perlez, the New York Times correspondent I accompanied to an interview with the P.M., is covering the coming campaign and the hopes of Ms. Suchocka that both Mr. Walesa and the Catholic Church will support "reformist tendencies." Steve Engelberg, just returned to The Times's Washington Bureau from Poland, is preparing a magazine profile on Ms. Suchocka. I see my role as pundit to set all this in vast global perspective.
1. Poland faces West with its hopes, and East with its fears. Poles see Russia and Ukraine as nuclear powers with unstable Governments posing a genuine danger. That's why the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, with the world's response only to worsen the mess, troubles a nation bordering these republics of a former union.
2. Poland is expected to be a strong ally of the U.S.; C.I.A. Director James Woolsey was here last week to set up cooperation among spooks. But Warsaw gets little respect from our State Department. When Secretary of State Warren Christopher traipsed about Europe on his halfhearted mission to sell the Clinton plan to arm and protect Bosnian Muslims, he never even sought Poland's help -- and Warsaw has peacekeeping troops in Bosnia.
3. Poland is the prime example so far of the benefits of a sharp turn away from command economy to capitalism. But the shocks, especially to retirees and older workers, are not over; the workers' movement that started it all now finds its members facing more layoffs in dinosaur companies that require streamlining.
4. By their willingness to bear privation in the prospect of economic freedom, the people are ahead of the parliaments across most of Eastern Europe. This legislative lag, most pronounced in Russia, is being overcome by steady pressure from the beginnings of a middle class. In September's election I suspect the Poles will back Hanna Suchocka and oust many of the foot-dragging hacks impeding economic transformation.
A combination of the people's grit, good new leaders and the profit motive have made possible the formation of a more stable, reformist government in Poland -- along with a little bit of luck from a politician who hit the snooze button and pulled the covers over his head.

HEADLINE: Florio Bars Blind Trusts for State's Top Officials

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 10

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio issued an executive order today that will eliminate the use of blind trusts by top state employees. The order is intended to stop New Jersey officials from using blind trusts to shield assets that would otherwise be subject to conflict-of-interest scrutiny.
The order would also prohibit companies owned by the workers -- senior officials of the executive branch and others appointed by the Governor -- from doing business with government at any level, from Federal to local. 
 The rationale for the move was in part political, as Mr. Florio tries to distance himself from a damaging election-year investigation into a company owned by his former chief of staff, Joseph C. Salema.
Whatever the order's impact on Mr. Florio's future, it could bring about big changes in state government because of its long-term potential to require financial sacrifices of government employees.
New Jersey law does not prohibit state employees from investing in companies that do business with the state. But through a blind trust, a New Jersey government employee could place personal assets under the control of an independent trustee to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.
Though a blind trust is usually considered a good-government measure, one that involves ownership of a single company, as it did in the Salema case, would allow a government official to know his assets and how his goverment actions could affect them.
Under Governor Florio's order, people with assets in blind trusts would have to either sell those assets or leave their jobs.
The order applies to all executive-branch employees in policymaking positions and unpaid appointed members of state commissions and boards, about 2,000 people in all. Five state workers, all of them in senior positions, have blind trusts now, the administration said. It did not have any figures on how many of these employees were involved in companies that did government business.
The state workers would have until the end of the year to dispose of assets in blind trusts or leave state service. The same timetable would apply for any holdings that have government-related business.
"Some have said that heightened disclosure might keep qualified people from choosing to serve in state government," Mr. Florio said. "But it is clear the public's trust has to be the primary concern."
The Governor also acted today to tighten rules issued in 1990 requiring employees to file yearly disclosures of assets and sources of income. Now the affected employees and their spouses will have to file amended disclosure statements within 30 days of engaging in a business relationship covered by the order, instead of the current annual disclosure.
Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, said state employees are barred by New York State ethics laws from owning companies that do business with the state. A state official whose assets are held in a blind trust must still fully disclose his financial holdings.
 
Challenge to Whitman
 After Mr. Florio released his order today, Democrats moved swiftly to turn the issue into a political club against Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial nominee. In a letter to Mrs. Whitman, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Assembly, Joseph V. Doria Jr., asked her to disclose all assets and their value and sources of income.
Mr. Doria also said Democrats would introduce legislation within a week that would require full disclosure for all gubernatorial candidates.
Mrs. Whitman is a millionaire whose wealth was an issue during the Republican primary as her opponents tried to portray her as an elitist out of touch with the electorate. Mr. Florio, who has no assets in blind trusts, clearly intends to continue stressing that theme.
Mrs. Whitman said today that she called last month for specific measures to tighten the way that blind trusts are used. Her proposals would require any assets that present an actual or potential conflict of interest to be sold before entering government.
 
Federal Inquiry
 Today's executive order followed one issued on May 4 that required all state agencies and authorities to accept competitive bids on bond underwriting and other professional services. Both are part of an effort by Mr. Florio to distance himself from the troubles growing out of investigations of sales of New Jersey Turnpike Authority bonds that are being conducted by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Federal sources have said the investigation centers on Armacon Securities, a bond consulting company in Camden County that is owned by Mr. Salema and Nicholas H. Rudi. Both men are close political friends of Mr. Florio.
Mr. Salema's 50 percent share of Armacon was in a blind trust. He resigned on May 25 to avoid becoming a political liability for his boss and long-time friend, Mr. Florio, who is facing a tough re-election fight.
Jon Shure, the Governor's spokesman, said today that the executive order Mr. Florio signed would have barred Mr. Salema from owning a share of Armacon and would have prohibited the company from doing business with the state.
There are five other senior state officials with blind trusts: Brenda J. Bacon, chief of management and planning; M. Robert DeCotiis, chief counsel; Robert E. Hughey, director of the State Office of Economic Recover; Steven P. Perskie, chairman of the Casino Control Commission, and Lawrence J. Lockhart, an assistant commissioner in the Department of Human Services.
Under the Governor's executive order, the State Ethical Standards Commission will immediately begin ending blind trusts held by everyone covered by the order.
By June 30 the trustee administering a blind trust is required to notify the commission of all assets held in the trust. The commission is to review the information to determine which assets the official must divest himself of and notify the trustee by Aug. 15. From that point, the state employee would have 120 days to dispose of the assets or to leave state service.
David Bradford, a professor of economics at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, said the strict new guidelines may make it difficult for New Jersey to retain or attract some people to work in state government.
Mr. Bradford also was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Bush Administration.
"I know what I went through, a very, very stringent environment," he said. "At some point, people do say, 'Am I going to subject myself to this?' You do lose people."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Newspaper Whose Independent Streak Helps Boston Define Its Image

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
It claims to have been the first big newspaper in the country to call for an American withdrawal from Vietnam. During the agonies of Boston's school integration struggle in the 1970's, someone fired shots at its headquarters in Dorchester. In the Brahmins' Boston of the late 1800's, it battled hospital rules that barred Roman Catholic priests, even if their task was to administer the last rites to their Irish immigrant parishioners.
In the more than a century since its founding, The Boston Globe -- usually self-consciously responsible, sometimes flamboyantly liberal -- has helped shape the identity of Boston and played a part in the life of the nation. 
 "The Globe is a critical element of Boston life," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the latest Massachusetts politician in the famous family that The Globe has occasionally battled and, some say, too often championed. "Whether you're talking about the social, economic or political life of the biggest city in the region, The Globe is important," Representative Kennedy said this week.
 
'Paddle Our Own Canoe'
 Through the generations, especially since big media companies began to gobble smaller newspapers in the 1970's and 1980's, The Globe has prized its independence as a business. Its image as a newspaper that answered to no one was central to its view of itself. And there were some who said that that was what propelled it to become the dominant newspaper in New England.
"We have been willing to take risks editorially, and we've been able to paddle our own canoe," the newspaper's current publisher and chairman of its parent company, William O. Taylor, told a Globe historian in 1981. Mr. Taylor, 60, who took over from his father as publisher in 1978, is the fourth generation of Taylors to run the newspaper.
Charles H. Taylor, The Globe's original Taylor, who was given the title of "General" because he once served as a military secretary to a Massachusetts Governor, is described as the paper's rescuer rather than its founder.
The Globe was begun in 1872 when the booming city had 10 newspapers. The rival Herald accounted for about half of the papers' combined daily circulation of 170,000. But The Globe quickly prospered, and by the turn of the century, it had the largest circulation in New England.
The Depression brought a change in fortunes, allowing The Herald to regain the lead, which it held until the mid-1950's, while the number of newspapers in the city dwindled to four.
The Globe's founders were six Boston businessmen, including Eben D. Jordan, the founder of the Jordan Marsh department store company. Within a year after the paper was started, most of the original investors were gone. Mr. Jordan remained and quickly called upon General Taylor, then 27, who had already worked as a soldier, a reporter and a printer. General Taylor was originally hired as the temporary business manager. He would become the central figure at The Globe and an important figure in the Northeast and beyond.
Counted among The Globe manager's friends were the movers and shakers of the era, including Joseph Pulitzer (though General Taylor disapproved of Mr. Pulitzer's brand of journalism, saying the owner of The New York World would not be happy unless he saw blood dripping from the pages of the newspaper every day).
Adhering to rectitude as a guiding rule, General Taylor and his descendants have run the newspaper since 1873 and have shared voting control with the heirs of Eben Jordan.
 
Trusts Set to Expire
 The corporate entity that formally owns The Globe, Affiliated Publications, Inc., sold stock to the public beginning in 1973 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Separate trusts set up for the Jordan and Taylor heirs own 33 percent of the stock in Affiliated. But together, the two trusts have 68 percent of the voting power in the company.
The trusts are scheduled to lapse in 1996, and some of the more than 100 heirs are believed to be eager to disentangle themselves from the newspaper. Quietly over the years, a host of potential suitors, including big media companies, have made inquiries about a potential sale. William O. Taylor turned away most of them.
This week, as rumors of the merger with The New York Times Company swirled, there were some in The Globe's newsroom and in Boston who suggested that the independence of the city's top newspaper may have had something to do with the way Boston has viewed itself over the years.
Under the merger, The Globe would retain its management and its editorial autonomy.
 
Not The New York Times
 A sophisticated, world-class city with its own rough edges, Boston had its own world-class newspaper that was -- and this sometimes appeared to be the main point -- not The New York Times. That may have helped the city keep its own distinct identity, said Martin Nolan, a nationally known reporter for The Globe and former chief of its editorial page.
"Do you know what it's like to live in the shadow of New York? It's deep in the New England psyche," Mr. Nolan said. "My own gut instinct," he said of his fears about the deal with The New York Times, "is we're going to be in the farthest reaches of Fairfield County; we're going to be a prominent New York suburb. This is a loss to that New England psyche."
Of course, there are those in Boston who have never forgiven the New York Yankees for buying Babe Ruth from the Red Sox in 1920.
Mr. Nolan, who has been with The Globe 31 years this week, is one of those who remember that The Globe, as he put it, was "a sort of a laughingstock of a newspaper" when he started. For three-quarters of a century until 1967, it did not endorse a political candidate, and its coverage was sometimes seen as parochial.
That changed.
Partly because of the ferment of the times, partly because it began to prevail in the 1960's in its long battle with its archrival, The Boston Herald-Traveler, and partly because of a back-slapping Harvard alumnus named Thomas Winship, The Globe built a national reputation.
Mr. Winship succeeded his father as editor of The Globe in 1965. In his youth the younger Mr. Winship worked at The Washington Post. At The Globe, he emulated the style of his friends Benjamin C. Bradlee, The Post's editor (whose son is now a rising editor at The Globe), and Philip Graham, The Post's publisher.
 
Cambridge and Georgetown
 Mr. Winship traveled the "Cambridge-Georgetown axis" of Harvard and Washington intellectuals and government servants, as the writer J. Anthony Lukas put it in his book on Boston, "Common Ground." Mr. Winship propelled The Globe toward a broader national perspective and toward a more activist stance on local issues.
It was not always a clear path, and there were always -- and are still -- questions about how committed to Boston's urban core the mass-distribution Globe was. "The Globe's prevailing voice" during some of Mr. Winship's term, Mr. Lukas wrote, "was that of a Harvard-educated lawyer from the suburbs -- affable, humane and well intentioned, but no longer entirely comfortable in the city of his youth."
Long strong in its coverage of sports, Mr. Winship's Globe refined a specialty in political reporting. It was host to lively columnists. Its investigative reporters zeroed in on local wrongdoing like bid-rigging in the government of Somerville, Mass., with enough punch to win a Pulitzer Prize.
In 1980, perhaps the height of the Thomas Winship era, The Globe won three separate Pulitzer Prizes.
 
Crisis Over Busing
 But the Boston school crisis was especially difficult for the newspaper. It was sometimes criticized for appearing to be too protective of its city. On the first day of court-ordered school busing, The Globe's headline said "Boston Schools Desegregated, Opening Day Generally Peaceful." Other national newspapers, including The New York Times, focused on the rock-throwing, jeering crowds that greeted black students in South Boston.
The Globe did aggressively persist on the school story, though, sometimes angering residents so much that the newspaper took its name off the cars used by reporters.
In 1975, the paper was rewarded with a Pulitzer Prize for "massive and balanced coverage of the Boston school desegregation conflict in a bitterly emotional climate."
There were other Pulitzers and other controversies to come. But since 1984, the newspaper has not won a Pulitzer. In journalism circles, that fact is often said to be an indication of editorial troubles in recent years.
After Mr. Winship retired in 1985, the publisher appeared unable to settle on a successor. There were high-level departures, and there was dissention among the news staff.
One editor, Michael C. Janeway, left after 14 months and a bitter battle over his management style and conflicting visions for the future of the newspaper. For a long period, The Globe simply left the position of editor vacant. During the tenure of Mr. Janeway's successor, John S. Driscoll, The Globe was widely criticized for appearing to drift, and it was sometimes beaten on Boston news by The Herald, now owned by Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Company.
"I just don't think it's been aggressive enough on public issues," Mr. Winship said this week. But he and others said that in recent months The Globe appeared to be, as Mr. Winship put it, "coming back on the tracks" under the stewardship of Matthew V. Storin, 50, who was appointed editor in February.
After a long career in high-level editorial positions at The Globe, Mr. Storin resigned in 1985 because of a dispute with Mr. Janeway. In his time away from The Globe, he held a series of journalism jobs, including the editorship of The Chicago Sun-Times and the managing editorship of The Daily News in New York.
Mr. Storin returned to The Globe last summer as executive editor. In the months since his promotion to editor, Mr. Storin has received high marks for increasing competitiveness in news and upgrading national coverage. He is also perceived to be trying to alter the newspaper's image of recent years as a publication aimed at Boston's suburbanites and the region's intellectual elite.
"I think he understands that the paper was perceived as relentlessly liberal and out of touch," said Mark Jurkowitz, the media critic at The Boston Phoenix weekly, "and he's trying to do something about both."

HEADLINE: Medical Group Battles to Be Heard Over Others on Health-Care Change

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 10

 BODY:
When the 435 delegates to the American Medical Association's governing congress arrive here Sunday for their annual summer meeting, the first speaker on the agenda will be Hillary Rodham Clinton. The doctors will be listening closely for hints on who among them -- if anyone -- the Clinton Administration has been heeding as it develops its proposal for overhauling the nation's health-care system.
Until recently, there would not have been any question. The medical association was the undisputed, all-powerful voice of medicine in Washington, and no major overhaul had much chance of succeeding without its cooperation. 
 These days, though, the association is battling to make itself heard over some 80 medical specialty groups, many of whose views on health reform differ substantially from those of the A.M.A.
And splits within the doctors' ranks are part of a larger trend that has undermined the association's stature in Washington. Insurers, hospitals, medical-equipment makers, pharmaceutical companies and support professions are all much more powerful players than before.
 
'Other Centers of Power'
 "As medicine became the nation's biggest business, other centers of power arose," said Dr. Quentin Young, a prominent Chicago internist.
In the early days of the health debate, the medical association and the other trade groups all found themselves shunted to the sidelines as secret groups appointed by the Clinton Administration weighed possible overhauls. Eventually the cold shoulder was supplanted by a polite ear, allowing Dr. James S. Todd, the association's top executive, and other representatives to have frequent meetings with top Government policy makers.
Dr. Todd says he is convinced that those meetings have resulted in modifications of the Administration's thinking. But, he adds, "We won't know the results until we see the proposal."
The medical association has about 290,000 members -- roughly 41 percent of the nation's doctors. While the number is higher than ever, the percentage is well down from the 70 percent level the organization enjoyed before dues were increased sharply in the 1970's and the specialty groups began expanding rapidly.
The organization still commands both public and professional respect for its anti-smoking and other public health campaigns, and its many scientific publications. And its political action committee, by far the richest of any in the health field, remains the profession's preferred vehicle for trying to catch Washington's attention with dollars. In the last two years, the committee has donated more than $2.9 million, most of it to Congressional candidates -- more than any other lobbying group except the National Association of Realtors.
 
'Need More Input'
 But the membership includes many doctors, especially women, members of minorities and students, or residents, who feel that their views and needs are given too little weight because aging white males dominate its governing boards and activities.
"A lot of the individuals at the top need more input from those of us who are going to practice for the next 30 years," said Dr. Jorge Menendez, a young plastic surgeon from Stamford, Conn., who attended a medical association meeting in Washington in March.
Most of the major specialty groups send representatives to the association's House of Delegates, a medical version of Congress that meets twice a year to set policies for the group. Citing the representatives' participation, the association asserts it speaks to and for 90 percent of the medical profession.
That may be true on issues like the group's campaigns against smoking or reducing malpractice suits. But it is hardly the case in the current debate on revamping the health-care system.
Some specialty groups like the 80,000-member American College of Physicians and the 72,000-member American Academy of Family Physicians have split with the medical association by endorsing a national cap on health spending. Several smaller groups, like the 6,000-member Physicians for a National Health Program, go further, arguing for a Government-managed system like Canada's.
 
A.M.A. Proposals Criticized
 The schisms were most vivid last year when the medical association's revamping proposals were publicly derided by Dr. John Ball, executive vice president of the College of Physicians, for lacking any "realistic or effective cost-containment measures." The public hatchets were buried after a January meeting between the two groups.
But Congressional staff members say many medical groups are complaining privately that the association's views are getting too much attention. And most specialty groups have little confidence that the association can be relied on to protect all of their interests.
The increased visibility of other medical groups and of trade groups that laid out varying overhaul ideas has helped Dr. Todd and a new generation of A.M.A. leaders that came to power in the late 1980's push the association's old guard toward compromises and advocacy of national changes that would have been unthinkable a short time ago.
Dr. Todd, a 62 year-old Cape Cod native who practiced surgery in New York City and New Jersey for more than 20 years before joining the association's staff in 1985, took over as executive vice president in 1990. That same year, the association shocked the Bush Administration by calling for major overhauls, including requirements that employers provide minimum health insurance for all workers and that the Government finance insurance for everyone else.
"The White House called us on the carpet," said Dr. Todd, recalling with relish the publicity that ensued. "I asked what they wanted us to do and Dick Darman just said, 'Cool it!' " Dr. Todd added, referring to Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget chief.
The association did not back away, but many other groups, including a number of medical specialty societies, were already advocating far bigger changes. The association has responded with a flexibility that has impressed many former critics.
"The Government may have arrived a little after Hippocrates, but they've decided they have to negotiate with us and that we shouldn't be treated with disdain," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.
In an effort to broaden the appeal of its proposals, the association has gradually softened its opposition to broad spending limits, provided doctors can participate in setting them. And association leaders have suggested they might back voluntary price controls to help keep costs down as changes are being phased in, if the package includes reduced exposure to malpractice suits, streamlined insurance systems and less Government regulation.
"Our proposals and the College of Physicians are now pretty similar when you take into account all the fine print," said Dr. Todd, who constantly preaches the virtues of coalition-building over confrontation. "The Clinton Administration has definitely been encouraging everyone to come to them separately to divide and conquer us."
Leaders of rival medical groups and Washington insiders agree that the association's influence could grow when it comes time to cut deals over legislative and regulatory language. No other group is in a better position to find and expand points of consensus.
"We deal with the A.M.A. only," said Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals and is one of several hospital trade groups active in the debate on health reform. "We're not going to run around dealing with all the splinter groups of doctors."
The association encourages such attitudes by supporting 17 Washington lobbyists, a presence that dwarfs other medical groups. And the group has the wealth -- a $200 million total annual budget, most spent on educational activities, and $100 million in reserves -- and experience mobilizing doctors to shape public and Congressional opinion.
"My colleagues listen to folks from home and that's the A.M.A.'s strength," said Representative Stark.
 
The Biggest Challenge?
 Perhaps the A.M.A.'s biggest challenge will be to combat the general assumption that it is more interested in its members' welfare than the public's. The group's own surveys show that the average doctor's earnings jumped from $48,000 in 1973 to more than $170,000 in 1991, about 15 percent more than general inflation.
But the figures mask wide disparities. Dr. Todd said that many doctors have lost ground during that period. Surveys also show an overwhelming majority of doctors saying that increased regulation has made medicine far less satisfying over the years.
As the debate unfolds, the group continues to flesh out its position with new reports. The upcoming congress, for example, will review the organization's latest plan for what should be included in a basic health-insurance package for all Americans. But Dr. Todd is already trying to prepare his members for a sobering outcome.
"I don't think the A.M.A.'s influence is waning but the problems are so much greater that no one is getting everything they want," he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. to Weigh Options on Bosnia Border Monitors

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 10

 BODY:
The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution today asking Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to prepare a report on "options for the possible deployment of international observers" to verify that Serbia is keeping its promise to cut off military aid to the Bosnian Serbs.
But the Council's decision remains an empty gesture that is unlikely to bring any action soon, because President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has refused to allow such monitors into his republic. 
 The resolution's main supporters -- Britain, France, Russia and Spain -- argue that the Council must at least prepare the legal framework for deploying the monitors along Serbia's border with Bosnia even if they cannot immediately be sent into Serbia. Failing to do so, they say, would amount to letting President Milosevic dictate the Council's agenda.
Britain's delegate, Sir David Hannay, said it would be in Belgrade's interest to cooperate with the Council by accepting the monitors rather than engaging in "a new act of defiance."
 
U.S. Remains Skeptical
 The American delegate, Madeleine K. Albright, said she remained skeptical about Mr. Milosevic's willingness to put real pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. But she said the world would soon know whether he was sincere about ending the war or "engaging in another elaborate hoodwink."
Other members went along without enthusiasm. Several argued that the Council would only further sacrifice its already diminished credibility in the Bosnian crisis by adopting another resolution whose outcome is in question.
The United States and the Council's members from the developing world have made clear that they favor a different approach that involves lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslims so they can rearm and recapture lost territory.
But last month the Clinton Administration abandoned that position after running into implacable opposition from Britain, France, Russia and Spain, which said it would only escalate the fighting and force them to suspend relief work.
 
Show of Allied Unity
 Instead, in an attempt to show allied unity toward, Secretary of State Warren Christopher joined the Foreign Ministers of these countries in devising a three-part program at a meeting in Washington on May 22.
Under this plan, they agreed to create a tribunal to hear war-crimes charges, to send more soldiers to protect the six safe havens that the Council has designated for Muslims in Bosnia, and to deploy monitors to the border between Serbia and Bosnia.
The Council has already taken action on the first two proposals. Supporters of the program see it as an attempt to start enforcing portions of the peace plan prepared by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, which would divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces under a weak central government in Sarajevo.
The monitors would attempt to reinforce the United Nations trade embargo in an effort to pressure the Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan. The decisions to protect safe havens and create a war crimes tribunal were intended to halt Serbian "ethnic cleansing." But it remains unclear whether any of these measures can be put into effect soon.
Next week, the United Nations Secretariat is to tell the Council that it needs a force of 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers to protect the safe havens -- far less than the 25,000 soldiers it initially requested but which the United States and others warned could never be raised or funded.
The United Nations already has forces in all of the safe havens except Gorazde. But countries contributing additional troops will not allow them to be sent in without the permission of the Bosnian Serbs. And it is not clear whether the Serbs will allow reinforcements.

HEADLINE: As Iran Chief Faces Vote Today, West's Doubts Rise

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, June 10

 BODY:
When President Hashemi Rafsanjani first took office in 1989, some diplomats greeted him as a moderating force in a country dominated by radical Islamic clerics.
Just over a year ago, some Western envoys hailed the ouster of some parliamentary hard-liners as a victory for the President and a turning point in Iran's relations with the West. But as Mr. Rafsanjani heads into an election on Friday that he seems virtually assured of winning, diplomats are increasingly skeptical that he will use his second four-year term to cut off Iran's support for shadowy groups threatening other governments in the region. 
After a series of assassinations of exiled Iranian dissidents and renewed friction over Teheran's backing for Islamic and Palestinian militants in Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied territories, American diplomats have reassessed the 58-year-old President's intentions and his influence.
 
Focus on Economy
 Mr. Rafsanjani's struggle for control of revolutionary Iran now centers on free-market reforms to revive the economy, they say, and he has little interest in jeopardizing his fragile power base by seeking to ease political repression or end state-sponsored terrorism.
Western diplomats suggest that the President's chief aim in cultivating a moderate image was to attract European and Japanese investment and woo back the Iranian business managers and engineers who fled after the Islamic revolution in 1979. So far he has achieved neither goal, and envoys in the region doubt that he has enough domestic support to restructure bloated industries influenced by hard-line clerics.
Meanwhile, the strategy for containing the Islamic Government's activity abroad has sharply divided Western allies. Countries like France, Germany and Italy still view Mr. Rafsanjani as the only hope of curbing Iran's sponsorship of state terrorism and its hard-line clerics; the United States insists that Iran must remain a pariah, no matter who governs, until its policies change.
"It is not in our interest to have an economically powerful and politically resurgent Iran," a senior American diplomat in the region said. "While President Rafsanjani talks of opening Iran to the West, he means opening Iran to Western technology and capital. The longer Iran remains economically crippled, the less damage it can do."
 
U.S. Withholds Ties
 The Clinton Administration, disturbed by Iran's support for militant Islamic groups in the region and by what it describes as a steady arms buildup, including an effort to buy or develop nuclear weapons, refuses to lift trade sanctions or to resume diplomatic ties with Iran. Last month a State Department report assailed the country as the "world's principal sponsor of extremist Islamic and Palestinian groups."
The repression characteristic of presidential campaigns here involves few subtleties, and Iranians interviewed on Teheran's tree-lined avenues raised their eyebrows in amazement when asked to predict the outcome of Friday's voting.
Political parties are banned in Iran. Only contenders chosen by a council of conservative clerics can run. There are no campaign rallies. Television and newspapers are in the hands of Islamic fundamentalist organizations, and the three unknown opposition candidates have vied to lavish praise on the incumbent.
"The selection of four presidential candidates does not mean that these four people should represent four different points of view," said one candidate, Abdullah Jasbi, president of the Islamic Open University.
Also running for President are a former Labor Minister, Ahmed Tavakoli, and a former member of Parliament, Rajab Ali Taheri.
 
Uses of the Election
 But while the vote has stirred little enthusiasm here, diplomats expect Mr. Rafsanjani to use it to promote his free-market program.
"I hope that at the end of the second term the country will be in a totally different shape than it was at the beginning," Mr. Rafsanjani said in his second and final campaign broadcast Monday night.
Still in tatters from an eight-year war with Iraq, the Iranian economy is paralyzed by a lack of foreign investment and by inefficiency in many industries. Though the official unemployment rate is reported to be 10 percent, diplomats believe that it is much higher, and inflation has been running at an annual rate of 40 percent.
Fourteen years after the Islamic revolt that overthrew Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, many Iranians are also tiring of the sermons that monopolize state television, the police squads that roam cities enforcing Islamic tenets of dress and behavior, and the restraints on civil liberties.
To allay public discontent, the Government recently drew on its limited hard-currency reserves to restock shops with electronic goods and food products that had all but disappeared over the last decade.
 
Often Stymied by Hard-Liners
 But even with the backing of Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the President's economic program is often stymied by hard-line clerics, many of whom have called for a boycott of the election on the ground that no candidate has proposed an alternative to Mr. Rafsanjani's free-market policies.
Political and economic power in Iran is shared by about 150 clerics. Many of them are linked to five main Islamic charity foundations that essentially operate as vast holding companies, controlling industries that produce shoes, cars, aluminum, pharmaceuticals, candy and even ham for export.
The foundations employ hundreds of thousands of workers. However inefficient some of those industries are, the clerics who run them show little inclination to turn them over to the private entrepreneurs Mr. Rafsanjani says he has waiting in the wings.
"The outcome of the election is preordained," a Western diplomat said, "but what will follow is not. How much reform is possible? How much power can be centralized?"
For Abdel Rezza Ahmed, an official at the 15th of Khordad Islamic charity organization, the future can be summed up in one word: Islam.
Sipping tea from a glass cup and nibbling coconut cookies, Mr. Ahmed sat placidly on a recent morning in an office whose walls bore a poster showing the British author Salman Rushdie clutching a copy of his book, "The Satanic Verses." Mr. Rushdie and his novel were being devoured by bright orange flames.
The organization for which Mr. Ahmed works has offered to pay more than $2 million to anyone who kills Mr. Rushdie, who was condemned to death in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for blasphemy.
"When Mr. Rushdie is dead," Mr. Ahmed said, "it will mean we have removed one more obstacle on the path to an Islamic paradise."
Faced with such pronouncements, some European diplomats in Teheran criticize what they say is the shortsightedness of the United States Government.
"President Rafsanjani is the best alternative we have," a European Ambassador said. "If he fails, what will follow will be much, much worse and the United States will have to bear most of the blame."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls by 20.21 as 3M Shares Tumble

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
A big plunge in shares of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, sent the blue-chip index lower yesterday.
Without 3M's decline the market was fairly flat, analystss said. The Dow industrials finished down 20.21 points, to 3,491.72. 
 3M said second-quarter earnings would be higher than a year earlier, but by less than previously expected because of slowing United States sales growth. The stock dropped by 10, to 105 3/4, on 2.29 million shares traded, nearly 10 times its three-month daily average of 297,300.
Another big decline came in Helene Curtis, which also scaled back its sales and earnings outlook. Its shares tumbled 5 1/2, to 28.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 232.6 million shares, down from 249 million shares Wednesday, as declining issues outpaced gainers by a ratio of 5 to 4. Except for the Nasdaq composite, which was off 1.19 points, to 688.05, the other market indexes were off less than a point each.
Many investors were on the sidelines, analysts said, ahead of today's report on producer price inflation for May.
"A lot pulled back because everyone knows that the Federal Reserve has the green light to raise short-term interest rates, so today's May Producer Price Index number is important," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany. "But if the number shows an increase of one-tenth of a pecentage point, or less, it could touch off a spirited rally in stocks and bonds.
Gene J. Seagle, director technical research at Gruntal & Company, sees little worry over inflation.
"Looking at the stock market, the Dow industrial average was at 3,232.50 at its January bottom," Mr. Seagle said, "and despite worries about the Fed, Russia, President Clinton, the health program, and a myriad of other depressants made an all- time high on May 27 of 3,554.83.
"The market is still correcting its May move from 3,400 to 3,580 in intraday trading and also working off an overbought condition." He expects the Dow to rise to at least 3,600 this summer.
 
Drug Stocks Exhibit Strength
 Some drug stocks exhibited strength yesterday. Merck, the only drug stock in the Dow industrial average, rose 7/8, to 37 5/8; Bristol-Myers Squibb 1 1/4, to 59 1/2, and Schering-Plough rose 2 1/4, to 66 1/4.
Semiconductors came under pressure as Texas Instruments fell 1 1/2, to 66 1/4, and Intel dropped to 54 5/8, down 1 1/4.
First Savings Bank, in Greenville, S.C., saw the price of its stock jump by 2 and finish at 13, after the bank said it was in talks to be acquired. First Savings did not indicate by whom or for how much.
Andrea Electronics stock fell 9 5/8, to 31 7/8, after the company confirmed reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry on the wild trading activity of its stock, but that no formal investigation has commenced. It also said it was in negotiations with certain companies in the public telephone industry for the sale of its Active Noise Cancellation products.

HEADLINE: Wanted: Contributors in Search of Immortality

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Call it an answer to the yearning for immortality: for a price, universities and colleges will carve the name of a generous benefactor in limestone on an imposing building. Too costly? The donor can opt for a piece of the building -- a student lounge, a science laboratory, a library, even a photography darkroom -- dedicated in perpetuity with a bronze plaque.
The practice of marketing buildings and other campus landmarks is hardly new, but it is reaching new dimensions. Squeezed between faltering government support and rising expenses, private universities and colleges are pursuing potential donors as never before, with lists of "naming opportunities" ranging from research institutes to plastic seats in an athletic stadium. 
 Rutgers University, for one, will put the name of a donor on a locker in the locker room for the men's football team for $1,000. Fifteen have been designated and 10 are waiting adoption by loyal fans of the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers also has pricier offerings, like a new library wing under construction on the New Brunswick campus, available for a $2.5 million gift.
To name a building, a donor does not have to pay the entire cost of construction, but most schools require signing on to pick up at least a third to half of the cost.
The pursuit of major donors is commonly entrusted to a high-ranking school administrator, though universities are increasingly bringing in outside consulting businesses. Typically, the opportunity is broached during a friendly luncheon and the potential donor gets a glossy photograph of the offered properties and a price list.
 
Giving Something Back
 "At New York University, we encourage people to put their names on things," said Naomi B. Levine, the senior vice president for external affairs who has a reputation as an adept strategist in matching the school's priorities and donor preferences. "In many instances, a gift is the donor's way of saying, 'I want to give something back in return for my education.' "
If a persuasive word is needed, Mrs. Levine can call on a board of trustees including such influential New Yorkers as Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS, who is the board chairman; Leonard N. Stern, chairman of the Hartz Group whose name is on the university's Business School, or George H. Heyman Jr., an advisory director at Lehman Brothers who plays a significant role as volunteer chairman of the University's Development Committee.
"There is not a door these men and women cannot open for me," she said.
Mr. Tisch, whose family donated $30 million to name the hospital that bears their name (formerly University Hospital), invites other trustees to luncheons where they identify prospective donors and decide which board member is best positioned to pursue the goal.
New York University, in the midst of a campaign to raise $1 billion by the year 2000, has a long list of naming opportunities including a 23-story biomolecular medicine building waiting for a donor willing to make a $10 million gift. It also has a new business library to be named in appreciation of a $5 million contribution, and four student residences.

 At Columbia University, for $25 million each, donors can put their names on the college's library, the Neurological Institute or the law school library. Columbia has other lower-priced naming opportunities, including the molded plastic chairs in Wien Stadium at $5,000 apiece.
In the past, the largest gifts to the university have not been designated for buildings. John W. Kluge, the chairman of Metromedia and a 1937 graduate, gave Columbia $60 million for minority scholarships last April, saying at the time that he was not interested in buildings named after him and "would rather do something for human minds." Two earlier gifts totaling $50 million went for minority scholarships and assistance to young scholars and junior faculty members.
Occasionally, a college will take a building in use for decades under one name, and rededicate it in honor of a new donor, with the approval of the first donor's surviving relatives.
In some instances, college authorities will rededicate the building with ceremony but take care to keep a plaque honoring the first donor in some less commanding position. Others use both names, hyphenated.
 
A Second Opportunity
 Brandeis University, for example, got a second naming opportunity for a building that was to be rededicated as a new admissions center after bearing the original donor's name for many years. The grandson of the original benefactor agreed to the change, saying, "After much soul-searching, I decided my grandfather would have wanted the university to benefit in any way possible."
The campus of Brandeis, which opened in Waltham, Mass., in 1948 without benefit of the financial cushion of an endowment, offers abundant evidence of its debt to benefactors: a tribute wall and hundreds of plaques on everything from buildings, classrooms, walkways and even a boulder.
Abram L. Sachar, its first chancellor, has said Brandeis, which had no prospects of substantial alumni gifts for a least a generation, survived only because of its wide circle of donors.
 
Roosevelt Memorial House
 Hunter College also offers a renaming opportunity as it casts about for donors to provide $3 million to renovate and endow a double town house at 47 and 49 East 65th Street, originally purchased by Sara Delano Roosevelt to be shared by her son and daughter-in-law, the newly married Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The house, donated to Hunter College in 1943 to serve as an interfaith center, needs extensive repairs to restore the President's library and equip the center for college and community activities promoting religious and racial harmony.
The building's name will be retained as the Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House, but a number of rooms will be offered for naming.
The practice of honoring benefactors goes back centuries. A young Puritan minister named John Harvard started the process in the American colonies in 1636 by bequeathing a few hundred pounds to establish a college on the Charles River in Massachusetts.
New Jersey's ailing state university was rescued in 1825 by Col. Henry Rutgers, who gave the school $5,000 and a bronze bell, a gesture that led to the naming of the school in his honor. The bell is still in use, and each of the college's 2,000 graduates is invited to ring it at commencement each year.
 
An Urban Garden
 High on Fordham University's list of naming opportunities is a property the size of half a city block, just south of Lincoln Center on West 62d Street between Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues, which now resembles a parking lot. Fordham would like to turn it into a grassy urban garden with space for a sculpture area and a glass-enclosed dining section and still leave room for students to toss flying disks.
The university was offered the property in the early 60's by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who approached the late Laurence J. McGinley, Fordham's president.
"There was some grumbling about whether the university was taking on an investment that would become an economic liability," said Bruno M. Santonocito, vice president for development and university relations, "but the university agreed and so became owner of one of the city's most valuable open spaces." Depending on how Fordham develops the site, it will need between $250,000 and several million dollars -- and has identified six naming opportunities for people with that much money.
Fordham also is looking for benefactors to share the costs of developing a library at its Bronx campus. The building itself has been named for Daniel C. Shedrick, a businessman who made a fortune selling baseball, football and hockey cards and gave $10 million to his alma mater, the school's largest gift. But naming opportunities exist for rooms and work stations in the building.
The Jewish Theological Seminary of America is looking for donors to renovate its landmark tower destroyed in 1967 -- a restoration likely to cost millions. The seminary recently lost one benefactor's name: after his conviction for insider trading, Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur, asked the seminary to remove his name, saying he wanted to save the school embarrassment, and it obliged.

HEADLINE: MOYNIHAN HOLDING WELL-TIMED PARTY

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
A week before the Senate Finance Committee began reworking President Clinton's economic package, supporters of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan mailed invitations to lobbyists for a fund-raising event that reminded them of the New York Democrat's enhanced influence as chairman of the panel.
No laws were broken by Mr. Moynihan or by his campaign organization, and his aides noted that the Senator did not know who was invited nor who was responding to the invitation to an event that will be held a month after the committee completes its work. 
 But an advocate for changing the way campaigns are financed said the Senator had been insensitive at a time when public skepticism about the influence of lobbyists on Congress is especially sharp.
Invitations to the $5,000-a-person event at the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center, which will be limited to 30 people, is scheduled for July 19. That will probably come before a Senate-House conference committee reconciles versions of the economic package that emerge from the two Houses.
Mr. Moynihan is up for re-election next year.
 
Oversees 98% of Revenue
 The invitation, mailed last week, noted, "Most importantly, Senator Moynihan is now chairman of the Finance Committee where he will oversee 55 percent of all Federal spending and 98 percent of all revenue raising, as well as health care reform and trade."
Mr. Moynihan's office referred questions about the letter to William T. Cunningham, a consultant to the Moynihan campaign. "I can't imagine how you can put pressure on somebody to buy tickets for something when the items they are most interested in have already been decided," said Mr. Cunningham. "During his entire career, a question has never been raised about conflict of interest in his fund-raising, and it shouldn't now. Senator Moynihan has been fastidious."
Mr. Cunningham added: "If you had public financing you wouldn't have to do this stuff. No matter what date you pick, somebody is going to say there's an appearance of conflict of interest."
Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that lobbies for campaign finance changes, disagreed. "It's a serious conflict of interest," she said. "In a time in which concern over the role of special interests is at an absolute height -- a campaign finance bill is on the floor of the Senate, the President is bashing lobbyists every day -- for a senior member of the Senate to be insensitive to this seems to be absurd."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was Mr. Moynihan's predecessor as chairman of the Finance Committee, was sharply criticized six years ago when he invited lobbyists to join a breakfast club for $10,000 apiece. Mr. Bentsen withdrew the idea, calling it "a doozy"of a mistake.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits New Low Vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The dollar hit a new low against the yen yesterday even as the manager of the nation's currency market dealings stressed the need for stability.
Administration officials have been talking the dollar down against the yen this year to promote exports and discourage imports, in hopes of narrowing the vast trade deficit with Japan. William J. McDonough, manager of the Federal Reserve System's open market account, set a contrasting tone at a quarterly briefing yesterday, stating the Government's intent to avoid a headlong selloff. 
 As of late April, he said, "The dollar-yen exchange rate was at that point moving too far, too fast, in part due to apparent misperceptions in the market of U.S. policy makers' views." He later added, "If the market perceives a U.S. policy in appreciation of the yen, the market is mistaken."
Lending detail to moves already familiar to market strategists, he confirmed that on April 27, the Government sold a modest $200 million in yen for dollars, evidently coordinating its support for the dollar with the Bank of Japan.
 
Dollar at 106.16 Yen
 That intervention braked the dollar's decline at about 109 yen, then a record, but only temporarily. As the dollar has fallen since then, currency traders have seen the Fed's hand in the market several more times, into the beginning of this week. These moves have generally been slight, however, more to indicate the Government's sentiments than to fight the trends.
Yesterday, the dollar fell to 106.16 yen from 106.45 in New York, leaving a currency worth 20 yen less than in January.
Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.6295 marks, from 1.6358 late Wednesday, after gaining on Wednesday from some well-timed comments by George Soros, the manager of a large investment fund. Mr. Soros said that German interest rates were likely to fall, reducing the mark's attractiveness.
Traders saw no reason to relent in selling the dollar against the yen, however. So far, the American and Japanese Governments have tried only to slow the dollar's decline, not halt it, said Michael Levy, a currency options trader at Societe Generale. "As long as that happens, you will have people trying to push it down and down," he said. "Why stop now?"
Speculators can use strategies that yield huge profits from even a slight change in rates. These strategies often accelerate the market's momentum.
The dollar dipped below 105.9 yen before recovering yesterday, but Mr. Levy predicted a test of the 105 level. Traders will be watching today's report on producer prices, and Tuesday's on consumer prices, for signs of revived inflation, which could produce higher interest rates and a stronger dollar.
At yesterday's news conference in New York, Mr. McDonough, in tones of measured forbearance, formally confined his remarks to the three months through April, the Fed's own distinctive quarter. The Fed's press release went to the extent of quoting Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, on the risk that currency volatility would hinder growth.
In late May, Mr. Summers released a report noting that the yen's rise could reduce the trade deficit but then denied that the Government was seeking any such thing. Far better, he said, for the Japanese to reduce the trade deficit by stimulating their economy and increasing consumption.
Traders said that with the Japanese economy already stagnant, the Bank of Japan had become increasingly restive about letting the yen's appreciation stifle exports.
Volatile exchange rates can upset other financial markets and cause business planners to hesitate. The President himself has a stake in containing the dollar's decline against the yen and keeping it from spreading to other currencies, said Steven H. Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities in New York.
"It's a piece of baggage you don't need, because the signal it gives is that neither Americans nor foreigners are that confident about the Administration," he said.
Despite the Fed's independence in monetary matters, the Treasury has the final say when it comes to the currency. Mr. McDonough said that the Government, committed to floating exchange rates, had not endorsed any targets or changes. April's support for the dollar, backed by some statements from Treasury officials, only signaled the markets and, as he put it, "re-established a sense of two-way risk."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Gold and Silver Fall
 By Reuters
Gold and silver prices declined again yesterday on expectations that today's Government report on producer prices will show a cooling down of inflation at the producer level.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery dropped $2, to $371 an ounce. The actively traded gold contract had lost $2.60 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, July silver fell 3.5 cents, to $4.31 an ounce.
 Analysts said the market seemed to be factoring in forecasts for a rise of only one-tenth of a percent in the Producer Price Index for May, down from April's increase of six-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: Paternity Suit Just Another Crisis in Rhode Island

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., June 10

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans alike today dismissed an unfolding scandal over a paternity suit against Gov. Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island as a titillating but temporary problem.
The suit was filed by a 17-year-old Michigan girl whose mother was involved with the 73-year old Democratic Governor for several years in the 1970's, after his second marriage. 
 But residents of the country's smallest state today jammed the airwaves, on radio talk shows, to debate the Governor's obligations to Kara Kathleen Hewes, whose news conference in Birmingham, Mich., was broadcast live on Wednesday afternoon on Providence television.
Ms. Hewes, who bears a strong resemblance to the Governor, appeared to capture the sympathy of many Rhode Island residents with her clear, calm responses to reporters.
Ms. Hewes, along with her mother, Judith Hewes, on Wednesday filed a paternity complaint against Mr. Sundlun in Oakland County Circuit Court in Michigan, asserting that he is her father and seeking an undisclosed amount of financial support with back payment to her birth.
The complaint asserts that DNA and blood tests show with 98.96 percent certainty that Kara Hewes is the Governor's daughter. Mr. Sundlun has 28 days to respond to the lawsuit once it is served.
 
More Difficult Crises
 Guy Default, chairman of the state's Democratic Party, said Mr. Sundlun had weathered more difficult crises since his 1990 election. Upon taking office he froze 250,000 credit union accounts as he confronted a statewide banking crisis; in 1991 his wife, Marjorie, nearly died in a car accident, and he has to contend with what is proportionally the largest budget deficit of any state.
"This'll be a short-term blip," Mr. Default said. "Rhode Island being so small, this is a very learned electorate. They've come to focus on substantive issues rather than on insignificant but titillating ancient history."
A Republican political consultant, Thomas J. Cashill, offered a similar assessment. In an interview today he said Rhode Islanders had known that they were electing a "womanizer" in the Governor, who married his fourth wife in 1985.
"It doesn't really matter," Mr. Cashill said. "These things last about 72 hours."
The Governor was the first to mention the suit in a news conference on Tuesday, and he addressed the issue again on Wednesday and today. He said it was very likely that he was Ms. Hewes's father. But Mr. Sundlun, who is a millionaire, said a 1976 agreement and a $35,000 settlement with Judith Hewes had relieved him of further financial responsibilities. He also said that "my own rights of fatherhood were lost upon Kara's adoption by Mr. Hewes in the late 1970's."
Judith and Robert Hewes were divorced in 1985, Kara Hewes's lawyer, Henry Baskin, said. Mr. Hewes's Miami telephone number is unlisted.
In an interview taped today by the NBC affiliate in Providence, Governor Sundlun directly addressed his daughter Kara: "It's going to be difficult. But somehow or other, you and I have got to fight our way through those obstructions. We've got to get by Mr. Baskin; we've got to get by your mother. My hands are out and my heart is open. I hope yours is, too."
In the news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Sundlun defended his treatment of Kara but criticized her mother's handling of the situation. "I really do not think that I can be accused of ignoring Kara or not wanting to have a relationship with her," Mr. Sundlun told reporters. "Candidly, I do not feel the same about Judith Hewes."
Governor Sundlun acknowledged on Tuesday that he had had an affair with Judith Hewes, then Judith Vargo, in the early 1970's when he was single, and headed an airline company in which Ms. Vargo served as chief flight attendant. But the Governor's office issued a statement today saying that the affair continued briefly during his third marriage to Joy Carter Sundlun.
Neither Kara Hewes nor her mother could be reached for comment yesterday, because they were resting, Mr. Baskin said.

HEADLINE: Middle of the Road;
Clinton's Policy on Trade, It Turns Out, Has Similarities to the Bush Approach

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
As a symbol of how President Clinton's newly announced Japanese trade policy is similar to President George Bush's, consider Harold A. Poling, the strong-minded chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, who accompanied Mr. Bush to Tokyo last year for trade negotiations that proved to be a political disaster
On Friday, Mr. Poling will be coming to Washington to join another round of talks with Japan, this time for President Clinton. But while his business companions last year were other Big Three chairmen, they will be replaced on Friday by the chief executive of a far broader group of companies -- Motorola, Apple Computer, Tenneco Automotive and American International Group, the insurance giant. 
 After months in which trade watchers puzzled over often-contradictory signals from the Clinton Administration over its trade policy, the proposal announced this week seems to be what President Clinton in February said it would be: something in between.
 
Similarities and Differences
 It tracks the Bush approach by keeping America open to imports, seeking to tear down Japanese barriers and avoiding public threats of trade sanctions. And it pursues a middle path between free trade and protectionism much like the Bush Administration, which denounced managed trade while obliging Japan to limit its car shipments here, and Taiwan to limit its shipments of factory tools.
There are significant differences, too. The Clinton policy uses a few extra numerical targets like seeking to reduce Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world to between 1 and 2 percent of Japan's annual economic output.
Former Bush Administration trade officials are most alarmed by the setting of targets for Japan's overall trade surplus with the world. The reason is that the trade surplus could be trimmed not by opening the Japanese market to imports but by cutting its exports to the United States.
 
Could Shift Produciton
 "Japanese multinationals have factories throughout Southeast Asia, so if there was a need for them to reduce the surplus, they could always shift production," said Eric I. Garfinkel, who was President Bush's Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Import Administration. The result of such a shift in production would be larger American trade deficits with countries like Thailand and Malaysia instead, he added.
The Clinton Administration's response to that problem is a second target: increasing Japan's imports of manufactured goods by a third within the next several years. Japan imports a smaller percentage of its manufactured goods than any other industrialized country.
The new strategy also takes clear precedence over national security concerns, unlike the Bush Administration approach, and it is backed up by the prospect of sanctions later. It enjoys support from both ends of the business spectrum and includes lavish financial backing for export-oriented high-technology companies.
All told it combines American complaints about the way the Japanese economy is organized with complaints about specific industries' trade barriers, instead of handling them separately. And it coincides with an enormous expansion in the Japanese trade surplus that has increased world pressure on Japan.
In Mr. Clinton's first Presidential address on trade, he outlined a vision of a world in which free trade was kept alive by aggressive action to dismantle unfair barriers, and promised a trade policy that would confront foreign trade barriers without restricting the entry of foreign goods into the United States.
 
Middle of the Road
 He posed the idea as one that fell between what he called "voices from the extremes."
"One says government should build walls to protect firms from competition," he said. "Another says government should do nothing in the face of foreign competition, no matter what the dimension and shape of that competition is, no matter what the consequences are in terms of job losses, trade dislocations or crushed incomes."
As President Clinton promised then, the new American strategy is a combination of unilateral, bilateral, regional and global initiatives. The White House plan is also combined with domestic policies aimed at strengthening the same industries that would benefit from more open international markets.
"This is consistent with what our membership has been calling for," said Willard Workman, the United States Chamber of Commerce's vice president for international affairs.
Mr. Workman, a former Reagan Administration trade negotiator, said that the Clinton Administration might be wise not to threaten Japan publicly with trade sanctions, leaving it to journalists and other trade policy observers to point out that domestic American law allows considerable freedom for the Administration to limit imports from Japan if it becomes dissatisfied with the pace of negotiations.
"When you have a hammer, it's always better to have someone else say you have a hammer," he said.
According to the International Monetary Fund, Japan's current account surplus has widened to $117.6 billion and 3.2 percent of economic output last year, from $35.8 billion and 1.2 percent of economic output in 1991.
"Japan's surplus is, today, the major asymmetry in the world economic system," just as the American trade deficit was a large disorder in the world economic system in the mid-1980's, a senior Administration official said on Tuesday. Whereas the United States ran large trade deficits with most of the world eight years ago, it has now moved into balance with most countries.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 2,000 last week, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 345,000, down from a revised 347,000 in the previous week. Claims were previously thought to have totaled 344,000 for the week that ended on May 29. They totaled 338,000 in the week that ended on May 22. 
 Many economists had predicted that claims would drop by several thousand last week.
The less volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts prefer to track because it more accurately reflects the labor situation, rose to 342,750 in the latest reporting period, up from 340,750 a week earlier.
The Labor Department report also said 26,104 applications were filed under a Federal emergency unemployment program in the week that ended on May 29, down from 26,559 in the previous week. The emergency claims and individual state figures lag behind the overall total and the four-week moving average by one week.

HEADLINE: Ruling Scuttles Plan to Collect Taxes on Reservation Sales

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 10

 BODY:
New York State's highest court outlawed a state plan today that was intended to help the state collect taxes on the sale of gasoline and cigarettes by Indian retailers to non-Indian customers.
The unanimous decision killed a State Department of Taxation plan intended to do two things: collect as much as $100 million in unpaid taxes and force up prices on Indian reservations, where sales by tax-free stores to non-Indians are booming. 
 The ruling, by the State Court of Appeals, outraged the owners of hundreds of gasoline stations and convenience stores outside Indian reservations, who say they are losing ground to a growing number of Indian-owned businesses that sell tax-free goods.
"Competition I can handle; this I can't," said Salvatore Aronica, the owner of a gas station and store seven miles outside the Seneca Nation reservation south of Buffalo. Mr. Aronica said he has been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by Seneca businesses that sell gasoline for 20 cents less a gallon than he does.
 
Hailed by Indians
 New York State Indians hailed the ruling as an important affirmation of their sovereignty, one that would help economic development on reservations by safeguarding the tax-free advantage maintained by Indian businesses.
"If this case went the other way, we would have lost hundreds of jobs," said Barry Snyder, head of the 6,000-member Seneca Nation. "But this has never been about money. It has been about honoring our treaties."
Today's ruling does not question the right of the state to collect taxes on sales by Indians to non-Indians. But because Indian land is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, states cannot seize property there to enforce tax collection.
The state regulations struck down today represented a novel attempt to circumvent such restrictions by collecting taxes from non-Indian cigarette wholesalers before they had even sold their goods to Indian retailers. The cost of the taxes presumably would have been passed along to the retailers and then to their customers.
Under the 1989 regulations, state officials made estimates of how many cigarettes were sold to Indians on certain reservations. Based on those estimates, the state allowed wholesalers to sell a certain number of tax-free cigarettes to Indian businesses. But sales beyond that would be taxed on the theory that they would be resold to non-Indians.
The regulations, which could have been applied later to gasoline wholesalers, were challenged almost immediately by a Buffalo cigarette distributor, Milhelm Attea & Brothers, Inc., who said the state was interfering with commerce on Indian reservations in violation of Federal laws.
 
Appeal Remains Possible
 In writing for the court, Associate Judge Richard D. Simons agreed, saying that "no room remains for state laws imposing additional burdens" upon companies doing business with Indians.
State Commissioner of Taxation James W. Wetzler said the state had not decided whether to appeal the case in Federal court. But he said a solution to the state's problem of attempting to collect taxes to which it is legally entitled would come from either Federal legislation, the United State Supreme Court or a negotiated settlement with Indian nations.
Mr. Wetzler said the tax-free status of Indian reservations have made them attractive to tax-evasion schemes by non-Indians. For instance, some distributors try to avoid taxes by claiming they sell exclusively to Indians when they actually do thriving business with non-Indians.
Mr. Wetzler estimated that Indian stores account for about 7 percent of all the cigarette sales in the state, over 113 million packs a year. He said uncollected taxes on sales by Indians to non-Indians amount to over $70 million on cigarettes and $30 million on gasoline each year.
The state levies a tax of 56 cents on a pack of cigarettes and 32 cents on a gallon of gasoline.
At the Shinnecock Smoke Shop on the Shinnecock Indian reservation in Suffolk County, a pack of Marbloros costs $1.90. But at the Townhouse Deli down the road in Southampton, the same pack costs $2.95, up from $2.75 a week ago because of a 17-cent increase in state taxes.
"They have a line for their cigarettes like you wouldn't believe and we are losing sales big time because we are getting slammed by taxes," said Robert C. Capo, owner of the Townhouse Deli.
Organizations that represent gasoline station and convenience store owners reacted angrily to today's ruling, calling on the state Legislature to find relief for non-Indian businesses.
One bill proposed by Senate Republicans would reduce state taxes on businesses near Indian reservations by 50 percent. No similar bill has been introduced into the Democratic-led Assembly.
Constance K. Barrella, vice president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, said Indian businesses have grown rapidly in recent years because their proprietors are now marketing their tax-free status more aggressively.

HEADLINE: Plan Seeks To Rebuild Downtown Of the Bronx

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
Gambling that an infusion of public money will reverse 25 years of decline, state, city and Bronx officials announced yesterday an ambitious plan to rebuild the Bronx's downtown. They said the plan was aimed at encouraging private investment in the borough and keeping the Yankees in the Bronx.
The officials, announcing a proposal developed through Borough President Fernando Ferrer's office, admitted they had no guarantees on financing. Rather, they said, the plan was intended as a framework for rebuilding the area around four huge public projects in the next decade at an estimated cost of $1 billion. 
 In a ceremony at Alex and Henry's restaurant off 161st Street, Mr. Ferrer, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Bronx community advocates spoke of the plan as the economic shovel they hope will bury the area's poverty as well as the symbol of the Bronx as the pre-eminent example of urban decay.
"As Charlotte Street came to be a metaphor for urban struggles in the 1970's, let this Bronx Center become synonymous with an urban success story for the 1990's and beyond," Mayor Dinkins said.
The announcement, if an idealistic call to combine money, education and culture in one 300-block area, was also firmly grounded in political reality. The Mayor hinted that the looming budget gap could hurt the plan. And as he faces a mayoral race in which the Hispanic vote will be crucial, Mr. Dinkins was effusive in his support for community organizers, Mr. Ferrer and the plan itself, which could have a broad impact on the largely Hispanic communities surrounding the Bronx Center.
 
'A Very Special Capacity'
 Whatever the political implications, Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said in an interview that the plan appeared to be a wise move, even if the politicians faced public skepticism because no money was in place for it.
"This is an effort to take current public investments and to link them to give them a greater impact than any one project would have," he said. "We have to appreciate that New York has a very special capacity to propose partially funded visions that become reality. The point is they are going to take existing public money and try to get other investments."
Though the numbers are vague, the plan could mean thousands of jobs, both in construction and in permanent positions, said Richard A. Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly, the Manhattan nonprofit planning group retained to develop the $200,000 report. The total cost would be as much as $3 billion and the overall plan would evolve as it developed to include small parks, high schools, shopping areas, health-care units, access to the Harlem River and improved transportation.
The plan, developed with community groups extensively involved, includes the area bounded by 165th Street on the north, 147th Street on the south, the Harlem River on the west and St. Ann's Avenue on the east. This area is already the Bronx's economic and municipal core, including Yankee Stadium, the Bronx County Building, Bronx Criminal Court, the Bronx Terminal Market and the Hub, a central shopping district.
The 48-page document released yesterday centers around four projects already in planning or construction: Melrose Commons, a 2,600-unit housing development off Melrose Avenue; the new Police Academy, at Grand Concourse and 153d Street; the new State Supreme Courthouse off 161st Street; and the Juvenile Detention Center, at 149th Street and Brook Avenue, the only one of the projects already under construction.
 
New High Schools
 The plan calls for three new high schools in the area: one near the Police Academy for teen-agers interested in becoming police officers; another in the court building to train high school students for legal careers such as paralegals, stenographers and secretaries, and another near Yankee Stadium focused on sports-related careers like trainers and managers.
The plan would also encourage retail development along the Grand Concourse and would upgrade the Metro-North station on Park Avenue and 161st Street to bring more people into the area. The first project would be to renovate the ground floor of the old County Courthouse, a Beaux-Arts landmark at Third Ave and 161st Street. This project would cost $600,000 -- not yet raised -- and the building would the center for the plan's development over the next few years.
High on the planners' priorities were concessions to the Yankees baseball team, whose lease on the stadium expires in 2002. The city is currently in negotiations with the team owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, and the plan would include ferry service to the stadium, a baseball museum and a 3,000-car garage near the river, on top of which is planned a park and possibly an arena.

HEADLINE: Mastercard and Midtown: City Hall Wins in New Tack

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
In a decision that company officials say turned more on New York City's intangible assets than on simple economics, Mastercard International will keep its headquarters in mid-Manhattan rather than move to Westchester County.
For the city, Mastercard's decision to move from its current Manhattan headquarters into nine floors of the old Burlington House on the Avenue of the Americas means holding onto 450 jobs, and if Mastercard's own growth projections hold true, getting another 750 within the next 12 years. 
 But beyond the numbers, it also amounts to a symbolic victory in the Dinkins administration's long-running battle to keep corporations from fleeing the city. And both they and Mastercard officials hailed the company's decision as validation of the city's position as the nation's pre-eminent business center, despite its high taxes and other costs of doing business.
Mastercard executives insist that the ultimate decision never came down to a playoff between incentive packages, that their talks with Westchester never reached that stage. They concede that moving to White Plains would have reduced their occupancy costs over the next 20 years by 25 percent. They say that the availability of a more sophisticated labor pool in New York and the city's vibrant atmosphere ultimately kept the company in Manhattan.
 
New Strategy by City
 "If you want to hire people who are multilingual, who have international experience, and if you thrive in a stimulating environment, then being in New York is just more important than being able to sneak a midweek round of golf in the suburbs," said Alex W. (Pete) Hart, Mastercard's president.
Still, Mastercard received an unusual package of tax incentives that Dinkins administration officials said signaled a new strategy in their economic-development efforts. The package represents New York's first offer of abatements that are tied not just to existing jobs, but to job growth.
Under the agreement, if Mastercard maintains its current employment level of 450 jobs, it will receive a relatively small package of incentives amounting to no more than $2 million over the next 20 years. It will receive a real-estate tax credit for each employee it hires above that level. But if it increases its staff to 900 -- something that its managers expect to do by the year 2000 -- the tax breaks would amount to $8 million, prorated over the 20 years.
"For us this is a new approach to jobs in this city," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "We've spent a lot of years looking at job retention. Now, for the first time, we are focusing on job growth. We held onto a lot of jobs during the recession, and now we don't want to play defensive ball anymore."
According to the city's estimates, keeping Mastercard, with a staff of 450, would mean $81 million to the city from corporate taxes, personal income and sales taxes, and related business travel. With a staff of 900 people, the boon to the city is estimated at $176 million.
 
Earlier Decisions
 Neither the incentive numbers nor the revenue numbers are huge, particularly compared with the multimillion-dollar packages that the city has offered larger companies like BankAmerica or Morgan Stanley to locate here or to stay here.
BankAmerica, with 1,700 jobs in the city, announced that it would take eight floors at the World Trade Center in April, after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the center's owner, offered the huge bank two years' free rent, and after the city offered it a package of sales tax breaks and other incentives worth $15.5 million over the 15-year term of its lease. Similarly, last year when Morgan Stanley considered moving 4,100 jobs to Stamford, Conn., the city kept it in Manhattan with a tax-incentive package worth $39.6 million over a 10-year lease.
But for New York it represents a new way of figuring the importance of a company to the local economy, not in terms of immediate cash or job infusions, but in terms of future growth.
 
Company's 3-Year Study
 Mastercard's lease calls for it to take seven floors now and an additional two floors in a couple of years -- a total of 350,000 square feet -- at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, at 55th Street, the old Burlington Industries building. Veteran deal-watchers in real estate said Mastercard had negotiated a rent in the high $30's per square foot a year, along with a substantial contribution to the cost of building the offices to Mastercard's specifications, as well as more than a year's free rent. Those numbers represent a good deal even for large, credit-worthy tenants.
Mastercard's decision is the culmination of a three-year study that began with looking at whether Mastercard should consolidate its international headquarters, which was crammed into 170,000 feet at 888 Seventh Avenue, at 53d Street, with its huge data center in St. Louis -- and if that consolidation took place, whether the newly combined company should be in New York, Missouri or elsewhere.
By the fall of 1991, Mastercard had already decided that it would lose too many people if it tried to move either operation and decided to keep them separate.
But the next decision was not so cut and dried: Should Mastercard keep its headquarters in midtown or move it to Westchester.
Westchester -- and particularly White Plains, with its easy rail and car accessibility -- was an early leader. Costs were lower, and Mastercard's chances of getting a building built to its own specifications were far higher.
 
The Other 20%
 Still, Mr. Hart and many of his senior executives were reluctant to give up what they saw as the international prestige of a mid-Manhattan address, as well as the availability of what they considered a higher-caliber cadre of professional staffand a more sophisticated atmosphere.
"People tend to believe that relocation decisions are driven entirely by economic factors," said Les J. Cranmer, a principal of PHH Phantus Consulting, a management consulting firm in Florham Park, N.J., that Mastercard hired to help it evaluate the repercussions of moving. "In fact, in a front office relocation, maybe 80 percent of the things are quantifiable, and 20 percent are things you just can't attach numbers to."

Shares of 3M Plummet on Sales Report

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 10

 BODY:
Shares of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company plunged today after the company said slower-than-expected domestic sales growth would cause it to miss Wall Street's projections for the second quarter.
3M shares fell $10, to $105.75, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The 8.6 percent decline accounted for much of the drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, in which 3M is one of 30 stocks. 
 Analysts scratched their heads at the steep decline. "It's a surprise but not a shocking one," said Eugene Glazer, who follows 3M in New York for Dean Witter Reynolds. "They are reporting a moderate slowdown."
Some analysts speculated that institutional shareholders had rushed to lock in profits generated by the 20 percent run-up in 3M shares over the last year, to a recent peak of $117. The consensus earnings forecast for the year was cut yesterday by 2.4 percent to $6 a share, from about $6.15.
 
Modest Gains Expected
 3M, which is based in St. Paul, and best known for its Scotch brand tapes, is one of the most diversified manufacturers of industrial, medical and consumer products in the United States. It makes more the 60,000 products, many derived from its expertise in what Kimberly Retrievi, who follows the company for Lehman Brothers, described as "goos, films, or goos spread on films."
The company said it expected to report only a modest gain from the second quarter of 1992, when it earned $317 million, or $1.45 a share, on sales of $3.5 billion, instead of the growth of about 10 percent that many analysts had projected. The company's information and memory storage products have been among the hardest hit by the slowdown, but L.D. DeSimone, the chairman and chief executive of 3M, said an across-the-board slowing of the American economy seemed to be the main problem.
"A majority of our businesses have experienced slower U.S. growth so far this quarter," Mr. DeSimone said.

HEADLINE: Hint to Fed On Rates Is Louder

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
A day before the release of a closely watched report on inflation, the White House subtly turned up the pressure today on the Federal Reserve not to raise short-term interest rates, suggesting that inflationary pressures remain weak.
After announcing that President Clinton met Wednesday night with the Federal Reserve's chairman, the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, sent the central bank a clear message, saying that Administration officials "believe there is no real inflationary pressure in the economy." 
 Ms. Myers also said she believed that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction program "would help keep interest rates down."
 
 
Fed Asks for Clarification
 Hours later, however, Ms. Myers issued a clarification, at the central bank's request, saying her comments did not mean that Mr. Greenspan had endorsed the plan.
Interest in the Fed's stance remains particularly high as economists try to get a better fix on how fast inflation is actually rising while the economy continues its slow growth.
On Friday, the Labor Department will issue its report on wholesale prices in May, and many economists say that if the report shows a sharp increase, coming after a surprising jump in inflation in April, the Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates immediately.
In recent days, Mr. Clinton, in what is widely seen as a signal to the Federal Reserve, has said several times that it is critical for interest rates to remain low. On the defensive over the economy's lackluster performance, the Administration has repeatedly underlined the importance of low interest rates for lifting the economy out of its slump.
 
 
Link to Deficit Package
 A rate increase would also upset the White House because President Clinton has often boasted that his $500 billion deficit-reduction package has set the stage for a period of low interest rates.
Administration officials said that when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan met Wednesday night in the Oval Office, they discussed the President's budget package and the state of the economy, including inflation and interest rates.
At her daily news briefing, Ms. Myers apparently made a faux pas that upset the Federal Reserve chairman by saying, "I believe chairman Greenspan thought that the deficit reduction" of the President "would help keep interest rates down."
Administration officials said the Federal Reserve had asked for a clarification of Ms. Myers's statement. Although Mr. Greenspan had told Congress that the President's deficit reduction plan would help push down interest rates, the Fed chief was worried that her statement might be construed as saying he endorsed the President's embattled plan.
 
 
Avoiding Conservatives' Wrath
 Since many conservatives tore into Mr. Greenspan for initially praising the President's plan, the central banker has appeared to be straining to show that he is not in Mr. Clinton's pocket.
Within hours, Ms. Myers issued a statement saying that she "did not mean to imply" that Mr. Greenspan "in any way endorsed the President's economic package now before Congress."
Her statement added that Mr. Greenspan "said the President's economic initiative had set into motion a process that he feels reasonably assured will in the end lead to significant deficit reductions. He went on to say that passage by the Congress of any credible deficit-reduction plan would help to keep long-term interest rates low."
 
 
A Sensitive Time
 One Administration official said the White House produced its clarifying statement so quickly because it was eager not to offend the Federal Reserve at such a sensitive time.
Administration officials said that Mr. Clinton had asked for the hourlong meeting and that it was something the two men planned to do periodically.
Among the other officials attending the meeting were Robert E. Rubin, coordinator of the National Economic Council, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and David Gergen, the White House counselor.
Even as Ms. Myers sent subtle signals to the Fed today, she tried to show that the White House was not trying to push around the proud central bankers. "The Fed is an independent agency and we don't presume to control their decisions," she said.
 
 
'We Remain Optimistic'
 "However, I think most of the people here, the economic advisers, believe that there is no real inflationary pressure in the economy, although there's been some uptick," she added. "We remain optimistic about inflation."
Federal Reserve officials are tilting toward raising rates because they are concerned that inflation has jumped to a 4 percent rate in recent months. But many central bank officials believe that the wholesale prices report on Friday and the consumer prices report on Tuesday will show lower inflation.
The Clinton Administration's gentle nudging of the Fed has been far different from the Bush Administration's muscular jawboning. Fed officials say in private that relations with the new Administration have been far better than with the Bush Administration even though all the current Fed governors were appointed by Republicans.

HEADLINE: Japan's Chief Economist Sees Signs of Recovery

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 10

 BODY:
Japan's chief economist, in a step toward declaring an end to the nation's worst recession in two decades, said today that the economy would deteriorate no further and that signs of recovery were coming into view.
"The economy has generally hit bottom," Hajime Funada, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, told a Cabinet meeting today. His remarks came as the agency submitted a monthly report on the economy that while far from ebullient had a somewhat more positive tone than in recent months. 
 A recovering Japan would be welcome news for its struggling companies and pessimistic consumers, and for America and the rest of the world. A healthy Japan would buy more foreign products, reducing Japan's nettlesome trade surplus.
 
 
Other Views
 But many politicians, business leaders and economists, while agreeing there are some positive signs, do not agree that the recession is anywhere near over or even that the bottom has been reached.
They say that corporate profits are expected to decline this year for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, consumer spending is weak and the rapid rise of the yen is about to deal a fresh blow to Japan's already weakened automobile and electronics companies.
"When you look at data, most economists in town would agree that we're past the worst," said Jesper Koll, chief economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. "But being past the worst doesn't mean the economy is going to recover to 3.3 percent growth," he added, referring to the Government's official growth target for this fiscal year. "There is no section of the economy that is better off than it was six months ago, one year ago or even three years ago."
Still, the notion of a recovering Japan has touched off a bitter debate that is not so much academic as political. There is widespread speculation here that the E.P.A., with the backing of the powerful Finance Ministry, wants to declare the recession over so that Japan will not come under pressure to stimulate its economy at next month's summit meeting of industrial nations.
 
 
Rescue Packages
 In the last year Japan has announced two major economic rescue packages containing more than $200 billion in increased public works spending and other incentives, an amount, Mr. Koll noted, that is equivalent to the total economy of Belgium.
But the United States, for one, has been calling on Japan to take further pump-priming measures to help drive the world out of recession and to increase Japan's imports. Many Japanese business leaders favor another stimulus package, including possibly a cut in income taxes. The Finance Ministry is against further fiscal stimulus because it fears having a national budget deficit.
As word spread this week that the E.P.A. was preparing to declare that the economy had turned a corner, powerful voices rose in protest, including those of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and of the Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying group.
When the report was issued today, any mention of the economy bottoming out or the recession being over had been removed. Instead, the report merely says that Japan's economy is in an adjustment phase and that some movement toward a recovery is emerging. But Mr. Funada then expressed his own judgment that the economy would get no worse and would slowly get better.
 
 
Criticism of Government
 Business leaders have complained since the recession began that the Government failed to notice that the economy was slipping into recession two years ago and took too long to devise countermeasures.
The E.P.A. in particular has been criticized for being too optimistic. It held to an unrealistic forecast of 3.5 percent economic growth last year, before finally cutting the figure to 1.6 percent, which still might prove too optimistic. This year's target, 3.3 percent growth, compares with some outside economists' forecasts of only 1 percent growth.
"These guys are excellent at turning out very good quality statistics but they are slightly out of touch with the realities of a very dynamic economy," Mr. Koll of S. G. Warburg said.
Kenji Umetani, an E.P.A. official, said today that there were several signs of recovery: housing starts were picking up, the economic stimulus packages were starting to kick in and sales of some electric appliances were showing signs of life. Domestic sales of videocassette recorders in April rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the first year-to-year increase in nine months.
In addition, Mr. Umetani said, excess inventories had been worked off and the diffusion index, a group of leading economic indicators, had been in positive range for two months.
Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist in Asia for Deutsche Bank, said he thinks the economy hit bottom at the end of last year. But he said the rise of the yen, which would make Japan's exporters less competitive, could wipe out much of the growth expected for this year. In Tokyo trading today, the yen rose to another record high.
Still, some other highly visible economic figures, such as automobile sales and department store sales, continued to fall.

HEADLINE: Tough Talk on Trade By U.S. Envoy to Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 10

 BODY:
With the United States and Japan heading into a period of unusually bitter exchanges on economic issues, the American Ambassador here described Japan's efforts to depict itself as a free trader as "propaganda." He said it would only stiffen the Clinton Administration's resolve to use market share targets to open Japan to imports.
"I admire the chutzpah that this P.R. campaign represents, and in some respects I welcome that the Japanese are touting themselves as the champions of free trade," the Ambassador, Michael Armacost, said in an interview today. "It goes without saying that those who wish to enjoy that reputation will be held accountable to a higher standard of conduct."
 
 
Reflection on Difficult Times
 Mr. Armacost, a highly regarded career diplomat, is expected to wind up a four-year tour here this summer, and to be replaced by former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Reflecting on the difficult times he has spent in Japan, he said he was pleased at how well the two nations had managed the array of tough security and political issues that had followed the end of the cold war. 
 But he openly expressed frustration over the fact that years of negotiated agreements and promises from the Japanese have produced only a temporary reduction in their trade surpluses, which are now soaring to record levels. He characterized the harsh protests by the Japanese against the Clinton trade proposals as little more than an attempt to deflect attention from the huge surpluses.
"I hope people are not being too persuaded by some of the P.R. that's been flowing so freely recently, which is designed to dismiss the problem, or suggest that it's a product of short-term factors that will take care of themselves, or, in any event, the surplus will be recycled and in the long run it will go away," Mr. Armacost said. "That isn't an adequate answer."
The only alternatives, he indicated, are the sort of proposals the Clinton Administration had made, which will be negotiated intensively in the next several weeks. The United States is demanding that Japan agree to specific targets for imports and market access for foreign companies.
Japanese officials have vehemently denounced President Clinton's new strategy as a breach of the principles of free trade, and some have started personal attacks on the President, describing him as a neophyte in international affairs who is relying on his heart rather than his head. Some officials have also attempted to argue that Japan's economy is more open than America's.
Mr. Armacost, who had long backed a much broader and less specific approach to balancing Japan's trade, said he now feels that the Clinton Administration's tougher approach is justified. He added that while at one time such economic concerns took a back seat to the more pressing demands of trying to hold the line on the spread of Communism in Asia, times had changed.
 
 
'Undermines Confidence'
 "I do believe that in the post-cold war world the United States cannot afford to subordinate its economic interests to strategic concerns," he commented, and added, "There is a belief that a failure to come to terms with these problems undermines confidence in the alliance."
Mr. Armacost said that both sides shared some of the blame for the bitter edge in the relationship, at least in the economic sphere. For several years the United States failed to bring down its budget deficits, he said, and those have contributed to America's trade deficits.
But the Clinton Administration is now taking concrete steps to bring the deficit under control. Meanwhile, Mr. Armacost said, the Japanese surplus is expanding wider than ever, with the Japanese Government offering little more than denunciations of the new trade policies in Washington.
"Unfortunately there has been a kind of reversion to the old pattern of exporting their way out of the current recession," Mr. Armacost said. "I sense a loss of momentum in the effort to deregulate the economy."
 
 
Global Trading System
 He also criticized Japan for not taking firmer steps to help bring to a conclusion negotiations to revitalize the global trading system. For several years now the major trading nations have been struggling to design a new trade regimen that would open markets further and enhance the free flow of goods as well as services.
Japan, Mr. Armacost said, has benefited more than most countries from the global trading system, and thus ought to be a leader in making the difficult political decisions necessary to open markets further. This, he said, was another area in which Japan was obliged to show leadership by taking the initiative in using its huge markets to benefit other countries.
"I believe we do practice different forms of capitalism," Mr. Armacost said of Japan and the United States. "The differences, I think, are increasingly familiar. What is needed, I think, is a harmonization to some degree, but not a homogenization."

Boeing Sees 600-Seat Jets in Future

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that preliminary marketing studies indicated that the world's airlines could need 400 to 500 so-called Very Large Commercial Transport planes during the first decade of the next century.
The feasibility of the plane, known as the VLCT, was being studied by Boeing and four European companies. The plane would carry about 600 passengers, compared with 421 in the Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet. 
 Separately, Boeing said three airlines had ordered nine Boeing 767 jets at a total value of about $700 million. Boeing shares fell 37.5 cents, to $38.375, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
The announcement on the very large plane was made at the Paris Air Show by the directors of the study, which was being conducted by four European aerospace companies -- Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace, CASA of Spain and Deutsche Aerospace of Germany -- and Boeing.
The yearlong study began in January, and Boeing and the European companies have met monthly since February to discuss technical issues, develop marketing forecasts and examine the feasibility of creating a consortium to produce the plane.
 
'All Signs are Positive'
 "We're a long way from deciding whether to launch a big airplane," John Hayhurst, the Boeing program director for the joint study, said in a statement. "But so far, all the signs are positive."
Jurgen Thomas, the European program director for the study, said: "The study is off to a faster start than we had anticipated. We agree on many points, and we both believe that the only way the VLCT will be produced is through an international partnership."
The two directors said the technology existed to develop a 600-seat airplane, adding that a plane of that size could operate out of most big international airports. They said a VLCT could have an initial range of about 7,000 nautical miles, with the possibility of future derivatives that could carry more than 600 passengers or fly farther.
"If our initial estimates hold up, it appears that there could be a viable market for the VLCT" starting about the end of the decade, Mr. Hayhurst said.
Separately, Boeing said Gulf Air, which is based in Bahrain, had ordered two 767-300ER's (extended range); EVA Airways of Taiwan had ordered four 767-200's, and Japan Airlines had ordered four 767-200's. Delivery dates were not announced.
 
Orders Are Encouraging
 Available in various configurations, the 767-200 carries 181 passengers and the 767-300 carries 218 passengers. To date, 50 customers have ordered a total of 665 of the 767's.
"I'm encouraged by the level of orders we're seeing given the economic environment," said William B. Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle. "Asia is kind of weak right now, and we're especially nervous about Japan because J.A.L. is such a key customer for Boeing, so the fact that they placed an order is a positive."
Mr. Whitlow said the very large transport plane presented both positives and negatives for Boeing: While it would create a huge new market opportunity in the long term, it would require significant research and development spending that would squeeze earnings in the short term.
"On balance, it's a positive because Boeing seems to be in a position today to take the lead in that market," he said. The joint effort under way "with key Airbus partners would seem to preclude Airbus from doing it," he said, referring to the European aerospace consortium which makes Airbus planes.

HEADLINE: Haiti: End the Charade

 BODY:
After 20 months of dithering, Washington finally seems to have summoned the political will to apply serious pressure for the restoration of democracy in Haiti.
The United States, Canada, Venezuela and France are preparing to ask the U.N. Security Council to slap a worldwide ban on oil shipments to Haiti, backed up by Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use of military force. The oil embargo would reinforce a toothless Western Hemisphere economic embargo. And it would be accompanied by a new round of political negotiations timed to exploit Tuesday's resignation of Marc Bazin, the military's figurehead Prime Minister. 
 American will has been the issue all along. Haiti's corrupt and undisciplined 7,000-man army stands isolated at home and abroad, no match for determined international pressure. Traditionally, Haiti's top generals have been eager to accommodate Washington's wishes, provided those wishes were clearly and consistently expressed. The generals' intransigence this time around has been fed by the mixed signals emanating from Washington since the September 1991 coup.
The Bush Administration publicly proclaimed its commitment to restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's democratically elected Government. But American diplomats privately sent signals to the generals that they distrusted Father Aristide, whose uncompromising assaults on the corrupt and violent crowd he replaced triggered the coup and the reign of terror that followed. And by its blatantly racist policy of delivering would-be refugees from the terror back to Haiti, the Bush Administration eased the pressure on the rest of the world to achieve a political solution.
President Clinton ignored his own campaign denunciations of the mistreatment of Haitian refugees and continued the cruel Bush policies. He promised accelerated diplomacy. But Mr. Clinton was thwarted by the Haitian military's contempt for a process it sees no reason to take seriously. Able to evade regional sanctions by importing oil from Europe, and noting the Administration's backpedaling on Bosnia and other issues, Haiti's generals have simply folded their hands.
Tougher policies are needed, but that doesn't mean sending in the Marines. Haiti endured 19 years of U.S. military occupation earlier this century, and no one, President Aristide included, favors even a brief reprise of that unhappy experience.
The right way to get tough is to enforce a worldwide oil embargo. Most of the oil reaching Haiti comes by sea from the Netherlands and is unloaded in Port-au-Prince harbor. For the past year the U.S. has demonstrated the capacity to stop tiny refugee boats from leaving Haiti's most remote beaches. Big deep-water tankers should be a lot easier to turn around.
The U.S. would not have to enforce the embargo alone. Canada has already offered ships, and Venezuela, Argentina and France might also be willing to help. With enough cooperation from exporting countries, active naval enforcement may prove unnecessary. And, with help from the Dominican Republic, Haiti's single land border can also be sealed. With outside supplies cut off, oil stockpiles would run out within a month or two.
Already, thousands of Haitians have died and tens of thousands more have tried to flee for their lives while two American Administrations played pretend diplomacy. Twenty months after a brutal clique overthrew Haiti's first democratically elected Government is not too soon for Washington and the rest of the world to get serious about defending legitimacy, democracy and human rights.

HEADLINE: It's Not Too Late for Clinton to Get It Right

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A History of Gergenism" (editorial, June 2) and "The Constant Hearts" by A. M. Rosenthal (column, June 1): Americans of my generation, children of the Depression years, who grew up during World War II and were very active and centrist Democrats, voted for President Clinton because we believed he was an intelligent and practical professional politician who had learned from his McGovern activist days and his governorsip of Arkansas that we as a nation are people of the center. Many of us had voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush in 1988 because we did not agree with the ideology of the Democratic Party or feel represented by its shrill, often faddish culture. We voted for President Clinton.
I am at a loss to understand how this intelligent man could have misunderstood the "centrist" message he conveyed during the campaign and made a first priority of the sexual roles of military personnel; then the firing of the travel bureau of the White House in what appeared to be a failure of due process, and then getting a haircut in a plane on a runway while holding up traffic. 
 What I think the President has to realize is that he has to be himself, not a product of gimmicks or advisers. John F. Kennedy could cavort with the Hollywood set because we were then a successful nation in a different era. Today we have what I call a managed depression, and the President was voted in with the hope that he could do something to create jobs and a better economy -- setting the tone for hope.
Good lawyers, in negotiation or litigation, have a clear-cut goal in mind and prepare for their job. That's what a good politician has to do. There is a perception in this country that the President is a little bit of a phony with no real beliefs. If that perception does not change, President Clinton will disappoint me and lot of other people. I believe he can change, and I still have confidence in him, but he has credibility problems that only he can correct.
I was office manager for the New York Committee for Stevenson, Kefauver and Wagner in 1956, an aide to Adlai E. Stevenson and treasurer of Citizens for Eugene McCarthy in 1968.

HEADLINE: It's Not Too Late for Clinton to Get It Right;
Alternative Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With all due respect, you seem to miss the point of the alternative budget plan I introduced with Senators John C. Danforth of Missouri, William S. Cohen of Maine and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. "A Deal on the Economic Plan" (editorial, June 3) and other editorials level the charge that it was just oil state senators out to protect that industry. 
 That argument ignores that two of the authors are not even from oil states and that the British thermal unit tax had already been changed so that it would not hit oil producers. The tax, now abandoned, was to be collected not at the wellhead, not at the refinery, not even at the utility, but from consumers. Consumers in New York would have paid every bit as much in B.T.U. tax as consumers in Oklahoma. It would have cost jobs in all 50 states by making our products less competitive in world markets.
In offering an alternative budget plan, we wanted to provide a third option to the unacceptable choice between a budget plan that proposed to bring down the deficit primarily with tax increases and doing nothing at all. Ours would reduce the deficit with twice as many spending cuts as tax increases, without the anti-competitive B.T.U. tax and with controls on entitlement spending, which is 46 percent of the budget.
Our suggestion was the first major bipartisan budget proposal made since Bill Clinton became President. We wanted to send a signal to the country that some Democrats and Republicans want to set aside childish partisan bickering and work together in the national interest.
President Clinton deserves to be encouraged and congratulated for his decision to add the highly respected David Gergen to his staff and for signaling he is willing to change his budget plan by adding spending cuts and reducing tax increases. These are steps in the right direction.
We sought to give the President room to get back to the center of American politics. For the sake of the party, and above all for the sake of the country, that is where he needs to be.

HEADLINE: Reaganomics, With a Mexican Accent

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind is executive editor of The National Interest.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The growing opposition in Congress to the North American Free Trade Agreement may save the Administration from its own confusion.
The President has ignored the contradiction between his ambitious program for domestic revitalization and his support for a much freer flow of capital and labor between the United States and Mexico. The trade agreement and continuing high levels of immigration from Mexico can derail his vision of a high-investment, high-wage, high-tech America. 
 Mr. Clinton was elected because cheap-labor economics failed to improve life for most Americans. Under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, real wages, in constant dollars, stagnated or sank for most workers, benefits were slashed and job security declined. For most of the 1980's, the minimum wage was held constant despite inflation, creating a disguised pay cut for the poorest workers.
The expatriation of U.S. industry replaced many high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage service jobs. The results were predictable: higher profits for corporations and investors, and a decline in real pre-tax income for all but the wealthiest Americans. Levels of private-sector investment in productivity-enhancing new capital equipment fell far below Japanese and German rates -- and below U.S. rates of the past 30 years.
Most of those who voted for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot repudiated this cheap-labor policy. Its ghost lives on, however, as the spirit of the free-trade agreement.
Naftanomics is Reaganomics with a Mexican accent. Though proponents argue otherwise, it is almost certain that Nafta, if ratified, will tend to depress U.S. wage, benefit and consumer-safety levels toward those of Mexico. Many well-paid U.S. breadwinners in the Rust Belt and Sun Belt will lose their jobs to poorly paid Mexicans in shantytowns. Nor will most displaced U.S. workers move from sunset to sunrise industries. If the 1980's are a precedent, they will go to work in low-paying service jobs at a fraction of their former salaries.
If Nafta is bad news for many workers, it is even worse news for the Administration. Making it easier for U.S. multinationals to relocate and take advantage of cheap Mexican labor without benefits will undermine Mr. Clinton's expensive effort to extend health care benefits to all citizens: Companies with factories in the U.S. could claim that paying more for employees' health care would make them uncompetitive with rivals that have Mexican operations.
Similarly, public investment in upgrading the U.S. infrastructure will hardly persuade U.S. corporations to invest in domestic operations as long as they can make windfall profits by exploiting Mexico's labor costs.
Even if Nafta did not threaten Mr. Clinton's reform agenda, the continuing mass immigration of mostly unskilled Mexican workers would. Few economists deny that the flood of poorly educated Latin Americans in the last three decades has depressed wages for less-skilled U.S. workers.
Unskilled immigrants from Mexico compete with poor blacks and whites in such cities as Los Angeles and Houston for entry-level jobs. Compared to U.S. citizens, they are also disproportionately likely to go on welfare or end up in jail, at taxpayer expense. Voters who fear that their tax dollars are going to indigent or violent immigrants are more likely to resist the tax increases without which Mr. Clinton's program cannot work.
For Mr. Clinton to try to raise middle-class incomes and taxes while Mexican and other third world immigrants are depressing wages and raising the costs of law enforcement, education and welfare would be like bailing water from a leaking canoe.
Mr. Clinton promised to put the material interests of workers and taxpayers above those of foreign economic rivals and the affluent few in the U.S. That means rejecting Naftanomics and restricting unskilled immigration. If he does not recognize this, he may say hasta la vista not only to his domestic program but to the White House as well.

HEADLINE: Israel Looks Like the Winner

BYLINE: By Shibley Telhami; Shibley Telhami, associate professor of government at Cornell, is author of "Power and Leadership in International Bargaining: The Path to the Camp David Accords."

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Although Middle East peace talks are scheduled to resume on Monday, the Arab-Israeli conflict is really over. Victory is Israel's to clinch -- or squander. And America is in a position to tip the balance one way or the other.
For decades, the Arabs oscillated between finding an ally other than the U.S. and working to erode U.S. support for Israel by replacing it as a strategic ally. Egypt recognized the futility of the first strategy in the early 1970's. The rest of the Arab world reached that conclusion at the end of the cold war. 
 After the Camp David accords were signed in 1978, America's Arab allies believed that offering themselves as a strategic alternative to Israel could weaken the U.S.-Israeli relationship and give them an edge in the confrontation with Israel.
Since the gulf war, a remarkable transformation has taken place. The Arab governments have finally and genuinely accepted that U.S.-Israeli relations are beyond their reach. Some have even come to believe that the quickest route to Washington goes through Israel. And today, the rich Arab countries are wooing Washington for security needs, the poor ones for economic needs.
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia chose an important religious occasion to call for peace with Israel. Most Arab countries have dropped the boycott of companies that do business with Israel and some have entered into joint ventures with Israeli companies. The Libyan Government, usually the most hostile to Israel, recently authorized a pilgrimage by private citizens to Jerusalem, apparently as a way of improving relations with the U.S. Morocco and Tunisia have accepted Israel's suggestion to hold Middle East talks on their soil. Many Arabs, officials and academics, seeking access in Washington find it expedient to go through the very Israeli lobby they once sought to undermine.
Arab leaders are clearly preparing their publics for a deal with Israel. More importantly, some view their potential relations with Israel as strategically beneficial. For the Arab-Israeli conflict, 1993 could turn out to be what 1989 was for the cold war.
To clinch a deal, Israeli leaders have to be wary of outsmarting themselves. Israel holds considerable leverage, while the Arabs, especially the Palestinians, have precious little. Even if Israel can get Arabs to accept most of its conditions, it cannot ignore Palestinian and Arab domestic politics. An agreement that does not secure the bare minimum requirements for each side will not endure.
The primary obstacle to peace lies in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Even in the difficult Syrian-Israeli negotiations, the issue of linking a Syrian-Israeli treaty to a Palestinian-Israeli treaty is a key obstacle. Although the Palestinians have agreed to a transitional period of autonomy before a settlement can be reached, wide disagreements with Israel remain on the scope of autonomy.
Given its leverage, Israel feels it need not offer much. Israel can prevail. But unless an autonomy agreement makes possible the creation of independent Palestinian institutions that could ultimately sustain self-determination (a powerful legislature, for example), the Palestinians will have few incentives to cooperate. And unless diaspora Palestinians envision the possibility of settling on the West Bank and in Gaza in the future, replacing the dream of returning to Israel, they will work to defeat an agreement.
One problem for the Israeli Government is the difficulty of domestic political compromise unless there are short-term incentives or threats. This is where the U.S. comes in. To help the Israeli Government negotiate with its own public, the U.S. has to take the lead in inducing necessary concessions -- something that has been missing so far.
It's easy for a mediator to get concessions from the weak. It is not always wise. An Arab-Israeli agreement would be a boon to the Administration -- but not an agreement that would blow up in its face.
Even if negotiations failed, Israel would still have a strategic edge. Failure would possibly be more painful for the Arabs than for Israel. But in the end, all would lose. While a favorable deal is within Israel's reach, who knows what tomorrow will bring?

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SAYS IT WON'T PULL OUT OF ARMS PACT NOW

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 11

 BODY:
Averting a major confrontation with the West, North Korea said today that it would not withdraw for now from the international treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons.
The announcement came just hours before the North Korean pullout was to take effect on Saturday. 
 In a surprise announcement after intensive negotiations with the United States, the North Korea Government said that it would "suspend" its treaty withdrawal, for the time being at least, and continue to allow international monitoring of some of its nuclear sites.
 
Short of U.S. Demand
 But North Korea gave no indication that it was ready to let inspectors into the most sensitive installations, where the West believes North Korea is producing material for nuclear weapons.
The Central Intelligence Agency has said that North Korea may have produced enough plutonium to make at least one nuclear weapon. The prospect of a nuclear-armed North Korea is widely regarded as one of the most serious threats to stability in the region and the world.
The North Korean agreement to honor the treaty for a bit longer fell short of the complete acceptance demanded by the United States. American diplomats said the agreement was the best they could obtain, but warned that more pressure would be necessary before North Korea opens sensitive sites to international inspectors.
There was no indication that Washington had made any significant concessions to persuade North Korea to take its step today.
 
No Mention of Pledges
 Before the talks, United States negotiators had made it clear that Washington would reward a total North Korean reversal by canceling joint military exercises with South Korea and by giving assurances that it would not reintroduce nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula.
But because North Korea's action fell short of what was wanted, there was no reference today to such pledges.
Some experts say that the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea is so great that military force might be justified to stop its nuclear program. But South Korea, Japan and many United States officials fear that a military attack would be dangerous and counterproductive, and they have sought to rely on pressure and negotiations.
In an unusual joint statement this evening, the first ever issued by the United States and North Korea, the countries said North Korea would "suspend as long as it considers necessary" its withdrawal from the nuclear accord.
The head of the United States delegation, Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, called the move "a step in the right direction" and said the United States had decided to accept something less than what it wanted because the alternative would have been "extremely unfortunate."
 
Discussions to Continue
 The joint declaration also emphasized the determination of both countries to continue their discussions and expressed support for international scrutiny intended to insure that nuclear material is not being used to develop nuclear weapons.
The drama began early this year when the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which had sent inspectors into North Korea, pressed for more extensive inspections of North Korean installations.
Then on March 12 North Korea announced abruptly that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which pledges signers to refrain from making nuclear weapons and to allow inspections.
Under the treaty, withdrawal announcements are supposed to take effect 90 days after they are made, or on Saturday, in North Korea's case. Throughout the 90 days, fears rose that North Korea was determined to proceed with a nuclear weapons program.
The announcement hours before the final deadline followed a warning by the United States that it would be "looking urgently at next steps" if North Korea went ahead with its effort to become the first country ever to pull out of the 23-year-old accord. As a sign of good faith, Washington issued general assurances of its commitment to North Korean security.
By agreeing for now to remain in the nuclear accord, North Korea has eased the United States' most immediate concern.
 
U.S. Wants New Talks>
 By refusing to actually retract its decision to withdraw, however, North Korea retains the right to take that step at any time. American diplomats said they intended to seek a new round of talks to persuade North Korea to complete its change of course, but expressed relief that the deadline would pass without the standoff turning into a rupture.
The nuclear treaty is the main international obstacle to the emergence of new nuclear powers, and American officials had feared that North Korea's withdrawal would set a dangerous precedent.
In separate appearances in the courtyard of the United States Mission to the United Nations, the two sides left no doubt that they remained divided over whether the International Atomic Energy Agency could demand the right to inspect any instalation it chose.
Kang Sok Ju, North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister, bluntly characterized the International Atomic Energy Agency as pro-Western, and said his Government's agreement to future inspections "totally depends" on whether the agency acted impartially.
North Korea is believed to be hiding evidence of its nuclear weapons program in a plant at Yongbyon, and it was its refusal to permit the agency to search the site that kindled a dispute that led to its March announcement to withdraw from the pact.
The United States initially threatened to seek United Nations Security Council authorization for economic sanctions against North Korea. But China made clear that it would veto such a measure, and at its urging Washington agreed to the direct talks with North Korea.
 
No Other U.S. Options
 That the United States agreed to accept the mere suspension by North Korea of its pullout appeared to reflect its lack of credible options. Without Chinese support, Administration officials acknowledged, it would be all but impossible to win Security Council approval for any punishment of North Korea.
The agreement today brought the first easing in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang since North Korea announced its plan to withdraw from the pact. Although their representatives did not appear together in public, the two countries were represented by flags behind an outdoor podium, and Mr. Kang described their joint statement as "really a turning point in our bilateral relations."
For his part, Mr. Gallucci appeared less pleased that the two sides had not reached a complete accord. But American officials said the intensity of North Korea's mistrust of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its insistence on maintaining a right to withdraw from the nuclear treaty made it impossible to obtain a total reversal.

HEADLINE: NIGERIA SAYS VOTE WILL STILL BE HELD

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, June 11

 BODY:
Nigeria's military authorities announced today that the first presidential elections in nearly a decade would go ahead as planned on Saturday, despite a ruling from the nation's highest court that the voting be postponed.
The authorities said the high court in Abuja, the capital, had no right to preside over the conduct of the elections. The vote will be held as scheduled, they said, despite allegations that the election may have already been marred by fraud and vote-buying. 
 Nonetheless, the decision late Thursday night by Justice Bassey Ikpeme has suddenly altered the political landscape. Uncertainty reigned today as the excitement that normally precedes elections appeared to evaporate.
 
American Official Expelled
 Nigeria's state radio also announced tonight that the Government was expelling Michael O'Brien, the director of the United States Information Agency here, for what it called his "blatant interference" in Nigeria's internal affairs. According to the Government, Mr. O'Brien issued a statement early today saying that the postponement of the elections Saturday "was unacceptable to the United States Government."
Mr. O'Brien was given 72 hours to leave the country.
The Government also announced that it was withdrawing the accreditation for eight Americans who are here as election observers.
The two-party presidential poll is being contested by Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party and Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. Both are widely regarded as close friends and allies of Nigeria's military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, and the victor is not expected to stray far from the political and economic course chartered by the current administration.
An opinion poll of about 2,500 likely voters published today in The Nigerian Tribune, an independent newspaper, put Mr. Abiola ahead, with 47.3 percent of the vote, as opposed to 28.3 percent for Mr. Tofa. However, 24.4 percent of those polled did not indicate how they would vote.
In granting a temporary injunction halting the elections, Justice Ikpeme said the National Electoral Commission should not proceed until it heard allegations brought by the Association for a Better Nigeria, a group that supports an extension of military rule.
The association has led a highly visible campaign to keep General Babangida in power for at least four more years, or until -- in their words -- civilian politicians show themselves capable of establishing democracy.
General Babangida has said repeatedly that, come what may, the military will return to its barracks on Aug. 27 and leave the governing to elected civilians. But critics note that he has done nothing to discourage those who have called for him to remain in office.

HEADLINE: Economic Trouble and Nuclear Dispute Deepen Ukraine's Sense of Insecurity

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, June 9

 BODY:
After 18 months of independence, Ukraine is bogged down in uncertainty about its nuclear status and is caught in a severe economic downturn as strikes spread across its industrial and coal-mining regions.
And with the political leadership in disarray, these troubles have only increased Ukraine's innate feelings of insecurity, which lie at the root of the Parliament's continuing reluctance to approve the strategic arms agreement, known as Start I, that was worked out in 1991 by the Soviet Union and the United States. 
 The troubles are also delaying the steps necessary to declare this country of 55 million people a non-nuclear state, which its leadership promised a year ago.
With the country already talking of building up an armed force of a half million, this flirtation with nuclear weapons has become a concern for Ukraine's neighbors, most prominently Russia and Poland, and for Western nations alarmed at the uncertainties this might produce in Europe.
 
Aspin and Kohl Visit
 This has produced some unusual major diplomacy for this new nation. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, both have been here in recent days to show their support for Ukraine's independence. They also sought to reassure Ukraine, which until now has felt that its concerns -- particularly about Russia -- have gone unheard in the international arena. This was evidently done in the hope that it would make it easier for Ukrainian politicians to end their coyness with nuclear weapons.
But Ukrainian opponents of swift approval of the arms control agreements said they still want more -- more financial help from the West to cover the cost of dismantling the 176 intercontinental missiles, and above all, a commitment from Russia that Ukraine will be compensated for relinquishing weapons that have proved to have economic as well as political value.
In the last three weeks, Ukraine's internal debate over the nuclear issue has been complicated by a three-way tug-of-war between the President, the Parliament and the Government over not only who should lead Ukraine but also how and where.
Three times now, Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma has submitted his resignation to Parliament, only to be turned down each time. At one point, President Leonid Kravchuk, the former Communist Party ideology chief who led the country to independence 18 months ago, proposed to take over the Government himself, but that proposal too was rejected by Parliament.
The political crisis may be resolved when Parliament reconvenes next week, but in the meantime, the reputation of Ukraine's leadership -- the President, the Parliament and the Government -- has been badly bruised, just as popular discontent over a crumbling economy begins to heat up.
This week, a wave of strikes swept through the Donbas coal region, which straddles Russia and Ukraine and was the largest coal-producing area in the former Soviet Union.
The strike has spread to the Kharkov region in eastern Ukraine, a bastion of heavy industry, as an estimated half million workers, many of them ethnic Russians, shut down mines and factories in protest against a new surge in prices.
In a repetition of a miners' strikes during the final years of the Soviet era, the Donbas strike leaders have issued political as well as economic demands, calling for Mr. Kravchuk's resignation, new parliamentary elections and greater independence for the Donbas.
[Appearing on national television on June 10, President Kravchuk called on workers to refrain from strikes, and pledged to come up with a package of measures "to lessen the pressure of prices," the Tass news agency reported.
[Mr. Kravchuk also declared that the "resignation of the Government and the Prime Minister is out of the question, and this question will never be raised."]
 
Inflation Is Soaring
 By any indication, the Ukrainian economy is in bad shape and getting worse. Production has been falling steadily, while the money supply increased fortyfold in 1992 alone. In the first three months of this year, prices rose fourfold, more than three times the rate of Russian inflation, and that was before a recent jump in fuel prices. In the meantime, the value of the interim national currency, the karbovantsy, has plummeted from 1,232 to the dollar in March, to more than 3,000 at the end of May.
"It would not be an exaggeration to call the situation catastrophic," said Volodymyr Cherniak, an economist from the Institute of the Economy. "Those who call it a crisis are dangerous optimists."
This view is shared by ordinary Ukrainians whose despair is now approaching panic as they try to make ends meet. With salaries averaging between 23,000 and 26,000 karbovantsy, the latest price rises have been a severe blow. A loaf of bread, which last week cost 40 karbovantsy, now costs 180, while quality meat at the farmers' market now goes for 12,000 a kilogram (2.2 pounds), compared with 5,000 a short while ago.
All this has added a new and desperate edge to even ordinary transactions. "The only people making money now are speculating on prices, or on the currency," said Mr. Cherniak.
A taxi driver who asked $5, about 16,000 karbovantsy, for a short ride in downtown Kiev, first blamed the high cost of gasoline (3,000 for a liter), and then justified himself this way: "If the Government behaves like bandits, then to survive, we have to do the same."
Mr. Kuchma, the former director of a missile factory who became Prime Minister six months ago, gets some credit for trying to stabilize the economy. But according to diplomats here, he has been undercut by Parliament, which has balked at taking even the first steps toward large-scale privatization, and continues to push the inflationary spiral upward by raising salaries, pensions and state subsidies.
Last month Mr. Kuchma appealed to Parliament to extend his powers to carry out economic changes and in particular give him control of the Central Bank and the state privatization fund. But Parliament refused his requests, thus prompting his first offer to resign.
"The crucial issue is where the economic leadership of Ukraine lies," a Western diplomat said. And the growing sense, even fear, here is that the answer will continue to be, as it has been, a muddle in which the only winners are the barons of the old Communist system who here, even more than in Russia, still dominate the political and economic leadership and who use their considerable power to protect their own interests, both personal and corporate.
"The absence of political reform has put a brake on economic reform in Ukraine," said Mr. Cherniak, who blames both the Government and Parliament for failing to set a consistent, unified economic policy, and following through on it.
 
New Demands on Bank
 This month, pressure is again building in Parliament for another round of credit flows from the Central Bank, in sums rumored to top 3 trillion karbovantsy, which would blow apart the meager attempts made so far to bring Ukraine's money supply back under control.
Although the final outcome of the political crisis is unknown, most diplomats agree that Mr. Kravchuk's standing has suffered the most. One telling indication was a recent poll, in which 56 percent of the respondents said they did not care whether the President took control of the Government.
Mr. Kravchuk, in meetings this week first with Mr. Aspin and later with Mr. Kohl, who was on his first official visit to independent Ukraine, has tried to put the best face on his position. He even reassured Mr. Aspin that a vote on ratification of the 1991 arms treaty was possible before Parliament adjourns in mid-July, a prediction that several Western diplomats here dismissed as highly unlikely under the current political circumstances.
Mr. Kravchuk has come under increasing attack from nationalists in Parliament -- who this week went into official opposition against the Government -- for his foreign policy generally, but in particular for his handling of relations with Russia, which many Ukrainians distrust. The issue of the Black Sea Fleet, which was put under joint Ukrainian-Russian command last year, erupted again last month, after dozens of supply ships raised the St. Andrew's flag, emblem of the Russian Navy.
"It was a political provocation by Russia, and our President did nothing about it," said Ihor Derkach, a 29-year-old member of Parliament from western Ukraine who belongs to a nationalist fraction.
 
Negotiations Stall
 Negotiations over the division of the Black Sea Fleet have stalled, and a planned meeting this month between Mr. Kravchuk and President Boris N. Yeltsin appears to have been postponed. Mr. Kuchma recently suggested that Ukraine would be ready to lease some of the fleet's land installations, the latest obstacle in the negotiations, but diplomats here say the crucial question, still unresolved, is how much and for how long.
For Ukraine, the arguments over the future of the Black Sea Fleet are just a warm-up for the issue of the Crimea itself, a peninsula that became part of the Soviet Ukrainian Republic in 1954, but that in the minds of many Russians, including top officials, is still bound to Russia culturally and historically. From this painful issue flows doubts, shared by many Ukrainians, about whether Moscow has truly reconciled itself to the idea of an independent Ukraine.
This uncertainty, backed up by a legacy of centuries of Russian rule, is considered to be the key to the Ukrainian Parliament's doubts about the wisdom of handing over to Russia strategic nuclear weapons that it inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Ukraine is now the only one of the four former former Soviet republics holding nuclear weapons that is yet to ratify the 1991 treaty, which called for a substantial reduction of weapons by both the Soviet Union and the United States. Ukraine became a party to the treaty in July 1992, when Mr. Kravchuk joined the heads of the other former Soviet republics in signing the Lisbon protocols. In Lisbon, Ukraine also committed itself to signing the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons "in the shortest possible time."
 
Anxieties in West
 But since then, Ukraine has persistently delayed a vote on both treaties, causing new anxieties in the West. While important members of the Government have remained firmly committed to Ukraine's earlier pledges, Mr. Kuchma, in a recent closed session of Parliament in which he spoke as a deputy rather than Prime Minister, said he would support a policy by which Ukraine remained an interim nuclear power. Other deputies in Parliament have been pressing for greater security commitments from the West, as well as more compensation.
A key issue in the debate, often overlooked in the West, is Ukraine's insistence on its ownership of the missiles -- a position that has not been recognized by Russia. At stake, besides national pride, is the distribution of profits made from Russia's planned sale of the reusable nuclear materials extracted from nuclear warheads.
"We say that these missiles are the property of Ukraine, and without a resolution of this issue, nothing can move forward," said Mr. Derkach, one of a number of members of Parliament who want Ukraine to remain a nuclear nation temporarily, until the dismantled missiles are removed from its territory.
A recent proposal, advanced by Mr. Aspin, for an international commission that would keep the dismantled weapons under its control, pending their elimination, might successfully "muddle" the ownership issue, as a Western diplomat here put it, although the Ukrainian side has not yet had time either to review or endorse the position.

HEADLINE: Energy Tax Quest: Levy That Draws Least Outcry

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
As it seeks to find a replacement for the Administration's B.T.U. tax, the Senate is struggling to choose the least ugly of several alternatives.
It has quickly discovered that every option has somebody ready to loathe it. 
 Westerners who drive a lot hate the idea of a gasoline tax.
Truck drivers and struggling airlines have dragged out the heavy artillery to shoot down the leading proposal, a broad transportation tax on gasoline, diesel fuel and airline fuel.
Environmentalists dread another idea -- a sales tax on energy -- because coal, which is dirty, is also cheap. They want a tax that penalizes coal rather than favors it. Besides, senators from the Northeast dislike an energy sales tax because it would hit their region disproportionately since its electricity and energy prices are among the highest in the nation.
 
Looking For Right Tax
 As so often happens in Congress, the selection process appears to be boiling down to the tax that has the fewest, weakest, least vocal opponents.
But this time there are two other factors complicating the muddle, with environmentalists looking for the tax that will help the environment most, and economists looking for the tax that will hurt the economy least.
On that last point, there seems to be wide agreement.
After cutting through all the lobbyists' talk about how such-and-such energy tax will send such-and-such industry back to the Jurassic Age, economists say that a gasoline tax or transportation tax would do less overall damage to the economy than the B.T.U. tax that the Administration trumpeted, and then withdrew.
The reason is that while the B.T.U. tax and the gasoline tax would each hurt consumers by raising the price of gasoline, the B.T.U. tax would hurt many industries -- and would hurt them in international competition. The B.T.U. tax would be levied on nonrenewable energy sources and be based on the heat content of different fuels as measured in British thermal units.
"A straight gasoline tax has a much smaller impact on the nation's manufacturing sector," said Philip Verleger, an energy economist at the Institute for International Economics. "But with a B.T.U. tax, there would be substantial job losses in the energy-intensive sector."
Environmentalists, on the other hand, are unhappy that the B.T.U. tax has been set aside. They like it because it would help shift consumption away from dirty fuels and toward cleaner ones, like natural gas.
"If you compare the environmental benefits per dollar, a gasoline tax is just half as effective as a B.T.U. tax," said Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The B.T.U. tax creates an incentive to switch from coal to natural gas."
The energy tax that environmentalists really love -- a carbon tax, based on the amount of carbon dioxide produced by burning each unit of fuel -- is not even being considered by the Senate. The reason: it would hit coal country hardest, and Robert C. Byrd, the powerful Democratic Senator from West Virginia, would not want that.
The Administration's B.T.U. tax died of 1,000 pinpricks after the National Association of Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, American Chamber of Commerce and dozens of other lobbying groups organized to kill it. Because there was so much unhappiness that the tax would hurt manufacturers, several senators concluded that an energy tax that fell mostly on consumers would have a better chance of passage.
Thus, Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, is pushing a transportation tax on airline fuel, diesel fuel and gasoline. Under one version, it would raise the price of gasoline by 7.6 cents a gallon, about the same amount as the Administration's B.T.U. tax. When fully phased in, the B.T.U. tax would raise more than $20 billion a year, while Mr. Breaux's transportation tax would raise less than half that.
Speaking about a 7.6 cent tax on gasoline, William Durbin, associate director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said: "A tax that size will only have a marginal impact on the economy. We often see fluctuations of eight-nine cents in the price of gasoline. An increase of eight or nine cents means nothing. In some European countries, the gasoline tax is over $4 a gallon."
 
Opposing Gasoline Tax
 Nonetheless, Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, opposes a gasoline tax, saying it would unfairly penalize Montanans who have to drive long distances. According to Resources for the Future, an environmental group, Mr. Breaux's gasoline tax would cost households in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain states about $100 a year, while costing Middle Atlantic households $75 a year.
"There are a lot of suburbanites on the East Coast who drive long distance to work, and they would probably face the same burden as people in Western states," Mr. Durbin said.
The Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee met for several hours today as senators took potshots at competing energy plans. They broke for the weekend still divided over what shape the energy tax should take and where spending cuts could be found. The chairman, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, said he expected a consensus could be reached when the Democratic senators reconvene on Tuesday.
For the committee to approve a bill, the Democrats must stick together. They have a majority of only 11 to 9, and all the Republicans have vowed to vote against the legislation.
Some form of tax on transportation fuels and spending cuts in Medicare still seem likely to be approved. Senators John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan said they could not support cuts in Medicare much deeper than the $50 billion over five years that the Clinton Administration has proposed.
One advantage of Mr. Breaux's proposed tax over a B.T.U. tax is that it would be far cheaper to administer. All it would take would be to increase existing fuel taxes, while administrating the B.T.U. tax would require a huge new apparatus, which some economists say could cost $10 billion a year.
Convinced that a gasoline tax would be unfair to rural states, the Administration ruled out such a tax early. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen favored a sales tax, which would be inexpensive to administer. But Vice President Al Gore persuaded the Administration to put forward the B.T.U. tax because it would be better for the environment.
Some economists favor combining a gasoline tax, which favors the densely populated East, where mass transit is more common, with a straight sales tax on energy, which would favor the West, where energy prices are cheaper. The Northwest would benefit disproportionately from a straight sales tax because hydroelectricty gives the region low-cost power.

The Economy
Producer price inflation was flat in May and retail sales posted a weaker-than-expected rise. The data indicated continued slow economic growth and provided evidence that inflation jumps in April did not represent a worrisome price surge that could cause the Fed to raise interest rates. [Page 35.]
Cable television customers will have to wait a few more months for Government-imposed price reductions because the F.C.C. is short of money to handle an expected avalanche of paperwork caused by complicated new regulations. [35.]
Replacing the Administration's now-abandoned B.T.U. tax is boiling down to a process of finding a tax that has the fewest, weakest and least vocal opponents. [10.]
 
 Companies
The New York Times's purchase of The Boston Globe combines the interests of two newspaper families -- the Sulzbergers and the Taylors -- and continues a broad industry shift in which papers like The Globe, free-standing for 121 years, become subsidiaries of big media companies from somewhere else. [35.]
The Times took its biggest step yet in a 20-year effort to move beyond dependence on metropolitan New York and its flagship newspaper. [47.] Some Bostonians expressed the feeling that a big-city rival had muscled into their town. [47.]
The future of Colt's Manufacturing, the venerable gun maker, was clouded when the Connecticut Legislature banned sales of its best-selling rifle -- blaming it and other military-style semiautomatic weapons for a rise in drug-related urban violence. [1.]
Northwest's two largest unions scuttled a proposed agreement to exchange a stake in the airline for wage and benefit cuts. [37.]
Choice Hotels bought 163 European hotels for an undisclosed sum from Inovest, one of France's largest budget hotels. [37.]
General Motors said it would close or sell some parts-making units unless it gains concessions on wages. [37.]
Merck agreed to sell its Calgon Water Management business to English China Clays for $307.5 million in cash. [37.]
R. H. Macy's sales and cash flow rose in its fiscal third quarter, further evidence of its slowly reversing fortunes. [37.]
 
International
American and Japanese officials began discussions on a new framework for bilateral economic relations. But, as expected, they did not reach an agreement. [35.]
 
Markets
Bond prices jumped and interest rates fell on indications that inflation eased in May. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.80 percent, its lowest in more than a month. [35.]
Stocks advanced modestly, helped by a sense of relief that inflation had eased. The Dow industrials gained 13.29 points. [36.]
The dollar held its ground despite signs of eased American inflation, which hurt chances for higher interest rates. [46.]
Oil and gold prices declined as a key index of commodity prices dropped to its lowest level in more than three months. [46.]
 
Your Money
The explosive growth of initial public stock offerings has drawn many investors, some of whom have been disappointed. [33.]
Low- and no-load mutual funds are trying to attract larger investors with pampering more common at financial planners. [33.]
New tax breaks for people who buy cars that run on alternative energy sources are especially generous for electric cars. [34.]
Student loans will be cheaper, beginning with the 1994-95 academic year, under a bill approved by a Senate committee. [34.]

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 13.29, But Is Off 40.13 in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Helped by a sense of relief that inflation had eased, stocks advanced modestly yesterday, but gains were restrained.
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 13.29 points, closing at 3,505.01. For the week, however, the Dow lost 40.13 points. 
 The Government's report that producer price inflation was level in May produced a burst of early buying, which took the Dow up as much as 23.25 points. But investors later shifted their focus to other economic issues and lower corporate earnings, which analysts said held the market back from making any significant gains.
"The market focus is now on secondary growth stocks. And cyclical issues, which have outperformed the market in the first half of the year, are fading as they have the last three years," said Edward P. Nicoski, managing director for technical research at Piper Jaffray Inc.
 
Other Indexes Up
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 256.8 million shares, up from 232.6 million on Thursday, with gaining issues outpacing losers by a ratio of 5 to 4. The Big Board composite index was up 0.71 point, to 246.24, while the Standard & Poor's Index of 500 stocks gained 1.88 points, to 447.26.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 5.14 points, to 693.19, while the American Stock Exchange composite declined by 1.48 points, to 434.32.
Traders said the fact that May producer price inflation was below expectations indicated that the jump of six-tenths of a percent in April was a fluke. They also pointed to May retail sales data released yesterday showing a gain of one-tenth of a percent, well below forecasts of an increase of as much as seven-tenths of a percent.
Taken together, the traders said, the two reports of continued slow economic growth suggested that the Federal Reserve was now no longer under pressure to raise short-term interest rates, which helped both stocks and bonds yesterday.
Investor attention now shifts to a second monthly inflation number, the May Consumer Price Index, which is due on Tuesday.
 
Bank Stocks Gain
 Bank stocks were among the issues that benefited from the low producer prices and the calming effect on fears of higher interest rates. J. P. Morgan was up 5/8, to 65 3/8; BankAmerica up 1 1/2, to 43 7/8; Citicorp up 3/8, to 27 1/2, and Federal National Mortgage Association, up 1 3/4, to 79.
Technology stocks, battered during the week, also saw some rebound as investors sought bargains. Intel was up 1 7/8, to 56 1/2, and Hewlett-Packard gained 1 1/2, to 86 1/4.
The New York Times Company fell 2 1/2, to 24 3/8, after announcing on Thursday that it was acquiring Affiliated Publications, the parent company of The Boston Globe, for $1.1 billion. Affiliated gained 3/8, to 13 5/8.
Merck rose 1, to 38 5/8, after announcing an agreement to sell its Calgon Water Management business for $307.5 million in cash.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 7.63 points, or just 0.04 percent, to close the week at 20,500.95.

HEADLINE: Bonds Rally on Good News on Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
There was a sigh of relief from bond traders and investors yesterday after the Government's report that the Producer Price Index was unchanged in May.
After last week's report of a surprisingly strong jump in employment in May and with consumer prices rising so far this year at a 4.3 percent annual rate, another large jump in this key inflation indicator would have sent Treasury prices reeling and yields higher. 
 Traders and investors would have sold on fears that rising inflation would erode their fixed-income investments. And signs of sharply rising prices would probably have forced the Federal Reserve to move quickly to raise short-term interest rates to control inflation.
But that is not what happened. Instead, prices jumped sharply immediately after the report at 8:30 A.M. and then continued inching higher all day.
The credit market rally was aided immediately by the report that retail sales in May were much weaker than expected, rising only one-tenth of a percent, rather than closer to a full 1 percent. If the economy is weak, there is less chance there will be upward pressure on prices, so the two reports were quite positive for a worried market.
The price of the 30-year bond, which can be heavily influenced by inflation concerns, was up 27/32 as the yield dropped to 6.80 percent, its lowest level in more than a month, from 6.87 percent on Thursday.
The impact of the good inflation news was even stronger on shorter-term Treasury securities, where yields dropped by as much as 16 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
This was a response to the relief that the Federal Reserve would not be expected, based on May's Producer Price Index, to raise short-term interest rates immediately.
The price of the two-year Treasury note rose 9/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.12 percent, down from 4.28 percent Thursday. The price of the three-year note was up 12/32 and the yield was down to 4.49 percent from 4.63 percent the day before.
The discount rates on Treasury bills also fell sharply as the expectation of a Fed tightening of interest rates faded for the time being. The rate on the six-month bill was 3.17 percent, down seven basis points.
The market's apprehension will not be fully over until the Consumer Price Index report on Tuesday. While forecasters expect it to increase only a moderate two-tenths of a percent, until that is confirmed this bout with inflation fears cannot be said to be over. A much higher increase would surely jolt the market.
"This certainly was welcome news today, " said James S. Fralick, principal senior economist at Morgan Stanley. "It should keep the Fed on hold for a month or two. And next month's C.P.I. could also be moderate.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that "the initial strength of the market's response was a bit surprising." He said that performance of the Producer Price Index in May was only slightly better than market expectations.
 
Revisions Are Noted
 In addition, he said that although the retail price data for May were weak, the upward revisions in the April data were very large and indicate that it is "adventurous" to depend on data that can be revised so sharply. For example, sales excluding automobiles were revised to a gain of 1.4 percent from the initially reported increase of seven-tenths of a percent.
Both Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Fralick said that the positive data, even if it is borne out in the consumer price report, does not mean that the threat of a Fed tightening is over. It just means that it is put off for now. They both expect that inflation will still be higher this year than last year's 2.9 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index and higher than the 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent Fed forecast for 1993.
While the rise in short-term interest rates in the last few weeks indicated that there was a fear that the Fed might act soon, analysts generally thought that the inflation data for May would not be as bad as those for the first four months of the year and, therefore, the Fed would not be forced to act so soon. The general expectation is that the Fed will have to move sometime this fall.
The rally yesterday was helped along in the afternoon by declines in other inflation barometers that traders watch closely. Gold, whose recent price rise had increased some investors fears of inflation, fell $3.50, to $367.50 an ounce.
The price of oil also dropped in the wake of OPEC's failure to get a firm agreement on limiting its production after Kuwait said it would not agree to the limits. The price of a barrel of oil fell 30 cents, to $18.98, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Common Traditions and Visions for 2 Big Papers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
The marriage of The New York Times and The Boston Globe began with a phone call last fall from Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, a descendant of a man who stabilized an ailing newspaper in New York, to William O. Taylor, a descendant of a man who kept one afloat in Boston.
In a way, both men said yesterday, it was their similarities and the similar traditions of the newspapers they have run for much of their adult lives that brought them -- and their companies -- together. 
 "We go back a long way," Mr. Sulzberger said, seated next to Mr. Taylor in a hotel suite in New York. "My father and Bill's father. My grandfather and Bill's grandfather."
 
 
The Talk of 2 Cities
 On the day after the announcement of the biggest American newspaper merger ever, there was talk among Sulzbergers and Taylors, on Wall Street, in newsrooms across the country, and on the streets of Boston and New York, about times changing. "It's been a hell of a run and it'll be a hell of a run," Mr. Taylor said.
But, of course, the point of the day was to declare that the "run" will be a different one from now on, with The Times's parent company becoming an even bigger public company. And The Globe, free-standing for 121 years, will become, like a lot of other newspapers, a subsidiary of a big company from somewhere else.
In all of the places where the $1.1 billion deal was being studied, questions were raised that went to the heart of the modern newspaper business: Will the industry's once-high profit margins return? Does conglomerate ownership of news-gathering businesses hurt the news? Is the newspaper business still the future?
Again and again, in meetings with securities analysts and in news conferences in Boston and New York, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sulzberger and their executives worked to convince the skeptics. Why, Times executives were asked again and again, would the company make such a huge investment in a newspaper market so much like New York or, for that matter, in a newspaper at all?
"It is a true diversification," the president of the Times Company, Lance R. Primis, answered. The economies of Boston and New York, he said, are different. As a strong regional newspaper, The Globe, which is much more dominant in Boston than The Times is in New York, is a different type of paper than any the company has owned before, he said.
And Mr. Primis said there were possibilities for joint distribution, advertising sales and new newspaper ventures like efforts to use the huge amounts of data they collect in new commercial ways.
For the moment, the stock market did not appear convinced. Class A shares of the Times Company fell $2.50 each to close at $24.375 on the American Stock Exchange. Declines in the stock prices of acquiring companies are common immediately after a merger is announced.
Shares of Affiliated Publications Inc., the parent of The Globe, rose 37.5 cents each, to $13.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Securities analysts who follow media companies were divided about the wisdom of the deal for Affiliated, with some declaring it a bargain for the Times Company and some saying the price is too high. In addition to The Globe, Affiliated owns a one-third interest in BPI Communications, a magazine publishing company; the other two-thirds is owned by BPI's managers and a venture capital firm.
In the middle ground on The Times Company's deal were analysts like John Morton of Lynch, Jones & Ryan, who said he thought Times Company shares declined because the company had paid a "fat" price. He said that according to his estimates, the Times' Company's merger with Affiliated would dilute The Times' earnings by 10 to 15 cents a share on an annual basis. Before the announcement of the merger, some analysts had predicted per share earnings for the Times Company of 85 to 90 cents a share.
Because the Times Company is expected to pay for Affiliated largely by issuing millions of new shares of stock, some dilution of the amount of earnings per share had been expected. But some analysts said the terms of the deal, as it was announced on Thursday, resulted in greater dilution of the expected earnings for each share than they had predicted.
 
 
One of a Kind
 But Mr. Morton said he thought the deal was basically a good one in financial terms, because The Globe's operation is well run and newspapers are still a good business. "Long range," Mr. Morton said, "there aren't newspapers like this for sale -- and won't be -- because newspapers like this are already owned."
Times Company executives said yesterday that were not troubled by the decline in the stock price, predicting that it would begin to climb once the full terms of the merger were understood by financial analysts. The point is important because a provision of the deal would permit Affiliated to back out if the Times Company stock dropped to $22, on average, for 10 trading days just before completion of the merger, which is expected around Oct. 1.
The Times Company can back out of the deal if the price of its stock rises to more than $35 a share in that same 10-day trading period.
There is also a "lockup" provision of the merger agreement, meant to discourage other suitors. Affiliated has two classes of stock. A vote of two-thirds of each class is required to approve the merger. As part of its negotiations, The Times obtained agreements from 58 percent of the holders of Affiliated's class B stock that they will vote for the merger.
Each of Affiliated's class A shares entitles the holder to one vote, and each B share entitles the holder to 10 votes.
Separately, the Times Company was also granted an option to buy Affiliated's class A stock, up to a total of 19.9 percent of the outstanding shares, if it is unable to complete the merger and there is another bidder. The exercise of the option would make it very expensive for a competing bidder to purchase The Globe.
 
 
Concern Over Concentration
 In most of the places where the deal was being discussed yesterday, such technicalities were beside the point, since the merger seemed all but complete.
There were those who worried, as there are with every acquisition of a giant media company, about the concentration of so much communications power under one corporate roof.
There were those who said the Times Company's promises of independence for The Globe were fine, but still expressed concern about the prospect of a New York company owning New England's most influential newspaper.
But perhaps the most common response yesterday was that the deal was just another sign of changes in the country's information businesses.
"Concentration of ownership of media companies is a fact of our times," said Reese Cleghorn, dean of the University of Maryland's College of Journalism. "It isn't particularly desirable. But it's inevitable."
Sitting next to each other yesterday, Mr. Sulzberger, 67, and Mr. Taylor, 60, seemed determined to serve as a bridge between the newspapers they inherited and the ones they will leave behind.
Mr. Sulzberger's son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., is now the publisher of The New York Times. On Monday, one of Mr. Taylor's sons will begin work at The Globe. One of Mr. Taylor's cousin's, Benjamin B. Taylor, 46, is the president of Affiliated.
Both of the older men confessed yesterday to a bit of feeling about their deal and the way it showed how big and corporate their business has become. "Nostalgia" was how Mr. Taylor, a man of few words, expressed it.
Mr. Sulzberger described his call back in November to ask Mr. Taylor whether he would consider a sale to The Times. "I called Bill up and said, 'Should we talk about whether there's some sweet music we can play together?' "
It was the way business used to be done.
 
And Then, the Details
 Both men said that matters got more complicated after that, as lawyers and financial advisers began to negotiate stock options, lockup agreements and the like.
"As it gets bigger, it gets more complicated," Mr. Sulzberger said, looking over at his chief financial officer, David L. Gorham. "And David makes me fill out all those forms that my grandfather would never have done. But it's still a family business -- we're not going to let that get away from us."
Turning to look at Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sulzberger added: "It's a family business. And this is going to be a new member of the family."

HEADLINE: Bronx Hears a Slur and Responds With Its Cheer

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
New Hampshire's State Parks and Recreation Director was only trying to explain why he wanted to scrap some old playground equipment. The reason he gave: The state parks were starting to look like the Bronx.
Apparently, he picked on the wrong borough. The Bronx, after all, known as "the borough of parks and universities," is a place that, statistically speaking, is 25 percent park. It has the city's largest park: Pelham Bay, which, at 2,764 acres, is bigger than three Central Parks. It also has Van Cortlandt Park, the city's third largest, which, at 1,164 acres, is roughly 1-60th the size of all the parks in New Hampshire. 
 New Hampshire has Wilbur LaPage, the State Parks and Recreation Director. On Wednesday, discussing plans to remove old jungle gyms and swing sets from state parks, he said he was taking aim at "that galvanized type of equipment you expect to find in some city park in the Bronx."
 
Sounds Like a Stereotype
 Several hundred miles away, in neighborhoods that have been home to everyone from Babe Ruth to Arturo Toscanini, it sounded as if he were taking aim at the Bronx. Some even said it sounded like an all-stops-out stereotype: violent, drug infested, burned out, graffiti splattered and abandoned.
"He's just a bureaucrat trying to wax dramatic," declared the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "If his intent was to compare his parks with Bronx parks, his suffer by comparison."
New York City's Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum, said she was furious.
"I question the manhood of someone who would stand up there in New Hampshire and take the name of the Bronx in vain," said Ms. Gotbaum, who has been involved in setting up a nonprofit fund-raising organization, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, to raise money for projects the park needs that the city cannot afford. "It's a cheap slight without him knowing what he's taking a swipe at."
Was he taking a swipe at the Bronx? Mr. LaPage's boss, the Commissioner of the Department of Resources and Economic Development, said no. (Mr. LaPage himself was said to be unreachable yesterday because he was attending an out-of-town dedication ceremony.)
"It wasn't intended to be derogatory," said the Commissioner, Stephen K. Rice. "The reason he used the Bronx was to draw a contrast between an urban park and a rural park setting. He could just as easily have used Boston and East Manchester, N.H."
But Arnold Getzner, a hot dog vendor in Portsmouth, N.H., said Mr. LaPage was on target in making a target of the Bronx. Mr. Getzner said he had been to New York and "wouldn't go in a park there if my life depended on it."
Neither would George Tyler, a supermarket produce manager in Newmarket, N.H. "If our guy LaPage says those places are no good," Mr. Tyler said, "he's probably right."
Wrong, countered Daly Jimenez, as her 7-year-old nephew whizzed down the sun-baked slide in Pelham Bay Park yesterday. "Our parks aren't bad," she said. "They're clean; the equipment's nice. The Bronx's image is bad, but it has beautiful parks."
This being New York, where unanimity is something of an abstract concept, not everyone sees it that way. Some Bronx residents say their parks are shaggier than they used to be, that there are more bald spots in the infields. Some even complain that when the city cuts the budget and lays off park workers, they don't start in Central Park in Manhattan.
Nora Nees, a baby sitter in Williamsbridge, said she had stopped taking the 14-month-old boy she looks after during the day to a local park known as Williamsbridge Oval.
"There's broken glass and dogs without leashes," she said. "From time to time you see the police, but that doesn't seem to make a lot of difference."
And there are a lot of wide open spaces in the big parks in the Bronx. You can find yourself alone in the middle of nowhere -- have the whole of a valley to yourself in the vastness of Van Cortlandt -- and remember that you're all alone out there, which adds a bit of anxiety to the pleasure.
"I've never been to New Hampshire, but I can't picture anything worse than the Bronx," said Stan Martucci Jr., behind the counter of Stan's Sports World, opposite Yankee Stadium. "I plan on moving out. Down south. New York's turning into a disaster area. Some kind of bad news breaking every day."
James R. Ryan, the Parks Department's Borough Commissioner for the Bronx, says his domain gets a bad rap. He offered to give Mr. LaPage a guided tour. After all, he said, 65 percent of the parks he oversees have been renovated in the last five to seven years.
"Anybody who would say this," he said, "does not know the Bronx. It's really a great place."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Co.'s Strategy: Dominate Northeast

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
With its $1.1 billion purchase of The Boston Globe, The New York Times Company is taking the biggest step in its 20-year effort to move beyond metropolitan New York and its flagship newspaper, further hedging its financial future.
The Globe purchase certainly advances that goal, analysts and consultants agree. But the question raised by the purchase, they say, is whether it is smart to make a huge bet on the Northeast, a region whose economic outlook is uncertain, and on the newspaper business, an industry often regarded as mature. 
 Times Company executives reply that the timing is right to take a big stake in the Boston market, which is starting to recover, and that a dominant regional newspaper like The Globe will remain a lucrative business for the foreseeable future.
 
 
'Buying a Market'
 "The truth is that we're buying a market," explained Lance R. Primis, the Times Company's president and chief operating officer. "We think that Boston is going to have a hell of a run again. And buying The Globe is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to be dominant both in Boston and in the Northeast generally."
Moreover, Mr. Primis noted, the Times Company has a tradition of investing against the grain of economic downturns in the New York economy. For example, the family-controlled company's diversification drive began in the 1970's, when the local economy was so weak that the New York City government narrowly avoided bankruptcy. Another motivation for moving outside New York was to make the company less susceptible to prolonged strikes by union workers.
Under the direction of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of the Times Company and former publisher of The New York Times, the company went ahead with investments in new properties during the 70's, even though business was soft.
"By acquiring The Globe," Mr. Primis said, "we're repeating that strategy in the 90's."
 
 
'Very Powerful Position'
 Most analysts say that purchasing the parent company of The Globe, Affiliated Publications Inc., should prove to be a solid move for the Times Company in the long term. "It gives The Times control of much of the Northeast market, and that's a very powerful position to be in," said Craig Cline, a vice president at Seybold Inc., a consultant in Malibu, Calif.
But analysts point out that the payoff for Times Company shareholders will not be for a while. Because the acquisition is being paid for mainly by issuing millions of new Times Company shares, the per-share earnings of the combined company will be less than analysts had expected for the Times Company alone for the next couple of years. A company's share price is largely determined by the level of expected profits.
Consequently, the price of Times Company class A stock fell sharply yesterday, down $2.50 a share, to $24.375.
Kevin Gruneich, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation, estimated that earnings for the combined company would reach about $96 million this year, and rise perhaps 25 percent, to $120 million, in 1994. "But in the short term, I expect more pressure on The Times's share price," Mr. Gruneich said. "If you're in this, it's for the long term."
 
 
Patient Pursuit
 For the most part, the Times Company's diversification effort has been a patient pursuit, but one that has proved effective. At the start of the 1970's, The New York Times was virtually the company's only business. But that changed gradually in the 70's and the pace picked up during the heady years of the early and mid-80's, when the boom on Wall Street buoyed the New York economy and The Times's ad revenues. The Times Company's operating profits, before taxes, rose steadily from $83 million in 1982 to $284 million in 1987, the peak year, when the stock market crashed in October.
From 1979 to 1987, the Times Company spent about $1 billion to acquire newspapers, magazines and broadcast properties. "We rode those boom years and put the cash into diversification," said David L. Gorham, the company's senior vice president and chief financial officer.
The Times Company does not report the contribution of its individual businesses. But analysts say that by the early 80's, The Times represented about two-thirds of the company's business, a share that remained fairly steady until 1987 because, despite the string of acquisitions, The Times also grew rapidly. Today, The Times represents about half of the company's $1.77 billion in revenues. Once The Globe is folded in, The Times's share will be down to 40 percent or so.
The Times itself has moved well beyond its New York and Northeast base. The paper's national edition, begun in 1980, currently has a daily circulation of 270,000, and 340,000 on Sunday. The national edition represents a growing slice of The Times total circulation, 1,230,461 daily and 1,812,458 on Sunday.
The Times Company's first important diversification move came in 1971, when it acquired Cowles Communications Inc. for shares valued at roughly $70 million. The Cowles merger brought Family Circle magazine; a Memphis television station, WREG-TV, and three Florida daily newspapers, The Ledger in Lakeland, The Gainesville Sun and The Ocala Star-Banner.
The Cowles move set the direction for further diversification by the Times Company, building on that foundation in three key businesses: magazines, broadcasting and regional newspapers, mainly in the Southeast.
Today, in addition to The Times, the company publishes 31 regional newspapers. Analysts agree that the company has done an excellent job lifting quality and profits at most of the papers it has acquired. As a business model, the Times Company has followed the strategy of many newspaper chains, purchasing papers in smaller markets that virtually control the local newspaper advertising market.
Typically, the regional papers in the Times fold will be read by more than 50 percent of the households in their circulation area. By contrast, The Times reaches 14 percent of the households in its area on Monday through Saturday, while The Globe reaches about 25 percent.
 
 
Serious Misstep
 But the newspaper-buying spree included one serious misstep. In 1987, the company acquired The Gwinnett Daily News in a suburban area outside Atlanta that seemed poised for growth. It was, but it was also within the circulation area of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
Under the Times Company's wing, The Gwinnett Daily News nearly doubled its circulation, to about 50,000 by 1992. But The Journal and Constitution offered a special regional edition, cut its cover price and offered deeply discounted advertising deals.
The Times Company closed down The Gwinnett Daily News last year, and took a $53.8 million charge against earnings. "We went in and took on a major newspaper in part of its home turf," Mr. Primis explained. "We won't get in that situation again."
The company's 20 magazines, led by McCall's, Family Circle, Golf Digest, and Tennis, contributed revenues of $386 million last year. The most recent big purchase was in 1989, when the Times Company acquired McCall's for a reported $80 million. "It doesn't get much notice, but the Times Company has become a major consumer magazine publisher," said Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a publishing consultant.
In 1984, after years of running a small but respected book business, the Times Company sold Times Books to Random House Inc. for an undisclosed sum. At the time, company executives explained that the Times Company was getting out of book publishing mainly because it consumed too much management time and energy for a small unit that was outside its core businesses.
In 1989, the company sold its cable television business, NYT Cable TV, which it had acquired eight years earlier. The system served 162,000 subscribers in southern New Jersey; the Times Company sold it for $420 million in cash, making a handsome profit.
 
 
'Providers of Information'
 "We've decided we want to be the providers of information, not the transporters of information," Mr. Primis said in explaining that sale.
And it is as information suppliers that Mr. Primis and other Times Company executives remain confident about the newspaper business, a confidence that is behind their enthusiasm for buying The Globe.
Some combination of computer, television and telephone technology may well make inroads in how the information traditionally gathered and presented by newspapers is distributed, they say, but that information-supplying role will remain a valuable business.
Industry consultants tend to agree. "There are challenges, but that does not mean newspapers are dinosaurs," said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates Inc. in New York. "If it is well managed, a big newspaper company like the Times should be in a good position to make the transition."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Open Talks On New Trade Framework

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
American and Japanese officials began discussions today on a new framework for bilateral economic relations but, as expected, they did not reach an agreement, the officials said.
"The meeting was primarily an opportunity for a mutual exchange of views on economic issues," said Bowman Cutter, the deputy assistant to the President for economic affairs. "It was a useful meeting -- it was not intended to arrive at an agreement and it did not." 
 Mr. Cutter said that he and five other senior American officials would discuss the framework further in Tokyo on June 27 and 28. More talks will be held on Saturday but they will be restricted to noneconomic issues like the environment, Mr. Cutter said.
A Japanese official who insisted on anonymity also characterized the meeting as useful. He said that there had been a few differences, but that the overall tone was cordial. He echoed the confidence of American officials that a new framework for further negotiations could be put together in the next month.
The American negotiators raised concerns about the openness of Japan's market for cars and car parts, but most of the talks today were about broad issues such as how to organize the new agenda for bilateral trade relations.
The Japanese official mentioned that his Government perceived "problems" in access to the United States market and in past efforts by the Federal Government to improve the competitiveness of American industry. But the official refused to elaborate. Japanese officials in the past have urged Washington to do everything from reducing the Federal deficit to improving the quality of American schools, while criticizing unilateral American moves to restrict Japanese products ranging from factory tools to electric typewriters.
The White House plan presented today to Japanese officials is not intended to resolve any of the bilateral trade issues now pending. American officials tried instead to persuade the Japanese to consent to a new agenda -- or "framework" that would guide talks on specific issues.
 
Two Goals in U.S. Plan
 The American plan calls for an agreement on two overarching economic goals, together with the creation of five new categories for detailed talks.
The first overall goal is to reduce the Japanese trade surplus within several years to less than 2 percent of Japan's economic output, from 3.2 percent last year. The second broad goal is to increase Japanese imports of manufactured goods by a third.
The American and Japanese negotiators plan to continue talking over dinner tonight, joined by at least five business leaders and some members of Congress, but Administration officials said these talks would be less detailed.
President Clinton said today in the Rose Garden that he hoped an understanding could be reached on the framework before heads of state from the world's seven leading industrial nations gather in Tokyo on July 7.
 
Clinton Emphasizes Relationship
 President Clinton has put economic disputes with Japan at the center of what he calls the world's most important bilateral relationship. The United States and Japan "recognize that there will have to be an evolution in not only our relationship, but in the whole balance of global trade if we're going to have sustained global growth, which is what is in the interest of Japan and the United States," the President said today in the Rose Garden.
President Clinton spoke about the relationship after announcing the nomination of Walter F. Mondale to become Ambassador to Japan.
Mr. Mondale was President Carter's Vice President and ran for President in 1984. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the fourth Vice President who has gone on to become an ambassador, and the first former Vice President dispatched as an ambassador to a non-European country, the State Department said.

HEADLINE: Worries Over Inflation Are Eased by May Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Inflation at the producer level evaporated in May, providing strong evidence, relieved economists said today, that jumps earlier in the year did not represent the start of a worrisome price surge.
The Government also reported today that retail sales in May posted a weaker-than-expected rise, an indication of continued lackluster growth in the economy. 
 The reports quickly erased fears that the Federal Reserve would act soon to raise interest rates, a move that would further slow the weak recovery by raising the cost of buying a house or a car or anything else that requires credit.
 
Markets React Positively
 The good news on the inflation front unleashed heavy buying in the bond markets that pushed interest rates down sharply. The stock market also rallied, despite the signs of continued economic sluggishness.
Prices, as gauged by what American producers receive for their finished goods, were unchanged last month after having jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in April and four-tenths of 1 percent in March, the Labor Department's report showed.
The so-called core inflation rate, which does not count the erratic food and energy components, was halved from April's pace, to two-tenths of 1 percent.
Private economists hailed the inflation report, declaring that it confirmed suspicions that the early-year increases in the Producer Price Index exaggerated the danger of a surge of inflation severe enough to force the central bank to raise interest rates.
"The May P.P.I. report sharply reduces the likelihood of any Fed tightening in the months ahead," said Donald H. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch. He noted that the core producer index has risen just 1.7 percent over the last year, the slowest pace since 1967.
President Clinton's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said that while she was reassured by the latest figures, the White House had not been much worried about the earlier increases at either producer or consumer levels. Her office has been aware that in the latest three years -- and in 9 of the last 11 -- core inflation has been significantly higher during the January-April period than during the rest of the year.
This fluctuation occurs despite the adjustment of the data for normal seasonal variation, like cold weather, which would tend to raise heating oil and natural gas prices. Various analysts contend that it is deficiencies in the adjustment process that magnify inflation early in each year, though the puzzle is complicated by the fact that the elements making the biggest impact conform to no annual pattern.
 
Political Considerations
 The Clinton Administration and other Democrats have tended to play down inflation risks as they try to win passage of legislation to stimulate the economy, which has been expanding at a relatively slow pace two years after the formal end of recession. Mr. Clinton is also counting on low interest rates to offset economic drag from the tax increases and the spending cuts in his economic package.
"The inflation hawks at the Fed should lay aside their spears and stop jousting with phantom inflation," Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, head of the Senate Budget Committee, said today. "Upward price pressures are nonexistent and flat retail sales show that the economy, far from being overheated, has barely mustered any forward momentum."
The Labor Department's price figures also showed that inflation at the intermediate stage of production -- one step further removed from the consumer than finished goods -- fell two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the weakest showing since November.
Crude goods jumped 2 percent after a 1.2 percent rise in April, but this mainly reflected a 12.3 percent surge for natural gas. Apart from food and energy, the rise for crude goods slowed to four-tenths of 1 percent, from 1.8 percent in April.
The Commerce Department's report that retail sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent last month, to $170.1 billion, was below most expectations, but any disappointment was softened somewhat by an upward revision for April.
The April gain is now put at 1.5 percent instead of the 1.2 percent initially reported. March, however, was revised down slightly.
Analysts also took comfort in the fact that durable goods, accounting for 37 percent of total sales, posted a hefty advance, of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Durables -- goods meant to last at least three years -- tend to be postponable items bought with discretionary income, and analysts were encouraged that consumers still seemed willing and able to spend.
Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes chalked up a 3.6 percent advance last month, while the gain for automotive dealers was four-tenths of 1 percent. Those selling furniture and other equipment for the home posted a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent, a result at odds with the surge in sales of new homes previously reported for May.
Among nondurables, which declined four-tenths of 1 percent over all, general merchandise stores had a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent, while sales at stores selling apparel and accessories rose 1.5 percent and at drug and proprietary stores, five-tenths of 1 percent.
But these increases were more than offset by declines of 1.6 percent at gasoline stations, seven-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and four-tenths of 1 percent at food stores. Some of this weakness, particularly in gasoline and food, reflected lower prices rather than reduced demand.
 
Year-to-Year Comparison
 For March through May, total sales were 5.4 percent above the comparable 1992 period, adjusted for seasonal and holiday differences but not for inflation, which at the consumer level was 3.2 percent for the 12 months through April. Consumer price figures for May are to be released on Tuesday.
Among the items exerting sizable upward pressure on producer prices last month were fresh fruits and melons, beef and veal, shellfish, heating oil, tobacco products and books.
Finished goods that fell in price included automobiles, fresh and dry vegetables, pork, shortening and cooking oils, bakery products, roasted coffee and prescription drugs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Weak Economic Data Fail To Cause Selloff in Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar held its ground against leading foreign currencies yesterday, despite reports that American wholesale prices and retail sales barely budged in May, statistics that hurt any immediate chance of higher interest rates.
The dollar, which ended mixed, apparently was buoyed by traders nervous about selling the currency during trade talks between the United States and Japan. 
 The Government reported that its Producer Price Index was unchanged in May after worrisome increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in March and six-tenths in April. A second report showed that retail sales rose an anemic one-tenth of 1 percent in May, far below expectations.
The combination sent the dollar tumbling about one and a half pfennigs against the German mark in early New York trading. But the dollar recovered later in the day, settling at 1.6260 marks in New York, only slightly lower than late Thursday's 1.6295 marks.
There has been speculation in the financial markets for weeks that May's inflation rate, if it showed a continuation of high levels established earlier this year, would prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates to help combat inflation. Higher interest rates would tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to investors.
In recent days, however, expectations began to lean toward the data's showing an easing of inflation in May. David Gilmore, a currency analyst at MCM Inc., said the dollar's early plunge yesterday was more closely tied to the sluggish retail sales.
"The numbers really turn the pendulum back toward a market bearish on the economy, and I think rightfully so," he said.
Many traders, though, remained hesitant to sell dollars amid talks yesterday between United States and Japanese trade negotiators aimed at reducing the trade deficit with Japan.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 106.15 yen, barely changed from late Thursday's 106.16 yen.
The dollar ended slightly stronger against the British pound amid mounting uncertainty about the viability of Prime Minister John Major's Government. In New York, the pound fetched $1.5225, down slightly from late Thursday's $1.5270.

Innkeeper Expands In Europe

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Choice Hotels International has added 163 European hotels to its rapidly expanding hospitality empire, bringing to more than 3,000 the number of Choice franchises in 30 countries. With its parent company, Manor Care Inc., Choice purchased the properties for an undisclosed sum from Inovest, one of France's largest operators of budget properties.
The acquisition gives Choice 144 more properties in France, plus 19 additional hotels in six other European countries, including its first hotels in Spain and Portugal. The agreement comes less than two months after Choice formed a joint venture with the Journey's End Corporation, Canada's biggest hotel management company, which owns 120 inns. 
 "It was a great opportunity because France is a target for us, and because all the properties were built in the last six years," said Gerald Petitt, president and chief operating officer of Choice. "And it brings our European properties to about 225, although we plan to more than double that within a few years."
Manor Care, based in Silver Spring, Md., is a major health-care company in the United States, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where its stock lost 12.5 cents to close at $20.375 yesterday. Its Manor Care Hotels division owns and operates 20 hotels in the United States. Those hotels, and all those in the Choice portfolio, operate under one of seven banners: Clarion, Comfort, Econo Lodge, Friendship, Quality, Rodeway or Sleep Inns.
 
Renaming Hotels
 Manor Care revenues for the fiscal year ended May 31 are expected to be slightly more than $1 billion, with Choice contributing about $159 million.
Mr. Petitt said the Inovest hotels, most of them along the major highways in France, had been in bankruptcy courts, casualties of the country's economic downturn.
Choice will rename the 141 two-star Primevere properties Comfort Inn Primevere. Comfort is one of Choice's limited-service chains. The three existing three-star properties in France, named Saphir, will be renamed as Quality Inn Primevere and Comfort Inn Primevere.
As a result of the purchase, Choice Hotels Europe and Quality Hotels Europe will form a new Paris-based company, Manor Care Hotels (France) S.A., to oversee Primevere's hotel operations in France. But Choice's existing 14 franchised hotels in France, and future franchised properties there, will continue to be administered by Choice Hotels Europe.
Faced with dwindling opportunities for growth in the United States, Choice and other franchises are forging relationships in foreign lands with local franchise operators. In addition to its joint agreement in Canada, Choice has signed franchise agreements in recent months with partners in Singapore and Mexico, each of which will develop at least 30 hotels.

Macy Shows Gain in Sales, Cash Flow

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Offering further evidence that its fortunes are slowly reversing, R. H. Macy & Company, which is operating under bankruptcy-law protection, said yesterday that its sales and cash flow were stronger in its fiscal third quarter.
The retailer has met its plan for the last three months, and last month it announced that its expense-reduction efforts were paying off more quickly than it had anticipated. 
 Sales rose 5.8 percent in the quarter, to $1.34 billion, from $1.3 billion in the comparable period last year. Sales in stores open at least one year, which is considered a barometer of retail growth, rose 3.1 percent.
 But higher costs from closing stores and eliminating jobs resulted in a $228 million net loss in the quarter that ended May 1, compared with a $226 million loss a year earlier.
Operating losses shrank somewhat, to $54 million from $60 million, mostly because of lower overhead expenses.
Despite the negative bottom line, analysts regarded the numbers as further evidence of a positive overall trend at Macy, which operates the Macy's, I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains as well as two specialty store chains, Aeropostale and Charter Club. "We continue to like what we see," said Jack Hersch, an analyst at M. J. Whitman L.P. who follows distressed and bankrupt companies.
 
 
Productivity Levels
 The company has been planning conservatively and trying to raise its productivity levels to offset the effects of the weak economy in most of California, as well as Long Island and Baltimore. It said sales in Texas and Florida were strong in the third quarter and less vigorous in the New York and Washington regions.
Macy's cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $26.5 million in the quarter, exceeding the requirements of its bank loans by about $6.5 million.

Key Commodity Index Off; Gold and Oil Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A key index of commodity prices dropped yesterday to its lowest level in more than three months as prices for oil, precious metals and some agricultural products declined. Both oil and gold prices fell sharply.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities declined 1.89 points, to 203.29. Coincidentally, the Government reported early yesterday that its Producer Price Index of wholesale prices remained flat in May. Many analysts said, however, that in the intermediate term the bureau's index was likely to rise again and even surpass the one-year high of 214.27 set in late March. 
 "It's attempting to put in a major bottom, and this always takes time," said Hans Kashyap of Analytics Research Corporation.
If this proves true, yesterday's favorable news on producer prices may be short-lived.
 
Eight-Month Lag
 William Branson, professor of economics at Princeton University, estimates that rises and falls in commodity prices precede turning points in inflation by about eight months.
Commodities analysts have said repeatedly in recent months that supply-and-demand fundamentals are improving for many commodities and that price increases are likely. Goldman, Sachs, for example, predicts an overall increase in commodities prices of about 10 percent over the next year to year and a half.
Oil prices dropped for the second consecutive day on continued disappointment over the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement. Kuwait, which rejected the pact, softened its stance somewhat and said it would watch the market before raising oil production.
 
July Crude off 30 Cents
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in July dropped 30 cents, to $18.98 a barrel, the lowest level since January. July heating oil declined 0.16 cent, to 53.01 cents a gallon, and July unleaded gasoline fell 0.23 cent, to 54.61 cents a gallon.
Gold prices tumbled in thin trading. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded August gold contract fell $3.50, to $367.50 an ounce.
The letup in inflation at the producer level drove prices lower. Tuesday's report on consumer prices in May will be closely watched, analysts said.

HEADLINE: To Assure a Nuclear-Free Korea

 BODY:
Deft diplomacy by the Clinton Administration has coaxed North Korea back from the brink. The North had threatened to bolt from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and build nuclear arms. It will now allow routine international inspections of its nuclear sites.
Gaining access to its nuclear waste sites will require further negotiation; that could provide more evidence of how much plutonium North Korea might already have produced. But the resumption of routine inspections is a critical first step toward assuring that the Korean Peninsula is truly nuclear-free. 
 The agreement is a tribute to sensible officials in Pyongyang who chose the path to prosperity over the road to ruin. It's also a tribute to cool heads in Washington who refused to overreact to North Korea's bizarre bargaining behavior.
Pyongyang opened its nuclear reactors to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency last year. But initial inspections turned up evidence that the reactors had been operating longer than North Korea said they had, raising fears that it could have produced enough plutonium for a bomb.
When the agency sought to clear up the discrepancy in March by visiting the North's nuclear waste sites, Pyongyang balked and threatened to renounce the Nonproliferation Treaty. Now it has agreed to "suspend" taking that rash step and allow inspections. But the North continues to resist special inspection of the waste sites as unfair and insists on "impartial" application of the Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards.
If the North carries out its commitments, that will not only help inspectors determine how much bomb-making plutonium Pyongyang amassed in its reactors but also insure that such material is properly accounted for in the future. That will reassure uneasy neighbors that the North may yet abandon its nuclear ambitions and open the way to improved diplomatic and trade ties.
Those neighbors, who had good reason to fear regional instability that would surely result from a nuclear-armed North Korea, all played a part in persuading Pyongyang to reconsider.
The new civilian Government in South Korea, wisely repudiating its predecessor's strategy of isolating the North, has made several reassuring gestures toward Pyongyang in recent months. It is ready for North-South talks to promote peaceful coexistence on the divided peninsula.
Japan, which has forsworn nuclear arms in favor of economic growth, is prepared to offer trade and aid to encourage the North to follow its lead. And China, which feared that a nuclear North Korea would trigger an arms race in the region, weighed in diplomatically as well.
Washington, which joined in needlessly provocative "Team Spirit" military exercises with South Korea while letting diplomacy lapse during the Bush-Clinton transition, now needs to pay close attention. It cannot afford to let either its vigilance or its diplomacy relax if it is to prevent proliferation on the Korean Peninsula.

HEADLINE: May National Service Live Up to Peace Corps

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In 1987 two professors at Mercy College in New York compared the salary history of 1,000 former Peace Corps volunteers with 1,000 Fulbright scholars. 
 What the researchers discovered would surprise Michael S. McPherson and Morton Owen Schapiro, who contend in "What Price Patriotism?" (Op-Ed, June 3) that President Clinton's national service plan is fraught with economic disincentives, on an individual and a national level.
The Peace Corps is, for good reason, often held up as the model for the new national service program; it was no coincidence that the President announced his plan on the anniversary date of the agency.
At conception, the Peace Corps, too, was criticized as idealistic and a waste of taxpayer dollars. What Richard M. Nixon failed to comprehend in 1960, Professors McPherson and Schapiro fail to see today: Americans are desirous of an opportunity to serve. It is simplistic, laughably so, to argue that the short-term benefits to one's pocketbook will drive the recruiting success of this program.
As economists, Professors McPherson and Schapiro should know it is the long-term view that matters.
In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, one of the authors of the Mercy College study said the evidence suggested that service in the Peace Corps "is better than an M.B.A., better than a diploma from an Ivy League college, may even be better than a Fulbright grant."
There followed this statement: "Former Peace Corps volunteers are consistently outperforming their fellow workers in terms of salary gains and upward career mobility."
The study showed that large percentages of former volunteers tended to choose careers in education and health services -- two of the most maligned and unappreciated, but critically needed, occupational fields in this country.
If the national service plan President Clinton proposes does indeed become a close cousin to the Peace Corps, with its graduates achieving higher salaries, and paying more taxes over a lifetime, while they are drawn to careers in critically needed areas like education and health, thousands of Americans, along with their grateful compatriots, could be in for a boon.

HEADLINE: Raise the Cigarette Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re: "Experts Wavering on Steep Rise in Cigarette Tax" (news article, June 7): Although the costs of smoking to the American economy have been estimated at more than $100 billion a year -- more than $4 for every pack sold! -- some argue smokers shouldn't be asked to pay more through higher cigarette taxes because their early deaths save some pension and Social Security costs. 
 But the burden on nonsmokers of paying those costs through higher taxes and health insurance premiums will not be offset until 30 to 50 years from now, when today's smokers begin dying off.
No other country in the world has as low a cigarette tax burden as the United States, and many now impose far more than the proposed $2 a pack increase. All have found that higher taxes bring in much-needed revenue, even while reducing consumption -- especially among young children -- and slashing health care costs.
Cigarettes are lightly taxed in this country only because of the political clout of the industry and the reluctance of the nonsmoking majority to speak up.

HEADLINE: Yonkers Outlines Barriers To Minority Housing Plan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In the best of circumstances, buying a cooperative requires as much coordination as juggling five balls in the air while riding a unicycle. Throw in the emotional politics and the personalities of the Yonkers desegregation case and things become even more difficult.
That became apparent in a Federal courtroom yesterday as the City of Yonkers tried to explain why in more than a year's effort to desegregate the city's housing it had yet to move a single family into a cooperative apartment. The act of lining up qualified families, fiscally stable buildings, welcoming cooperative boards, state and Federal mortgage assistance agencies, and feuding city and court officials is proving to be an extraordinary challenge. 
 In defending itself in the latest stage of a 13-year-old Federal desegregation suit, the city has been trying to persuade Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in lower Manhattan that, despite such travails, its resistance to integration is a thing of the past. The mayor for the last 18 months, Terence M. Zaleski, took the stand to testify that he and his new administration have been working doggedly since April to find housing for 709 families with incomes below $67,000 a year in middle-class, largely white areas of Yonkers.
But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which along with the Justice Department brought the 1980 school and housing suit, contends that the effort to resolve the housing issue through existing cooperatives is largely a quixotic -- and dilatory -- one and that it would be more useful to build new housing. Under the city's current plan, only 115 of the 709 apartments are to be created through new construction, with the rest to be found in existing cooperatives or rehabilitated apartments.
 
Where Help Hindered
 Taking the witness stand for a second day yesterday, Marie Burkart, an urban planner who is Yonkers's director of community development, tried to shift much of the blame for the city's failure to house families on an agency appointed by the court to monitor the city's progress, the Fair Housing Implementation Office. She testified that the office's director, Karen V. Hill, had been expected to supply the city with names of families interested in purchasing apartments.
But of the nearly 1,000 referrals that the city received, Ms. Burkart said, hundreds of families could not be found, others were no longer interested and others had incomes too low or credit histories too shaky to qualify for mortgages, even with state and Federal subsidies. The list was eventually distilled to 60, she said, and further investigation revealed problems with many of those.
As a result of the Fair Housing office's poor referrals, she said, only four families have actually signed purchase contracts for apartments, and only two of those have received approvalfrom cooperative boards. The city, she said, is now advertising for new applicants.
Questioned by Judge Sand as to why only two applicants had received co-op board approval, she explained that there was a "Catch-22" situation in which Judge Sand himself had a part. She said the co-op boards would not approve families who had not received Government financing for closing costs and down payments, but that financing was being held up because Judge Sand wants first to decide whether the use of cooperatives is the best approach. And she said the New York State Mortgage Agency was unwilling to guarantee mortgages until subsidies were in place.
Judge Sand, a soft-spoken scholarly judge who was at one time a real-estate lawyer, wondered aloud whether the city had been putting itself through a year of unnecessary gyrations when the key factor, co-op board approval, had never been assured. He mentioned his experience with Park Avenue cooperative boards who had rejected apartment applicants for reasons of "economics or ethnicity" or reasons that he suggested amounted to pure whim.
 
Belief in Cooperation
 Ms. Burkart argued that the city had sounded out cooperative board presidents and believed it had found many interested in participating in the integration program, particularly because a weak market with a high rate of vacancies was hurting many of the co-ops. Judge Sand was not convinced, pointing out that co-op board presidents exercise only one vote on the fickle boards.
"You're making sound, rational arguments," he told Ms. Burkart. "Whereas my experience in a context not as volatile as Yonkers is that rationality is often irrelevant."
At another point, Judge Sand also fretted that the city could imperil the life savings of some families by placing them in financially shaky co-op buildings with desperate landlords.
"The consequences of purchase may be a few thousand dollars, but that may be all that they have," Judge Sand said.
If Judge Sand finds that the effort to scatter mostly black and Hispanic families through existing cooperatives is flawed in conception, he may end up supporting something closer to the N.A.A.C.P.'s proposal to rely on new construction.
That is why Michael H. Sussman, the N.A.A.C.P. lawyer, and Christopher Shaheen, a lawyer for the Justice Department, sought in their cross-examinations to show that Yonkers's once recalcitrant attitude toward integration has changed very little and that 450 adequate apartments will never be found.
 
4 Percent Cap Debated
 Mr. Sussman bore in on statements by Yonkers officials that they would place a cap of 4 percent on the number of subsidized tenants steered to any one building, suggesting that the city was still trying to hold down the number of minority families permitted to participate. He also focused on the city's decision to require approval by co-op boards of tenant purchases even when apartments were held by building landlords and did not typically require such approval.
Mayor Zaleski testified that the 4 percent figure was merely an effort to assure integration by scattering tenants around middle-class areas of Yonkers and that the figure had been recommended by the housing expert appointed by Judge Sand. And Ms. Burkart said the motive behind requiring board approval was to assure that tenants would be welcome.
Under prodding by the city's lawyer, Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., Mr. Zaleski sought to show that despite years of stubborn resistance to housing integration by his predecessors and other officials, he was elected with a pledge to resolve the controversy.
"I stated again and again in public forums that the city needed to respect its constitutional obligations," he said. "I stated that we had an obligation to move the city forward."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a housing desegregation case in Yonkers misstated the number of families that have received approval as tenants from cooperative building boards. Only one of the four qualified families needs the approval of a cooperative board, and that family has not yet received such approval.

HEADLINE: ON LANGUAGE;
Sic 'Em!

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
BOB DOLE'S TITLE is Senate Republican Leader. The sign over his door used to read, "Minority Leader," a tradition Senator Everett Dirksen preserved, but Senator Hugh Scott changed it in the late 1960's when he was leader because it struck him as down-putting.
The Senate Republican Leader (going against Times style, I capitalize the letter l because it is part of a title) called the other day and, before passing along a hot news tip, observed, "Those guys in the White House just don't know sic 'em." 
 I asked what he meant; Dole seemed taken aback, as if surprised to find that I didn't know sic 'em, either. "It means 'anything,' " he said. He thinks I've been inside the Beltway too long.
A quick call to DARE -- the Dictionary of American Regional English, at the University of Wisconsin in Madison -- turned up the geographic dispersion of the dialect term: a few spottings in the Midwest, explaining Kansan Dole's usage, but heaviest in the Pacific Northwest.
Question JJ156 on the DARE questionnaire, skillfully designed to elicit regionalisms, is "Sayings about a person who seems to you very stupid: 'He doesn't know ----.' " Although some would respond with a brief expletive, DARE's query drew 27 answers of Sic 'em, along with these more detailed responses: " 'Here' from sic 'em," "Sic 'em from 'come here' " and "Sic 'em from 'go get 'em.' "
When American Speech magazine queried readers about sic 'em in 1961, one observed that his mother heard it from Arkansas friends who owned hound dogs. Another reader, the great San Francisco dialexicographer Peter Tamony, replied: "The remark describes an unresponsive, indolent, shiftless person. He is like a dog that shows no courageous and instant reaction to the command 'sic 'em.' " Mr. Tamony gave an etymological insight by adding that sic 'em is "merely a pronunciation modification of seek 'em or seek 'im."
The earliest citations are from Stewart Edward White's 1907 "Arizona Nights": "You see, for all their plumb nerve in comin' so far, the most of them didn't know sic 'em. . . . I didn't know sic 'em about minin'." In Ramon Adams's 1968 "Western Words," the term is defined as "a cowboy's expression meaning 'ignorant.' I have heard many unique references to ignorance, like 'He don't know 'nough to pack guts to a bear,' 'He don't know dung from wild honey' and many others. Ted Logan referred to a man with 'His head's so hollow he's got to talk with his hands to get away from the echo.' "
The key is the unspoken from. Not to know sic 'em (sometimes spelled sickum) means not to distinguish the master's command to his dog to attack from the entirely different command "come here." (This is not a canine slur; either the master or the dog can be the stupid party. Or both can be: when I say sic 'em! to James, my Bernese mountain dog, he snarls ferociously and comes at me.)
Modern dialect users are more familiar with not knowing from beans, which probably originated in "not knowing split beans from coffee beans," or "not knowing beans from barley," "beans from bullfrogs," etc. The key from is found in "not knowing cow chips from kumquats," a fine double alliteration; indeed, alliteration is frequent in this trope of comparison, as the makers of Shinola shoe polish learned to their rue. Today, the from is usually dropped, and "He don't know beans" is all that remains.
I am indebted to Republican Leader Dole for this lead, if that's what he called about.
 
SUMMER READING
 IN AN ERA OF audiobooks and videotapes and CD-ROM's, the printed book remains the single best way to learn and appreciate the language. As long summertime weekends approach (go try to find a book editor in the office on Friday), here are the books I am taking with me to the West Virginia mountains to read:
"When They Took Away the Man in the Moon," a novel by Kate Lehrer, a self-discovery specialist who is getting up into the Anne Tyler league (Harmony, $20).
"Blue Hearts," a spy novel by Jim Lehrer, rapidly becoming known as "Kate Lehrer's husband," a modern spy novel set in the C.I.A.-infested mountains of West Virginia (Random House, $20; dicker with your bookseller to sell you the Lehrer family books in a package for a discount).
"Crossing by Night," a spy novel by David Aaron, Jimmy Carter's deputy national security adviser, based on the life of Elizabeth Pack, the legendary British secret agent (Morrow, $22).
To nonfiction, sticking with spies to start:
"Spy Trader," by Craig R. Whitney, which John Le Carre accurately blurbs as "a revelation"; the fascinating story of the cold war through the ambivalent eyes of the shadowy German who arranged the spook swaps (Times Books, $25).
"The Real Anita Hill," by David Brock, which I'm taking because of the reverse-selling review in The New Yorker by two pro-Hill, anti-Clarence Thomas writers (Free Press, $24.95).
"The Fifties," by David Halberstam, who writes breezily but profoundly about the time that shaped the postwar world (Villard Books, $27.50).
"Touched With Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament," by Kay Redfield Jamison, showing why Byron, Poe, Melville and other depressives lit up the landscape, by one of the nation's foremost psychiatrists (Free Press, $24.95).
"The Hard Way," by Alexander B. Brook ($19.95). I'll read this memoir by a crusty editor because it's the first book from Warren Phillips's new publishing house, Bridge Works Publishing, Bridgehampton, N.Y.
"Terror in the Night," by Jack Nelson, the gripping history of the Ku Klux Klan's campaign against Southern Jews (Simon & Schuster, $22).
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition ($21.95). I get my kicks reading great dictionaries: "Mole . . . 4. a spy (as a double agent) who establishes a cover long before beginning espionage." And if the owner has a specific question about any word that didn't make it or word origins, he or she can write M-W's research service. (How come wimp is "origin unknown"? Isn't it from "whimper," spelling influenced by Popeye's friend Wimpy?)
 
STAND AND DELIVER
 THE MOST ill-considered phrase uttered on the floor of the House of Representatives this year came from the Speaker himself.
Urging his fellow Democrats to support President Clinton's economic proposals, Speaker Tom Foley said, "This is the time to stand and deliver."
Presumably, the Speaker meant that the members must courageously stand up and be counted to deliver their votes. However, the phrase Stand and deliver! is the command of the highwayman holding up a horse-drawn coach. Its meaning was clear to every driver carrying valuable cargo: stand still and deliver up the gold and jewelry.
The phrase today still carries the connotation of mounted theft. It's not a locution a politician wants to apply to a representative's relations with the taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Enormous Changes at the Last Minute

BYLINE: By John Darnton; John Darnton is the London bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Spring has come early to Warsaw this year. Crocuses poke through the soil near Chopin's statue in Lazienki Park, and the snow has retreated to small mounds heaped with dirt in the shadows.
For me, a visitor returning to Poland after an absence of 11 years, the change is more than seasonal. The country's transformation is noticeable even before entering, in the cursory glance given to my American passport at the spanking new Okecie airport. Gone are the interrogations, the hassle of filling out currency forms, the peculiar overhead mirrors that enabled immigrations officials to peer down your back. 
 On the ride into town, Pontiac and Chevrolet dealerships line the road. On a billboard, two women on Rollerblades, wearing yellow and fuchsia sweatbands, smile and hold up Coca-Cola bottles. A sign says it's only 2.3 kilometers to McDonald's. Five new hotels have gone up, almost creating a skyline.
The change can be seen too in things no longer here. The Pewex shops that sold liquor and cigarettes and canned hams, and only accepted hard currency. The meat stores open only to party officials. The ubiquitous black marketeers hounding tourists, who came with their phrase books at the ready and soon learned that the customary greeting from strangers wasn't "Good day" or "Hello" but "Pssst, change money?"
Everywhere, English is seen and heard. It may be fractured, as in the sign over a repair shop -- "carservis." Or it may be precise, as in the crisp diction of some of the thousands of students now taking the language. Nowhere does one hear Russian, which was compulsory in school during the years of the "fraternal relationship" with the Soviet Union.
Before, imported American films had to conform to ideology. (Thus, "Apocalypse Now," which depicted American brutality in the Vietnam War, was permitted while "The Deer Hunter," which showed a savage Vietcong, was not). The movies had to portray the dark side of America -- America as a cesspool of alcohol, crime and poverty. Predictably, the policy backfired: the audience erected its own filter. What it saw was not the man robbing the car but the car itself with sleek styling and smooth bucket seats.
Now, anything goes. Though the Polish film industry is booming -- it produced more than 30 feature films last year -- almost all of the theaters show American movies. They run the gamut, from "Dracula" to "Home Alone 2" to "Fried Green Tomatoes." The message of alienation that characterizes much of American culture comes through loud and clear.
Before, the cultural icons from the West were filtered and softened through a Polish culture that still made room for the Catholic priest swinging incense, the peasant saddling his horse to a wooden wagon and the somewhat seedy nobleman clicking his heels and kissing the hand of a woman.
Young people who flocked to discotheques lacked the hard edge of their Western counterparts, the overtones of rebellion and violence. They mimicked the form but not the substance. They may have been alienated from their Government but not from their parents. One young student I knew, the spitting image of James Dean, came close to breaking up with his girlfriend because he felt she didn't show enough respect to his mother.
All this is rapidly changing. Polish skinheads, though few in number, are every bit as rabid and racist as their cultural heroes in Germany. The Polish rap group Breast delights in devising obscene lyrics to invoke the wrath of the establishment. The hottest new play in town, "Antigone in New York," by Janusz Glowacki, a Polish playwright living in New York City, is about homeless people in Tompkins Square Park, and the America it evokes is the familiar one of alcohol, crime and poverty.
It may be that Communism's most significant achievement in the 1950's was to act as a hermetic seal, and that once the seal was broken, by the power of American culture in the 1960's, the entire system was doomed.
With the end of the cold war, the Second World War has also dimmed. No more pamphlets in the hotels giving statistics of the war losses, no more faded footage of the invading Wehrmacht on television. Aside from a state-sponsored commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising on April 19 -- an event intended to show how much Poland has moved away from anti-Semitism -- there is no attempt to evoke the horrors of the past.
Gorbachev and Yeltsin have acknowledged Soviet guilt for Katyn, the massacre of thousands of Polish officers. Schools now can teach the truth about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which divided up Poland. The obsession with suffering and betrayal is over.
Not coincidentally, there has been a remarkable shift in public attitude toward the Russians. A decade ago, Soviet soldiers had to be stationed in the countryside, out of sight, and a car with Soviet license plates parked overnight in Warsaw was apt to have its windshield smashed. Now there is nothing but sympathy for the hordes of poor Russians, Moldavians, Ukranians and others who slip across the border to sell their pathetic wares.
How abruptly it can all change. "When I was growing up," recalls Adam Michnik, the onetime dissident who helped form Solidarity, "I learned that we were surrounded by three countries -- the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Now look, they've all disappeared."
I served as a correspondent in Poland from 1979 to 1982. When I arrived, Communism was in the full bloom of its decay. From outside, the regime of Edward Gierek looked normal enough, but inside the rot had spread. To come crumbling down, all it needed was a nudge. That came in August 1980, when the workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk went on strike. For the next 16 months, Solidarity held the country and much of the world in thrall. Then, abruptly, the drumbeat of freedom stopped: on Dec. 13, 1981, martial law came down like the blade of a guillotine.
I witnessed a cycle of oppression, rebellion, oppression. Three years, three different countries. There was a sense of symmetry to it. And now, 11 years later, I have returned and found a fourth country. Stalin once said that Communism fits Poland the way a saddle fits a cow. Well, Poland has thrown off the saddle. Making up for lost time, it has embraced a rambunctious, even rapacious capitalism. Adam Smith has replaced Karl Marx.
One evening, back in my hotel room, I went over some notes I had made over a decade ago. Only then did the enormity of the changes really come home to me.

DECEMBER 1980. Recently my wife, Nina, and I met Stash, a 30-year-old academic who recently discovered he was Jewish. His parents were ardent Communists and they kept their background a secret. But he always suspected he was different. He grew up, he said, "with the sense that anti-Semitism was somehow personally threatening," so that when he pried the truth out it didn't come as a total surprise. Still, it changed his life.
His girlfriend, Monika, is Catholic, but she wears a pendant with a Star of David. A whole group of young intellectuals has gathered around them, about 20 in all. They are all Jewish or half-Jewish, and they are hungry to learn whatever they can about their religion and culture. What's astounding is how little they know and how hungry they are for information.
Some of their stories are dramatic. One young woman named Ewa was rummaging around in the attic one afternoon and found a document that identified her grandmother as Jewish. When she confronted her mother, her mother at first denied it. "Then she broke down and cried. She said she had raised me as a Catholic to protect me. She begged me not to tell my brother, but of course I didn't go along. Being Jewish -- it's part of what makes you what you are, and you have a right to know it."
Stash's group began meeting, at first just to swap experiences and to "overcome the taboo" of admitting they were Jewish. Then they met to study Judaism. By the time I encountered them, they were getting together to observe holidays and festivals, though no one really knew what to do or how to act. They seem to feel a little self-conscious about the whole thing but they are drawn to it by some force they can't describe.
There's not much to help them. No one really knows how many Jews are left in Poland, but the figure is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 -- a pathethic remnant considering that Poland was the center of prewar world Jewry with three and a half million. In Warsaw alone there were about 400,000 Jews in 1938, nearly a third of the city.
Recently I read "Shosha," by Isaac Bashevis Singer, and then took a walk along Krochmalna Street, which he describes house by house. He wrote lovingly of the tenements and shops and balconies hung with wash and cobblestone alleyways so packed with sellers and thieves and prostitutes that it was hard to pass. There was nothing left but cold high-rise buildings set back from the street and a few bare-branched trees. I saw two children skateboarding, but no other sign of life.
There's no Jewish community in any sense of the word, no children even. Of 30 prewar synagogues, only one survived, and that was because it was used as a stable for the horses of Nazi officers. Today it sits empty and ransacked, its windows broken with pigeons flying in and out. Saddest of all are the few old men who hang out there. They are broken, wizened figures, and they have learned how to evoke pathos to secure handouts from the one or two American tourists who come by. "The synagogue will remain," said one of them, Izah Kamer, 70. "But the youngest of us is 53. In 10 years, we'll all be gone. There will be nobody left to pray in it."
Stash and his group have little to do with these old men. They meet only in one another's apartment, and they switch the venue every two weeks because they are nervous about the authorities. They remember the thugs in leather jackets who used truncheons to break up meetings of dissidents. They've asked me not to write a word about them. Of course, I have to agree, but I'm disappointed.
They invite us to a Hanukkah party. As we slip into a doorway and climb up a darkened staircase, someone handing us a bowl of potato latkes to carry, Nina asks one of them, "How do you say 'Happy Hanukkah' in Polish?" The answer comes with a quick laugh: "You don't say 'Happy Hanukkah' in Polish."

MARCH 1993. These days it's not hard to find Stash, whose full name is Stanislaw Krayewski. His name is well known in religious circles, from the various Christian-Jewish committees he serves on. As he strode into the Bristol Hotel, looking older and filled-out at 42, he announced that he had become something of a spokesman on Jewish issues, even appearing on television.
He had married Monika, who converted to Judaism, and they had two boys, ages 6 and 3, both being raised as Jews.
With the advent of democracy, the group stopped its underground services. The synagogue is now newly reconstructed and functioning. It was, said Stash, a relief to be able to worship openly. "It filled a great void," he said, and it was important not only to identify oneself as Jewish but to be seen as Jewish in the eyes of the rest of the world.
Indeed, there are some tentative signs of a Jewish revival in Warsaw. There are services twice a day, and there is no longer a problem securing a minyan, the minimum number of men necessary for worship. Thanks largely to the Israeli Embassy, there is a Jewish kindergarten with 34 children. And there are even Jewish camps and Jewish clubs for fencing and bridge, along the lines of the prewar Maccabiah. The camps and clubs are run by the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, which was set up five years ago to preserve what remains of Jewish life in Eastern Europe.
Most important, of course, there is a rabbi. Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz was sent here four years ago from Israel. He speaks Polish -- he was born 75 years ago near Lodz and survived the war in Poland. He did not return to Poland easily. He had to summon up "some kind of inner strength" -- his wife refused to accompany him or even to visit him. "I'll tell you why I came," he says. "I once saw 20 people hanged on the gallows. One of them was shouting: 'Jews, don't let our blood spill in vain. Avenge us!' This gives me the strength to come back. I want to restore all these ruins that the Germans wanted to eradicate. They didn't just want to kill us. They wanted to wipe out all traces that we ever existed."
Rabbi Joskowicz does not believe in the possibility of rebuilding the community. He exudes an air of fatalism. He observes that not all of the Catholic churches are "friendly." He sends young boys to other countries to be bar mitzvahed. And he is resigned to the fact that he will never see the "billions" needed to restore the Jewish cemetery, where 300,000 moss-covered tombstones are cracked and fallen. His shoulders are stooped with world-weariness, and he is facing something he thought he would never have to live through again. For the revival of Judaism has rekindled the ancient scourge of anti-Semitism.
A year ago the rabbi was walking home from evening prayers when he was jumped by a gang of skinheads. "I cried for help. They knocked my hat off and hit me a few times. They shouted: 'Jews go to Israel.' They knocked me down." Ever since then, the rabbi has taken a cab. "They see easily I'm a Jew, so I don't stay outside on the streets in the evening."
On the front of the newly reconstructed synagogue, someone has drawn two swastikas and the words, in English: "Jude Is Dead." Similar graffiti have appeared before, and whenever they are painted over, they come back. The rabbi shrugged. "That's the outside of the building. It's written for the Poles and it's bad for the Poles. I want things to be good on the inside."

NOVEMBER 1979. Mostly, Poles go about the business of living. It is not an easy business. A search for a pair of shoes can turn into a weeklong odyssey. Lines for milk form at dawn. Meat shops are empty. The waiting list for apartments, which are cramped and dingy, is seven years. For a car it's five years.
The frustrations of daily life weigh on the spirit. "A thousand tiny crucifixions," a friend calls them. The crowds elbowing onto the cold streetcar, the frozen faces of the saleswomen, the labyrinthian bureaucracy that intrudes into every facet of existence, the grime-infested assembly lines with that scratchy, buoyant music coming over the loudspeakers, the lying news programs, the continuous refrain of "nie ma, nie ma" -- "there is none" -- all of these, mixed in with the very bleakness of things, are almost unbearable.
There is a string of coal-mine disasters in Silesia. I go to one in the town of Czechowice-Dziedzice, where a cave-in killed two miners and a deadly fire trapped 20 more underground. Coal is the mainstay of the economy, and the miners are the most pampered workers in the socialist state. But is the regime squeezing the miners too hard in its increasingly desperate scramble for foreign exchange?
For two days I try to get close to the mine. Each time I arrive, something has gone wrong -- the official I was to see has been called away, the gate is locked. Losing patience, a local party secretary finally tells me to get the hell out of town.
I find a small bar two blocks away, named Barborka, after the miners' patron saint. I enter, a smoky cavern smelling of beer and sweat, with a menace of fistfights in the air. The bawl of conversation stops. Hostile eyes rimmed with coal dust turn to the stranger in a necktie. No one eases my path to the bar, but I finally get a beer. Gently I approach a table. I explain that I am an American journalist, that I have come to learn about the disaster. A miner lurches up, lunges actually, and grabs me by the arm. His face is three inches from mine. "First thing," he says, "you gotta realize all the papers in this country print crap, lies and crap." His companion says, "They're scared of the truth, and by Christ the Government better do something or we're going to do something ourselves."
There follows over the next hour an unremitting stream of complaints, threats and curses from dozens of miners, despite the presence of a shadow who crept in and sat conspicuously alone at a table nearby. By the end, as I leave, my car now tailed by three men in a Polonez, I think: rarely have I encountered such a burning brand of anger, a pure white-hot, we're-going-to-get-the-bastards anger. And this from the elite of the work force.
The next morning I return to the mine. The party secretary tells me I got his workers drunk to elicit classified information. I decide to leave. And the fire? "None of your business," he says. "And don't you worry -- everything's under control here." Three days later they bring up the bodies.

MARCH 1993. These days the great debate under capitalism is about how many people are doing better and how many are doing worse. The waiting list for apartments is gone. But on the open market, at a cost of $15,000 to $80,000, who can afford them? (Rentals are virtually nonexistent.) The stores are filled with goods; now with inflation galloping along at 40 percent, the problem is how to stretch the paycheck to buy them.
I decide to look up an old friend, Stash Gayewski, a courtly, elegant man who once served as Ambassador to France. Cheerfully, he confirms that things have never been blacker. "Take me as an example. I get 3,200,000 zlotys [$215] a month on my pension. Take away 600,000 zlotys [$40] for rent. Then some for clothes and some for food and before you know it, it's all gone. And I'm better off than most people. I can eat every day for practically nothing at the foreign-ministry canteen. I see a lot of people eating there, including a lot of former foreign ministers.
"Liberty has its price, but the price is very high. Disillusionment is growing. Political life has degenerated. Moral life is worse. There's this new clericalism. It all came too fast -- Solidarity was not prepared to take power."
He advises me to travel outside Warsaw, and so I go to Lodz, which underwent a 48-hour general strike in February. Some 64,000 members of Solidarity took part. The main industry of the city is textiles, and with the collapse of the traditional market in Russia, factories are shutting down and laying off workers.
I sit in the Solidarity office and listen to Henryk Formicki, a local Solidarity leader, earnestly describing the abysmal conditions for workers. He stands in front of a map of Poland with eight pinned banners; they denote towns on strike or strike alert. He speaks angrily of the Government's inaction. I have to pinch myself -- this is 1993, and many Solidarity people are running the country. Lech Walesa is President. Formicki's language, tactics and commitment are the same as theirs once was. Deja vu.
Formicki calculates that 132 of the 285 factories in Lodz have closed down and that some 40,000 people have been laid off in the past three years. Most of the textile workers are women. That explains the sudden upsurge in prostitution and live sex shows so unbelievably lewd that they are notorious throughout the country.
We go to visit a textile factory called Uniontex. It was built 170 years ago, with walls as thick as a castle's. The grounds cover 70 acres, including an ancient sports stadium, railroad-switching yards, three swimming pools and, off to one side, the decaying mansions of the founders, Scheibler and Grochman. There are also blocks of dismal red-brick workers dormitories that were used in "The Promised Land," Andrzej Wajda's film that excoriates capitalist exploitation.
At its height before the war, Uniontex employed 14,000 people. Since 1989, with the introduction of free-market economics and the collapse of the Soviet sales outlet, production has fallen 50 percent. Only 3,000 workers are left. From time to time a potential foreign buyer will tour the plant and hopes will soar, says Leszek Lewandowski, director of production. "But nothing's come of it. These old walls you see scare away the capitalists."
Inside the mill house, huge hundred-year-old machines from Manchester grind away. Cotton dust hangs in the air, so thick that the rows of spindles and thread extend off into the distance and then disappear in a yellowish haze. The women who work the machines, standing eight hours a day, have legs as thick as birch stumps.
They are shy when interviewed singly, but in a group inhibitions drop away and there is no stopping them. Standing around on a 10-minute break, wearing rough cotton jumpers, smiling and frowning with broad faces, they pour out their complaints. "Ten years ago, I was working and I could save. Now when I spend money for a new pair of shoes, there's nothing left over," says Miroslawa Jaroszek. After 26 years here, she earns $113 a month.
"This Government's a big disappointment," puts in Stanislawa Wisniewska. "How can they allow a worker to be a beggar? They were supposed to improve our lives. After 34 years here, I've got nothing to put in my pot."
They all say life was better under Communism. But when I ask them if they want to return to Communism, they all say no. Some shake their heads for emphasis. Why not? They pause, uncertain. "The Russians," says one, finally. Says another: "We got the Russians out." Says a third: "At least we can talk now, say what we feel. We'll give them a bit more time. We can hold on a bit longer, till the summer. We'll see what happens then. Maybe it'll all come together."
Maybe it will, I think as I leave. But how much time will it take? How much time remains? The last time I left Poland, and looked down through the airplane window at the tiny fields and forests shrinking into the distance, I knew only that the system could not last. But how the change would come about was beyond imagining. Who could have foreseen that the process started by the Poles would spread to the center of the empire? That it would happen in the belly of the beast, in Moscow?
Now, I'm leaving behind a new Poland. It is being proclaimed as the economic success story of Eastern Europe. Unlike the Balkans, Hungary and what once was the Soviet Union, Poland has no clamoring minorities, no ethnic divisions, no internal tensions -- its troubled history has left it totally homogeneous, 99 percent white and Roman Catholic. Its borders are secure for the first time in memory. And it has rid itself of foreign domination. Its historic enemies, Germany and Russia, are internally preoccupied.
Politics is as fractious as ever -- witness the no-confidence vote late last month that effectively ended the Government of Hanna Suchocka, the fifth Prime Minister since 1989. But the newspapers are strong and the courts are functioning independently. There is a memory at least of what unity was like during the Solidarity days and a kind of consensus that restraint is important.
In short, for the first time since it was partitioned and disappeared from the map for 123 years, Poland is coming into its own, however haltingly. It has reconciled its contradictions, put the horrors of the war and Communism behind and settled its account with history.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
The Heroism Of Anonymous Men and Women

BYLINE: by Vicki Goldberg

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Documentary photographers are many but their jobs are few. In America, at least, photojournalists with long lists of awards to their names have trouble finding assignments, especially assignments that deal with difficult and depressing subjects. It may be that television news is so full of harrowing events that magazines are putting their money on reassurance. People can get bad news and appeals for pity for free; why would they pay extra at the newsstands? At all events, in a field where some sort of mass venue is essential, many "concerned photographers" find themselves playing to small audiences, devising projects primarily for books, or shifting into the business of celebrity portraiture.
Sebastiao Salgado is an exception. Not only has he been showered with awards, he has also been lionized by museums and widely published in the last few years. In 1991, his work seemed to be everywhere. This is a testament in part to his talent, which is undeniable and impressive, in part to the importance of his subjects and his evident sympathy for them, and in part to a comfortingly old-fashioned esthetic and belief in the goodness of humanity and its capacity to survive. Even his photographs of famine in the Sahel, the drought-plagued region south of the Sahara, generally played up the dignity, the classical grace and resignation of the starving rather than the horrors of their plight. 
 Now "Workers, an Archeology of the Industrial Age: Photography by Sebastiao Salgado" is on view at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through July 11, after which it travels to Louisville, Ky., Iowa City, Dallas and, in 1995, New York). This show, 250 pictures large and sponsored by Professional Imaging, a division of the Eastman Kodak Company, represents six years of travel to approximately 50 locations and arrives with a book with yet more images. An epic amount of photographs for an epic enterprise, it ends up being something of an overdose. Although many of the pictures are exceptional, no photographer in history has taken 250 first-rate photographs.
In the catalogue Salgado, 49, calls this project "a homage to workers, a farewell to a world of manual labor that is slowly disappearing." Manual labor here means everything from sugar-cane harvesting to cigar making, steel and bicycle manufacturing, shipbuilding and shipbreaking (reducing old ships to raw material for re-use). In Philadelphia, "Workers" is next to a wonderful show of Camille Pissarro's late-19th-century cityscapes, which romanticize the industrial-age harbors and crowded cities of France at least as zealously as Salgado romanticizes work and workers, though the painter glories in the signs of the mechanical revolution whereas the photographer less than a century later writes its elegy.
This elegy may be a little early. It is true that the developed nations are entering the post-industrial era and that machines, computers and robots are doing many of the jobs men and women used to do. But as recently as 1989 the International Labor Review reported that manufacturing as a share of total output in Asia was consistently increasing. Where Salgado is excruciatingly on point is in his catalogue introduction: "The developed world produces only for those who can consume -- approximately one-fifth of all people. The remaining four-fifths, who could theoretically benefit from surplus production, have no way of becoming consumers."
Photographs are not particularly good at teaching economics, and Salgado does not really try. Some of the work he pictures is clearly arduous, even dangerous, and many of the workers are obviously poor, undoubtedly overworked, long-suffering and patient, but he seldom addresses their working or living conditions.
His best pictures are both beautiful and haunting, charged with a Latin American sense of drama. (Although he is now based in Paris, he was born and brought up in Brazil and claims this drama as his birthright.) Salgado documents a world where darkness is powerful and invites the sudden effects of light as poetic revelation, smoke-filled shafts of light, nuanced caresses along the edges of form. It is to his credit that he has tried, and managed more often than one might expect, to accommodate his style to the various places and labors he has photographed. For the steel industry in Poland and France he took up machine moderne; for the shipbreakers of Bangladesh he adopted an echoing, almost surreal formality; for canal building in India, a more geometrical concision.
His muscular, black-and-white compositions, frequently concentrated on one strong figure that anchors the secondary objects of attention, sing the rhythmic song of manual labor, the unnatural beauty of machines, the endurance, intensity and struggle of the worker's life. Salgado has a remarkable eye for the human figure as fulcrum, accent or activator of a motley or mechanical scene, plus a sharp instinct for the uses of silhouettes and isolated figures. His pictures dwell on the strange, mutated faces that masks and goggles and coal dust make, with their hints of a charged existence.
Deeply invested in the heroism of anonymous men and women, Salgado has a romantic vision of labor. He seeks out dauntless workers in daunting occupations, as well as proudly confident men wearing rags or slathered with mud. He focuses on single figures subsumed and almost overwhelmed by the materials of their work: a tangle of wool or branches or fishing nets. This response to pattern is strongest in the Boschian pictures of Brazilian gold miners reduced to repetitive parts of some infernal machine as they clamber over the pit in packed formations.
Both the style and the humanism of Salgado's photographs are throwbacks to the 30's. A kind of rhetorical grandness and centripetal force inhere in many of his compositions; they hint of a time when the center held together better than it seems to now. His compositional strategies are bold but not new, and the fact that they fit into some recognizable scheme of things may in itself help explain the breadth of his appeal. Neither post-modern nor alienated, he is a photographer of clear intent and comprehensible means, and he speaks of a universe with humanity at its center. This is familiar, unthreatening, even a relief.
The worker pictures echo a feeling common enough during the Depression that grit and perseverance and innate dignity would ultimately guarantee the survival of the down-and-out. One would like to share his assurance of human nobility, survival and salvation, hedged about though it may be with the difficult facts of life. But in a post-World War II, post-Vietnam era of refugees and homelessness, it is not always easy. Salgado's images are so persistently grand, even grandiloquent, that they overload the scales.
The notion, strong in the 1930's, that the camera can and should elicit active sympathy continues to burn brightly in Salgado's work and elsewhere despite the onslaught of alienation and glitz in photography. It has even outlived the compassion fatigue supposedly induced by an excess of images requiring our sympathy. In fact, the power of images to move the heart and conscience endures no matter how burdened people's eyes and minds are, as pictures of Kurdish refugees and starving Somalians testify. Moral sympathies might just be capacious enough to outlast the unremitting siege of the media.
Some of Salgado's pictures can be specifically credited with provoking powerful responses. His photographs of Cambodian amputees in 1990 in The Independent, with an article appealing for money to manufacture artificial limbs in Cambodia, helped bring in contributions far beyond the amount of the appeal.
What qualities in a photograph can move people to such actions is very unclear. The subject must be the primary mover, but whether the treatment should be artistic (as in Salgado's case) or wrenchingly blunt (as in some pictures of war) is hard to say. Both subject and treatment must reach the wellsprings of horror or compassion but must also leave open the possibility of remedy. Clearly Americans have been greatly stirred by images of the conflict in Bosnia, but solutions are not ready to hand, and the public has not been moved to demand action.
Salgado's worker photographs do not call for action so much as for a change in consciousness. In large numbers, however, his photographs suffer from the insistence of their message. Awkward as it is to complain of too much humanism -- it's a bit like saying your family loved you too much -- Salgado's reverence for downtrodden humanity pulses so doggedly from so many pictures that eventually one could feel preached at, or a trifle disbelieving, or even a little resentful at not being able to muster such noble feelings hundreds of times oneself.
He is the real article. Not a rich man, he gave generously to the Cambodian amputees and donated most of his profits from the Sahel pictures to Medecins Sans Frontieres, the French doctors who worked there. Still, 250 images on the wall, no matter how good many of them are, is a little too much goodness in one place. Everything in moderation . . . even goodness. Even Salgado.

HEADLINE: Step by Step, the State Moves Toward Integration

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
THE new state legislation requiring all towns and cities to join regional discussions on achieving greater racial diversity in their public schools leaves much unstated because of the volatile politics of race.
To win passage in a reluctant General Assembly, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and his Education Commissioner, Vincent L. Ferrandino, had to strip references to race and integration from the legislation and express their intent in the all-purpose euphemism "diversity." Even diversity was left undefined, and no goals for achieving it were stated. 
 Whether towns or cities participate in regional plans involving their schools is up to each community. The only requirement is that they take part in a planning process in "good faith." Good faith, too, is not defined.
The measure, however, does set out general goals, as well as a precise timetable and process for the state's 169 towns and cities to draft plans to meet them.
The legislation, "An Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity," divides Connecticut into 11 regions for drafting "education and community improvement plans." The plans should improve the quality of schools and the performance of students, overcome barriers to educational opportunity and enhance student diversity. Following is an explanation of the bill's main points.
 
Improving Quality
 The bill recommends several ways to improve the quality of schools. Most involve the voluntary transfer of students across municipal boundaries. They include magnet schools, interdistrict or regional schools, school-choice plans and early-childhood education programs.
Barriers to opportunity could be lowered by addressing poverty, unemployment and the lack of housing or transportation, all of which have helped concentrate poor black and Hispanic families in the state's cities. For example, instead of creating a new education program to bring city children into its schools, a suburb could build low-income housing.
Having already recommended several strategies used in desegregation plans, the measure does not suggest ways to enhance diversity. But it notes that diversity includes bilingual instruction for children who need it; in Connecticut, most bilingual students are Puerto Rican. The legislation divides the state into 11 regions, the largest covering 26 small towns in northeastern Connecticut, the smallest encompassing Bridgeport and 7 surrounding towns.
In drawing the regions, legislators grouped the state's major cities, with high enrollments of black and Hispanic children, with their surrounding towns, while trying to respect the boundaries of regional school districts and existing interdistrict programs. But towns and cities are free to form partnerships with communities of their choosing, including those outside their own region.
 
Forming Planning Units
 Planning at the local level will be undertaken by local school boards, which will appoint advisory committees consisting of their municipalities' chief elected official, parents, teachers, administrators as well as representatives of business and civic organizations and the general public.
Planning at the regional level will be undertaken by regional forums, which will appoint advisory committees of parents, administrators and business and civic representatives. A regional forum will consist of the chief elected official of each community in the region, or a designee, and a representative from each community's school board. The forum will also include two teachers who both teach and live in the region, appointed by the heads of the largest local teacher unions within the region. For example, in the Hartford region, the president of the Hartford teachers union will appoint one teacher.
In addition, the forum will have four parents of public school children, one from each of the region's four largest communities, appointed by their local school boards. In an effort to promote diversity, the parents are supposed to reflect the largest racial or ethnic group in their schools. Strictly interpreted, Hartford's school board should appoint a Puerto Rican, West Hartford's a white.
 
Meeting a Timetable
 By Jan. 15, 1994, the Institute of Public Service at the University of Connecticut is to convene regional meetings to present information to help in drafting plans. A key purpose of these meetings is to lay out the aspects of education, equal opportunity and integration that local districts must address to qualify for the legislation's financial incentives.
By April 1, each board and committee is to have studied the needs of their own schools and developed proposals for contributing to the needs of their region, through any of the various interdistrict devices. Each school board is to meet at least once with its community's council or selectmen, and to conduct at least one public hearing.
By April 15, the UConn institute will convene the regional forums and provide technical assistance in developing the regional plans. By Sept. 15, each region is to submit a plan to the state Commissioner of Education, who will have 60 days to review and comment on it.
From Nov. 15 to Nov. 30, each region will conduct at least one public hearing and then submit a final plan to its communities' local legislative bodies and school boards. The state Commissioner will also receive the plan, but approving it is not up to him. Instead, by Dec. 1, the legislative body and school board of each community are to vote. Both groups must approve the plan for a community to accept it. If a majority of communities accepts the plan, it will be approved for the entire region -- as long as that majority also includes a majority of the region's population.
The voting procedure puts the final decision in local hands, while requiring a broad consensus within the region.
In the 13-town New Haven region, for example, New Haven, West Haven and Hamden have a majority of the population, and the largest minority enrollments, but they would need four smaller towns to join them to approve a plan. Similarly, the seven smallest towns could not impose one, because they have less than a fourth of the region's population.
By Jan. 1, 1996, and each year afterward, the Education Commissioner is to report to the General Assembly on the status of the plans and their progress toward improving performance, overcoming barriers to opportunity and promoting diversity.
 
Offering Incentives
 Because the legislation is aimed particularly at improving the quality of city schools with large numbers of poor children, it encourages districts with low overall scores on the state's mastery tests to apply for competitive grants for early-childhood education programs, to reduce class sizes and to institute other academic programs.
It also invites towns and such cities that have formed partnerships, like a magnet school, to apply for competitive grants that would pay for the cost of new schools and for transporting students.
Those grants would be available for the 1995-96 school year, if the General Assembly appropriates money for them in its 1995 session.
 
Enforcing the Goals
 The state Education Commissioner cannot approve or reject a region's plan. Even once a region approves its plan, there is no penalty if a community then refuses to participate.
The Commissioner's power rests largely on his authority to establish the initial guidelines for the regional forums to follow, and to award the grants for school construction and transportation according to how well a group of school districts have met his guidelines' goals.
The Commissioner, Mr. Ferrandino, has said he will make very clear that achieving greater racial diversity is essential for districts that hope to receive grants.
 
Asking Questions
 The legislation provides one penalty: if a town fails "to participate in good faith" in the planning process itself, the state Board of Education can withhold state education funds from it. Will a town be in good faith if its representatives show up for the discussions, or must it also offer a contribution to the plan?
The measure relies on financial incentives to encourage voluntary cooperation between communities, but no funds have been appropriated, and Mr. Ferrandino will not request any until 1995. The bill provides no financial guarantees.
Under the legislation, the state would not spend anything on new programs promoting school integration for nearly three years. A decision in the Sheff v. O'Neill lawsuit, which is seeking a desegregation order for Hartford and its suburbs, is expected long before then.
 
How Integration May Be Achieved
 While the state legislation recently approved by the General Assembly relies on voluntary cooperation between towns and cities to integrate public schools, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Sheff v. O'Neill case have asked a Superior Court judge to order a desegregation plan for Hartford and 21 surrounding towns.
The Sheff case charges that the concentration of poor black and Hispanic children in the city denies them the equal educational opportunity guaranteed by Connecticut's constitution. Final arguments will be heard this summer. In their post-trial brief, the Sheff lawyers asked for a ruling with the following elements:
* A desegregation plan would be drafted by a group of education experts, desegregation experts, demographers, representatives of school boards and superintendents, teachers, parents and community representatives. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the state would review it before submission to the court.
* The plan must cover the entire metropolitan area.
* All communities must participate, and the court may penalize those that do not comply. All standard methods for desegregating schools should be considered, including the mandatory reassignment of students. But the plan may also include some options for parents to choose their children's schools.
* Reducing the isolation of poor and minority children in city schools must be a major goal; the court should set racial-balance goals for every school. The ideal outcome would be one in which no school in the region could be characterized by race, such as "the white school" or "the black school."
* Bilingual education programs must be preserved for all children who need them.
* The quality of education in Hartford schools must be improved.
* Housing must be part of the plan. Schools are segregated because communities are segregated.
* Timetables must be strictly enforced. "Unless rapid deadlines are set, racial polarization can also begin to occur," the brief states. A plan could be developed within six months.
* A group of independent experts must assess the plan and then monitor its results to be sure that academic progress is being achieved. School districts need court approval to close schools, build new ones, redraw attendance zones, or make other changes that could affect the plan's goals.

HEADLINE: Behind SUNY's Choice for New President

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
THE lengthy and open process that led to the appointment here last month of Bill Lacy as the next president of the State University of New York at Purchase caused a serious rift between nearly half the members of the presidential search committee and the College Council, the college's board of trustees, who are legally entrusted with such appointments.
At issue was not so much the council's choice of Mr. Lacy, a former president of Cooper Union in Manhattan and the American Academy in Rome, but its dealings with the search committee itself, an advisory group representing all segments of the college. 
 Everyone involved in the controversy has praised Mr. Lacy, an architect and experienced administrator, but many on the 4,000-student campus are reluctant to discuss the dispute, which one dean said should not be allowed to overshadow the "fireworks, pride and celebration" appropriate to the new president's arrival here next month, when the current president, Dr. Sheldon N. Grebstein, retires. Some long-time faculty members, however, are not ready to let the matter drop.
 
First Choice Passed Over
 They continued to ask why the council disregarded guidelines regarding the search process, which are spelled out in university bylaws.
The trouble began when the council, a 7-member group appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, passed over the first choice of the 16-member search committee, Stanley Fish, a literary scholar and professor at Duke University in North Carolina, and appointed Mr. Lacy, the committee's second choice, as president. The committee had indicated its preference in a straw vote of 9 to 2, from which the four council members on the search committee and one faculty member abstained.
Dr. Peter F. Bell, an associate professor of economics and a member of the search committee, said the decision had taken search committee members by surprise because the council members on the committee had at no time indicated that they would vote for Mr. Lacy.
 
Consensus 'Should Be Sought'
 Yet, said Dr. Bell, a faculty member for 21 years, the guidelines provided to the search committee by the office of the Chancellor of the state university system, Dr. D. Bruce Johnstone, stated that "consensus, or near consensus, both within the council and between the council and the search committee, should be sought and expected."
The day after the appointment, eight members of the committee wrote a letter to Dr. Johnstone, accusing the college council of violating "the spirit, if not the letter, of the search process." The letter said that "the council's action showed a complete disregard for virtually all of the available evidence, most especially the recommendations and wishes of a preponderance of the college community." Those search committee members who said they preferred Mr. Fish represented the administration, the College of Letters and Science, the alumni group, the student body and the professional staff, Dr. Bell said. Two representatives of the arts faculty favored Mr. Lacy.
 
'Shock and Disbelief'
 In a scathing reply, which search committee members said further astonished them, Dr. Johnstone said he objected to such words in the letter as "outrage," and "shock and disbelief" and used some extreme language of his own. In a memorandum dated May 21, which was sent to the search committee, the college council and the 16 trustees of the State University system, he called the committee's letter "dishonest," "violent" and "offensive" and asked for an apology.
The letter is "destructive of the kind of collegial spirit that Purchase needs at this time to turn itself around after the dreadful budget cuts imposed by the state," he wrote.
In a telephone interview, Dr. Johnstone said the memorandum had been intemperate and atypical of him. "I don't usually get angry," he said, calling the committee's complaint "patent nonsense."
Richard Maass, president of the Purchase College Council and a member of the search committee, said that in voting to rank the candidates the advisory group had misunderstood its role. "It was a search committee, not a selection committee," he said.
 
'Insisted on a Straw Vote'
 He said that the council members of the search committee had asked the other committee members not to rank the candidates in order of preference but that "they insisted on a straw vote." He and the other council members abstained from voting, he said, because "it would have fixed our position" when the college council met the next night to make its decision. "We felt we should start with the two names fresh," Mr. Maass said. The college council unanimously voted for Mr. Lacy.
But Gari Laguardia, chairman of the college's humanities division and a member of the search committee, said there had been "an explicit understanding from the college council members that we'd act as a unit, and that they would represent the deliberations of the search committee as their own." He said the committee had worked harmoniously for months, sifting through an initial 137 candidates for the $105,000-a-year job, until many members began to show a strong preference for Mr. Fish of Duke University.
 
'They Should Have Discussed It'
 At that point, Dr. Laguardia said, the four council members began to withhold their opinions and gave no indication that they favored Mr. Lacy. "It was quite legitimate not to want to rank the candidates or to feel Bill Lacy was preferable," Dr. Laguardia said. "But if they disagreed with what we felt, they should have discussed it with us." The problem, he added, was "less the different view on No. 1 than that they didn't argue for that view within the venue they had agreed on. If you don't give serious weight to a search committee, then don't have one."
Dr. Laguardia and Dr. Bell said that while Mr. Lacy was a solid candidate, with impressive experience in administration and fund-raising, Mr. Fish was the kind of exciting intellectual who could ignite the disparate elements of the college -- a campus Dr. Bell described as "always straining to realize itself."
The controversy also reflects the historical tension here between the School of the Arts and the College of Letters and Science. While the college's mission as the visual and performing arts center of the State University system is well known, the College of Letters and Science is larger, and some say its achievements are less heralded.
Toward the end of the search, which began after Dr. Grebstein announced his retirement last summer, five candidates each spent two days on the campus here, meeting with faculty and student groups, deans and others. Of those, three candidates were asked back for a third visit. "All the finalists were exposed to as much scrutiny as possible," Dr. Laguardia said.
 
Overwhelming Preference Is Cited
 Members of the arts faculty said they were pleased with the choice of Mr. Lacy, who serves as executive director of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Joan Potter, a professor in the theater division and a member of the search committee, said, "The overwhelming preference of the campus was for the man we got." She added that she felt it was "ungracious and unwise to start a new president off with this kind of dark cloud."
Some, like Dr. Alfred N. Hunt, dean of the College of Letters and Science, said that a more diplomatic handling of the appointment could have prevented the furor. "All it would have taken," Dr. Hunt said, "would have been for the council to call in the committee after it had made its decision. Everyone was not as open as they should have been -- there is a sense of ingenuousness."
Dr. Laguardia said that as of last Thursday the college council still had offered no explanation of its vote to the search committee. Mr. Lacy, however, did meet with the committee's disgruntled members and impressed them with what Dr. Laguardia called his "grace and maturity" under the circumstances.
"It was a nice meeting," Dr. Laguardia said. "Clearly, he's ready to heal and move forward."

Poor Women, Rich Dreams

BYLINE: By Veronica Byrd

 BODY:
WHEN Donna Nicolardi, a former public school teacher, applied for a Small Business Administration loan to start a business, she was asked for a five-year projection. "They wanted to see a business plan, but I did not know how to do one," Ms. Nicolardi said. "When I contacted companies to do the plan, they wanted more money than I had."
But now, thanks to a 14-month course for unemployed and low-income women, Ms. Nicolardi, 40, will get her chance. She hopes to master the basics of business ownership and make a go of her company, A+ Kidlings Inc., which specializes in educational books and games and toys that "help children learn moral lessons and self-esteem." 
 "Now we are learning how to do a business plan at no cost," she said.
For the entrepreneurial dreamer, owning and operating a business is daunting enough, but for the 35 women enrolled in the new program, sponsored by the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation, the dream of business ownership is coupled with another daily challenge: survival.
Most of the women in the program, called New Directions, run a household. Many receive public assistance, and some must deal with inner-city strife, health problems or abusive relationships.
Rosalind S. Paaswell, president of the corporation, said there were more than 1,000 inquiries and 400 applications for the 35 slots in the New Directions course, which held its first weekly class in January. She said the program was the first of its kind.
"A lot of these women have decided that because of the constraints of traditional employment, they want to be entrepreneurs," Ms. Paaswell said. Most entrepreneurs fail -- not because they don't have a good product or idea but because they don't know about business, she added. "They must understand what it is to put together a business plan, how to identify a market, how to negotiate a sale or a contract, whether their company will be a sole proprietorship or partnership."
Most women in the program have business ideas that don't require much capital: cleaning service, real estate management, video production, jewelry manufacturing, floral arranging, accounting and consulting.
Since the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation was founded in 1976, more than 20,000 women have entered its doors to hone their knowledge of business plans, advertising and public relations, accounting and product development. But before the New Directions program, most of its clients are more educated and savvy about business. And they pay for their courses, whereas the New Directions students do not.
Elisa Moore, program director at the organization, said New Directions was conceived to address the problems caused by technological changes, a shrinking job market and "the difficulties women face in everyday life, whether they are single mothers, public-assistance recipients or mothers who are primary caretakers and would be better off with a home-based business."

THE City of New York contributed $200,000 to the program through its share of a Federally financed job training program. Corporate donors -- Bankers Trust, the A.T.& T. Foundation, Morgan Stanley, Morgan Guaranty and Citibank -- contributed $130,000. In addition, all New Directions courses are taught by volunteers.
Patricia Schaefer, vice president at Morgan Stanley, said the program is unique in that it offers an opportunity for "those who do have the skills and resources to teach those who do not."
Josephine Nieves, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Employment, said her office was interested in expanding the usual training programs offered to include entrepreneurial training.
"We are very interested in self-sufficiency and economic independence for disadvantaged people," she said. "And the best way of providing that is for people to own their own businesses."
The department finances similar programs for veterans, youths and Asian immigrants.
Topics in the New Directions program include writing a business plan, financial planning, defining and targeting a market, business law and professional conduct.
Additional services, like courses on stress and time management, goal setting and presenting a businesslike appearance , are provided by the Women's Center for Education and Career Advancement, an organization that offers training in business and personal skills.
Plans are in the works to organize a lending club where members of the program can pool resources and lend small amounts to each other.
"We're very enthusiastic and optimistic," Commissioner Nieves added. "If this shows any degree of success, we would like to expand funding of these types of programs."
 
Training for New Opportunities
 WHITE males will account for only 11 percent of the additions to the work force between 1990 and 2005, according to the Department of Labor. The rest will come from a diverse pool: members of racial minority groups, immigrants and women.
When the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation was founded in 1976, only 4.6 percent of small businesses in the United States were owned and operated by women. In 1987 that number had jumped to 30 percent, and Labor Department officials estimate it could reach 50 percent by the year 2000.
With so many new opportunities opening to women, the women's organization, a private nonprofit corporation, has found itself more in demand than ever. Since 1976 it has offered dozens of courses in every facet of business ownership to more than 20,000 would-be entrepreneurs. Course topics include public relations and advertising, bookkeeping and accounting, banking and finance, business law, personnel management, insurance, quality control, distribution, the art of negotiation, identifying and reaching a target market, planning meetings and finding sources of capital..
The organization also offers individual business counseling and consulting by telephone and at its offices in New York, Washington and Los Angeles.
Each year the company holds an annual conference. Past speakers have included Diane Sawyer, Oprah Winfrey, Georgette Mosbacher and Elizabeth Dole.

Telmex Rides a Roller Coaster

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
MEXICO'S stock market, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, has grown in sophistication and importance recently, but one stock dominates it -- Telefonos de Mexico.
Telmex is also one of the most heavily traded New York Stock Exchange issues. And in the past two weeks, a few stray words by a Telmex executive in New York about disappointing earnings ignited a selloff in both markets, proving that while all eyes at the Bolsa may be on the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, company news still moves markets, especially if it's made by Telmex. 
 In the last two weeks, Telmex stock has been on a roller coaster. At one point, Telmex shares in Mexico lost 20 percent of their value, a plunge that pushed the Bolsa index close to the 1,550 level, which many investors see as a threshold beyond which real trouble lies. Last Monday in New York, Telmex shares hit a new 52-week low to close at $45.
By last Tuesday, investors looking for bargains revived prices in Mexico. On Friday, the stock had gained a bit to close at $46 on the Big Board.
John F. H. Purcell, director of emerging-markets research at Salomon Brothers, is among those anaylsts who maintain that despite the sudden drops, Telmex remains a solid bet that will become more valuable if the Nafta is passed, which both Salomon and Lehmann Brothers now rate as an 85 percent probability. "There are a lot of jitters in the market right now," said Mr. Purcell. "But we're looking at the long-term perspective, and after the end of the year Telmex should continue to do well."
But Christopher Whalen, editor of The Mexico Report, a newsletter on Mexican business, saw the past two weeks as a sign that Telmex's salad days of huge earnings and virtually unlimited growth are over. Even though millions of shares were sold in the last week, he believes the biggest investors are now eager to get out.
It's easy to see what got investors interested in the first place. The Mexican Government sold its controlling stake in 1990 as part of its larger plan to privatize many Government-run businesses. The winning bid of $1.76 billion came from a consortium of Southwestern Bell, France Telecom and Grupo Carso, a diversified Mexican company that owns restaurants and a cigarette manufacturing operation among other concerns.
What they got was a monopoly -- at least until 1996, when the Government will allow competitors -- and an unfilled demand for basic phone service. Even today, Mexico has only 7.4 million phone lines for a population of over 80 million.
What caused the early June rout of Telmex? The company's chief financial officer, Adolfo Cerezo, was in New York on June 2 to attend an investor luncheon at Lehman Brothers and a conference on Latin American markets at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Analysts who heard Mr. Cerezo at the private luncheon said he spoke about Telmex's second-quarter performance. "What he said essentially was that the second quarter was not going to be a barn burner but that the full-year story is still on track," said one analyst who attended the luncheon and who spoke on condition of anonymity because Telmex has not commented on Mr. Cerezo's remarks.
Later, at the conference, Mr. Cerezo again spoke about his company's performance. By then word was spreading that Telmex's second quarter would match its disappointing first quarter, which showed earnings of $1.23 per share, far below expectations of about $1.37 a share.
That day on the New York Stock Exchange, Telmex American Depositary Shares dropped 62.5 cents to close at $47.75 on active volume of 2.7 million shares. On the following day, volume soared to 6.9 million shares, and the price dropped an additional $1.50, closing at $46.25.
Mr. Cerezo's reported statements, or "indiscretions," as the Mexican newspapers called them, made their way to Mexico by Thursday and prompted trading of nearly 40 million shares, half the value of the Bolsa's trading that day.
Mexican investors were furious, and a committee of the Mexican Association of Brokerage Houses complained to Telmex that critical financial information had been given to American investors first.
Company officials tried to set the record straight. They explained that foreign-exchange losses on the company's yen-denominated debt in the first quarter would continue in the second because of the strengthening yen and weak dollar. They also said that, while Telmex was still growing, the rate of growth had eased, partly because the Mexican economy had slowed.
Still unexplained to the satisfaction of some American analysts, however, was a smaller-than-expected increase in long-distance calling volume and a 6 percent drop in long-distance revenues, as opposed to the 30 percent increase in volume and 5 percent increase in revenues that had been expected.
Jonathan E. Heath, chief economist for Macro Asesoria Economica, a private consulting firm here, said that Mexican investors were already irked by Telmex because it said it would repurchase $300 million in stock but then pulled back.
Last Wednesday, after Telmex shares hit a new low in New York, Telmex began a modest repurchase of 1.5 million series L shares worth $3.4 million, and pledged that the repurchases would continue.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
If Business Is Better, What About 3M?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IF a weak economy is bad for a stock, why is it good for the stock market?
That puzzler reasserted itself when the stock market turned around and began to rise late last week, on the heels of a surprising announcement from one of the economy's most trusted bellwethers, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. 
 The disclosure by 3M that its sales were slowing -- and that it was getting less for the products it was selling -- confounded those who believe the economy's slow growth in the first quarter was a temporary aberration. If one assumes 3M is not simply engaging in that old corporate habit of blaming the economy when things go bad, the news is significant simply because 3M is a supplier to so many industries. And it is important that the slowdown in sales growth came in the domestic market. This weakness reflects something more than slow European economies. As Alex Henderson of Prudential Securities noted, 3M has a history of leading the economy by about three months, suggesting that growth is likely to slow.
So why did that not bother the entire stock market? The positive way of looking at the news is that inflation is not likely to become a big problem in the face of such slack demand. Nor is there much chance the Federal Reserve will defy the Clinton Administration and try to raise interest rates. If inflation and higher interest rates have been the things feared most, then it stands to reason that 3M's announcement was good news for the stock market. Sure enough, on Thursday the Dow's drop of 20 points was caused by 3M. The average of the other 29 stocks was up a bit. And the market gained a bit more on Friday.
Whatever the stock market view, the 3M announcement can be viewed as merely the latest indication that what strength there has been in the economy has not spread widely, particularly in the manufacturing companies that are 3M's prime customers. The latest Commerce Department survey shows that virtually all industries have scaled back their capital spending plans, even autos and steel, which have been viewed as doing quite well. The Labor Department figures that since employment bottomed in February 1992 the economy has added 1.9 million jobs over all. But it is government and services that have seen the rise. There are 328,000 fewer people employed in manufacturing, where employment is at the lowest level in decades.
In this country, as in Britain, there has been an assumption that things will get better, eventually. The public's doubt about that can be seen in plummeting public opinion polls for both President Clinton and Prime Minister John Major. Suddenly, it appears that no one has a good word to say about either one of them, particularly in economic matters. But neither stock market is tumbling.
Investors remain ready to punish companies that suffer from the weak economy. But over all, the investor view of the future is a lot more rosy than the headlines would suggest.

HEADLINE: Labor Draws the Line in Decatur

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill.

 BODY:
UNTIL the resistance began at the Caterpillar plant here, Lance Vaughan first installed a set of small hydraulic hoses on the huge off-highway trucks that he helps to assemble, and then a big outside hose. Now he installs the big one first, and reaches awkwardly around it to attach the others, losing production time in the process.
This is not sabotage. The instructions furnished by Caterpillar's engineers specify the inefficient procedure, Mr. Vaughan says. Normally, he ignores such instructions and makes a note to himself to tell the engineers to fix the mistake. Now, he no longer speaks up. Withholding initiative, he works "to the rules" furnished by the company. 
 "I used to give the engineers ideas," said Mr. Vaughan, who is 38 and has worked at Caterpillar for nearly 20 years. "We showed them how to eliminate some hose clips and save money. And I recommended larger bolts that made assembly easier and faster, and were less likely to come loose."
Mr. Vaughan's behavior is being multiplied hundreds of times in Decatur, interviews with workers show. A slowdown is taking place not only at Caterpillar, but also at the A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company, whose corn-processing operation spreads like a refinery over 400 acres near the center of Decatur, turning out soft-drink sweeteners, corn oil and other products.
At both companies, tough new work conditions -- including reduced seniority rights and, at Staley, 12-hour workdays -- were imposed after an impasse in contract negotiations. In response, union workers like Mr. Vaughan at Caterpillar and Patricia Zilz at Staley are trying to slow production and thus force the companies back to the bargaining table. Ms. Zilz works with three other waste-water analysts who now drive a truck around the vast plant collecting water samples at 15 miles per hour, the company speed limit, rather than the 25 miles per hour or more that got the job done faster in the past.
 
'In-Plant' Strategy
 That sort of resistance is making this city, set among fields of corn and soybeans 175 miles south of Chicago, the most significant battleground to date for a novel union tactic: Rather than strike, and risk losing jobs to outsiders hired to replace them, the nearly 2,500 union members at Caterpillar and Staley are staying on the job and trying what they call an "in-plant strategy." They are testing, in effect, the widely held proposition that in today's competitive world, no company saddled with employees who carry out their tasks only routinely, and without initiative, can make money for long.
So far, the battle is inconclusive. What is clear, though, is that a lot is at stake in Decatur. Reflecting the importance of in-plant resistance, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has endorsed the strategy. If the unions win, labor stands to regain some of the bargaining power it lost in 1981, when the nation's air traffic controllers struck and President Reagan replaced them en masse. And the outcome could also have implications for employers and workers across the nation in nonunionized workplaces.
Citing the harsh realities of a weak economy and global competition, employers have been asking more from workers -- who have given in, fearful they might otherwise lose their jobs. But at some point, say labor economists and others who study the workplace, management starts to lose something in worker loyalty, initiative and cooperation for all that it might gain in lower labor costs and more flexible work rules. Getting both sides to agree on where that point is could be the big labor-management challenge of the early 90's -- with a miscalculation likely to be costly.
"Workers almost always see a way to do a job better," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, "and passing up these opportunities in time becomes damaging for companies and the economy."
In a union setting, like the one here, the resistance to givebacks is organized and the workers have the benefit of union safety nets that protect against job loss. In a nonunion setting, such as an office or college campus, the resistance is amorphous but often just as deeply felt.
"If you have a professor who is asked to handle 400 students instead of 100 -- and that is happening regularly -- she does it, because she knows that if she does not, she can be replaced by any of the several hundred people who have applied for her job," said Katherine Newman, a Columbia University anthropologist.
Unable to openly resist, as the unionized workers at Caterpillar and Staley can, the protest becomes an accommodation, Professor Newman said -- one in which the teacher "creates an inefficiency somewhere else." In this sort of case, she said, a teacher "substitutes multiple-choice tests for essay assignments, although knowing that multiple-choice tests are a terrible way to prepare students to be critical thinkers."
 
Smiles and Hellos
 Even in Decatur, the resistance by Mr. Vaughan and others is virtually invisible. Walking among the huge trucks and partly assembled yellow road graders also made here, Gary Stroup, the plant manager, greets workers with ostentatious warmth, and they respond with smiles and hellos -- as if he and they are friends rather than opponents in a tense and potentially historic battle.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Stroup insists that the battle is not even being fought. "This is Middle America," he said. For a union "to come and ask these people not to do their jobs fully is to go against their work ethic and their moral fiber."
But the union is doing just that, said Larry G. Solomon, president of the United Auto Workers local here that represents Caterpillar employees. "Most of us have been taught the work ethic, but when we must fight, we can put that work ethic in neutral," Mr. Solomon said.
Morris Delbridge, who machines axles at Caterpillar, agrees. When his equipment broke down in the past, he called in the repairman himself and helped diagnose the trouble. Now, he leaves all that to the foreman. And Gregory Peck at Staley says he has considerable control over the speed at which he produces a corn-based ingredient for beer, but only increases the speed now when a foreman specifically tells him to do so.
The resistance appears to be gradually reducing efficiency at both Caterpillar and Staley, although the companies deny union claims that slower production has caused a delay in the filling of customer orders.
"We continue to grind corn and to operate the plant in a normal fashion," said J. Patrick Mohan, an executive vice president at Staley. "What we are losing is moving toward greater productivity, and that is costly."
Without an "engaged" work force, Mr. Mohan adds, Staley will have difficulty getting the return on the investment here to an acceptable annual rate of 15 percent or more from the present 10 percent average.
The resistance getting tested here could be affected by what is happening in Washington. President Clinton is trying to restore some of the power to strike, once again making a strike a viable alternative to a slowdown. A bill that would outlaw the hiring of permanent replacements for strikers has been sent to the floors of the House and Senate, and the House might act this week. The chances of final approval are uncertain, given the fierce opposition of corporate America.
"That bill puts too much power in the hands of the unions and of labor," said Gerald Flaherty, vice president for human resources at Caterpillar.
 
Wages Still High
 For the moment, the power is not there. And Caterpillar and Staley, having failed to win union agreement to their proposals, have imposed them unilaterally, calling their actions "implemented contracts." The companies argue that despite the changes they made, benefits and pay -- averaging $18 an hour at Caterpillar and $13 at Staley -- are still very high for the Midwest, and their workers are fortunate to have these jobs.
Realizing this, the workers will eventually give up their resistance, the companies say, overruling their unions in the process: the U.A.W. at Caterpillar and the Allied Industrial Workers of America at Staley.
Maybe. What the companies overlook, say the unions, is that some of the new rules that were imposed are wreaking havoc on workers' lives. Staley, for example, has moved its production workers to 12-hour shifts, with 3 one week and 4 the next, from 8-hour shifts, 5 days a week.
That has angered many, including Ms. Zilz, the waste-water analyst. "I was asked the other day to stay over an extra four hours and I worked 16 hours and I got no overtime for it because I did not manage to accumulate more than 40 hours in that particular week," she said. But with three children at home, Ms. Zilz, 46, had never sought much overtime. What really angers her, she says, is that she is cut off from her children by the longer shifts. "I cannot be a Girl Scout leader anymore, and I can't participate in a carpool," she said.
The slowdown at Caterpillar began last spring, after the U.A.W. called off a five-month strike, mostly at plants in Illinois, because Caterpillar was lining up replacement workers. Now the in-plant resistance involves nearly 15,000 workers at Caterpillar's various plants, including the 1,700 in Decatur, a city of 86,000 where the company is the largest employer.
Local 837 of the Allied Industrial Workers resorted to the strategy last fall for the 780 Staley employees that it represents here. The resistance began after an old contract expired and the company -- purchased in 1988 by Tate & Lyle P.L.C., a British multinational -- insisted that the plant was too costly and that pay and work rules be brought in line with similar facilities elsewhere. An impasse resulted.
 
Gumming Up the Works
 The worker resistance here is actually an amalgam of two proven labor tactics. One was the sitdown strike, made famous in the Depression; the other was the brief, informal slowdown, used for decades to protest a firing or other specific grievance.
"In the 1930's, when people tried to strike and were fired, there was a huge pool of unemployed people available to replace them," said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego. "So they did sitdown strikes instead. The U.A.W. even organized the auto industry this way. The in-plant strategy is essentially a walking-around sitdown strike that gums up production without halting it."
But while labor responded enthusiastically to the sitdown strikes of the 30's, the on-the-job resistance today is harder to sustain. For one thing, Caterpillar and Staley, although insisting they have no plans to move their operations to areas of cheaper labor elsewhere, nevertheless hold out that possibility if they fail in the struggle with their unions. For Staley, there is also talk of a shutdown: it recently gave 60 days' notice that it might close the corn oil section of its plant here, eliminating 92 jobs.
But Caterpillar is trying to win over the workers by giving as well as taking. While imposing cutbacks in such things as seniority rights and future staffing levels, it has also promised six years of job security for current workers. That promise, if fulfilled, would give most hourly employees, whose average age is 48, enough years to retire on full pensions. And pensions are also to go up.
"Most of our employees are trying to do a good job," said Mr. Flaherty, the human resources executive, in effect claiming that the resistance is not drawing many adherents.
Mr. Vaughan says that he almost fell into this category. Working as an assembler on the overnight shift, he farms 600 rented acres during the day, providing back-up income during strikes, Mr. Vaughan says, but leaving little time for union activity.
"I never got involved before, but now I have to," he said. "You can't straddle the fence when there isn't a contract that we have signed and they can't change. That is stressful. My kids will be in college in four years and what do I tell them, that I have job security for six? Maybe I do."
 
Bringing In Advisers
 With so much at stake, the Allied Industrial Workers has sought help from Ray Rogers, a New York consultant known for putting labor disputes into the public spotlight and thus increasing the pressure on management to settle. Already, two Midwestern banks have removed Staley executives from their boards after Mr. Rogers campaigned to get unions to withdraw deposits from the banks.
The local has also brought in Jerry Tucker, a former U.A.W. official and an early proponent of the in-plant resistance under way here. At weekly meetings at the local's union hall -- meetings that draw more than 300 Staley workers, nearly half the hourly staff -- Mr. Tucker offers encouragement and listens to testimonials.
The plant is falling behind in filling an order from Miller Beer, one worker reports. And another, Michael Banning, whose operation produces corn-based additives for food products, reads from a notice posted by a supervisor. "I am asking everyone to cooperate and get the production in this building back to what you've demonstrated in the past," it says.
Mr. Tucker asks about grievances. They are an effective way, he says, of keeping managers and workers from their jobs while dealing with complaints. And then, answering questions, he explains ways to file them, particularly by groups of workers.
Over at Caterpillar, Mr. Stroup, the plant manager, shares Mr. Tucker's view that grievances can hurt. He judges the effectiveness of the resistance in part by the number of grievances. They are down at Caterpillar, Mr. Stroup says -- and Mr. Solomon, the U.A.W. local president, does not challenge that assessment.
"We could do a lot better job gathering information about what is working and what isn't," Mr. Solomon said, noting that the U.A.W., unlike Allied, does not schedule weekly rank-and-file meetings.
Whatever the differences in strategy between the two unions, they are certainly in agreement on the goal. Having already called off a strike at Caterpillar, U.A.W. officials say they can't -- and won't -- call off their new form of resistance. "No worker, not even one on layoff, has ever suggested that we accept their contract offer," said Bill Casstevens, the U.A.W.'s secretary-treasurer.
 
Union Foes: Weak Demand, Automation
 THE weak national economy is turning out to be a blessing of sorts for Caterpillar Inc. and the A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company. Orders are off; that's not good. But the worker slowdowns at the two companies have to cut more deeply into production if the companies are to feel the pain.
Caterpillar, which makes graders, loaders and off-highway trucks at its Decatur plant, illustrates the problem. High volume in boom times is 22 units a day, versus a current 15 or 16. "We could get to 22 now if we had to," said Gary Stroup, the plant manager, insisting that the slowdown has failed. "But we don't have to."
The Allied Industrial Workers of America, Local 837, has a similar problem at Staley. The company does not have to run its Decatur plant flat-out to fill its orders, said J. Patrick Mohan, an executive vice president. "In a weak economy, it is harder for the union to make an impact on production."
Automation is another obstacle complicating the efforts of the United Auto Workers to slow production sufficiently to force Caterpillar to negotiate. Motor graders made here used to move down assembly lines. To keep the lines moving, even at slow speed, required a full staff.
Now the graders are assembled in niches along an open "highway." After a section is installed in one niche, a robotic cart carries the grader to another niche for further assembly.
"The highway requires fewer people because you don't have to keep the whole line going," Mr. Stroup said, explaining not only why a slowdown is harder to bring off, but also why employment at the plant here has declined to 2,700 people from 4,400 in the late 1980's.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Shopping Lessons From (Gasp!) the Air Force

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
FOR anyone familiar with the horror stories of Air Force procurement -- $500 ashtrays, $700 toilet seats and $1,000 hammers -- it was easy to be apprehensive when the service announced in 1991 that it was letting out a contract covering as many as 300,000 advanced personal computers.
Now, more than two years after the Air Force opened its Desktop IV competition with a vow that the contract would be a model for streamlined high-technology procurement, the first batch of computers is almost ready for delivery. 
 The good news is that the Air Force -- and thus the public -- actually got a good deal on the $724 million, three-year contract, under which the whole Defense Department may buy equipment. This despite all the delays caused by bureaucratic fiat and red tape, repeated protests from losing bidders, and some bombast from pork-barrel politicians. Instead of paying premium prices for outdated technology, the military is getting top-quality commercial systems at bargain prices.
And the Desktop IV experience may even offer some lessons for private-sector businesses.
"Let's face it, if corporations bought computers the same way," said Robert A. Dornan, senior vice president of Federal Sources Inc., "our competitiveness in the world economy would crumble."
"But in the long run," Mr. Dornan hastened to add, "Desktop IV was a significant success. The Air Force tried a lot of new things."
"Instead of demanding detailed, nitpicky stuff, it called for open specifications," continued Mr. Dornan, whose consulting firm, based in McLean, Va., specialized in government technology contracts. "Instead of low price, it looked for best value. It used electronic bulletin boards for bidding. And what it wound up with was not quite state of the art, but pretty darned close."
Two companies, the Zenith Data Systems Corporation of Buffalo Grove, Ill., and Government Technology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Va., will share the contract. What they won, essentially, is a three-year hunting license to sell personal computers, peripherals and software to various Defense Department and civilian agencies, all under the Air Force umbrella contract.
Zenith Data, a subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, appears to have the best chances for bagging Government sales. Unlike most of the original bidders, it proposed computers based on the Intel Corporation's i486 microprocessors. That was a bold step at the time, in May 1991 when the i486 was relatively new, but it paid off as the contract dragged on.
Government Technology was added to the award after several protesters, including Electronic Data Systems, Apple Computer and the Compuadd Corporation, cried foul over the Air Force's decision to give the contract solely to Zenith Data.
Government Technology originally bid in the summer of 1991, including 386- and i486-based computers made by Everex Systems Inc., which has since filed for bankruptcy protection. And while 386-based PC's were popular in 1991, today they are considered outdated. Last week, in a highly unusual step, Government Technology asked for permission to revamp its bid, even before the first computers were shipped.
"Under the terms of the contract, we are allowed to refresh the technology periodically, and we, as did Zenith, plan to take advantage of that," said Deborah M. Tucker, the company's vice president for corporate communications. She declined to say what changes the company wanted to make, but the newspaper Federal Computer Week reported that Government Technology is scrambling to find a PC maker other than Everex. It is also likely that the 386-based offerings will be abandoned. An Air Force decision on the proposed modifications is expected this month.
Compuadd, along with Sysorex Information Systems Inc. of Falls Church, Va., was the original contract winner. But after protests from losing companies, the Air Force acknowledged that its Standard Systems Center at Gunter Air Force Base, Ala., in its haste to award the contract under a new "fast track" procurement plan, had disqualified all the other bidders on technical grounds -- reportedly for errors as simple as filling out forms incorrectly.
The Air Force was forced to cancel the contract in January 1992 by the the General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals and then reopened the bidding. In September, Zenith Data was notified that it was the sole winner.
Electronic Data Systems, a General Motors subsidiary, led the next round of protests, complaining that Zenith Data's bid had violated the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. That act requires companies to "substantially alter" components purchased from designated foreign countries before they can be sold as finished products to the Government. Although Zenith Data assembled its monitors in the United States, the protestors said, it technically violated the 1979 act. Zenith Data denied the assertion.
E.D.S., of Dallas, and Compuadd, of Austin, enlisted the aid of the formidable Texas congressional delegation, including Representative J. J. Pickle and Senator Lloyd H. Bentsen, now Treasury Secretary. The Texans argued that because Zenith Data had been sold to a French company, and because the computers were to be used by the military, awarding the contract to Zenith Data posed a national security risk.
Zenith responded that it had supplied the military with computers used in the Persian Gulf war and had sold more than 500,000 computers to the Government in previous contracts. It also noted that E.D.S. was selling Taiwanese monitors to the Government under another contract. Even so, an administrative law judge at the G.S.A.'s Board of Contract Appeals upheld the protests.

 Then, last month, E.D.S. and the other protesters dropped their appeals. (Zenith Data acknowledged it had reached a financial agreement with E.D.S., the terms of which were not disclosed.) Government Technology was added as a second supplier.
Zenith Data recently disclosed details of its Desktop IV bid, which show that the military gets to go shopping at bargain prices. The computers involved are virtually the same as those available to anyone else, but the volume discounts are hefty.
For example, one Zenith Data computer, to which the Air Force has given the catchy designation CLIN 0003AB, has these specifications:
An Intel i486DX/33 microprocessor with an upgrade socket for a faster i486 chip, a 400-megabyte hard disk drive, 8 megabytes of system memory, 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch diskette drives, keyboard, mouse, four 16-bit expansion slots, 1 megabyte of video RAM for superior graphics performance, built-in Ethernet networking connectors and a 14-inch multi frequency, non-interlaced color monitor with Super VGA graphics and local-bus video.
It comes with a suite of Microsoft software: DOS, Windows, Word for Windows, Excel and Powerpoint, plus Polaris Packrat (a personal information manager) and software for connecting to Unix systems, plus a promise of free software upgrades for the life of the contract. The computer is backed by three years of free, worldwide, on-site service and round-the-clock toll-free telephone technical support, seven days a week.
Price: $2,330.
According to Zenith Data's Z-Direct sales catalogue, the public can get a Z-Station 433Dh computer for $2,599. It, too, has an i486DX/33 chip and upgrade socket, built-in networking and a Super VGA monitor. But it also has only 4MB of system memory, a 200-MB hard disk drive and a single diskette drive. Forget the $1,000 worth of application software and upgrades offered with CLIN 0003AB, and lop two years off the on-site service contract.
So what are the lessons for businesses?
First, it helps to buy in volume, insisting on discounts. Also, "Insist on transparent upgrade capabilities," suggested Robert B. Costello, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Procurement in the Reagan Administration, now a private consultant.

 Instead of writing 100-page specifications that spell out everything down to the type of processor and the number of screws on the computer case -- as the Air Force used to do -- consider an open search for the best value. Zenith Data's machines cost more than the 386's proposed by others, but they provide more power, a longer life span, extra software and service and support.
In short, don't be fixated on low cost. "Sure, you can choose a computer that costs $100 less, but that $100 can evaporate in one afternoon when a service technician comes to fix something," Mr. Dornan said.

HEADLINE: 'Little Italy' in South America: Colombia's Rising Leather Industry

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
SAY "Colombian exports" and most people will think of cocaine or coffee -- or books, bananas and oil. Lately, though, without fanfare, finely tooled Italian-style leather belts and bags have been added to the list.
In fact, with labor costs one-fifth those in Italy, Colombia is becoming South America's "Little Italy." It is pouring money into machinery and training to offer leather goods on the world market at half the price charged by Italian manufacturers. 
 Even the Italians are giving Colombian leather high marks for quality. After fingering soft purses and portfolios, and inspecting bags and briefcases, an Italian visitor here confessed: "I was quite surprised -- some of the workmanship is at the Italian level."
The visitor was not an idle shopper. He is Arturo Senserini, president of the Italian Association of Leather Manufacturers.
"Colombian handbags are now on the same level as France and Italy," added Giusseppe L. Landi, an Italian industrial economist who is providing technical advice to leather manufacturers here. "With leather garments, they have to improve their style. But in three years, they can reach the level of European industry."
Now, Italian manufacturers are exploring joint production ventures and Italy's export promotion institute is sending a mission of leather machinery manufacturers here in August. It has also agreed to sponsor workshops on improving production quality over the next year.
But some unusual factors are holding back the Colombian leather industry: Cattle ranchers are being kidnapped by guerrillas, who are largely rural forces; ranches themselves are deteriorating and hide quality can be poor. Also, bombings and other violence often scare away foreign buyers.
Still, Colombia's leather exports amount to $200 million a year, with 60 percent going to the United States. American consumers, however, are largely oblivious to the phenomenon. In the United States, Colombian products are usually marketed under brand names, or with the country of origin hidden in fine print.
"Retailers know the Colombian look, but there is no public perception," said Michael Schreiber, vice president of Latico Leathers of East Hanover, N.J. A major importer of Colombian leather bags, Mr. Schreiber estimated that over the last decade, the number of United States importers of Colombian leather goods has increased from two to 15.
Colombian manufacturers, meanwhile, have new reasons to expand the leather industry. Import tariffs on industrial machinery dropped last year to 5 percent from 35 percent, and tariffs on most imported hides fell to 10 percent from 30 percent.
Despite these financial incentives, the Colombian leather industry has hefty competition elsewhere, especially at the low-priced end of the market. India and China have even lower labor costs than Colombia. The answer to this challenge, according to manufacturers here, is to seek a market niche in high-quality garments, bags, shoes and accessories.
"Our niche is going to be the middle and upper quality," said Maria Angela Tavera, executive president of Colombia's Association of Leather Manufacturers, a group that has seen its membership mushroom over the last decade from 35 companies to 247. "Instead of trying to increase in volume, there is a great effort to improve design and quality."
In expanding its leather industry, however, Colombia has been importing cow hides -- an unusual step for a nation with so many cattle ranches. "Looking down the road, two years from now we think we are going to have a thriving market in Colombia," said Bruce Macdonald, the South America sales manager of the Prime Tanning Company of Berwick, Maine, America's largest exporter of finished leather hides.
A decade ago, exporting cow hides to Colombia would have made as much sense as carrying coal to Newcastle. But in 1992, increasing domestic violence forced Colombia to triple its hide imports over 1991 levels.
As foreign aid to Colombia's rural guerrillas dried up, they turned to kidnapping and extortion -- and of 1,136 Colombians kidnapped last year, more than half were ranchers. A large number of other ranchers paid millions of dollars in protection money to "vaccinate" themselves against kidnapping. In one ranching state, Cesar, kidnappings have become such a problem that the annual cattlemen's fair was cancelled last year.
The impact of all the civil unrest has been a dramatic reduction in Colombia's cattle herd, from 25 million cows in 1974 to 16 million last year.
Enrique White Salazar, president of the National Tanning Federation, referring to ranches that suffer from absentee ownership, added that the hides that are produced here tend to have defects. On some ranches, he said, cows' bellies "are scratched by weeds or wire. There are more illnesses because the cattle are not washed."
Another problem for the industry last year was the rationing of electricity -- the combined result of guerrilla violence, poor rainfall in a country dependent on hydroelectric power and poor Government planning. Many of Colombia's small leather workshops, located in residential neighborhoods, had to cut their working hours during the day while electricity was channeled to industrial zones.
In addition, the repatriation of illicit drug profits hurts legitimate Colombian exporters by boosting domestic inflation. Last year, local prices went up 25 percent in peso terms, while the dollars that exporters earned only appreciated against the peso by 14 percent.
Finally, many buyers have been shying away from Colombia because of the nation's reputation for violence. Foreign registrations for a leather-goods fair here in February thinned after a series of car bombs were detonated in this city, violence the Government said was committed by Pablo Escobar, the fugitive cocaine trafficker.
"I had a good Mexican client who cancelled his trip here because of the bombs," complained Gustavo Gonzalez Jinete, whose factory here, Gonari, exports to Latico in New Jersey. Mario Hernandez Zambrano, who has an outlet of his Marroquinera leather goods chain in Trump Plaza in Manhattan, said: "Only half of our American buyers came this year."
But with the leather industry still on an expansion course, foreign pioneers here say potential profits outweigh the risks.
"I was in Bogota when the World Trade Center was bombed in New York," said Mr. Macdonald of Prime Tanning in Maine, "so it's a worldwide problem." He added that his company planned to be represented each year at the fair. Having expanded tenfold over the last decade, the fair is expected to attract 735 stands in August. It's a gathering that now bills itself "Latin America's Most Important Leather Fair."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
The China Factor in Asia Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
SPURRED on by China's movement farther and farther from a controlled economy, "China funds" have been popping up fast -- so fast that only one among four new China-flavored mutual funds and three new closed-end China funds has celebrated its first birthday.
Their timing seems auspicious. Late last month, the International Monetary Fund reported that, at $1.7 trillion, China's economy is four times larger than previously believed and the third-largest in the world, behind the United States and Japan. 
 But investors who want to tap into China's fast-growing economy should remember that "10 to 12 percent economic growth rates won't translate into big investment returns overnight," said Colin Mathews, a closed-end fund analyst with Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago. And, like all investments in emerging markets, these funds carry plenty of risks.

 From the time they came to market last summer, the three closed-end funds -- the China Fund, the Greater China Fund and the Jardine-Fleming China Region Fund -- have been volatile. They trade, like common stock, on the New York Stock Exchange, and began selling at premiums of roughly 8 percent over the net asset value of the securities they own. But by October, all three had fallen to discounts approaching 20 percent.
Why? Because the funds are so similar, supply exceeded demand, explained Thomas J. Herzfeld, in Miami, a specialist in closed-end funds. Then there was a buyers' riot on China's stock exchange, followed by a threat in the United States to revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status.
But the funds quickly rallied when China agreed to reduce barriers to imports from the United States, averting a costly trade war. Then in April the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that the funds were allowed to buy "B" shares -- Chinese company shares created for foreign investors -- clearing the way for direct investment in Chinese issues.
Until the S.E.C. ruling, Chinese investments were nearly impossible. So funds labeled "China" haven't necessarily invested there, or at least not heavily, and that's still true. Direct Chinese investments account for only 16 percent of the Greater China Growth Fund's portfolio, for instance, and just 3 percent of the China Fund's.
Mutual fund investors likewise can only get a taste of China through regional funds. The two granddaddies here are Newport Tiger, started in 1989, and T. Rowe Price's New Asia, the only no-load in the group, set up in 1990. Two more began investing last year: the Merrill Lynch Dragon Fund and the Eaton Vance Greater China Growth Fund, in Boston, the first mutual fund to make China, rather than the Pacific Rim, its investment focus. In April, Van Eck, in New York, set up the Asia Dynasty Fund and Fidelity introduced its Southeast Asia Fund.
None of the China mutual funds, however, are loading up on direct investments in China. Instead, all try to capitalize on China's growth mainly by buying shares in Hong Kong, Korean or other Pacific Rim companies with large sales revenues from China or manufacturing facilities there.
Typical is Eaton Vance, which invests just 4 percent in China -- in Shanghai Refrigeration Compressor, Dazhong Taxi and Shenzhen China Bicycle, among others. Some 45 percent is in Hong Kong, whose exchange is better established and better capitalized, 13 percent in Singapore, roughly 10 percent each in Malaysia and Korea, and the rest in the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.
Newport Tiger, with no direct investment in China, has 48 percent of its portfolio in Hong Kong and the rest throughout Asia. "The China story is compelling, but it's going to be some time before the securities markets are settled enough to invest there," said Tim Tuttle, managing director of the fund's sponsor, Newport Pacific Management.
George Murnaghan, vice president of Rowe Price Fleming International, sponsor of the New Asia Fund, said, "We looked at 'B' shares, but there are cheaper ways to get China exposure." New Asia has 31 percent of its portfolio in Hong Kong and the rest in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand.
Most of the funds plan to continue investing outside China despite the S.E.C.'s blessing to plunge in. Valuations are high on the Chinese exchanges, managers say, partly because so few new issues are floated on the exchanges, which are not very liquid anyway.
Managers are enthusiastic about China's prospects, but concede that interim performance will probably be erratic, despite flashy gains this year of 30 to 35 percent (closed-end) and 19 percent and up (mutual) funds.

Mr. Mathews suggests that investors hang onto shares in Pacific Rim funds for at least 10 years to capture the long-term value built into China's economic prospects, and limit their exposure to only a small part of the high-risk portion of their portfolios. As shown by the lukewarm performance of funds that sprang up after Eastern Europe opened for investment, new and uncharted territory isn't easy to till profitably.
As for the closed-end funds, today they again sport hefty premiums and Mr. Herzfeld advises waiting to buy until the funds return to discounts -- which, because the funds react so sharply to political news, he noted, could be any time.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Week of Springtime for the Republicans

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
STILL smarting from their loss of the White House, Republicans triumphantly seized on their victories last week in the Texas Senate race and the Los Angeles mayoral race as evidence that their party had hit the comeback trail.
They grandly pronounced that the voters had repudiated President Clinton and that last year's loss was a rejection of George Bush, not the Republican Party. The results even spurred jubilant talk about taking back the Senate in 1994 and making big inroads into the Democratic majority in the House. 
 "It looks to me like it's a bad time to be running with a 'D' beside your name because all that anger and resentment, that anti-Washington feeling, is now aimed at them," said Charles Black, who was a senior adviser to the Bush campaign. "You're seeing a Democratic base being dispirited; they're staying home."
Even David Wilhelm, who as chairman of the Democratic National Committee is charged with putting the positive spin on even the most gloomy news, acknowledged the obvious, albeit with understatement: "We didn't have a great political week."
In Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, a conservative, became the first Republican mayor in a generation, defeating Michael Woo, a liberal City Councilman endorsed by Mr. Clinton, by 54 percent to 46 percent.
In the Texas Senate race, the surprise was not that Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Senator Bob Krueger, but that she won by a margin of 2 to 1. Though Mr. Krueger was never endorsed by Mr. Clinton and in fact distanced himself from the President's economic program, Mrs. Hutchison seemed to focus her campaign as much on Bill Clinton as on her opponent in Texas.
There were other danger signs for Democrats. Sam Farr, a Democratic Assemblyman, was elected to the California race for the House seat vacated by Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's budget director. But in a largely Democratic district along the coast south of San Francisco, Mr. Farr defeated a Republican, Bill McCampbell, with only 52 percent of the vote. Two years ago, Mr. Panetta defeated Mr. McCampbell with 72 percent.
And Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who won the New Jersey gubernatorial primary, is viewed as a formidable rival for Gov. Jim Florio because of the state's economic woes and tax increases.
While all this evidence has certainly rejuvenated the Republicans' spirits, it does little to mask the party's troubles: It is still struggling to find common ground between moderate factions and the increasingly influential religious conservatives. There is also a leadership void, with polls showing that Ross Perot is more popular and better known than any Republican who might run in 1996.
Mr. Wilhelm dismisses the Republican crowing as premature. "I fundamentally believe that six to nine months from now, the political dynamic is going to be far different," he said. "We will have passed the budget, passed health care reform. If the Republicans believe that gridlock and an excessive display of partisanship is in their interest, that is a fundamental miscalculation of the American people."
But Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, is not looking to six or nine months from now but to 1994 and the chance to end the 56-44 Democratic advantage in the Senate. "Our slogan now," he said, "is seven more in '94."

HEADLINE: LOST IN WASHINGTON;
An Economy Looking for Signals Gets One a Minute

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PERHAPS it was naive, but the hope was once in the air that President Clinton would march into Washington, lift the nation's spirits, get employment up and the deficit down and have the economy gliding along like a high-speed train.
That hasn't exactly happened. Instead Mr. Clinton has gotten bloodied and bruised as he struggles to push his budget package through a Congress with ideas of its own. This has dissipated the burst of confidence that greeted the President, and, to Mr. Clinton's chagrin, the underpowered economy remains on the same unhappy course as when he arrived -- chugging uphill and on the slow track.
Some economic analysts believe that all the inside-the-Beltway mudslinging and mayhem can only cause the economy to lose more steam. Washington has never been like Moscow of old, with heavy-handed bureaucrats pulling the strings of factories and shops thousands of miles away. But Washington does send out countless subtle signals every day that influence myriad economic decisions, and in recent weeks those signals have spelled uncertainty with a capital U.
Businesses abhor uncertainty -- it worries them and often paralyzes them. True, a considerable amount was to be expected, since Mr. Clinton came into office on the promise of change, committed to cutting the deficit and overhauling health care. But he seems to have piled it on with a vengeance -- with the help of Congressional Democrats and Republicans, of course. This uncertainty further clouds an already murky economic picture, with just as many indicators pointing down as up.
Confusion in Washington inarguably hurts the economy to some degree because it has sent corporate executives to the sidelines, anxious for matters to clarify before they get on with the business of expanding, hiring and investing -- paradoxically, the precise economic goals that Mr. Clinton wants to achieve. With the investment tax credit here one day and gone the next, with trial balloons being floated about new consumption and payroll taxes, and with the energy tax seemingly changing every few minutes like a kaleidoscope, many corporate executives say they don't know who's on first.
 
A Tax Free-for-All

 And the uncertainty is likely to continue for months to come, through the Administration's anticipated but much delayed effort to reform health care, which accounts for one of every seven dollars spent in the economy.
In its latest turn last week, the White House abandoned an energy tax on the heat content of fuels, and now appears ready to let a Congressional free-for-all determine what energy tax the country should have. The leader among a raft of unpopular proposals is a transportation tax -- a levy on gasoline, diesel fuel and airline fuel pushed by Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat.
Seeing all this confusion, many executives are asking how they can decide whether to build a new factory or hire new workers when they don't know which new taxes they will face and how large they will be.
"Many businessmen are deferring decisions on hiring and capital spending -- either they don't know what Washington is going to come up with or they don't like what has already been proposed," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm. "They're uncertain or frozen."
In Mr. Brinner's view, such uncertainty hardly hurt the first quarter of this year because most investment and hiring decisions had been locked in when Mr. Clinton took office. But many analysts agree this uncertainty is hurting the economy now.
In the first quarter, the economy inched upward at a miserably slow nine-tenths of 1 percent. The Administration is praying for a robust second quarter, and many economists say that just might happen in spite of Washington's budget turmoil. But if the economic torpor continues, it will hard to push the jobless rate much below 7 percent -- and to fulfill Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 8 million jobs in four years.
 
Vicious Cycle
 Indeed, if growth doesn't get better and soon, the economy's weakness could metastasize into serious political trouble for Mr. Clinton, just as it did for George Bush. That could complicate efforts to push through his economic and health care programs, forming a vicious cycle of uncertainty undercutting the economy and hampering lawmakers, creating more uncertainty, and so on. Americans, Mr. Brinner says, will be less game for sacrifice and grand experiments when the economy and their paychecks are going nowhere. And members of Congress, already in a surly mood, might grow even less loyal to Mr. Clinton as worries fester that he might not turn around the economy before the 1994 elections.
At the moment, the economy seems to be both accelerating and holding back. On one hand, businesses seem discouraged by all the confusion in Washington. But on the other, companies see the economy expanding, although slowly, quarter after quarter, and as orders flow in, they feel obligated to increase hiring.
"Even though companies are worried about new laws or taxes and all the uncertainty, that is very much overridden by the fact that new orders keep coming in," said Mitchell Fromstein, chief executive officer of Manpower Inc., the temporary help company.
For businesses, predicting how the economy will behave in six months is about as difficult as predicting whether Mr. Clinton will stop stumbling by then. On the negative side, consumer and business confidence are dipping, retail sales are weak and factories have scaled back their investment plans. Brighter news, however, comes from the strong pickup in employment in May and surprisingly robust gains in car and housing sales.
What economic strength there is seems concentrated in sectors highly sensitive to interest rates. Mr. Clinton can claim some responsibility for that, since long-term interest rates dropped sharply after he was elected and unveiled his $500 billion deficit reduction package. Since his $19 billion economic stimulus package went down in flames, he is looking to the sharp fall in interest rates as the economy's salvation, saying it will translate into $100 billion in stimulus.
The trouble is, the combination of tax increases and spending cuts in his budget package is bound to have a numbing effect on the economy -- what economists often call "fiscal drag." Companies complain that higher taxes or dropoffs in government contracts cause them to hire fewer people. And corporate worries have been aggravated by reports that Mr. Clinton's health-care package may include hefty payroll taxes of 7 to 10 percent of the wage base.
"We are being more than extremely careful about hiring," said Pepe Piedra, chairman of NeoCAD, a software company in Boulder, Colo. "There could be a double whammy for us between the enormous tax increases in the economic package and the whammy of new taxes to pay for health-care reform."
One company recently finished a study on whether to modernize an existing American factory or replace it by building a new plant in Mexico. The study concluded that it was a tossup, but, a company executive indicated, if the Administration pushes through a 10 percent payroll tax for health care, the investment will go south of the border.
With the recent shake-up in the White House, Administration officials nevertheless exude confidence that they will get their economic package passed this summer, that confidence in the economy will rebound and that Mr. Clinton's popularity will likewise. If only the American people were as confident.

HEADLINE: On These Shores, Immigrants Find a New Wave of Hostility

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TOLERANCE and intolerance toward immigration form a double helix in the American genetic code. The United States, every civics textbook says, is a nation of immigrants, a refuge to the tired, the poor and the tempest-tossed. But nativism, the political reaction against immigration, is a hardy strain. It flourishes in times of economic and political uncertainty. It is flourishing now.
Last week's wreck of the Golden Venture, the smugglers' ship that spilled nearly 300 Chinese immigrants seeking political asylum onto New York's shores, and the abuse of the asylum system by a key suspect in the World Trade Center bombing, have spurred anti-immigration bills in Congress. They have raised fears that a flood of foreigners threatens the political and economic security of the United States. In particular, they have amplified calls for restrictions on the system of political asylum. 
 "The sense of siege has been a very good vehicle for the anti-immigration people," said Demetrios Papademetriou, director of immigration policy at the Labor Department from 1988 to 1992. "Their message resonates around the country: Immigration is out of control; our borders have fallen."
Immigration and Naturalization Service officers now use the language of the war on drugs. They speak of smuggling cartels trafficking in illicit cargo. William S. Slattery, director of the service's New York office, uses the language of war itself. "Who's going to control the borders of the United States?" he said. "The aliens have taken control."
The same message reverberates in Germany, where xenophobic firebombings and Government decisions to restrict immigration have coincided, and in France, whose new interior minister declared last week that the nation cannot absorb more immigrants.
About one million foreigners will ask to immigrate to the United States this year. Roughly 10 to 15 percent will request political asylum. No one knows how many more will slip across the border and into the sprawl of New York or Los Angeles. No one can measure the cost of health services or education for them. The strain on cities is enormous. But it always was, from the first great waves of immigration in the 1840's.
"All the overcrowded school districts today are immigrant school districts," said Frank Vardy, a demographer with New York's Department of City Planning. "That's always been true, ever since immigration started. Today 42 percent of all births in the city are to immigrant mothers. Those children are all American citizens, every one."
In California, "the nativist arguments are economically driven," said Larry Eig, a legislative attorney at the Library of Congress. "People will do anything they can to cut down the costs of immigrants and immigration. They are culturally scared as well as economically scared."
More than a few descendants of immigrants are saying enough is enough. "We cannot accommodate even a fraction of the people who want to move here," said Dan Stein, director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.
The modern strain of nativism was cross-fertilized by three movements: zero population growth, environmentalism and the English-first movement. Each of their beliefs supported the fundamental nativist credo: this country cannot assimilate more aliens.
If that is true, then a tenet of the Founding Fathers has collapsed.
"What Thomas Jefferson and others did was to create a civic culture which made it possible for the United States to make Americans out of people from vastly different cultural and religious backgrounds," said Lawrence Fuchs, acting chairman of the Federal Commission on Immigration Reform. "No other country does that."
But no other country has the same burden of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. None has an agency quite like the I.N.S., simultaneously responsible for throwing aliens out and allowing them in. None has quite the same tradition of embracing and repelling alien cultures.
In 1795, George Washington asked God "to render this country more and more a safe and propitious asylum for the unfortunate of other countries." Three years later, in the Alien and Sedition Acts, Congress gave the Government extraordinary powers to arrest and deport foreigners deemed un-American.
President Jefferson undid the Acts. "Shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives from distress that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land?" he asked.
In the 1850's, the nativist Know-Nothing Party elected governors, controlled state legislatures, and commanded scores of seats in Congress with demands for an end to immigration. Its members rioted against Irish and German newcomers, saying they would never fit into the American mosaic.
Five years later, the Government sought immigrants for Civil War soldiers. President Lincoln put this plank in the Republicans' 1864 platform: "Resolved, That foreign immigration . . . to this nation, the asylum of the oppressed of all nations, shall be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just policy."
That resolution ebbed with world wars. After admitting more than 600,000 Europeans made homeless by World War II, Congress passed the McCarran Act, excluding the ideologically incorrect and fixing quotas based on race and nationality. Each crisis provoked an exception -- Cubans after Castro's rise, Vietnamese after Saigon's fall. The doors of political asylum opened to those fleeing communism and closed for those fleeing the armies of the right. The new flood of illegal Chinese immigration began with the Bush Administration's liberalization of asylum policy after the Tiananmen Square killings.
Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln all used the word "asylum" to mean an America where anyone could come to make a better life, said Mr. Fuchs. Today asylum has a more narrow definition: the refuge offered people with "a well-founded fear of persecution" in their homelands.
"It's now so much easier to get to our doorstep on planes, on ships, on foot," said Mr. Fuchs. "Thousands of people show up and claim political asylum, and because we have a system of due process, it's very hard to administer. How do you ration the tickets to get in?"
Often left out of this life-and-death debate are those seeking asylum.
Min Sun Min is 37 years old and living in Brooklyn, two facts he regards as minor miracles. He grew up in Burma and became a history teacher. The government jailed and tortured him for his political beliefs. Released, he fled through the jungle into Thailand and was granted political asylum by the United States in April. He now works in a movie theater and studies advertising.
"My belief is that everyone has to be free," he said. "I love freedom here. The many Chinese people who came here by boat and the Haitian refugees who came here, their lives are the same situation. I know some Haitian refugees were sent back and the Chinese were put in jail. My feeling is Haitian, Chinese, whatever, people who have political reasons should have equal opportunity to save their lives."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Clinton's Health-Care Plan: It's Still Big, but It's Farther Away

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE shimmering vision of health-care reform, a central promise of President Clinton's campaign, seems to be receding into the distance as Administration officials and members of Congress wrestle with problems like taxes and the Federal budget deficit.
The soaring ambition of Mr. Clinton's health plan has been brought down to earth by certain political laws of gravity, and no one is more worried than the 500 policy analysts who labored for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, dissolved May 30 with no assurance about the use to which their work will be put. 
 "The policy-making process was unusual, exhilarating, disorienting and rather bizarre, but it produced a workable proposal," said Dr. Irwin E. Redlener, a New York City pediatrician who assisted the task force for three months. "I worry that Clinton's proposal will now be dismembered because of political and fiscal pressures as it runs through the gantlet of Congress, with special interests waiting in the wings."
The need for improvements in the health-care system -- to slow the explosive growth of health spending, to guarantee care for the uninsured, to provide security for those who already have some coverage -- is as great as ever.
But the prospects for sweeping changes have dimmed for several reasons: the Administration's own delays; its political naivete; the erosion of the President's political capital; the inherent conflict with his economic plan and deficit-reduction goals, and not least, the power of the "special interests" that Mrs. Clinton often decries.
The Administration seems to have underestimated the magnitude of the task it was undertaking.
Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said: "You couldn't find a more enthusiastic supporter of Clinton than I was in January. I was quite sure that he would give us a bold vision for health-care reform by May 1 because Hillary Clinton's personal reputation was riding on that deadline. But if you ask me now, instead of that early vision of an elegant, powerful program announced to the world by an exuberant Clinton, I think you will get a compromise worked out by the White House and Congress. And it may be more incremental than bold."
Referring to the Administration, Mr. Reinhardt said, "Their heart is in the right place, but I'm no longer so sure of their political and technical acumen."
Whereas Mr. Clinton tends to favor mandates and requirements, Congress is more likely to provide encouragement and incentives to control costs and get small employers to buy health insurance for their employees.
 
Fading Commitment
 At her confirmation hearing in January, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said any money saved through cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid would be used to provide health benefits for the uninsured, not to reduce the Federal budget deficit. But that commitment evaporated in the blistering heat of political reality.
In his budget request in mid-February, Mr. Clinton proposed to cut the projected growth of Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, by more than $50 billion over five years, and all the savings were earmarked for deficit reduction. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Finance Committee, raised the ante last week when he suggested further Medicare cutbacks of $35 billion over five years.
President Clinton's budget director, Leon E. Panetta, warned that such big reductions in Medicare would be seen as "undercutting health-care reform." Mr. Clinton's health policy advisers expressed despair. For if Congress follows Mr. Moynihan's suggestion, they said, the President may have to scale back his health-care proposals or seek bigger tax increases to pay for them.
Kevin E. Lofton, chief executive officer of Howard Unversity Hospital in Washington, said, "We expected health-care reform to pay for the uninsured." Instead, he said, the hospital may lose some of the money it is receiving for people already insured through Medicare and Medicaid.
Medicare serves more than 35 million people. There are 30 million Medicaid recipients; about half are under 18 years old.
In the political calculus of Washington, the economy takes priority over health care, for this reason: people must have secure jobs before they can get health benefits through those jobs. Mr. Clinton's plan would require all employers to provide health benefits for their workers, either directly or indirectly though regional insurance purchasing groups.
Economists have been involved in the formulation of Mr. Clinton's health-care proposals, but their insights have not always been welcomed or assimilated by his health policy team, and that was probably a mistake. For as C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, says: "Government policy toward health care can never be separated from financing or tax issues, or from alternative uses and expenditures to which tax dollars might be devoted. In many discussions, health policy is treated as isolated from tax policy. Inevitably and irreducibly, however, they are two sides of the same accounting ledger."
 
All or Nothing
 In remarks that now look prescient, Mr. Steuerle said in May 1992: "The failure to make headway in health care derives from the attempt to do too much. The drive to 'do it all' has, in many ways, deterred efforts toward incremental improvements that, when combined, could be quite substantial."
One such incremental effort seeks to regulate the health insurance market, to prevent insurers from denying coverage or charging exorbitant premiums for people with a high risk of costly illness. Democrats, Republicans and many big insurance companies now agree that such regulation is needed. But there is little chance that it will be considered except as part of Mr. Clinton's proposal to restructure the entire health-care system. Indeed, some Democrats oppose piecemeal change on the ground that it would undermine political support for comprehensive change.
When people speak of the political naivete of Mr. Clinton's health policy advisers, they are referring to technicians like Ira C. Magaziner and Walter A. Zelman, who have inventive minds but no experience in Washington. Mr. Magaziner, the coordinator of Mrs. Clinton's task force, is the President's senior adviser for policy development; Mr. Zelman, who also works at the White House, is one of the chief architects of the Clinton proposals. The vast apparatus of the task force, with its work groups, policy papers and secretive discussions, sometimes seemed to exist more for the purpose of educating Mr. Magaziner than drafting legislation.
But Mr. Clinton was ultimately responsible for the operation of the task force. Its strengths and weaknesses reflected his style of management. He has wallowed in hours and hours of discussion, and he has impressed his staff with his command of the nuances of health policy. But he has deferred crucial decisions about how to pay for new benefits and whether to regulate the prices of insurance, drugs, doctors and hospitals.
Thus, the sales campaign for the President's health plan appears to be in a more advanced stage of development than the plan itself. The Democratic National Committee will orchestrate a public relations campaign in support of the President's proposal. Mrs. Clinton is already assailing critics of the President's approach. And the White House has distributed "talking points" so members of Congress can answer questions from constituents (Will I still be able to choose my doctor? Won't quality be sacrificed? Won't this plan kill small business?).
President Clinton's approval rating has fallen sharply since February, and Mrs. Clinton's popularity has suffered a more modest decline. If the President cannot persuade Congress to pass a $16 billion jobs bill, can he sell a health-care proposal costing two or three times that? It will be difficult. But polls consistently show a public yearning for major changes. For Mr. Clinton and Congress, the challenge is to shape such sentiment into a consensus for specific legislation that would revolutionize health care in America.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
There's Nothing Like Foreign Policy for Producing Ennui

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SHORTLY after President Clinton took office he held a town meeting in Chillicothe, Ohio, during which an audience chosen by lottery asked him about everything, it seemed, from health care to Hillary. But in 90 minutes he did not get a single question on foreign policy. It was a harbinger of things to come.
In all the town hall meetings the President has held since then, you could count on one hand the number of unprompted foreign policy questions he has received from the public. Clinton aides barely bother anymore to even prepare the President for foreign policy questions, for they know he is much more likely to get asked about the trimmings of Cristophe the barber than the travels of Christopher the diplomat. 
 What happened to American foreign policy? It was here a minute ago. Lately, though, the whole subject seems to excite almost nobody: Iraq attempts to assassinate former President Bush while he is on a visit to Kuwait, and people shrug: "No harm done." Bosnian Serbs continue to thumb their noses at Washington, and people just avert their eyes. President Clinton opts for renewing trade benefits for China, with only the most tentative human rights conditions, and Congress is mute.
"You have to ask yourself," said Robert Tucker, professor emeritus of international relations at Johns Hopkins, "is there anywhere in the world where the American people today would be ready to suffer 5,000 casualties to achieve some foreign policy goal, besides the defense of the United States?"
An interesting question. And while it may not engage many in the wider public, it has sparked something of a new debate among foreign policy experts.
The fuel for this debate, and the underlying cause for the indifference to foreign policy, can be found in two conditions that happened to coincide in the last few years: the nation's thin wallet and its ambivalent will. Without a lot of cash, Americans are choosing foreign policy issues selectively. And without a Soviet Union as a threat, few of these issues really seem worth choosing.
More fuel for the debate was provided by Bosnia. As President Clinton campaigned on the promise of a more aggressive policy there, then tiptoed toward intervention, then suddenly retreated, it raised in the minds of many analysts fundamental questions about the limits of American power today, and the limits of American domestic tolerance for an activist foreign policy.
But the real spark for the debate was provided by Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, when, at a recent lunch with diplomatic reporters, he said: "Our economic interests are paramount." Given its limited resources, he said, the United States must "define the extent of its commitment commensurate with those realities -- this may on occasion fall short of what some Americans would like and others would hope for." Referring to Bosnia, he added: "Are people dying because the United States could do more if we wanted to? Yes."
Two articles then stoked the discussion by trying to tell Mr. Clinton what choices he should make in a world of scarce resources and ambiguous interests. One was an essay by Michael Mandelbaum, an American foreign policy professor at Johns Hopkins, who had served as a campaign adviser to the President. In an article for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, he argued that the "Tarnoff Doctrine" -- that we simply cannot afford to lead as we once did -- is wrong, because given the central role that America plays in the world, there is no such thing as taking a back seat and still achieving the ends it wants. According to this argument, if Washington does not lead no one will.
Mr. Mandelbaum faults the Clinton team not for acknowledging the limits of American resources to lead, but rather for a failure to set and justify for the American public clear priorities for where America should lead and where it should not. Without such priorities, he argued, America will dissipate its energies on secondary issues, and without good justifications the Administration won't get support for the most important priorities.
A more isolationist perspective is presented in the forthcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, in which Alan Tonelson, research director for the Economic Strategy Institute, argues that "the superpower role that America has played since 1945 is now not only too expensive and risky for the public taste, but is also unnecessary." The United States can protect its global economic and strategic interests, he contends, with a "significantly lower international profile." Mr. Tonelson worries, though, that "an Administration and a loyal opposition still addicted to globalism and leadership on the cheap may yet bloody the country's nose or warp its economy by pursuing world order in Bosnia or elsewhere."
In their defense, Clinton foreign policy aides disavow the Tarnoff Doctrine. They say that where it has counted -- particularly on the pivotal matter of aid to Russia -- they have been ready to lead. And elsewhere, they say, they have articulated clear, sustainable, realistic objectives -- ranging from stemming missile proliferation (a policy pursued with recent initiatives directed at both Iran and Ukraine), to establishing a framework for negotiations with Japan, to completing the world trade talks. There has also been success in turning back authoritarianism in Guatemala. The only area in which the Administration officials acknowledge that the President over-promised and then retreated is Bosnia.
 
When Is Credit Due?
 Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton has not gotten much credit for his foreign policy, and is not likely to. For one thing, it is going to be hard for him to assert the sort of clear-cut leadership that wins plaudits on the world stage. For American cold war Presidents, "multilateralism" -- working in concert with allies -- was really just a cover for the assertion of naked American power. For Mr. Clinton it is a fundamental necessity. This is because the United States believes that it can't afford to go it alone, except in cases of direct threat to its national interests. In addition, without the moral clarity of the Soviet threat, which could always justify action, most Americans seem reluctant to intervene abroad unless assured that the stakes are worth it by seeing allies join in the operation. It is hard to stand above the pack when you need them not for decoration but real support.
In addition, Mr. Clinton will find it difficult to succeed in foreign policy until he redefines for the American public what constitutes success. During the cold war, everyone knew what success was: The Berlin wall was up one day and down the next -- that was success. Russia was Communist one day and a democracy the next -- that was success. You didn't need to explain it to anyone on the street. But what is success in Bosnia? What is success in the helter-skelter march toward democracy in Eastern Europe? What is success in the trade talks with Japan? When everyone has a yardstick, no one has a yardstick -- and that is why, short of another direct threat to American security, Mr. Clinton is going to have to set some clear goals before anyone can measure whether he has met them.

HEADLINE: Europeans Fear Unemployment Will Only Rise

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 12

 BODY:
A new unease has taken hold in Western Europe as the conviction grows that record levels of unemployment may be tied less to the region's economic slump than to fundamental shifts in the work place and in the global economy that will persist beyond the current recession.
Last year, as the number of jobless mounted, the focus was on high German interest rates. By discouraging investment and consumption, the argument went, the high cost of money in Western Europe was delaying recovery and the creation of jobs. But as the rates have fallen this year, without any immediate response, awareness has grown that something deeper may be wrong. 
 Alarm is spreading: 17.4 million people are unemployed in the 12 countries of the European Community, or 10.3 percent of the work force, up from 14.6 million at the start of the year.
Over the next 18 months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of 24 countries predicts that unemployment in its 19 European member countries will jump almost 20 percent, to 23 million people or 11.9 percent of the work force. And that prediction is based on the beginning of an economic recovery next year in Western Europe.
"There is a great deal of apprehensiveness because we just don't know the full answers to why unemployment is surging," said one senior official from the economic organization, which is based in Paris. "If we did we could at least lay down some policy guidelines."
 
Whether, Not When, Jobs Return
 The question being asked is no longer when jobs will come back but whether they may have been permanently lost as a result of new technologies, the increased mobility of production, the determination of many large companies to become leaner and more flexible, and the relatively high cost of employing people in Western Europe.
"Now that capital and exchange controls have been largely removed, and communication is more or less instantaneous, investment goes increasingly to countries offering the best combination of labor costs, productivity and growing markets," said J. Paul Horne, the chief economist for Smith, Barney, Upham in Paris. "On all those counts, Europe loses out to Southeast Asia and this is going to weigh on the job market."
Every month, companies in sectors as varied as autos, champagne, tires, electronics, computers and glass announce new layoffs. For every I.B.M. or General Motors in the United States, there is a Philips or an Olivetti in Western Europe, engaged in equally extensive restructuring that eliminates tens of thousands of jobs.
 
Clear Consequences
 Already, the political and social consequences are clear. Turkish immigrants are killed in an arson attack in Germany. The French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, tells Le Monde that "our objective, given the gravity of the economic situation, is to move toward zero immigration." Prime Minister Edouard Balladur announces that a priority in long-stalled world trade talks must be the protection of European jobs.
Behind the sometimes vitriolic bluster on foreign goods and people lie fundamental questions about Western European competitiveness and the welfare state. Central elements of postwar Western European society -- like job security and extensive unemployment, social security and medical benefits -- are being re-examined even as the United States weighs an extension of health insurance to all Americans.
The reasons are clear. German wage costs, the highest in Europe, are now about 35 percent higher than in Japan and 50 percent higher than in the United States. This leads BMW to build a production plant in the United States, Mercedes-Benz to consider a similar move, and Audi A.G., a division of Volkswagen, to build an engine plant in Hungary rather than incur German wage costs. Each similar move costs Western Europe jobs.
Economists estimate that the overall burden of tax, social security and medical insurance payments amounts to about 41 percent of the total output of goods and services in Western Europe, compared with about 30 percent in Japan and the United States. This makes corporations think twice about plants in the region.
Recent research by the economic organization has revealed alarming statistics suggesting that unemployment has become endemic in Western Europe and that entrepreneurial activity is being stunted by the heavy costs to employers of the various benefits they must provide to workers.
While the United States has created more than 30 million jobs in the private sector since the mid-1970's, the European Community has created only about 3 million.
 
Job Growth in Public Sector
 Indeed, job growth in Western Europe has mainly come from the public sector, which has provided more than 5 million new jobs over the last two decades. But with most of these nations facing heavy budget deficits and taxation already high, further public-sector job growth appears very unlikely.
The Paris-based economic organization has also found that 45.8 percent of the unemployed in Europe have been out of work for more than a year, while the comparative figure in the United States is a mere 6.3 percent. This figure is viewed as particularly disturbing because technological change is now so rapid that the long-term unemployed quickly become virtually unemployable.
"If Europe is going to get anywhere close even to current U.S. unemployment levels of 6.9 percent, we have to become more flexible," said the director of Britain's employment policy institute, John Philpott. "The fact is that low-wage manufacturing jobs will go increasingly to newly developing countries where wage costs are low," he said. "Where we can compete is with jobs involving skilled labor and a high value-added content. But this means replacing long-term unemployment benefits with training and work programs."
The comparison between unemployment rates is not parallel, however. In Europe, people of working age and without jobs are counted as unemployed for as long as it takes them to find new work. In the United States, by contrast, unemployed people must be seeking work to be counted in unemployment statistics, so those who have stopped looking for work are excluded in calculating the jobless rate.
Alongside more vigorous and ambitious training, many analysts see a need for a rethinking of relations between employers and labor unions in Western Europe. Rigid relationships in which unions negotiate on behalf of tens or hundreds of thousands of workers in entire industrial sectors are increasingly seen as too unwieldy for a global economy in which the premium is increasingly on the speed and flexibility of production methods.
"A lot of the old industrial structures are obsolete," said Robert Skildesky, a professor of political economy at Warwick University in England. "The German model of a small number of big unions bargaining with employers, which is followed to a greater or lesser extent in most European countries, has produced very high wage costs and a lot of inflexibility."
That inflexibility may have been acceptable in a less global economy, but its cost is beginning to look prohibitive. Indeed, many economists believe that the current surge in unemployment has demonstrated that Western Europe stands at a crossroads.
Where the region relied heavily for employment on industries using the methods of Henry Ford -- capital-intensive manufacturing industries using a lot of unskilled labor -- it will now have to adjust because those jobs will increasingly move to places where such labor can be had more cheaply.
Instead, Western Europe must prove that it has the highly skilled and flexible labor force needed to be effective at the so-called lean production processes now being adopted by a range of industries.
 
Premium on Adaptability
 These processes put a premium on adaptability. For example, Japanese auto plants have cut the time for changing presses from weeks to hours. But in Western Europe, such nimbleness tends to be hindered by labor traditions of steady jobs, ponderous employer-employee negotiations and high non-wage costs.
Of course, the recession has taken a heavy toll on jobs. The European auto industry, for example, is in a slump not seen for two decades, with sales expected to fall as much as 15 percent this year over 1992. When a recovery comes, some jobs are certain to return.
But the number of those returning jobs may be more limited than in previous recoveries. At Moet et Chandon, a 25 percent drop in sales since 1989 led to a decision by the champagne manufacturer last month to lay off about 200 of its 1,600 employees. It was the first time since the crisis of the 1930's that Moet had cut jobs.
Philippe des Roys de Roure, the company spokesman, said the cuts were inevitable because champagne drinking slumped with the end of the high-rolling 1980's.
But asked if he expected sales to pick up again and new jobs to return, he said he believed that the next decade would at least be tough.
"People have less confidence in the future," he said. "The last 30 years were glorious for champagne, but I'm afraid that's over."

HEADLINE: MAYOR AND COUNCIL MAKE BUDGET PACT FOR NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins and the New York City Council agreed early yesterday morning on a $31.2 billion budget that holds taxes steady, clips some social programs but still grows by nearly $1.8 billion over last year's adopted budget.
The Council's leaders and the administration reached an accord at 4:30 yesterday morning, resolving a week of tense and at times acrimonious negotiations over the shape of nearly $300 million in spending cuts by agreeing not to cut services quite so deeply as the Mayor had initially proposed. 
 After resisting for more than a month, the Council agreed to the Mayor's proposal to create a new agency to take over the operations of the city's homeless shelters from the Human Resources Administration.
 
Short-Range Solutions
 Both the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that the budget, which takes effect July 1, did little to solve long-range fiscal problems. The city will face enormous chasms between taxes and spending in future years unless deeper cuts are made, they agreed.
"This is the last of the dinosaur budgets," Mr. Vallone said of the fiscal plan, the last before both the Mayor and the members of the Council face re-election this fall. "The administration and the Council now recognize that we really have to make some permanent changes."
Mr. Dinkins told reporters that he was "very concerned" about deficits in the next budget. He reminded them that he had appointed a committee of fiscal experts to study the problem and report back to him in December. But he said he was pleased with the plan agreed to yesterday.
 
Republicans to Vote No
 "A very difficult process has culminated in a budget that is as good as it can be in the circumstances," Mr. Dinkins said. "It's tough, it's painful always, it's distasteful, to have to diminish in any area you think is important. But fiscal stability is absolutely essential."
But the Council's six-member Republican minority said it would vote against the budget. And the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, quickly joined in criticism of the plan.
"It's not a question of if this budget is going to fall apart," said Mr. Giuliani. "It's a matter of when."
After days of frustrating talks, the turning point came about 6:30 P.M. Friday when the two sides reached compromises on the homeless agency and on a second dispute, over control of a new quasi-public corporation that will build health clinics.
The Council agreed to approve the creation of the homeless agency on the condition that its initial financing be cut to $5 million from $8 million and that it be dismantled after two years if the Council determines it has not been effective.
On the other major sticking point, whether the Council would gain oversight over an agency that will use state-issued bonds to build 30 health-care clinics -- the two sides agreed to disagree. The Council withdrew its demand, but promised a lawsuit. A judge will decide the matter, officials said.
 
Jockeying for Credit
 As in most municipal budget negotiations, the end-game boiled down to jockeying over which side would be able to take credit for repairing some of the damage from cuts the Mayor had proposed in his executive budget.
Once the disputes over the homeless agency and the health corporation were settled, the administration quickly found $40 million in spare revenues that would allow the Council to reinstate some of the Mayor's cuts and to finance a few of the Council members' priorities.
After a long night of haggling over what to restore, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Vallone appeared at 5:45 A.M. to announce that they were giving back some of the money that the Mayor had proposed to take away from parks, senior centers, police-cadet training, highways, day care, and AIDS patients. The Council also claimed credit for a modest increase in money for libraries and cultural institutions. The Mayor added a $1 million for a program to reduce infant mortality.
Despite the restorations, the budget still contains more than $130 million in cuts, touching services from school buses to youth programs to job-placement centers.
The average property tax rate will not rise under the new plan, but a city income tax surcharge that was scheduled to expire this year will be extended.
 
Uncertain Revenues
 The budget agreement will go to the full Council for ratification on tomorrow. The six Republican Council members said they would vote against it because the plan contained more than $500 million in uncertain revenues that would cause budget gaps to appear after the election.
"To stand up and pretend we have budget balance is a charade," said Councilman Charles Millard, a Manhattan Republican. "Conveniently for the Mayor, it probably won't fall apart until after the election."
But since the Democrats control the 51-member Council, passage seems assured.
Beyond the addition of the homeless agency, which will add about 250 people to the city payroll, there were no bold strokes to restructure the delivery of services in the plan, nor were there any significant concessions from city unions on civil service rules, Republican lawmakers said.
In cutting the budget, the Mayor and the Council appear to have followed the same strategy they have in the last three years, as a dismal economy failed to produce tax revenues that would keep pace with a spiraling demand for services. They have applied the budget knife gingerly, preferring to squeeze savings from programs across the board rather than lopping off entire branches of services.
Since January, when budget officials estimated there was a $2.1 billion gap looming in the next fiscal year, the administration has reduced the city's budget by about $1 billion. Most of the changes came from one-time sales, refinancing debt, re-estimating revenues, slowing hiring, reducing supplies, delaying new programs and streamlining operations.
 
Minimizing Growth
 Of all the reductions, about $260 million stem from actual spending cuts. But many reductions come from shrinking previously planned increases rather than cutting existing services.
Still, while the service cuts affect less than 1 percent of the city's spending, they represent a blueprint of the city's priorities. In general, Mr. Dinkins and Council leaders chose to protect the status quo as much as possible. Instead of reducing funds for the Police Department, for instance, they trimmed programs for teen-agers, seniors, students, the homeless and the sick.
The cuts that will directly affect people include a $3.1 million reduction in homeless shelter staffing, $2.8 million in advanced summer high school classes, $1.2 million in health supplies and $4 million from job-placement programs.
 
Withdraws Proposal
 In the final hours, Mr. Dinkins pulled back on his original proposal to save $14 million by cutting money for nearly 1,600 children in day care and for a program that cooks and provides transportation for AIDS patients. Now those two programs will still each be cut by $3.5 million, but the cuts will not take effect until January, officials said.
Some of the heaviest cuts fell at the Board of Education, where the city plans to save about $186 million through, among other things, reducing preparatory periods for teachers, increasing the sizes of special education classes, cutting school supplies and repainting schools less often.
All told, spending will rise $1.8 billion over the budget that was adopted last year, about twice the rate of inflation.
The budget calls for the city work force to shrink by about 2,300 jobs over the next year, to about 210,700. Part of that decrease will come from a partial freeze on hiring -- excluding the police, teachers and firefighters -- to save about $25 million.
Though it comes only five months before Mr. Dinkins faces a tough re-election fight, the budget contains few new programs aimed at winning votes or mollifying constituencies. Instead the Mayor has been forced to agree to scale back or delay some popular programs.
He has canceled a reduction in rent taxes for small businesses to save $30 million and delayed for three months the start of 15 new "beacon" schools that have special late-night programs to save $2 million.
 
One-Time Revenues
 Even with the spending cuts, the budget rests precariously on about $740 million in one-time revenues that fiscal experts have said will do nothing to reduce the city's seemingly permanent gap between spending and revenues in future years.
Those one-shot revenues range from things that are unlikely to happen, like selling the Off-Track Betting Corporation for $55 million, to standard fiscal maneuvers, like trading in old debt for new bonds at a lower interest rate to save $97 million.
State fiscal monitors have criticized the budget for depending on other questionable revenues. Chief among those is an unusual borrowing scheme that would use unpaid property taxes as collateral to leverage a bank loan for about $215 million.
State fiscal monitors have said the borrowing, which must be approved by the state, smacks of the fiscal practices of the 1970's, when the city was nearly driven to bankruptcy by borrowing money to pay for operating expenses.

HEADLINE: Christopher Gives Turks Plan to End Rights Abuses

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, June 12

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked Turkish leaders today to cooperate with a detailed American proposal to help end widespread human rights abuses in the country, he and other Administration officials said.
At the same time, the United States announced that it would provide Turkey with $336 million in aircraft and other military equipment. 
 Turkish leaders told Mr. Christopher that they would be willing to work with the United States, but made no specific commitments on the plan, senior Turkish officials said.
Acting Prime Minister Erdal Inonu strongly defended Turkey's human rights record, telling reporters, "Today I would challenge any country to come up and say they have a better human rights record than ourselves."
A senior Turkish official dismissed the importance of the United States initiative altogether.
"They're just trying to blow it up as if both sides are working on a plan," said the official, who attended today's meetings. "It's a showpiece."
The State Department's 1992 global human rights report said political murders and extra-judicial killings in Turkey increased last year. It also documented cases of torture, rape and killing of detainees, disappearances of political opponents, arbitrary arrests and detention and denial of fair trial.
Mr. Christopher also indicated that the United States would reward better behavior by Turkey, one of America's closest allies, with economic cooperation and favors. He and other senior officials rejected the suggestion, made over the years by human rights organizations, that Turkey be punished with designation as a "gross" violator of human rights, which by law could make it ineligible for American military aid.
When asked whether American aid should be contingent on an improvement in Turkey's human rights record, Mr. Christopher said human rights have to be "factored against many other criteria." A senior Administration official later told reporters that the United States did not consider Turkey a gross violator of human rights.
The interchange on human rights was one element of wide-ranging discussions during Mr. Christopher's first official visit here as Secretary of State. One subject was Turkey's frustrations with what its leaders perceive as the inaction of NATO in stopping the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
President Suleyman Demirel and other senior officials told Mr. Christopher that they expected the United States to do more to end the 14-month-old war in Bosnia, adding that America's global leadership role was more important now than ever before, senior Turkish officials said.
The Turks have offered to join the United States and other NATO countries in the air rescue of peacekeepers guarding the "safe havens" designated by the United Nations, and would be willing to provide troops as peacekeepers in Bosnia. But Mr. Christopher said the United Nations did not want any Balkan country to take part for historical reasons. As for Turkish participation in providing air cover, he called it a "NATO decision."
As for the American human rights plan for Turkey, senior Administration officials said it has three goals: to work to eliminate torture in Turkey, to improve freedom of expression and to eliminate disappearances and extra-judicial uses of force and killings. The plan also offered what a senior official called "suggestions" on such issues as the monitoring of interrogations, the creation of an independent body to investigate complaints and assistance in training judges and prosecutors.
In the first sign that the United States wass prepared to reward good behavior by Turkey, the United States announced today that it would sell five Super Cobra helicopters worth $110 million and parts and supplies for A-10 fighter aircraft worth $167 million. Additionally, the United States is transferring from its used stock 31 older Cobras and 50 A-10 Warthog ground attack planes of the type used in the Persian Gulf war against Iraqi tanks and slow-moving vehicles. That deal is estimated at $59 million.
"Turkey lives in a tough neighborhood," Mr. Christopher said.

HEADLINE: Microsoft and 2 Cable Giants Close to an Alliance

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Three dominant technology and entertainment companies are on the verge of joining forces to create the equivalent of software for cable television -- an operating system that would combine the worlds of computing and television and perhaps shape how much of popular culture is delivered.
Time Warner Inc., the largest entertainment company; Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable television company, and the Microsoft Corporation, the largest software company, are expected to announce by the end of the month that they will form a company, tentatively called Cablesoft. This new venture, its creators hope, will lead the way in establishing a standard for the transmission of the coming generation of interactive programs. 
 At stake, essentially, is control of the unobtrusive cable box that sits atop many television sets. In recent months the box, which is expected to gain many more powers in coming years, has become a battleground for computer, telephone and cable companies.
 
 
'Gateway for Popular Culture'
 "This has tremendous economic and social importance; it is the gateway for popular culture," said James F. Moore, president of Geopartners Research Inc., a management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "This is the substitute for newspapers and magazines and catalogues and movies, and that gives it enormous economic potential for those who control the gateway."
The three companies have declined to discuss their negotiations, but several executives involved in the talks say that for several months the three chief executives -- Gerald M. Levin of Time Warner, John C. Malone of Tele-Communications Inc. and William H. Gates of Microsoft -- have been meeting face to face to hammer out the details.
These executives said that the deal had not yet been completed and that other companies, including regional telephone and software companies, might participate.
 
Antitrust Considerations
 Asked whether the potential alliance might raise antitrust concerns, Christopher O. B. Wright, an antitrust specialist at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, a law firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said: "All three of these companies have tremendous influence in their respective markets. But the question is will this translate into leverage in this new market."
Such joint ventures are often subject to scrutiny by Federal agencies, he said, but there has been little antitrust enforcement in high-technology in recent years.
The competition to establish an industry standard for interactive television reflects lessons learned from the early days of the personal computer business, in the late 1970's, when literally hundreds of companies were introducing incompatible equipment.
In recent months, the jockeying for position in the emerging interactive market has reached a feverish pitch, months, with large information companies jostling to line up on the inside track.
Last month, for example, the Intel Corporation, the world's largest chipmaker, Microsoft and the General Instrument Corporation announced plans to develop a cable converter that would have a built-in personal computer. Last Monday, Time Warner announced that Silicon Graphics Inc., a Silicon Valley computer maker, and Scientific Atlanta, a supplier of cable boxes, would supply hardware and software for its digital television trial in Orlando, Fla., which is scheduled for next year. A day before that announcement, Kaleida, a joint venture of International Business Machines and Apple Computer, said it was joining with Motorola Inc. and Scientific Atlanta to develop a similar futuristic television controller.
 Also last month, U S West, the regional telephone company based in Denver, said it would invest $ 2.5 billion in Time Warner to build advanced cable and information networks that would offer a range of services. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Viacom Inc. have announced a similar plan.
 
An Imposing Partnership
 Amid all this maneuvering, the dominance of Microsoft, Tele-Communications and Time Warner in their respective industries makes the prospective partnership an imposing one.
Tele-Communications, based in Englewood, Colo., is the largest cable systems operator; Time Warner, based in New York, is the second largest. Together they provide service to 30 percent of the nation's 57 million households with cable television. Time Warner, through its music companies, production studios and film libraries, has access to a vast storehouse of videos, which could be transmitted on demand. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has become the standard setter in the personal computer industry through its MS-DOS operating system and its Windows software.
Indeed, Microsoft's influence in the personal computer industry has aroused intense concern among competitors that its position is so dominant that it stifles competition. The Federal Trade Commission has been been investigating antitrust complaints against Microsoft since 1990, and a hearing is scheduled for next month.
And some people now worry that Microsoft hopes to wield similar influence in interactive television.
"It's going to make it tougher for us," said A. Nathaniel Goldhaber, president of Kaleida, the I.B.M.-Apple venture. "Bill Gates through sheer brilliance has extracted every possible dollar from the personal computer industry food chain. If he is allowed to, he will do the the same thing for the digital distribution of entertainment and information."
One executive involved in the current discussions, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said the partners did not want the alliance to be seen as threatening to other companies. "We don't have all the pieces together yet," he said.
 
Desire for a Standard
 "We don't want to do another Blockbuster," he added, referring to a recent joint venture announced by I.B.M. and Blockbuster Entertainment, which plans to develop technology that Blockbuster, which has nearly 3,500 video and music stores, could use to obtain any item a customer wanted. The venture drew immediate opposition from record companies.
At the same time, he said, there is tremendous interest in creating a standard for interactive television, because the sooner a common ground is found, a burst of new digital information and entertainment services are likely. "People are crying out for a standard," this executive said.
A number of industry executives have warned that despite the intense interest in interactive television on many fronts, it may well be years before systems are installed and before public appetite for such services is sufficient to provide the companies significant returns on their investments.

HEADLINE: Budget-Makers Try to Soften Election-Year Blow

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Faced with a difficult fiscal squeeze, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the leadership of the City Council have fashioned a recession election-year budget planned so that most New Yorkers will not notice it over the next few months.
Those next few months, of course, are an important political season in the city. Both the Mayor and the Council members hope that the spending cuts are gentle enough and the stabilization of taxes reassuring enough to most New Yorkers that the city's fiscal straits will not be on their minds come Election Day. This is not a buoyant budget, but it is one they can run on. 
 But the Mayor's opponents made it quickly clear that they will be trying to draw the attention of voters to what the budget does not do, which is address the long-term imbalance between the city's revenues and spending. The Mayor and the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, conceded the point yesterday and said they would address it -- but not until next year, after what they plan as their re-election.
Many things are likely to help decide the New York City mayoral race this fall: voters' perceptions of Mr. Dinkins's leadership; whether Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, can convince people that he would change city government; ethnic and racial fears and aspirations and unforeseeable events and crises.
Exactly how fiscal management will weigh in the voters' minds remains to be seen. Most do not pay close attention to the detailed swings in New York City's fiscal fortunes. The spending cuts and revenue re-estimates enabled the Mayor and Council leaders to balance their lean budget without causing changes in the kinds of essential services most New Yorkers would notice.
 
Inherent Problems
 But the inherent problems in the city's fiscal condition, after four years of a bruising recession, could well have an effect on broad impressions of Mr. Dinkins that voters will form over the next five months, some political consultants said.
Moreover, the Mayor and Mr. Giuliani are both now on record as saying that something must be done to bring the size of city government in line with the amount of revenue it collects. So it is reasonable to think that an important question in the campaign is how each proposes to accomplish that goal.
For now, at least, the Mayor has closed a budget gap for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, that at one point was estimated as high as $2.1 billion. He and Mr. Vallone took care of the last $300 million in potential shortfalls over the last eight days, agreeing on a series of spending reductions and other fiscal actions that basically avoid painful cuts to major services.
 
The Debate Takes Shape
 The outline of the coming political debate over this year's budget is already clear. Mr. Dinkins contends that he has made tough decisions, opting not to paper over the city's fiscal problems -- as sometimes happens in election years. And he blames Republicans in Albany and Washington for failing to come up with additional aid, forcing the city to trim back on the somewhat more expansive $31.4 billion spending plan that he proposed a month ago.
Mr. Giuliani, for his part, argues that the city's fiscal woes are basically of the Mayor's making. He faults Mr. Dinkins, a Democrat, for not taking the kinds of decisive actions that would prevent the city from having to perform a fiscal balancing act each spring to complete the budget for the next year.
Mr. Giuliani contends that the Mayor missed a major opportunity last January, when he backed off his long-held negotiating position with a coalition of 19 municipal unions in reaching a labor settlement. Mr. Dinkins had said that, because of the city's dire financial circumstances, he would grant raises only if they were financed through worker productivity. The Mayor ultimately settled on a modest wage increase, 8.25 percent over 39 months, but one that will still cost the city more than $420 million in the next fiscal year. Negotiations are continuing with the unions on productivity measures.
 
A Test of Management
 Mr. Giuliani, a former United States Attorney who lost to Mr. Dinkins by 2 percentage points in 1989, no doubt will try to use the budget as a test of the Mayor's management of New York City. He will insist that the Mayor has made a mistake by struggling to maintain the status quo at a time when a deeply troubled economy should have forced municipal leaders to rethink and dramatically scale back the size of local government.
Even during an era of austerity, Mr. Giuliani asserts, the size of the city's budget has grown significantly. He says that increase demonstrates poor management, while the Mayor says it shows the growth in the welfare case load, Medicaid costs and other expenses over which the city has little control.
Over the next few months, Mr. Dinkins will argue that he has kept the ship afloat in very turbulent waters. He notes often that he has balanced the budget each year on time and that he has prevented the city's finances from being taken over by the State Financial Control Board, thereby preserving local autonomy.
Mayoral aides contend that they have fundamentally reshaped several city agencies, including the probation department, and consolidated others. They also say that major change in the structure of city government cannot be accomplished by the Mayor alone.
One other element is likely to help shape the political debate over the budget. In the past, election-year budgets crafted during recessions have sometimes unraveled later in the year, often right after the primary or general election. Republicans on the City Council have sounded the cry that this budget may fall apart. So have some independent fiscal experts, who are concerned that some questionable elements of the budget -- including a $215 million loan backed by delinquent property tax payments and a proposed $55 million sale of the financially troubled Off-Track Betting Corporation -- could contribute to problems later.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, said last week that the budget was certain to unravel. "It's not an issue of if," Mr. Proctor said, "it's only an issue of when and how."

HEADLINE: Emigres in New York: Work Off the Books

SERIES: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- First of six articles.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Leida Fermin wanted at least a modest version of the American dream. She had not left behind her family in the Dominican Republic to go on welfare or to work forever, for a pittance, in a basement tailor shop. So last year, she lugged four used sewing machines and endless yards of pink taffeta into her Manhattan apartment, creating a tiny, illegal factory to make ruffled party dresses for little girls.
"I am using my talents to support my family decently, in the only way I know how," said Ms. Fermin, 52, a legal Dominican immigrant. "It is only basic survival, really. I mean, what options do I have?" 
 From Senegalese scarf vendors to Korean manicurists, from Polish asbestos removers to Mexican delivery boys, immigrants like Ms. Fermin are fueling a growing underground economy in the metropolitan region. This economy is reshaping the region's commercial life, changing the tempo of the city's streets and providing thousands of entry-level jobs for newcomers.
But it is also forcing some immigrants into a world of seven-day workweeks, meager pay, dangerous working conditions and no way out. When the Golden Venture hit a sandbar off Rockaway last weekend, the freighter dumped into the Atlantic Ocean's frigid waters hundreds of illegal immigrants destined for a miserable life underground. Despite dreams of success, they faced the reality of working endless $150-a-week jobs at restaurants and garment factories to pay off the Chinese smugglers who charged them up to $30,000 for the trip.
In many ways, the growth of the immigrant underground, which many believe robs Americans of jobs, represents a contemporary version of the era of pushcarts, casual laborers and sweatshops like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. In the last 10 years, as a new wave of immigrants flooded an area weakened by a recession, the immigrant underground was born again. With unemployment high, new immigrants, particularly those hampered by their lack of English and illegal status, moved underground to survive.
The underground economy, defined as all activity that is off the books and unregulated, is burgeoning in cities with large immigrant populations like Los Angeles, Miami and New York.
This unreported economy, however, is difficult to measure. In New York City, Elizabeth Holtzman, the City Comptroller, estimates that it has increased by 5 percent during the last 10 years to $54 billion, or 20 percent of the city's economy. That translates into $5 billion in unpaid taxes, about a quarter of which is owed by criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking and money laundering. Another sizable chunk of uncollected revenue comes from the underreported income of American business: moonlighters, consultants and the self-employed.
Immigrants dominate the sector that economists call the informal economy: non-criminal but underground ventures like peddling, gypsy-cab driving and Ms. Fermin's home factory. Whether this informal, immigrant economy is a revitalizing or a debilitating force is a point of fierce debate.
 
Neighborhood Revival
 Some experts believe that the immigrant underground lends vibrancy to New York City, providing job training and reviving low-income neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. Others see only the tax evasion that saps the city of revenue and the exploitation that keeps some immigrants hostage to unscrupulous employers.
For Ms. Fermin, there is no debate, just the reality of living with the fear of being caught as she stubbornly tends to her family in this country and back home.
When she first arrived, Ms. Fermin found a job as a $150-a-week seamstress, off the books. She sewed until midnight so often for such little money that she finally quit to go on her own. That also allowed her to employ her daughter and son-in-law, who had just arrived and did not have working papers.
"I felt very lucky that I had a skill and I didn't have to be a burden on the government," Ms. Fermin said. "I could just carve out my own little corner in the United States, and sew and sew until the kids here were legal and the kids I left at home didn't need me anymore."
 
The Growth
Cutting Corners In Hard Times
 The immigrant underground is not really underground at all. Instead, New York City sidewalks bustle with at least 10,000 illegal vendors, hawking handbags and panties from briefcases and folding tables, the modern-day pushcarts. On corners in Brooklyn and Queens, laborers gather daily awaiting stints in construction and gardening. In storefronts and basements, Chinese and Hispanic immigrants bend over sewing machines, hot presses and workbenches as sweatshops and illegal industrial homework, virtually nonexistent 20 years ago, proliferate anew.
Only the street vendors, the most visible representatives of the growing underground, have provoked political controversy in New York by raising the ire of tax-paying merchants. Most New Yorkers accepted the striking transformation of the city almost casually, considering it a tradition in a place that prides itself on being a pioneer discount environment.
"There's a real bargain mentality here," said Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Commissioner of Finance. "You're a real schnook if you pay retail for anything."
 
Temptation Abounds
 With the highest tax rate and rents in the country, New Yorkers, newcomers and natives, face an especially great temptation to skirt costly legal obligations when times get tough. And they did. Between April 1989 and now, 360,000 mainstream jobs vanished from New York City's above-ground economy.
As a result, by the late 1980's, street vendors created a $300 million-a-year industry. From restaurants and greengroceries to car repair shops and nail salons, cash businesses proliferated, many in only partial compliance with the law.
Further, union-dominated industries like construction and apparel manufacturing increasingly turned to immigrant subcontractors and workers to cut labor costs. Illegal industrial homework -- the sewing, knitting and assembling of goods for manufacturers in private homes -- became a $1 billion industry. Apparel sweatshops, which numbered about 200 in the early 1970's, multiplied to 3,500 to 5,000 in the last few years, according to union statistics.
Illegal immigrants were forced underground by a new law that created sanctions on employers who hired them. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, intended to curb the flow of illegal immigrants, had no such apparent effect. By the conservative estimate of the Census Bureau, 400,000 illegal immigrants live in New York City -- 5 percent of the city's population -- and 25,000 more arrive every year.
Even many legal immigrants now have little choice but to work underground, especially if they do not speak English or have special skills. Luciano Urena, a husky 47-year-old Dominican, moved to Brooklyn last year when he married a Dominican-American woman, but found that working papers were not much help.
Mr. Urena, who had little formal education and no English, had worked as a foreman in a cigarette factory in Santo Domingo. But after much pavement pounding in New York, he finally had to accept an off-the-books job earning $3.25 an hour, $1 less than minimum wage, as a supermarket security guard. He compensated by working 11-hour days, six days a week. After several months, however, when he asked to have taxes withheld, his boss became furious.
"The next day," Mr. Urena said, "he dismissed me."
Many new immigrants expect their sojourns in the informal economy to be temporary, a steppingstone into the American marketplace. But the recession has cost even many established immigrants their legal jobs, setting them back years.
Dorelus Bernardo, a legal Haitian immigrant of 13 years, first lost his factory job, then a job as a valet parker. With five children and a sick wife to support, he sank his savings into a van and took to the streets ferrying other immigrants around Brooklyn. But because he did not have a license -- van licenses are in limited supply -- he was issued many costly summonses. Eventually his van was seized and sold by the city. Nonetheless, with lines etching deeper into his tired face, Mr. Bernardo leased another van and returned to the roads.
Paying taxes is the least of his worries. "I'm just trying to keep my head above water," he said. "I have so many bills, so many bills."
 
The Debate
Source of Strength Or Serious Flaw?
 Whether the underground economy is a positive or negative force is a matter of debate, and the story of Dalia White raises some crucial issues.
When Ms. White immigrated illegally from the Caribbean five years ago, she quickly found work at $180 a week, off the books, as a live-in baby sitter on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But last year, when she had a baby of her own, Ms. White quit. She still needed another way to earn a living without papers, however, and when she looked around her Brooklyn neighborhood, she saw an opportunity. She crammed her one-bedroom apartment with cribs, creating an illegal day-care center for the children of other West Indian baby sitters who tend affluent couples' children for a living, off the books.
Ms. White believes that, illegal or not, she twice provided a service to American society, first to American couples who could not find affordable day care, then to the women of her own low-income community.
But critics of the underground economy say that she would never have immigrated if there was not a burgeoning illegal market for her low-cost labor. That market, they say, is created by working parents who unintentionally devalue the job of child care. If the salary and conditions were better, Americans would gladly work in their homes, they say.
"It is pure self-deception on the part of people in the middle and upper-middle class -- the Zoe Bairds of this world -- to think that the reason we get our children cared for and our shirts laundered for a fraction of their real price is because we're such a hospitable country to immigrants and no American would accept these jobs," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
Many experts, however, find such reasoning unrealistic.
"Is the underground economy good?" said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "I think it's essential. It provides entry-level work through natural networks, families and countrymen, and teaches people to be entrepreneurial and capitalist on a small scale. Once they become a little larger, they inevitably start participating in the mainstream economy. So where's the harm?"
For some, the harms are tax evasion and exploitation.
"A lot of people in business and government feel the only way to revitalize the economy is to allow the creation of a huge underground class in New York City, available just as cheap as Mexico's," said Wing Lam, executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association.
 
The Consequences
Many Hardships, Silent Complaints

 
 Last month, the police found Chinese immigrants locked in a warehouse in New Jersey as they worked off their debt to the smugglers who arranged their trips to the United States. They are among the rare immigrant workers who live so completely underground that they are invisible to American society.
In contrast, many new immigrants simply work off the books for businesses that operate quasi-legally. They often want to pay taxes because they eventually will need to present tax returns at their interviews for citizenship. But their employers refuse to report the wages so that they can avoid paying their due to the government.
"Many employers simply do not accept Social Security numbers from documented workers because they prefer to make them part of the underground economy," said Jennifer Gordon, a lawyer at the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, L.I.
Often they force employees to receive half their wages by check and half in cash. Some legal workers in Chinatown, where most shops are unionized, have a hard time earning $5,400 yearly on the books, the minimum required by the union to qualify for medical benefits. So they end up buying fake checks from their employers, often at more than face value, to offer the required proof to the union, workers said.
 
Mortgage Was Refused
 Henry Yu, a legal immigrant from Hong Kong, begged his boss at a Long Island City dry-cleaning service to put his entire salary on the books. Mr. Yu had failed to qualify for a mortgage because his W-2 form represented only half his yearly wages as a 67-hour-a-week presser, $10,400 when he really earned $21,000.
The boss refused and eventually dismissed Mr. Yu, replacing him with an undocumented immigrant.
Most illegal immigrants still find eager employers, especially in their ethnic community. Employers often do not ask to see their papers or they readily accept the phony documents that are ubiquitous. The average cost of a fake alien registration card, known as a green card, in Astoria, Queens, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is about $200, immigrants said.
Since they have no choice but to work underground, many illegal immigrants take it in stride. Some, like Idrissa Dodo, an immigrant from Niger, see it as a necessary phase in their incorporation into American society.
Mr. Dodo had worked for 10 years as an electrician with an oil company based in Gabon. He was restless. "I knew that I had, at any price, to see New York," he said. So he took a leave and flew to the United States on a business visa, arriving on Oct. 14, 1990.
Staying at a midtown hotel filled with Africans, he made enough contacts to get his first job, pumping gas on Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn at a station owned by a Russian immigrant. He was paid cash, $5 an hour.
After several holdups at gunpoint, Mr. Dodo turned, like many other Africans, to street peddling. But he hated the constant cat-and-mouse games with the police. So he consulted with a banker friend and registered as an alien to pay taxes. Now he only peddles legally, at flea markets. He has also started English classes and applied for classes in computer repair training.
"Once you get your bearing, there are a lot of opportunities here, even if you're illegal," he said. "But you have to be patient."
But others do not have the patience or confidence to be so sanguine and they are simply taken advantage of.
On a recent day, Yrma Gallardo, a floor worker at the Peggy & Soo garment shop in midtown Manhattan, layered strip after strip of hem lining on length after length of fabric. Her face was impassive. Long black hair streamed down her back.
An illegal immigrant from Puebla, Mexico, Ms. Gallardo was dismissed from her previous job when she missed two days because her baby was sick. To find her next job, Ms. Gallardo -- who does not read or write -- went from shop to shop. She had no idea when and what she would be paid.
"I have to work where I find work, no questions asked," she said.
The 1986 immigration law appears to have made it easier for those who prey on illegal immigrants, many of whom are immigrants themselves, advocates say. As a result of the law, which requires employers to check the immigration status of all employees, most bosses now know who is legal and who is not.
"Employers basically use it as a tool to suppress wages further," said Muzzafar A. Chisti, director of the immigration project at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
 
Deceptive Appearances
 For immigrant entrepreneurs, the benefits of running a business in the informal economy often outweigh the risks. The immigrant grocer or contractor operating in his own ethnic community often has a network of suppliers, a captive market of consumers, and access to cheap labor.
Some immigrant entrepreneurs, insulated from official scrutiny by their language and ethnic community, find it temptingly easy to operate solely in cash. Many keep their money away from banks, stashing it in their homes, circulating it through community collectives, investing it in real estate or wiring it to their native lands.
Tax-enforcement officials believe that many cash businesses dominated by immigrant owners report as little as 30 percent of their transactions. And sometimes, a vibrant immigrant shopping district, which looks to many like the picture of economic health, looks criminal to the tax collector.
In the last 10 years, for instance, Indian immigrants have created a bustling commercial center on 74th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens, as famous among Indians as Canal Street is among Chinese. But tax investigators say that most of its electronics and jewelry businesses operate largely underground. Using two sets of books, many store owners hide about 60 percent of their total sales, investigators say.
Still, on a Saturday, when the street is alive with shoppers perusing saris, intricate gold jewelry and toaster ovens, munching on flat bread and sniffing spices, the street's vitality seems to be a crystalline example of urban development, above ground as only New York's underground economy can be.

HEADLINE: Haitians Mourn the Loss of a Piece of Their Dream

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
Wilner Boucicault died living the American dream, shot down as he closed his furniture store, the largest Haitian-owned business in New York City, perhaps the entire country. To many of his countrymen struggling through life in a new land, he was the embodiment of what they were working to become and a source of help and advice on how to attain success in an unfamiliar country.
Mr. Boucicault arrived in New York 25 years ago from a suburb outside Port-au-Prince and worked as a parking attendant while he studied at the City University, an incubator of generations of immigrant success stories. Saving his money, he opened his store only a year ago, and he ultimately wanted to own a bank that would serve the needs of other Haitian-Americans. 
 And yesterday, when it came time to mourn him, 2,500 people turned out. On Church and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn, Haitian-Americans came out to say one last goodbye to a man who was as committed to their success as to his own.
But even as they mourned the 44-year-old Mr. Boucicault, there was mystery surrounding his death on June 5. The police said the killing seemed to have been part of a robbery.
 
'I Don't Understand'
 "I don't understand why this happened," said his wife, Evelyn, sitting elegantly on a white leather couch inside the family's five-bedroom home in Flatbush with its walls decorated with brightly colored Haitian paintings. "Willie had a big heart. Why would anyone do something like that. He was the community. I can never replace him."
Mr. Boucicault was a bon vivant who enjoyed listening to opera, wore Italian clothes and ate at the best restaurants in New York. He was also known as a lady's man, the father of nine children, ranging in age from 3 to 22.
Affectionately called "Willie," the round-faced businessman was a kind of celebrity among the city's Haitian-Americans, having become widely known through his sponsorship of several Haitian radio and television shows.
 
An Ability to Sell
 Jordany Pierre, who lives across the street from the store, which is at 2828 Church Avenue in Flatbush, said he had known Mr. Boucicault for more than five years.
"He was a good man," Mr. Pierre said, recalling how he had first met Mr. Boucicault, then a salesman working at another furniture store, when he walked into the store to buy a living-room set. Mr. Pierre said he did not have any money, yet Mr. Boucicault gave him a loan for the down payment and convinced the store's owner to finance the rest.
"He did not even know me," Mr. Pierre said. "He didn't have to do that, but he did. That was the kind of man he was. I just can't believe that now he is dead."
By all accounts, Mr. Boucicault cared deeply about his fellow Haitians in New York, a city that he had lived in since 1968, when he arrived as a student at age 19.
He had grown up in the working-class neighborhood of Martissant, a few miles outside of Port-au-Prince, the capital, where he was the leader of a popular neighborhood band called Samba Jazz.
 
Uncanny Maturity
 Eddy Robin, a grammar school classmate in Port-au-Prince, said that even then his friend showed an uncanny maturity, often settling schoolyard fights.
"He was born that way," said Mr. Robin, now a school administrator in New York. "It's the leadership ability in him."
Just like many Haitian teen-agers of that time, he was fascinated with the United States and the tales of returning immigrants about how New York was a city where money littered the sidewalks.
But after his arrival, Mr. Boucicault found that life in the United States was not so easy. Still he was determined to become a success.
After attending the City University of New York he took real-estate courses and became a broker. He then went into the furniture business, apprenticing at three different stores before saving enough money to open A and B Furniture and Appliances last July.
The store was an immediate success. With the contacts he had made while a salesman and his broad smile, his earlier customers followed him to the new business, which tapped the growing wealth of the largest Haitian enclave outside Haiti.
But Mr. Boucicault aimed for more than just the furniture store. His wife said that his next ambition was to own a bank that would give Haitian-Americans a greater economic presence and give them access to the American dream of owing a home or a business.
"He was always striving higher and higher," Mrs. Boucicault said.
Though he loved the United States, and was by all measures a success in business, he never wanted to become an American citizen despite having lived in New York for 25 years.
"He never wanted to lose his roots," Mrs. Boucicault said. "Willie was a typical Haitian."
Moments after he and several workers were closing the store on June 5, a teen-ager walked to the car, asked for the keys and shot him. Badly wounded, he managed to drive his Mercedes three blocks before crashing.
The news of Mr. Boucicault's death spread quickly among Haitian-Americans in Brooklyn, and within minutes more than 100 people had gathered at the emergency room of Kings County Hospital Center, unable to believe that he was dead.
Since the killing, the family has received an outpouring of support. The exiled Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sent a representative to extend his condolences. Mrs. Boucicault said that Mayor David N. Dinkins called and told her that 18 detectives were working on the case and that her husband's killing was receiving the same attention as when a police officer is killed.
"It's a total loss for the community," said Wilson Desir, Haiti's consul general. "We demand that the police investigate the incident and make sure that the criminal is caught."

HEADLINE: Waiting for a Rudder at I.N.S.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
When the freighter Golden Venture ran aground off Queens last weekend, it sparked the latest crisis to confront an immigration agency that has lurched from controversy to controversy without a leader since President Clinton took office.
At a most sensitive time in immigration history, Mr. Clinton has not yet nominated an Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner or publicly articulated an immigration policy distinct from his Republican predecessor. As most senior immigration jobs are empty, the agency is being run by holdovers from the Bush Administration in Washington. And into the vacuum local I.N.S. directors, career officials like William S. Slattery in New York, have moved to reassert their power and law-enforcement priorities. 
 To be fair, few recent Presidents have rushed to fill the top I.N.S. job upon assuming office. But the immigration issue carries a distinct urgency now. From the outset of his Presidency, when Mr. Clinton risked having his inaugural celebration disturbed by an exodus of Haitian boat people, one major problem after another has presented itself: Zoe Baird's hiring of illegal immigrants, the revelation of a World Trade Center bombing suspect's entry into the country by claiming political asylum, the Golden Venture, and last week's judicial order closing the detention camp for H.I.V.-positive Haitians in Guantanamo, Cuba.
 
Extremely Fragile Moment'
 "It's an extremely fragile moment for the agency to be rudderless," said Warren Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington. "Some of our most shameful, exclusionary immigration laws have been passed at moments just like this, when the country was suffering an economic downturn and foreigners were focused on as a threat."
While the White House has remained silent, many immigration experts expect that Mr. Clinton will nominate Doris M. Meissner as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And they believe that the nomination is imminent. Ms. Meissner, an immigration expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was the acting commissioner and an associate executive commissioner of the I.N.S. under President Reagan. Well-versed in immigration law and the arcane inner workings of the agency, Ms. Meissner is a safe choice, both an insider and a knowledgeable expert. Fellow immigration specialists believe she will probably focus first on the management problems plaguing the agency's notoriously inefficient bureaucracy.
During this interim period, however, without a central office to rein them in, local immigration directors have attempted to recapture some of the ground they lost under Gene McNary, the Commissioner under President Bush. Mr. McNary had tried to curb the discretionary power of the local offices, which historically made the agency a kingdom of barons without any monarch. Local directors felt that Mr. McNary did not give a high enough priority to enforcement and paid too much attention to the agency's human rights responsibilities, like running the political asylum system.
After the World Trade Center bombing and again after the grounding of the Golden Venture, Mr. Slattery seized the moment to make public appearances railing against the humanitarian leniencies of the asylum system. While advocates for immigrants have long criticized the Immigration and Naturalization Service for its backlogged system, Mr. Slattery and other officials turned the tables, blaming the supposedly crafty immigrants who stormed the gates.
 
Grabbing the Initiative
 Immigration lawyers in New York said it was unclear whether Mr. Slattery had been instructed to make an example of the illegal Chinese immigrants from the grounded freighter, or whether he had grabbed the initiative to get tough himself by keeping them in detention centers.
"Slattery cannot not conceive of an alien who has a legitimate claim of persecution, and he has been much admired during this interregnum by other career bureaucrats for reasserting the old-timers' cynicism about political asylum," said Arthur Helton, an immigration expert for the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights.
Rosemary LaGuardia, a spokeswoman for Mr. Slattery, said he was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
As local immigration officials have tried to reassert their autonomy, they have received mixed signals from the Clinton Administration about whether big change was really on the horizon.
 
'Immoral' Repatriation
 During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton criticized the Bush Administration's "immoral" repatriation of Haitian boat people, yet as President he embraced the same policy. Similarly, Mr. Clinton not only kept open the barbed-wire detention camp for Haitian refugees at the Guantanamo Naval Base, he also continued the Bush Administration's legal fight against closing it until a Federal judge ordered the camp shut down last week.
"It's confusing to the country that the Clinton Administration now has a headless immigration agency which is continuing the discredited practices of Bush," said Lucas Guttentag, who heads the immigration project at the American Civil Liberties Union.
And from the opposite camp, George High essentially agreed.
"It's very hard to know where this Administration really stands on an issue -- immigration -- that will have an enormous impact on this country," said Mr. High, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on immigration.

HEADLINE: In Canada's Race for Premier, Front-Runner Falters

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA, June 12

 BODY:
A few months back it looked pretty certain that Canada was about to get its first woman as Prime Minister, a cello-playing lawyer from Vancouver named Kim Campbell, who at 46 is the same age as President Clinton.
But when 3,850 Progressive Conservative delegates start voting on Sunday at their leadership convention here the glamorous former Justice Minister, who was once photographed bare-shouldered behind her legal robes, will feel the pressure from a folksy 34-year-old man from a small town in Quebec named Jean Charest. 
Though still trailing in the delegate vote counts, Mr. Charest, whose supporters gleefully hand out "Turtle Power" buttons to back up the image he paints of himself as the tortoise chasing the hare, has the momentum, and political analysts say the race is too close to call. In the convention frolics, Campbell posters say: "We eat turtles for breakfast. Burp."
Canada has recently been through a bad patch that includes constitutional turmoil; a long recession that has kept unemployment above 11 percent; a growing debt that threatens its credit rating, and fears that austerity teams from the International Monetary Fund will intervene.
 
Prime Minister Moves Out
 The race offers the excitement not only of new leadership but also of generational change. Although 27 million Canadians hold sway over the world's second largest land mass, this is a country with no compelling vision of its place in the world. It defines itself more by what it is not -- the United States -- than what it is, which some say is a failure of leadership.
After nine years, Brian Mulroney, who announced in February that he was resigning, has already moved out of 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, Canada's White House, to make way for his successor, who will be the 19th Prime Minister.
Whoever wins on Sunday -- voting will continue until one candidate wins a majority -- will become Prime Minister automatically and will fight a general election that has to be called by November against Jean Chretien, 59, who heads the Liberal Party, the main opposition. The winner on Sunday will be inaugurated a week from Monday.
So strong did Ms. Campbell, who is the current Defense Minister, appear in early spring that all other members of the Cabinet declined to enter the race except Mr. Charest, the Environment Minister, who did so reluctantly after a push from Mr. Mulroney "for the good of the party."
Mr. Mulroney had set the stage for what he hoped would be an exciting contest -- the first Tory convention since he beat out former Prime Minister Joe Clark exactly 10 years ago -- to rivet the country and galvanize the party. It was the first time in Canadian history that a Tory Prime Minister had announced his resignation while in office.
 
Weak Showing in Debates
 The turnabout in the fortunes of Ms. Campbell reflects a closer scrutiny of her ideas and background after the period that newspapers called "Campbellmania," a weak performance in five national television debates and some gaffes that she calls "honest talk."
As the convention opens, polls show Ms. Campbell still ahead in delegate support, though Mr. Charest is closing the gap and has what political analysts here call momentum. One survey last week for Maclean's magazine and CTV found that Ms. Campbell had the backing of 43 percent of the delegates, while Mr. Charest had 31 percent. Jim Edwards, a Member of Parliament from Alberta, was third with 7 percent.
But public opinion polls suggest that across the country Ms. Campbell is considerably less popular than Mr. Charest, seeming to give him the best chance of beating Mr. Chretien. Her reputation as a "loose cannon" is most often cited against her.
Ms. Campbell has landed in hot water for things like calling those who disagree with Tory budget-cutting policies "enemies of Canada"; quipping in a country that is nearly half Roman Catholic that she became an Anglican in her youth to ward off "the evil demons of the papacy," and labeling those who stay on the sidelines in the political process apathetic "S.O.B.'s."
In her defense, Ms. Campbell says she has always been plain-spoken.
"I don't want to feel that I have to walk around censoring myself -- 'Oh, is this safe?' -- and I'll get the advice of 18 people before I go out and say something."
She has also lately taken to accusing the press of truncating her remarks and reporting them out of context.
In an interview with The Globe and Mail, she asked, "Are you going to play those old games, the 'getcha, gotcha' game where you are going to grab a word out of something and make something out of it that it clearly was not, or are you going to allow a politician to be a person?"
But also alienating some earlier supporters is her failure to be specific on issues. "Her positions on policy questions too often seem vague or patently calculated," said Kenneth McRoberts, director of the York Center for Public Law and Public Policy.
Mr. Charest has yet to put his foot in his mouth. Most often cited against him is what he can do little about, his Quebec origins. Quebecers have been Prime Minister for 24 of the past 25 years. People worry that resentments in the rest of the country will boil over with still another Quebecer at 24 Sussex Drive.
 
Quebec as an Issue
 Mr. Charest, who is perfectly bilingual, says origins do not matter. Mr. Chretien, the Liberal leader, is also from Quebec, and has the support of large numbers of people outside the province. Yet during the campaign, Mr. Charest has reasserted his strong backing for minority language rights in Quebec to show, as he puts it, that he would become "Prime Minister of all of Canada."
In courting Quebec delegates, Ms. Campbell, on the other hand, has pledged a hands-off stance on provincial language matters.
As Sunday approaches, the competition has become ever more acrimonious. Campbell supporters are angry over what they consider assaults against her because she is a woman. Mr. Charest's communications adviser, Tim Raife, says westerners will not vote for a woman. Other Charest supporters have raised questions about the personal life of Ms. Campbell, who happens to have been divorced and to have not had children. Mr. Charest's wife, Michele Dionne, and often his three children campaign with him.
Ms. Campbell has responded that attacks on her as a woman or over her suitability for the job suggest that some Conservatives are uncomfortable with change.
"This campaign I'm involved in represents change," she told a Canadian television interviewer. "It represents reaching out and broadening the base of the party, and maybe some people are uncomfortable with that."
While the two front-runners represent generational change, their basic message so far has been one of just staying the course politically. Yet to materialize in months of speeches and trekking around the country are any new visions for Canada.
 
Public Mood 'Very Glum'
 Partly because Ms. Campbell and Mr. Charest are Cabinet ministers in the Mulroney Government, they have refused to criticize past policies or stake out any new directions in the bedrock Tory policies of free trade, the goods and services tax or privatization of government interests.
Both promise to balance the budget in four to five years, yet are vague on details. Both say they want to humanize economic policy and emphasize job creation. Ms. Campbell calls it the "politics of inclusion." Mr. Charest says the "role of leadership is to help end the hurting and start the healing."
While such words may soothe Tory delegates, they may not be enough for most Canadians.
Donna Dasko, poll taker at the Environics Research Group, said the public mood was "very glum in all the polls we do."
"Canadians may feel somewhat better having a new leader," she said, "but they may well want more than that, a change in the party in power."

HEADLINE: REBELS IN ANGOLA CALL FOR U.S. ROLE

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Despite the Clinton Administration's recent diplomatic recognition of Angola's formerly Marxist Government, guerrillas in the southern African nation are urging the United States to broker a peace accord to end the civil war there.
"There is no other country, no other observer that can do it," said Fatima Roque, the shadow economic minister for the rebel organization that goes by the Portuguese acronym Unita, during a visit to Washington this week. 
 Frustrated by the collapse of a 1991 peace pact and angered by the rebels' refusal to accept the results of free elections last fall, the United States granted recognition on May 19 to the Government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The decision, long expected, ended 18 years of official enmity toward the ruling Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola.
Peace talks between the Angolan Government and the rebels broke down three days later over Unita's refusal to withdraw from towns and villages it has conquered since the civil war resumed last October.
 
Military Aid Discussed
 Since the talks collapsed last month, the rebels have retaken the northern oil-exporting town of Soyo and shelled some offshore oil platforms that belong to American companies, Clinton Administration officials say. They now hold most of Angola's territory.
Even as the guerrillas say they want the United States to help get the negotiations back on track, the Clinton Administration is drawing up options to support the Angolan Government in case the talks cannot be revived and the Unita offensive continues to gain ground. A senior Administration official said on Friday that these options could include providing military aid to Angola.
"We have asked the bureaucracy to think about options down the road if the negotiations do not succeed," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He emphasized that none of the options had been presented to the White House.
Still, the discussion of military aid as an option, however remote at this stage, is a sea change from the cold war years, when the United States armed and supported Unita to combat a Government viewed by Washington as a Soviet proxy. A peace accord reached in May 1991 led to internationally supervised elections in which Mr. dos Santos's party won a parliamentary majority last September.
 
Rebel Offensive Deplored
 Also emblematic of Washington's shifting post-cold-war policy is the harsh criticism of the rebels for the breakdown in talks and the offensive launched recently by Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader. Unita stands for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
Unita representatives met this week with the Assistant Under Secretary of State for African Affairs, George E. Moose, who handed them a copy of a communique in which the United States, Russia and Portugal said the rebel group's recent military actions "call into serious question Unita's intention to reach a negotiated settlement." Portugal was Angola's colonial ruler until 1975.
The communique said the three countries had discussed "potential actions that could be taken should Unita continue to fail to respond to appeals" to end its military campaign and return to the peace talks.
The envoys suggested that the Clinton Administration's decision to recognize the Angolan Government might make Washington a more effective mediator between the sides.
"I think the United States and the Clinton Administration can play -- has to play -- an active role in order to make the Angolans find a solution to end the war," Ms. Roque said. "I think they have to maintain the same relationship that they've made now with the M.P.L.A."
Last month, Unita harshly condemned the Clinton Administration for extending diplomatic recognition to Mr. dos Santos's Government. State Department officials said Unita's new conciliatory remarks seem to be aimed at convincing supporters of the guerrillas inside Angola that the rebel movement's ties to its former benefactor were still strong. "We feel it's for internal Unita consumption to demonstrate they are not isolated," said a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ms. Roque and Jorge Veiga Morgado, a Unita member in the Angolan Parliament, maintain that Unita is refusing to withdraw from areas it has recently captured or lay down its arms because it fears that its leadership and fighters would be slaughtered by Government troops. What is needed, they say, is a United Nations buffer force that is at least as large if not larger than the 5,700-member contingent that is to be deployed in Mozambique.

HEADLINE: Albany Pressured to Draw Plans to Reduce Pollution

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 10

 BODY:
Imagine the impact on New York City traffic if large stretches of the Gowanus Expressway, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and the Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges had to be shut down because there was no longer money for repairs.
That's the nightmare that state officials are depicting to prod the Legislature into enacting a plan that would meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act before the current legislative session is scheduled to end June 25. Failure to do so could cost the state billions in roadway repair dollars. 
 As the clock winds down in the Capitol, the three sides that must formulate the complicated and long-delayed legislation -- the Democratic-controlled Assembly, the Republican-led Senate and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- have so far been unable to resolve the differences that have divided them since the Clean Air Act was revised in 1990.
 
Costly Failure
 A failure to agree on the sweeping plan -- which must, among other tasks, show how the state intends to reduce pollution in the New York City metropolitan region 15 percent by 1996 and 3 percent each year thereafter -- could have dire consequences. Under the Clean Air Act, the state would automatically lose all its Federal transportation money, about $1 billion a year, or face severe pollution-control measures that could virtually halt its economic development.
Among the proposals that have hamstrung the three sides, in part along partisan lines, have been those to establish fees on factory and power plant emissions, curb the number of people who drive to work and create a more sophisticated car inspection and maintenance program.
In an effort to lower pollution levels that, largely because of New York City's smog, are among the highest in the nation, the legislation may also lead to regulations that address matters like the kinds of lawnmowers and barbecues that New Yorkers can use.
State transportation officials, who stressed that they were taking the looming deadline seriously and working closely with important legislators, said a loss of Federal money would truncate the bulk of their capital-construction program, triggering a rash of delays on highways and bridges throughout the state. And because the sanctions are mandatory, they said they were not counting on being rescued at the 11th hour by the Clinton Administration.
"I don't think this is an idle threat from the Federal Government," said David Murray, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. "The stakes are very high."
To underscore the seriousness of the dispute, Carol M. Browner, the administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, sent a letter to Governor Cuomo and other lawmakers this week imploring them to address a major part of the plan that involves permits for and fees on "stationary" pollution sources, like factory smokestacks.
 
Urging Prompt Action
 The three sides, riven partly by competing business and environmental interests, have disagreed over how high the fees should be, although the E.P.A. recommends a fee of $25 per ton of emissions.
Since that aspect of the state's plan must be filed with Federal authorities by Nov. 15, Ms. Browner wrote that she was "concerned" that the legislative session was drawing to a close and that no legislation had been passed. The next session is not scheduled to convene until January 1994.
While the state technically has a grace period of up to 18 months after the deadline to file an acceptable plan before penalties are levied, Ms. Browner emphasized that she was in no mood to wait and that "the consequences are severe." And she warned that penalties could be imposed before the 18 months were up.
In addition to smokestack fees, lawmakers must also find ways to encourage drivers to car pool or switch to mass transit and to consolidate the number of stations that perform car-emissions testing so as to improve monitoring.
The Clean Air Act requires that by 1996, companies in the metropolitan region employing more than 100 people reduce the number of people who drive to work alone. Last November, New York missed the act's first major deadline, which required states to submit a plan to encourage employers to comply with that aspect of the act. Several dozen other states also missed the deadline.
In January, the state was told that its initial plan was inadequate and that it had until mid-1994 at the latest to file an acceptable plan before mandatory sanctions were imposed.
 
Limp Response
 It is widely agreed that, because of the legislative calendar, the outlines of a plan must be in place by the end of the current session if the state has any hope of having a program in place next year. But the three sides have yet to resolve how such a program would work.
"Without doubt, this is the greatest environmental challenge New York has ever faced," said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby. "And it's still being treated as a run-of-the-mill dispute that business-and-politics-as-usual will solve."
"Frankly," he said, "I'm not sanguine about the possibility that they will come to their senses."
Further complicating matters has been the decision by a Federal judge in January that blocked the adoption of stringent emissions standards for new automobiles sold in the state beginning in 1995. Known as the California low-emission vehicle standards, they are stricter than Federal guidelines and are a linchpin of a plan that Governor Cuomo presented last year to bring the state into compliance with the clean-air law.
The judge's decision, which deemed the standards illegal because they placed an undue burden on car manufacturers, delighted Republicans and others who had objected to the standards because they might increase car prices. But the ruling left the Governor and other Democrats scrambling to compensate for the improvements that would have resulted from the cleaner cars. The state is appealing the ruling.
Unless the state can somehow find a way to switch to the cleaner cars, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Scarsdale Democrat who is the chairman of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, believes lawmakers will have to consider such Draconian pollution controls as closing Manhattan to traffic, establishing a fee to drive into the city or imposing tolls on all East River crossings.

HEADLINE: What's Audubon Doing in New York City?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter A. A. Berle's self-congratulatory article on the retrofitting of Audubon House ("Take a Tour of This Building, and Save!," Viewpoints, June 6) carefully avoided the most important question: Why is an environmental organization spending $24 million on a headquarters building in New York City? 
 The answer should be obvious to those who have watched the environmental movement evolve from the grass roots to the canopy of the political rain forests. Mr. Berle's building sits in New York City to best serve its true constituency: wealthy contributors. His $24 million fund-raising gimmick may impress them, but it looks like craven excess to me.

HEADLINE: About That American Industrial Policy . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "Wall Street: The Reason It's So Far From Washington" (Viewpoints, May 9) and "An Industrial Policy Is Not Outdated" (Letters, May 30), one often-heard phrase is that the Government cannot pick "winners and losers."
People seem to forget that our foreign competitors have been doing just that -- the Japanese, for example, in optoelectronics and the Europeans, through the Airbus joint venture, in the large long-distance commercial aircraft business. 
 In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission decided to forgo analog HDTV in favor of digital technology for HDTV. Competitors in Japan and Europe who were pushing analog have now abandoned it in favor of digital. Again, people seem to forget: the F.C.C., a regulatory agency, has actually set "industrial policy."
The point to be made is that all government agencies play a part in establishing an "industrial policy" and have to work together, rather than squabble over bureaucratic turf.

HEADLINE: Tight-Money Tactics of Depression Era Return

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Federal Reserve Prepares for a Rate War" (Business Day, June 1) reports that the Federal Open Market Committee on May 18 gave Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Chairman, "leeway to raise short-term interest rates, now 3 percent, by up to one-half of 1 percent before the next meeting in early July."
If this information, leaked from the supposedly secret meeting of the Federal Reserve's main policy-making committee, proves correct, it strongly indicates the Fed's policies of tight money will continue at the peril of the United States economy. 
 While the prospect of higher interest rates is making headlines, an equally important story is being overlooked -- the Federal Reserve's campaign to tighten the money supply. For a year and a half, and especially over the last three months, the Federal Reserve has engineered money growth far below the target ranges that it presented to the House Banking Committee in 1992 (2.5 percent to 6.5 percent) and in 1993 (2 percent to 6 percent).
This year, for the first time since the end of World War II, the basic money supply defined as M2 was negative for an entire quarter of a year. Money growth corrected for inflation and population growth (real per capita money supply) is falling rapidly, just as it has before every recession since 1960. Raising interest rate targets now would mean slowing the money supply even more. And that would severely damage the economy.
The Federal Reserves's campaign of tightening the money supply now is similar to its policies in the Great Depression of the 1930's, which devastated our country for a decade. In September 1932 a majority of Federal Reserve governors explained why they opposed expanding the money supply, stating that they supported the "10th annual report of the Federal Reserve Board (1923) -- 'The Federal Reserve supplies the needed additional credit in times of business expansion and takes up the slack in times of business recession.' "
At the Nov. 15, 1932, Open Market Policy Conference, the Federal Reserve decision makers stated:
"All the members of the conference were of the opinion that there is no occasion to buy more securities at the present time. The question for the decision of the conference, therefore, was whether the system should now sell some of its present holdings or leave the account stationary."
In other words, at the height of the Great Depression, when 24.1 percent of American workers were idled, the central bank pushed for even slower money growth, though the money supply had already fallen. This lack of sensitivity to the plight of the average working man and woman is still difficult to fathom, much less accept.
Again today, the high priests of sacrifice and pain are putting out messages to the public that, regardless of the pain they cause, the Federal Reserve fears the mere possibility of inflation so much that they prefer killing growth to taking any risk that healthy growth might entail. But like their 1932 forebears, they ignore the damage their mistaken policy does to the whole country.
There are positive rates of monetary growth that are consistent with moderate inflation or none at all. It is too bad the Federal Reserve is determined to stop any possibility of inflation through a policy of slow or negative money growth. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. Sound money and sound growth are not inconsistent, incompatible or even impossible goals.

HEADLINE: JUNE 6-12: No to Colt;
Connecticut Gives Up Some Guns and Butter

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
A glaring conflict of interest in considering legislation is supposed to prompt lawmakers to excuse themselves from voting, but this one could not be avoided: Was Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, 47 percent owned by the Connecticut state employee pension fund, a maker of assault weapons or not? Should the company's best-selling rifle, the Sporter, be banned in the state where it is made?
Last week, by the barest of majorities and with much angst on the part of some legislators, Connecticut said yes. 
 The new gun law, which was immediately signed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., made Connecticut only the third state in the nation, after New Jersey and California, to impose an absolute ban on the sale of a type of gun that the police say is showing up in greater numbers in the hands of urban drug gangs.
But it is surely the first state where legislating restrictions has required such searing self-examination about how the goals of economic development, urban social policy and law enforcement can fit together. Meanwhile, gun shop owners and distributors say that Sporters and other guns covered by the law, which does not take effect until Oct. 1, are flying off the shelves.

HEADLINE: CRUISES;
Running Away to Sea: A Brief but Shipshape Trip

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
IT was time for a sea change. Terra firma had grown too familiar. The little ad caught my eye. "Windjammer cruises from Mystic, Conn.," it said. "That's the ticket," I said to myself, and added, "Shiver me timbers." I have no idea what that means. Somehow it sounded right.
I called the number listed and communicated my interest to an answering machine that greeted me by saying, "Ahoy there." Presently a pamphlet arrived offering a variety of accommodations and departure dates on the Mystic Clipper. There were five-day, three-day and two-day voyages to choose from. We signed on for a weekend sail, sending off $518 for two berths. 
 Following instructions that came by mail, we drove up on a Friday evening, arriving after dinner at the pier in downtown Mystic where the Clipper was tied up. She was a 120-foot twin-masted vessel, and even in the dark I liked the cut of her jib, or would have if her sails had not been furled.
We were welcomed aboard by Craig Van dewater, the first mate, who told us we would be heading out for Shelter Island in the morning. It turned out he was also a bassoonist with the Nassau Symphony Orchestra. This happenstance is all the more amazing when you consider that the Oxford English Dictionary defines windjamming as both sailing a vessel and playing a wind instrument. I had left my O.E.D. behind and so did not learn this until I got home. I'm sorry I did not have a chance to talk about it with Mr. Vandewater.
 
Two Bunks and a Skylight
 He showed us to our cabin, one of six that shared a head down a gangway toward the bow. The head had a toilet and a shower with hot and cold water. Our cabin, the cheapest of the private quarters, was neat, cozy and functional. It was also very small, suitable only for two people who were quite fond of each other. There were two bunks, a sink, a skylight and reading lamps. Since my wife was recovering from a broken arm, I did not protest when she took the lower berth, and I set about practicing getting into and out of the upper one, which jutted out just a foot below the ceiling.
Eventually I adapted a version of a high jumper's approach and got to the point where I could almost get into bed without bumping my head or scraping my shins. Then I practiced sleeping.
That proved taxing. The problem was that I was kept awake by my concern about what would happen when I awoke. Would I sit up, as was my custom, and thereby risk a concussion or a bloody nose? The prospect gave me a lot to worry about, but since worrying has been a hobby for a long time, I was quite happy.
My wife said I did sleep, and on Saturday morning, I rose to the sound of ship's bells, the smell of pancakes and bacon, and a glorious sunny Saturday morning. My wife and I met the 12 other passengers and our captain, John Eginton. Like Mr. Vandewater and three of the remaining four crewmen, he had a fine nautical beard. Inspired by it, I vowed not to shave for the length of the voyage.
 
A Pancake Tradition
 By 9 A.M., the Clipper set out under power down the Mystic River. Just ahead lay a drawbridge. The crew gave out cold pancakes, instructing us to throw them at the man who operated the bridge. "It's a tradition," the cook said. I had read enough to know that it is dangerous to ignore tradition at sea, so with the rest of the passengers, I scaled pancakes, missing badly. The man on the bridge threw his own pancakes and came closer.
Once we reached Long Island Sound, Captain Eginton gave orders to hoist the Clipper's 5,000 square feet of sail. The passengers joined in hauling for a minute or two to raise the two larger sails.
It was not quite 10 A.M., and we were left to our own devices. I was eager for distractions. In a pattern that continued throughout the journey, the other passengers were mostly paired off in what appeared to be married couples. They were all friendly enough, but conversations tended to resemble the banter at a table of a wedding reception where no one knew one another: "The ship is very beautiful, isn't she?" or "Did it take you long to get here?"
 
Steerage Class, Too
 I chatted with the captain at the wheel, learning that on our course to Shelter Island we would be bucking tides and head winds. The routes, he said, were determined largely by weather conditions, with possible destinations including Block Island and Newport, R.I., and on the longer sails Martha's Vineyard.
I learned that the ship was nine years old and had been built in Rhode Island on the model of a Baltimore coastal schooner similar to the kind used by Yankee privateers in the Revolutionary War. The design had been adapted especially for passengers and was certified to take as many as 56 overnight passengers.
There were two other kinds of cabins in addition to ours: one a little larger that cost $269 a person for a weekend voyage, and two so-called owners' cabins, which have their own heads and showers, for $289 a person. There is also something like steerage class available in the dining hall, where 14 bunks flop down and can be curtained off to provide privacy. Such accommodations, which went unused on our sail, cost $229 a bunk for the two-day sail.
After chatting, I began scanning the horizon. We passed New London, Conn., and I thought of Eugene O'Neill, who grew up there and wrote of "dat ol' davil, sea." We passed North Dumpling Island, where we saw a lighthouse and a recently built, scaled-down version of Stonehenge. Mr. Vandewater told me the island had been purchased by someone who had playfully seceded from the United States, issuing visas and setting up his own currency, the dumpling.
We passed some cormorants and enough expensive-looking pleasure craft to make me wonder about my standing in the economic pyramid. We passed Fishers Island and in the distance could see Plum Island, where the Army reportedly raises and maintains all kinds of killer bacteria. I tried to hold my breath.
Then I lay down on a mattress on deck intent on reading. I read three pages and fell into a very pleasant sleep, awakening just in time for a lunch of crab salad. Like all the meals aboard, it was quite good and ample.
After lunch, I played Scrabble with my wife. We tried to use only nautical terms, but we failed. Later I read, scanned and slept. In the face of a stiff wind, Captain Eginton tacked along a zigzag course for Shelter Island, arriving to tie up at Dering Harbor. There was just enough time for a brisk walk through the tiny commercial center before all of us, crew and passengers, gathered for a steak dinner in the lounge.
The conversation continued on deck, but the sun and sea and relaxation had taken their toll, so we turned in relatively early. I seemed to be getting the hang of things, and I slept much better.
As Sunday morning broke hazy, I felt myself being drawn into the increasingly familiar rhythms of life afloat: breakfast, hoisting sails, scanning, chatting, reading, napping, eating and waiting to eat.
 
Fellow Travelers in the Mist
 Now the wind was at our backs, and we were on a much more direct course than on the outward passage, in which we were forced to sail 50 miles to cover a point-to-point distance of about 28 miles.
There was one stretch of the Sound where giant tankers kept looming through the mist. As I listened to their pilots give their positions over the radio, I noticed that our captain and crew were not worried. This, I realized, was my moment. I knew just enough about vectors to calculate the chances of collision. There I was along the starboard rail, silently and happily worrying as I mentally plotted converging courses and watched one tanker after another pass us at distances of at least a mile.
And so it went, napping, eating, reading, chatting, hoisting, more waiting to eat, scanning, and anticipating collisions and disasters. But in fact, there were no tragedies or dramas. It made me wonder what would have happened to literature if Conrad, Melville, Stevenson and O'Neill had known only such smooth sailing. No mutinies, no shipwrecks, no tempests, no failures of nerve, no crazed crewmen or breaching whales.
The Clipper returned to its berth on the Mystic River. It was late Sunday afternoon. We shook hands with our fellow passengers and the crew members, thanking them for safe adventure. We drove the 130 miles back to the city, and all along the way we could still feel the gentle pitching of the sea in our legs. After two days before the mast, home were the sailors, home from sea.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: New York Hotels;
New York City Hotels Battling the Blues

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
SEVERAL years ago, when Regent Hotels International decided to put up a 52-story luxury hotel at 57 East 57th Street, it seemed like a great idea. The New York economy was booming, hotels were commanding impressive room rates, and occupancy rates were high.
By last August, when the Four Seasons bought all the Regent properties, New York wasn't such a boom town anymore. The Four Seasons professed to be unworried. After all, the company, whose Pierre Hotel has been astriking success, would have its name emblazoned on a luxury property. 
 "This was an extraordinary opportunity to put our name on a global billboard," said Thomas Gurtner, the new hotel's manager.
Still, the Four Seasons opened this month into a sobering environment. Its 24-hour room service, I.M. Pei design, health club and business center will undoubtedly pique the interest of business travelers. And the remodeled St. Regis Hotel on 55th Street and Fifth Avenue, which many thought would be its biggest competitor, claims to have "exceeded all expectations" since it reopened 21 months ago.
But Stephen Alden, the St. Regis' director of marketing, declines to give occupancy figures. And whether the Four Seasons, at room rates of $295 to $3,000, will draw enough guests to justify the more than $1 million a room the hotel has cost is another question altogether.
"The return on that kind of investment is almost a mathematical impossibility," said Philip G. Georgas, regional vice president of Omni Hotels, which owns the Omni Berkshire on 52d and Madison.
It's probably cold comfort, but the Four Seasons will not be struggling alone. Occupancy in all hotels dropped sharply in recent years, and few guests are paying the full published rates. Hoteliers that want to bail out are finding that buyers willing to pay decent prices are scarcer yet.
The result is that most people who run hotels in the city are hunkering down for the long haul. They are abandoning their scattershot marketing, aiming instead at particular customer groups. They are asking repeat visitors for suggestions on how to improve their service and physical plant -- and, in many cases, spending millions of dollars to follow those suggestions. And they are rebuilding themselves and their sales forces, all in hopes that, when and if business does pick up, they will be in position to shine.
"IN just about every segment, from foreign tours to corporate travel, we have to work twice as hard to generate business," said Sam Haigh, president of Doral Hotels & Resorts, which owns four Manhattan hotels.
The numbers tell a sorry tale. The recession and the Gulf War hurt hotels throughout the country in 1991. But New York had two added things against it. It is overbuilt: more than 6,000 hotel rooms were added in Manhattan in the last five years. And the three-year-old 5 percent state tax on rooms that go for more than $100 a night has brought taxes on most New York City hotel rooms to a staggering 21.25 percent, effectively driving lucrative convention business to Chicago, Las Vegas and other cities. The hotel industry has been lobbying Albany to get the tax repealed, but so far there's no movement.
"Everybody we talk to has said, 'You are absolutely right, this tax has got to go,' " said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City. "We're guardedly optimistic, but we've got to continue knocking on doors, seeking legislative help."
For now, occupancy and revenues remain dismal. PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels, says that the occupancy level in Manhattan for the four months ended April 30 was 62.7 percent, only seven-tenths of a point above the 62 percent for the same four months last year and well below the 72.2 percent of 1990.. Average room rates were down to $135.36, 30 cents below the same period last year and $5.49 below 1990's peak. Although the second half of the year is traditionally stronger for hotels, and both occupancy and room rates will probably end higher (see chart), no one predicts anything approximating a rebound.
Payroll costs, meanwhile, continue to go up, with hotels struggling to meet union contracts they agreed to in more halcyon days.
"PAYROLL costs can kill profitability if a hotel isn't doing great," said Jeffrey S. Wilder, a partner in the Wilder Group, a New York hotel brokerage.
Not surprisingly, a lot of hotel owners would just as soon leave the market. But hotel sales remain few and far between.
The Helmsley Palace, which has been seeking a buyer since Leona Helmsley ran into her legal troubles, is on the auction block and industry insiders expect it to go for as little as $200 million, well below what it could have commanded a few years ago. Other hotels rumored to be on the block, including the Sheraton Russell and the Millenium, are barely getting nibbles.
"Lenders and investors alike are still pretty skittish about real estate in general and hotels in particular," said Sean Hennessey, a senior vice president and national manager of Landauer Associates' hotel division.
The few hotels that are being sold are going for a song. According to John A. Fox, a director at PKF Consulting, four years ago hotels commanded prices as high as $400,000 a room; today's buyers offer less than half that. And many would-be sellers simply do not have the option of selling at a loss.
"Sellers who bought or refinanced in the '80s have big mortgages that they can't cash out unless they cover their debt," Mr. Fox said. "Buyers aren't offering them enough to be able to do so."
Hotel owners readily concede that problem. Doral, for example, is selling "select" properties elsewhere in the country, but in Manhattan it is trying instead to restructure debt at its more-highly-leveraged properties.
"Now is not the time to sell real estate assets in Manhattan if you don't have to," Mr. Haigh said. "You just can't sell today for a price that lets you take positive equity out and still service debt."
Sales are a bit brisker outside Manhattan. For two years the Crowne Plaza in Stamford, Conn., was on the market, with an asking price of nearly $15 million; two months ago New Castle Hotel Corporation, a Shelton, Conn., company that specializes in turning around ailing hotels, bought it for $4 million. Now the company is looking for similar bargains in the New York hotel market.
"New York sellers definitely are getting more flexible," said David J. Buffam, New Castle's president.
Indeed they are. A group of Italian investors bought the Parc Fifty-One, now the Michelangelo, for $42 million last year; just three years ago, Park Lane Hotels paid $71 million for it. The bankrupt Prince George Hotel on East 28th Street sold this year for about $8 million; just two years ago its owners were still asking $20 million.
And a group of European and South American investors just agreed to buy the Collingwood, on 35th Street west of Fifth Avenue. The sale is rumored to be for about $5 million. Bernard Sillins, one of the Collingwood's owners, did not confirm that number, but says ruefully, "We got a lot less than we would have gotten five years ago."
In this troublesome environment, the niche hotels seem to have the best chance of survival. Later this year, when British Airways opens the condominium-turned-hotel that it owns at 127 East 55th Street, it will have a captive audience -- it is using it to house its own flight crews.
The Fitzpatrick on Lexington Avenue, which is owned by Irish investors, is doing well attracting Irish visitors. Similarly, Mr. Wilder and some California partners have been turning the old Latham Hotel on 28th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues into a half-youth hostel, half-budget private rooms for foreign travelers.
About half the hotel's 160 rooms are renovated and rentable, and Mr. Wilder says business is brisk.
But competition for niches is getting fierce. Manhattan East Suite Hotels, which operates nine hotels, has kitchens in most of its rooms, making it attractive for longer-term stays. Its occupancy rates are about 80 percent, well below the better than 90 percent in 1990 but still above industry averages.
PRESSURE on rates has been intense and competition has been heating up. The long-mothballed Sutton Hotel on East 56th Street near First Avenue has reopened as a long-term destination, offering 84 apartments for minimum stays of 30 days. And conventional hotels are modifying some rooms to attract corporate contracts.
So Manhattan East finds itself fighting to guard its turf. The hotel chain has started sending thank-you letters to first-time visitors, complete with questionnaires asking what else they might like to see on their next visit. It is offering corporations that sign contracts for at least 100 room nights a year a guaranteed rate and a guaranteed room at one of the other properties if their first-choice one is booked.
And it has developed a computer data base that will help it promote directly to regular customers. For example, someone who often visits at Christmas might get a letter offering a special holiday rate for next Christmas.
"Sure, we want new customers, but we are really trying to develop programs to retain the customers we have," said Priscilla Hurley, director of advertising.
But perhaps the fiercest competition these days is for the business traveler. Hotels like the St. Moritz and the two Sheratons on Seventh Avenue and 52d Street, which have traditionally catered to the leisure crowd, are now chasing corporate business. Hotels like the Vista International, which had marketed itself more to the domestic business crowd, is now chasing international business travelers.
Many of them have totally rebuilt themselves to go after those new markets. ITT Sheraton, which owns the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Manhattan, has spent close to $200 million to renovate both hotels. Much of the money went into refurbished meeting facilities and amenities like a fitness center. Now the hotel is actively marketing itself to groups like the American Society of Association Executives and Meeting Planners International, groups whose members can influence where their companies hold conventions and seminars.
"We used to be a destination place for people attending functions at the Javits Center," said Stephen D. Powell, director of sales and marketing for both hotels. "Now we want our meeting facilities to be the destination."
SO does the Vista International. The Vista, which once owned the market for Wall street-oriented traffic, has had to contend with fierce competition from the newer Marriott Financial Center and, to a lesser extent, the Millenium. Its occupancy, which used to be well over 70 percent, had been mired in the 60 percent range, as much because of competition as of the recession.
The hotel already had plans to transform its second floor into a high-technology business meeting center when the explosion on Feb. 26 in the World Trade Center garage forced the entire hotel to close for extensive repairs. The hotel is unlikely to reopen before late fall. But it is using its enforced hiatus to reposition itself in its market.
It is redoing its lobby and its ballroom and is carving out a new entrance from the nearby plaza directly to the second floor, which it hopes will increase traffic flow to its restaurants. And it plans to promote its relationship to the World Trade Center.
"That link makes no difference to downtown corporations, but in international markets the World Trade Center is an attraction in itself," said Jean-Claude Noel, senior vice president of the Americas for Hilton International, which manages the Vista.
The hotels that are part of large chains may have an easier time getting the word out. The Hotel Maria, on Lafayette Street near Canal Street, has been doing far better since it became the Holiday Inn Downtown and could hook in to Holiday Inn's worldwide reservation system. The new Four Seasons, too, is part of a chain that has 45 hotels and numerous branch sales offices around the world, all of which are geared up to refer travelers to the new New York location.
Chains with several New York properties, meanwhile, are looking for marketing synergies between them. Each of Doral's four hotels in New York used to have its own sales staff; now the company has combined them into one staff that will market all four properties. "We can't let our own hotels compete with each other any more," Mr. Haigh said.
The independents, or those whose affiliated hotels are widely scattered, are having to work much harder.
"We just don't have the huge advertising budgets that the large chains have," said Mr. Georgas of Omni Hotels. "We have to rely on long-term relationships."
Over the last year, Mr. Georgas has been asking regular visitors to the Omni Berkshire what they would like to see changed. He now plans to revamp the hotel, at a cost of $40 million to $60 million, to yield not only major esthetic changes, like new carpeting and furniture, but faster elevators, better air-conditioning and new room amenities like faxes and extra phone lines.
There are similar goings on at the St. Moritz. For more than a year FAI Insurances Ltd., the Australian company that bought the hotel in 1989 for $175 million, unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the property. About nine months ago it pulled the hotel off the market and began massive renovations and systems overhauls.
It has redone most of its rooms and public spaces. It has also taken a sharp knife to expenses -- for example, it has computerized what had been a very expensive and not very efficient manual telephone system, and reduced labor-intensive paperwork in check-in and check-out systems.
"We've just focused on every aspect of expense and brought the margins down to an acceptable level," said Ralph Stephenson, an FAI managing director who says that last year the hotel reaped an 11 percent increase in revenues and an eightfold increase in gross operating profits over 1991.
LAST fall the St. Moritz invited 20 major corporate clients to a meeting to pick their brains on what services they would like to see. As a result of that meeting, the St. Moritz has simplified what had been a polyglot of rates, so that most rooms can be had at ratesbetween $109 and $149 a night. It has put in a new business center and concierge services. It has strengthened its catering staff to better handle corporate functions.
Now it is trying to get the word out. It has hired people who are experienced in corporate sales and they are using telemarketing companies, direct mail and plain old cold calls to reach travel agents and big corporations in feeder cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as New York.
"Sure we're still interested in weekend sales and big international tours, but for the first time our main focus is on the corporate market," said James Claus, vice president of Tishman Hotel Corporation, which manages the St. Moritz for FAI.

HEADLINE: Northwest Indian Treasures

BYLINE: By SUZIE BOSS; SUZIE BOSS is a freelance journalist who lives in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
THE Cascade Mountains run like a spine down the backside of the Pacific Northwest, splitting Oregon into two distinct landscapes. The west is wet, a verdant rain forest. The east is dry and sunny, a sagebrush ocean washing across red soil. The difference in terrain seemed as clear to me as a geology exhibit during a recent 100-mile drive from Portland to the Warm Springs Reservation, home to three Indian tribes whose stories are intricately connected to the land east of the mountains. I planned to visit the Museum at Warm Springs, which opened in March to showcase a large collection of tribal art, and spend a weekend at Kah-Nee-Ta, a resort built at a hot springs on the reservation.
As Highway 26 crossed the Blue Box Summit, about an hour's drive from Portland, and began its descent off the eastern face of Mount Hood, the narrow, wooded view opened to frame a broad expanse of high desert. Clouds thinned into threads above red-rock volcanic columns. On this side of the Cascades, the air is drier, the light brighter, the horizon wider. Snow-capped mountains stretch across the horizon. 
 For 8,000 years, ancestors of the Wasco, Warm Springs and Paiute tribes lived here in relative harmony. They fished salmon from the rivers, gathered huckleberries from the foothills, hunted game on the plateaus, and wove native plants into decorative sacks and baskets, usually used for gathering edible plants.
Until white settlers pushed this far west in the 1800's, setting down roots on 160-acre homesteads, the tribes had used some 10 million acres here for fishing, hunting and plant-gathering. The Wasco and Warm Springs tribes gave up claims to those lands in a Government treaty in 1855 and were given the 644,000-acre reservation. The Paiutes, more nomadic than the other two tribes, moved onto the reservation 20 years later, after losing a battle for control of their ancestral lands.
The Museum at Warm Springs draws from a rich collection of native artwork, photographs and stories to tell the long history of the three tribes that compose the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. The $7.6 million museum, designed to evoke a creekside encampment among a stand of cottonwoods, is the result of a 20-year effort to preserve and showcase culture on the reservation. Since 1974, the tribal council has spent more than $900,000 buying artifacts from families of the Warm Springs community.
As part of the design process, the Portland architects Bryan Burke and Donald Stastny listened to stories, visions and dreams shared by tribal members. The resulting design liberally mixes art with architecture, using a variety of building materials to suggest native symbols and the natural resources of the region. The building's unusual roof line combines elements of a tepee, a longhouse and a travois -- a sled used by nomadic tribes to carry their belongings. The exterior walls are of basalt from nearby cliffs and bricks woven into a basketlike pattern. The roof, of metal and concrete tile, reflects the sky by day, and glows under evening lighting.
At the museum entrance, I passed a quiet pool of water, then learned in self-guided exhibits that Indian ceremonies traditionally begin and end with a cool drink. In the lobby, wooden pillars branch up to the ceiling, mimicking the cottonwoods growing just outside. Art meshes with architecture in small gestures, too, such as the door handles modeled after feather bustles on a dancer's costume.
As I waited in line to pay admission, the woman working the ticket counter noticed that another visitor was wearing a silver frog pendant. The ticket taker launched into a tale about how, as a child on the reservation, she was cautioned by her grandmother not to tease the frogs "or our spring would dry up."
Storytelling, the heart of Indian life, takes place on a grand scale at the museum. In each of several permanent display areas, audiovisual exhibits use similar stories to teach visitors about daily life, traditions, songs, dances, medicines, and rites of passage for each of the three tribes. Artwork featured in the displays includes intricately beaded vests and headdresses, patterned baskets and colorfully decorated cornhusk bags. Exhibits draw from a collection of 2,500 photographs.
The centerpiece of the museum is a trio of traditional dwellings built by tribal members. The tule mat wickiup, or house, of the Paiutes, the Warm Springs summer tepee, and the Wasco wooden plank house are each separate display areas, fully stocked with traditional furnishings. One of the most elaborate presentations is a diorama inside the Wasco house depicting a wedding scene with two families in full ceremonial costume. A taped story describes the customs that accompanied the trading of goods between the bride's and groom's families.
Exhibits about early reservation life make viewers aware that the cultures of these three tribes have survived against great odds. From the 1870's, Indian boarding schools forbade any language but English, nearly silencing the native tongues within one generation. Long hair, considered sacred, was cut short when Indian children arrived at Government-run schools. For people who had built their traditions around fishing, hunting and plant-gathering, Government policies designed to turn Indians into farmers made little sense. In the 1950's, a hydroelectric project along the Columbia River destroyed Celilo Falls, the tribes' most important fishing place.
Today, a total of 3,000 people live on the Warm Springs Reservation; most are members of the three tribes or are related to tribal members. A tribal council includes the chief for each of the tribes. As a result of an aggressive economic development program dating from the 1950's, the reservation employs more than 1,000 people in a variety of industries: lumber, hydroelectric power, fishing, clothing and tourism. In summer, the busiest season for tourism in the area, the payroll can top 2,000.
After visiting the museum, I headed toward Kah-Nee-Ta resort, about 10 miles from the museum along a winding, two-lane road colored red by spring rains. Built in stages since the late 1960's, with a conference-wing added just this year, the resort hotel sits alone on a high bluff. A modern-looking desert oasis made of wood and concrete, the building blends well with its natural setting. Four floors of guest rooms stretch along the bluff in two wide wings. A large, heated pool outside the lodge lobby is a natural gathering place. An even larger natural hot springs pool is located half a mile downhill at a recreational area called Kah-Nee-Ta Village.
Kah-Nee-Ta resort offers guests a variety of well-kept accommodations, including hotel rooms at the main lodge, and cabins, tent sites and cement-floored tepees at the nearby Village. I had a comfortably furnished lodge suite, with a wide balcony overlooking the red-rock landscape and the bright green Kah-Nee-Ta golf course in the foreground.
Indian motifs are used throughout the resort, from the patterned fabrics in the bedrooms to the arrowhead-shaped layout of the hotel itself. The hotel lobby, built around a massive four-sided fireplace, features changing displays of native art by tribal artists such as Lillian Pitt, who makes ceramic masks. On weekends, artists often set up shop in the lobby. The gift shop offers a wide selection of art and jewelry, along with colorfully beaded knit shirts and woolen blanket coats made on the reservation by Warm Springs Clothing.
The Juniper Dining Room, which is just off the hotel lobby and has high wooden ceilings and wide windows, offers native-inspired menu choices. With advance notice, guests can order "bird-in-clay," the house specialty featuring a game hen baked in clay and then cracked open tableside with a wooden mallet, which the diner gets to keep. I didn't order ahead, but wasn't disappointed with the remaining choices: venison, rabbit, buffalo, beef and salmon, all accompanied by crisp Indian fry-bread and blackberry preserves. The menu includes a good selection of Northwest wines, as well as beers from small, local breweries. Because of the resort's isolated location, the large dining room fills quickly. Even with reservations, guests can expect to wait for a table. Service is attentive but unhurried.
Even in early spring, daytime temperatures were warm enough to lure a crowd to the hot-springs pool. By summer, Kah-Nee-Ta Village is packed with families using the pool, miniature golf course, bath house with tubs for mineral soaks, game room and a casual restaurant. Spring is a quieter season, with hikers following trails along the Warm Springs River and kids zooming on Rollerblades and mountain bikes around the Village. Summer brings a fuller menu of activities, including Indian dance demonstrations, river kayaking and weekend salmon bakes. Horseback riding with guides is offered throughout the year, weather permitting.
I divided my time between the Village area and a quieter pool at the main lodge, next to a well-equipped fitness center. After an afternoon hike up and down the nearby hills, where wildflowers were starting to blossom amid the sagebrush, I headed back to the hotel's outdoor whirlpool, the best seat in the house for watching a high-desert sunset.

HEADLINE: U.S. Open: Towns Brace For 30,000

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD

 BODY:
TOMORROW, the deluge. With the start of practice rounds for the U.S. Open, an estimated 30,000 spectators will descend upon the Baltusrol Golf Club here.
For Springfield (population: 14,000) and its neighbors, Summit and Union, the weeklong championship will present a giant challenge in crowd control and a major economic opportunity. 
 For five years, officials of the club and the towns have been preparing for the event, the first Open here since 1980. "The good side," said Summit Fire Chief John Gerity, "is the large influx of people spending a lot of money in the area. On the other side is the extra workload worrying about those 30,000 people and their safety."
The scope of the event has grown dramatically in 13 years. The number of employees hired this year (2,500) and volunteers recruited (3,000) have both doubled. Some 1,100 telephone lines have been installed, versus 200 in 1980, and the expected press corps representation has soared to 2,100 from 350.
The impact is being felt for miles around. The United States Golf Association has booked the entire Grand Summit Hotel as headquarters for the event. The Hilton in Short Hills has been sold out for a year, as have the Governor Morris Hotel in Morristown and the Murray Hill Inn in New Providence.
The Summit Chamber of Commerce has organized special programs to encourage the Open visitors to spend time downtown. Bagpipers, a jazz band and the Banjo Ragtimers Dixieland Band will perform in the streets. For the first time, local restaurateurs will be allowed to set up sidewalk cafes. And a contest has been organized to urge shop owners to decorate their windows with golf themes; winners will receive day tickets to the championship. (A weekly ticket costs $200.)
Tomorrow will test the plans that Springfield's Chief of Police William Chisholm has been developing for months. "Twenty-two of our 43 officers have been assigned each day to be on traffic control from 5:30 A.M. to 9 P.M.," he said.
"It's a labor of love," said Springfield Mayor Philip Kurnos, referring to the time spent preparing to handle the crowds. "While the police will be working overtime, some of that money will be recovered from the $30,000 fees the U.S.G.A. paid the township in filing for site permits," he said.
Officers from the State Police and the Union County Prosecutor's office will also take part in traffic control, while at Baltusrol itself Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and employees of the Encore Security Group will be on hand.
Some 900 volunteer marshalls, members of area golf clubs, will work the lower course where the matches will be held, controlling the crowds. They all attended a three-day training session provided by the United States Golf Association.
Extra police from neighboring towns will help with traffic control. Some roads will be blocked off. Two main public parking areas have been established, the quarry in Summit and special sites at Newark International Airport. Shuttle buses will take drivers and passengers from the two areas to Baltusrol.
In addition, the Summit Chamber of Commerce and New Jersey Transit are operating a shuttle bus from the Summit train station to the golf club. To use it, a U.S. Open ticket and a train stub will be required.
Both the Summit and Union Fire Departments are supplying backup units for the Springfield department. "It's the most comprehensive plan we have ever put together," said Springfield Fire Chief William Gras. "We'll have men on a fire-safety watch at Baltusrol and we'll maintain a pumper on the scene there."
The Open has engaged the attention of many people in town government here, including Cinthia Weaver, an official of the Board of Health. Some 200 chefs will be preparing food in the so-called Corporate Village, a collection of 46 hospitality tents that companies have rented for $125,000 apiece. Ms. Weaver has been working since October with the Maryland-based caterer for the tents, Ridgewells, checking on plans for food storage and refrigeration; during the tournament, she will be monitoring the cooking temperature and other aspects of food preparation.
At Baltusrol itself, the years of preparation for the championship reached a crescendo of activity last week as the finishing touches were put on the course and convoys of trucks brought materials to the Corporate Village.
The man who has knit the various threads of the event together is Dick Miller, the general chairman and a retired Prudential executive. He oversees 50 committees and finds himself following through on such tasks as finding 900 accommodations for players and their families, golf association officials and the press. "It has grown so fast," he says of his volunteer job.
Another major figure has been Bob Ross, director of golf, a club professional and the manager of the pro shop. In a shop specially stocked with golf art and memorabilia for the Open, Mr. Ross was rapidly fielding telephone calls one recent morning. "Refresh my memory where I met you," he told one of the many callers seeking U.S. Open tickets. Jack Nicklaus, a two-time Open champion who will be one of the 156 players this year, says of Mr. Ross: "Bob insures the success of this championship."
Baltusrol has two championship golf courses supervised by Mr. Ross, the upper and the lower. Since May 3, electric golf carts have been banned from the lower course, where the Open will be played, and only members -- no guests -- have been permitted to use it.
 
Upgrading the Course
 Rees Jones, the golf course architect, was brought in to polish and update the lower course. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Robert Trent Jones, who upgraded the lower course for the 1954 Open.
The changes he has made in the course, Rees Jones said, reflect in part the improvements in recent golf equipment, including clubs and balls. He has lengthened the course in some places, adding six new tees and three new bunkers.
His goal, he said, was to make the course challenging for the best players in the game, but there were limits. Club officials wanted his changes to benefit their members' games, too. "A player like John Daly can drive the ball so far, but you can't design a course only with him in mind," Mr. Jones said. "You don't build a church just for Easter Sunday."
The Corporate Village is situated on the upper course. Some 20,000 pots of annuals will frame the tents; at night, six guards will roam the area to protect the plants from foraging deer.
The tents have 2,400 square feet of air-conditioned space, Palladium windows and landscaped patios. In preparation for the thousands of guests who will be entertained in the tents by brokers, bankers, insurance executives and Donald Trump, the caterers have stocked 11,000 servings of Hawaiian French toast, 18,400 eggs and 50 cases of kiwis.
In nearby Mountainside, the Hospitality Group of America has set up its own corporate tent village in the parking lot of a restaurant, L'Affaire. Sod has been laid on the macadam and flowers planted.
 
A Sense of Pride
 Beyond all the statistics and the elaborate preparations for the Open, those taking part in the event exhibit a strong sense of pride. Baltusrol and the Open are more than just another club, another tournament.
There are, for example, the traditions of the 98-year-old club. By the front door of the golf shop last week, a gray-haired figure was sitting, dressed in red plus fours, an official U.S. Open jacket and a straw hat. Newcomers sometimes greeted him: "How are you today?" They usually did not wait for an answer, which was just as well. Members call him Solly, and he is a most life-like mannequin.
Every time Marc Brody of Westfield drives by Baltusrol Golf Club, he says, he experiences "a feeling of awe" that U.S. Opens have been played there. This week, Mr. Brody will himself be on the course with the golf greats -- as one of the 900 marshalls.
Dressed in a uniform of black slacks, a beige U.S. Open shirt and a straw hat, he will be on duty at the first hole, in company with 30 other members of Shackamaxon Golf Club in Scotch Plains.
At the training session, he said, "The U.S.G.A. was pretty straightforward in telling us, 'You are not here to be in a privileged position to watch, but to make sure that the crowd does not interfere with play.' " Then Mr. Brody took a turn at practicing his job. Pretending to face the crowd, he gestured a stop sign with his hand, and said, "Quiet please."

HEADLINE: Facing the Problem Of County Gangs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE jagged scar begins three inches above Luis Cruz's left ear, clearly visible through his closely cropped haircut, and continues down to the middle of his neck. "It's a long story," the 21-year-old said. "We were young and thickheaded then."
It started with a squabble at school over a girl, continued with retaliatory skirmishes between two rival youth groups and exploded one night two years ago on a street corner on this city's west side, a crowded jumble of housing projects, apartment buildings and modest one- and two-family houses. 
 Mr. Cruz -- now a college student majoring in criminal justice -- was walking home with a friend when he was jumped. One of the 15 attackers, wielding a box cutter, ripped open the side of the young man's head and slashed through his back.
 
Time for a Truce
 The story might have been longer, and bloodier because a fellow member of Mr. Cruz's group, the Urban Ricans set out for revenge with a shotgun.
It was at that point, as Mr. Cruz recovered in intensive care under police protection, that members of the Yonkers Police Department's Community Affairs Division called for a truce among warring youth factions and an end to the violence, which has taken the lives of three teen-agers in the city, the most recent last week. The police suspect that that drive-by shooting death of Ticard Miller, 18, was gang related.
While Yonkers and other cities -- like Peekskill, Mount Vernon, White Plains and New Rochelle -- continue to struggle with escalating gang activity and to tally the resulting deaths and injuries, smaller towns and villages have also discovered that they are not immune.
 
70 Groups Identified
 Contrary to commonly held beliefs that gangs are a problem only in the poorer sections of cities, preliminary findings of the Westchester Task Force on Gangs indicate that as many as 70 groups with about 1,500 members are operating throughout the county. The report says that the gangs have been responsible for assaults, robberies, drive-by beatings and shootings in the larger cities and noise complaints, alcohol abuse, property damage and verbal harassment throughout the county. Others studying gangs, however, said that many gangs are organized to distribute and sell drugs.
In response to a task force questionnaire, Yonkers reported 30 gangs, Mount Vernon reported 10 and Peekskill said it had 5 to 10. Other communities said they had one or two problem youth groups, and many said they were worried about teen-age gangs coming into their communities from surrounding cities. The task force report said that drug-franchise gangs from Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles were not active in Westchester.
The task force report also said that the street gangs in Westchester appear to be small, independent and loosely structured groups that are territorial in nature. The average gang has 10 to 12 members who range in age from 12 to 32. The ethnic makeup of the gangs, according to the report, was 75 percent black and Hispanic and 25 percent white.
 
40-Member Council Appointed
 Only Yonkers reported female as well as male gangs, but in separate interviews officials in other communities said that they were aware of female members, usually girlfriends of the male members, in some gangs or youth groups. Some gang members who were interviewed said that girls carried their weapons for them because male police officers couldn't search the girls and lost time having to call in female officers.
The gang members said that when a fight was about to happen, the girls came to school dressed in workout clothes with their faces greased and their hair tied back to prevent scratches on their skin and hair pulling.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke last month appointed a 40-member Urban Youth Council and charged it with assessing the needs of Westchester's at-risk youths in Greenburgh, Elmsford, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Ossining, Peekskill, Port Chester, the Tarrytowns, White Plains and Yonkers.
 
More Aggression Observed
 "Every day we see evidence of kids who have lost faith in themselves, their parents, their teachers, their lives," Mr. O'Rourke said, citing the findings of the gang task force.
It is a trend that has left law-enforcement officials, psychologists and others studying gang activity and violence among youths with more questions than answers and with increased anxiety as summer approaches, when gang activity usually peaks.
The experts cannot explain why even in well-to-do communities the level of violence among youths has escalated, although they are quick to say that gangs in Westchester -- even at their toughest -- are not the same as Los Angeles gangs, which are regarded as some of the fiercest in the country.
But even in places like Mamaroneck, an upscale community tucked into the Long Island Sound shoreline, Police Detective Robert J. Reynolds said that he had witnessed "more aggression and more fighting among teens in the last year than in the last 10."
Sometimes, those observing the increased violence say, there are obvious reasons for restlessness and in-fighting among youths. On Yonkers's west side, for example, police officers and other officials cite one-parent minority families that are struggling financially, little supervision of offspring by mothers who must often work two jobs, too few constructive neighborhood activities and even fewer job opportunities for city youths.
Last year the unemployment rate for minority youths aged 16 to 19 was above 40 percent, twice the figure for all youths, reported Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the New York State Department of Labor.
Most gang members interviewed said their groups evolved from neighborhood friendships that began during the early years of elementary school. The Urban Ricans, Mr. Cruz said, were "clean-cut, hard workers in school and were never into drugs."
He added: "But other kids called us 'smurfs,' because we were short, and, if they called me that, I showed them I wasn't."
Another west side resident, Harold Morales, a 16-year-old member of the Lawrence Posse, said that most of the time his group "just chills or looks for girls" but members are somewhat confined to the neighborhood where they live, because outside of the area, "we got beef with other kids."
He added, "I gotta keep watching my back."
Two other west side residents, Noel and David Roman, 18-year-old twins and former members of the Lawrence Posse, said they did not look for trouble, but as Noel said, the group sometimes "got into small fights that became big deals."
Nevertheless, officials are hard put to answer why some of the most violent gangs in the city -- among them, the Hell's Kitchen Boys -- come from the well-kept homes that line the tidy streets on the city's east side. The more than 20 members of that group, officials say, are Italian and Irish from middle- and upper-middle-class homes, and some attend expensive prep schools.
Detective Sgt. Lorenzo Paul of the Yonkers Police Department speculated that the east side gangs were formed after the city's public schools were integrated in the late 1980's, disrupting the long-standing social order in the high schools.
"The upper-class white kids felt that they were no longer in control, so they used steroids and bulked up and fought back," he said.
 
Task Force Criticized
 Divisions of race, class and money are less clear in other parts of Westchester, like Mount Kisco, where Lieut. Robert Dagostino described his two-square-mile village as an "upper-middle-class community, with an urban mix in a rural setting." There, too, youths are hanging out on the streets at night, dealing drugs, and some have weapons. Lieutenant Dagostino blamed teen-agers from outside the village, "who take the train up on weekends and mingle with the locals," for most of the problems.
In New Castle, Detective Geoffrey Harisch criticized the county task force for using the term "gangs" too loosely and chose instead to describe the teens-agers in his upper-class community as belonging to "little renegade groups, not tightly knit gangs that kill for each other." He said local youth groups were responsible for graffiti and for petty larcenies that supported their drug use. The groups use marijuana, cocaine, crack heroin and heroin kickers -- "little packages that go for $10 a pop," he said.
Detective Harisch blamed outside groups coming in from White Plains and Mount Kisco for much of the trouble in New Castle.
In Scarsdale, Lieut. Robert F. Nicolais of the village police department said, "Criminal mischief and vandalism occasionally rears its ugly head even in this community." He blamed an influx of teen-agers from Yonkers and New Rochelle, who "get wind of parties in Scarsdale," for some of the problems.
"Kids have always done things," Lieutenant Nicolais said, "but the activity that we're seeing in the 1990's is a heck of a lot more dangerous."
Dr. Toni Collarini, executive director of the County Youth Bureau and chairwoman of the task force, said much of the gang activity appears to be related to the struggles of adolescent boys to define their self-image.
Or as Mr. Cruz said, looking back to his days as a member of the Urban Ricans, "It's about manhood, but finally we agreed not to go out and prove ourselves anymore."
Some experts, like Police Officers Victor Mendez and Joseph LeCoq in Yonkers, who work with youths and gang members, said the gangs -- or crews and posses, as they are also called -- provide members with a sense of family and protection.
But Dr. W. James Cosse, a Hartsdale psychologist and consultant to several police forces, said: "There has been a profound change. Gangs have shifted from banding together to define identity and turf to selling and distributing drugs. Gangs are now about business. There are enormous, mind-boggling amounts of money being made among youths in the sale of drugs and protection. It goes all the way from 'I'll watch your car for $5' to 'I'll watch your store to make sure it's not torched' to 'I'll protect you at school.' The banding together of affinity groups is classic stuff. The new forms are gangs as business enterprises. You'll find them anywhere you want to look."
 
Maintaining Close Relationships
 But if at the core of the gang activity, it is as County Executive O'Rourke said, a matter of youths who have lost faith in themselves and their lives, how can officials address that problem?
In Mount Kisco, Lieutenant Dagostino said youth officers are maintaining a close relationship with teen-agers and telling them that "drugs and violence are not the way to long-term success."
In Yonkers, Officers Mendez and LeCoq said that, with guidance, at least some of the youths outgrew the problems, and many of the younger ones at least had hope.
 
'I'm Too Old for This Stuff'
 Alex Alvarado, for example, a former member of the Urban Ricans who is now 20, has married and is the father of 1-month-old Yessenia.
"I'm too old for this stuff," said Mr. Alvarado, who works as a machine operator for a graphics supply firm. "If I take a bat, or worse, and go after someone, I'll be tried as an adult. I can't do that now, because I have a family."
And Reginald Rivas, 17, a member of the Elliott Troopers in Yonkers -- who recently had 40 stitches in his face to close up a knife wound and who rarely travels outside of his neighborhood for fear of further attacks -- said he dreams about the future.
"I'll probably marry my girlfriend Rosemarie, have two kids and live in the mountains," he said. "Let's see if I get attacked by the Lawrence Posse there." Mr. Rivas said he hopes to study nursing when he graduates from high school.

HEADLINE: United Way Reports 10 Percent Drop

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
CITING an uncertain economy, a smaller pool of donors and questions of staff misconduct, the United Way of Westchester and Putnam reported this month that contributions for the current fiscal year fell 10 percent short of expectations.
As a result, officials of organizations receiving money from United Way, an umbrella group that collects money for various charities, say they may now have to cut staff and possibly programs and turn to other fund-raising efforts to meet their budgets. 
 Ralph A. Gregory, president of the local United Way, reported that his organization fell short of its original $15.7 million goal for 1992-93 by $1.6 million. In mid-March, the organization -- realizing that pledges were down -- revised its projections and set a new target of $14.2 million. As of last week, the organization said it had collected $14.1 but was still hopeful that it would meet the revised goal by June 30, when the campaign officially ends.
During the 1991-92 fund-raising year, the organization collected $15.2 million in donations -- up from $14.9 million the year before.
 
Scandals Have Hurt
 United Way organizations nationwide are reporting that contributions this year are down about 3 percent, Mr. Gregory said.
He acknowledged that the current drive had been hurt by the resignation last year of United Way of America's former president, William Aramony, after disclosures about his $463,000 salary, lavish expense accounts and the financial manipulations that created a series of profit-making spinoffs.
Another blow to the organization's reputation came when Evol Sealy, the local chapter's former director of accounting, admitted last year to stealing $280,000 in charity contributions and was sentenced to a prison term of one to three years at the Bedford Hills Correctional Center. An insurance policy covered the local United Way's losses.
Mr. Gregory called this year's fund-raising campaign drive "challenging," saying that following Mr. Aramony's resignation, his organization, one of 2,000 autonomous United Ways, had demanded better accounting procedures from United Way of America, which is based in Alexandria, Va.
"We had to be able to reassure donors here that our house was in order," he said.
 
Other Factors Cited
 Mr. Gregory said that other factors affecting this year's disappointing results were the sluggish economy and a smaller pool of potential donors, a result of the continuing reduction in personnel by major corporations in the county -- among them, International Business Machines, Pepsico, Texaco, Kraft General Foods and Nynex. The organization solicits donations from employees at those and other companies.
Mr. Gregory, who said that "those who gave, gave more this year," added that even though there were fewer employees making pledges this year, the amount each gave was up by about 3.9 percent, according to the local United Way's statistics.
Each year, the charitable organization supports 127 local agencies on an ongoing basis and gives one-time grants to another 30 to 40. Among the regular recipients of United Way aid in Westchester and Putnam counties are the Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations, the Child Care Council of Westchester, the Volunteers of America, the Senior Personnel Employment Council in White Plains and the Nepperhan Community Center in Yonkers.
At the headquarters of the Red Cross chapter in White Plains, Robert L. Lenseth, the general manager, said: "Unfortunately, this is not the first year that this has happened. We've lost $170,000 over two years from United Way."
The Red Cross received more than $1 million from United Way's 1990-91 drive but only expects $836,800 from the current fund-raising efforts. The Red Cross's total budget for 1992-93 is $2.4 million.
"We're going to have to work smarter with less in the way of resources," Mr. Lenseth said. "Nonprofits are having to follow the lead of corporations and think thin and skinny, lean and mean."
He said the Red Cross chapter was considering closing its office in Yonkers, which was established in the early 1900's, and consolidating its central headquarters. He said that would mean many clients from Yonkers and Mount Vernon -- where the Red Cross serves 260 families, mainly victims of fires -- will have to travel to White Plains.
At the Hawthorne offices of the Mid-Hudson chapter of the Volunteers of America of Greater New York, which received $16,000 last year for its Runaway and Homeless Youth Network, its director, Catherine J. Marsh, said: "We can't afford to lose dollars for this program. It's going to hurt us severely."
The current budget for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Network is $425,000, made up by a "mosaic of funding," Ms. Marsh said, with financing from United Way and the state, county, Federal Government and private foundations.
And at the Nepperhan Community Center, the executive director, Mary A. Gaines, said: "I don't know if agencies like ours can continue to exist. We may have to close."
The center sponsors activities for youngsters, including its Read Now-Latchkey Program for grade-school children and pregnancy-prevention programs for teen-agers.
Mrs. Gaines said that last year the community center, which has an annual budget of $200,000, received $67,049 from the United Way. It also receives state and city funds.

HEADLINE: State Comptroller Assails Dinkins's Pact on Budget

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall yesterday sharply criticized the $31.2 billion budget agreement reached over the weekend between Mayor David N. Dinkins and leaders of the City Council, saying there were "serious questions about its soundness."
The criticism by Mr. McCall, who has been in the job just six weeks, comes as a rebuke to the Mayor on several levels. Not only is Mr. McCall the state's second highest official and top fiscal monitor, he is also a longtime friend and political ally of Mr. Dinkins. Prior to becoming Comptroller, Mr. McCall was president of the New York City Board of Education, a Dinkins appointee. 
 Since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's, the state comptroller has frequently issued opinions on New York City's budget. But the comptroller has no authority over the city's budget, which must be approved by the mayor and the City Council.
 
Little Long-Range Relief
 Mr. McCall said that the budget put together by the Mayor and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone did little to provide long-range relief for the city's fiscal woes. Mr. McCall's criticisms echo many of the concerns that the City's Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, and state fiscal monitors had with Mr. Dinkins's initial budget proposal.
Under the plan agreed to by Mr. Dinkins and the Council leadership, spending will increase by $1.8 billion, a rise equal to about twice the rate of inflation, which is now running about 4.3 percent a year. The budget also calls for spending reductions of more than $130 million, which will affect services ranging from school buses to job placement centers.
Mr. McCall said that there were "uncertainties contained in the proposal for next year's budget -- too many for the budget to remain balanced for long." He also criticized the so-called one-shot revenue proposals in the budget, including more than $200 million borrowed against uncollected property-tax payments and the proposed sale of the Off-Track Betting Corporation for $55 million. That, Mr. McCall said, "is unlikely to occur as planned."
 
'Without Fiscal Stability'
 "Without a budget based on recurring revenues that fund recurring expenditures," Mr. McCall said, "and without fiscal stability in the long run, the city will not be able to meet its commitment to social responsibility -- to providing the social services and to fulfilling the needs of its citizens."
Mr. McCall also said that $150 million in Federal assistance included in the budget was not certain and that spending on items like overtime and the operation of the Health and Hospitals Corporation was likely to exceed budget estimates.
Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said that the budget announced by Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Vallone was "balanced according to the strict standards used by the private sector." He added that the budget included a "significant downsizing of our estimates of the state and Federal aid that we expect in the coming fiscal year."
Mr. Jones said that many of the methods to secure long-term budget stability could be accomplished by state officials and legislators. Policies concerning the costs to the city of pensions, health insurance, workers' compensation and Medicaid are all controlled by the state rather than local governments, Mr. Jones said.
Several Council members and other officials said they interpreted Mr. McCall's criticism as an effort to distance himself from the Mayor, partly because he faces election next year. "He is trying to show that he is independent," said Marc V. Shaw, the Council's budget director. "But it's unfortunate that, rather than work with city officials and the Council, he's chosen to attack them."

U.S. Awaits 2d Key Index Of Inflation

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
If the consumer price news for May proves as encouraging tomorrow as the Producer Price Index reported on Friday, the second inflation scare of 1993 will presumably be defused.
The producer index -- what American producers receive for their finished goods -- was unchanged last month, after sizable increases in both March and April. This spurred optimism among many in the credit markets, where inflation is synonymous with danger. 
 Another positive report, from the consumer side, would be sufficient to push bond prices higher and to send yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower. Yet it is not clear if the relief obtained would be strong enough to bring down long-term interest rates to new lows.
 
One Cruel Month
 The first scare of 1993 began with unexpectedly high inflation reports for February, which were released in mid-March. It ended with mild reports for March prices announced a month later.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rallied on the good news, and the yield fell back to match the 16-year low of 6.72 percent for two days early in March. But that was only for two days, and no new mark was established.
For shorter-term rates, the easing of inflation fears -- again, if confirmed by the Consumer Price Index -- means that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise short-term interest rates immediately. This belief is expected to have the further effect of lowering these rates.
Still, yields are not expected to be drawn near the April low of 3.71 percent on two-year Treasury notes, because the specter of action by the Federal Reserve at some point still hangs over the market.
 
Confluence of Good News
 Along with the Producer Price Index, several other positive reports helped the bond market rebound sharply on Friday, and they are expected to help it this week, too. These include:
*A moderate increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy. Forecasters think that the Consumer Price Index will rise two-tenths of 1 percent, half the increase in April.
*A leveling off in the price of gold, the metal that is a traditional refuge when steeper inflation is expected. On Friday, gold, which had reached a three-and-a-half-year high of $381.40 an ounce in May, was down $3.50 an ounce, to $367.50. Its total decline for the week was $11.
*A drop in the Commodity Research Bureau index to its lowest level in almost four months. Seventeen of the index's 21 components were down Friday. The price of a barrel of crude oil for July delivery fell below $19 and is down more than 6 percent for the month.
*Surprisingly weak retail sales in May, rising one-tenth of 1 percent. This evidence of a still sluggish economy means that there is likely to be little effective pressure for price increases.
And if that holds, there is a better chance that consumer inflation will slow during the rest of the year, to a pace below the brisk 4.3 percent annualized rise of the first four months. Based on recent years, inflation has tended to rise sharply in the first four months and taper off in the remaining eight.
Nonetheless, some analysts and traders said Friday that they did not think the good news would drive long-term interest rates to new lows.
 
'Still Suspicious'
 "I think it keeps us in a trading range," said James S. Fralick, the principal senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Of inflation, he said: "People are still suspicious and still concerned. These concerns have been dampened, but they will resurface later in the year."
Mr. Fralick, like some other forecasters, expects that the economy will be growing at a moderate pace of about 3 percent for the rest of the year, which will mean that consumer inflation will turn out higher than the 2.9 percent of last year. He said he remained worried about rising medical and education costs and thought that manufacturing capacity use had risen enough "that we are a little close to the level at which we would see some price increases."
The strong jump in employment in May, with nonfarm jobs up 209,000, is a signal that the pace of the economy is moving toward 3 percent annual growth, rather than the nine-tenths of 1 percent annualized growth in the first quarter of the year.
"The employment data point to solid gains in personal income, which you would expect to see echoed in consumer demand in coming months," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
 
Drawing Hope From Change
 Mr. Lipsky also noted that economic growth may not be as slow as suggested by weak retail sales. Sharp upward revisions for April, he noted, had raised sales figures to where he expected them to be for April. There could be another increase for May when those figures are revised.
Jay Goldinger, a trader at Capital Insights in Los Angeles, did not think that long-term bond yields would reach a new low because, he said, investors would sell their holdings on rallies. "I think," he said, that "we are in an environment of when you get a bout of strength you sell, and when you get a panic you buy."
"That, coupled with good inflation news could generate new lows on the long end of the curve, but not on the short end of the curve," he said, comparing credit instruments like 30-year Treasury bonds and two-year Treasury notes. "The residual expectation of a Fed-tightening rules that out."
 
On the Other Hand . . .
 But Mr. Lipsky maintained, "If investors become convinced that prices could be kept at a 3.25 percent rate despite a pickup of growth back to levels of 3 percent, then new yield declines are certainly possible and a testing of recent lows could not be ruled out."

A Test of Assumptions On Race and on Politics

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
MATCH the two quotations with their speakers:
1: "It's important that we talk about diversity, but at the same time the parties we're trying to help must contribute to their own well-being." 
 2: "We objected to majority rule because history has demonstrated that it prevented minorities from having the opportunity to select candidates of their choice. Run-off primaries are like electoral steroids for white candidates."
The choices: (A) Former State Senator John Dunne of Nassau County, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights in the Bush Administration. (B) Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Manhattan Democratic leader.
The answers: 1, B; 2, A.
If that is surprising, it only goes to dramatize the dangers of blindly playing with matches. And it is a valuable reminder at the beginning of a campaign for mayor of New York City in which race may be a volatile ingredient again.
The election of a Republican political newcomer as mayor of Los Angeles (who won last week with strong support from whites, who turned out in higher proportions than blacks) and the victory of another relatively conservative candidate in San Francisco two years ago does not bode well for Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York this year.
In 1989, when Rudolph W. Giuliani ran as an agent for change, Mr. Dinkins asked dismissively how anyone could claim to embody change more than he did. New York had elected Republicans (though not since 1969) and even political novices (though not since 1905) but never a black.
This year, seeking a second term in a rerun against Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins has largely lost his novelty. His challenge is to get the single bloc he can depend on -- blacks -- to vote by margins great enough to offset erosion among Jewish, Hispanic and white Catholic voters, and to persuade New Yorkers that even in a recession, he managed to hire more police officers and generally to keep the peace.
Mr. Giuliani, a Republican but cloaked in the protective coloration of Democratic running mates, also faces a different hurdle this time out. Four years ago, the former Federal prosecutor argued that when it came to fighting drugs, organized crime and corruption, "all the other candidates would have to take a five-year course with me."
Now he needs to demonstrate that he can do better than Mr. Dinkins in translating nostrums for efficiency into improved services -- enough to justify dumping an incumbent.
In Los Angeles, which mirrors New York's racial and ethnic splits, the successful Republican challenger, Richard Riordan, now "needs to demonstrate to this community that he is going to be mayor for all the city," said Larry Berg, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. That is also a challenge that still gnaws at New York's Democratic incumbent. Last week, the Dinkins administration agreed to promote 75 white welfare workers who had been bypassed because the head of the agency was said to have complained that the civil service list was "too white and too male."
The last incumbent to lose in New York, Edward I. Koch, was defeated by Mr. Dinkins, but after three terms. Mr. Koch appears poised to endorse Mr. Giuliani. Yet one of his former deputy mayors, Kenneth Lipper, indicated recently that he was prepared to stick with Mr. Dinkins until persuaded otherwise -- in part, because of Mr. Dinkins's race.
In a city where non-Hispanic whites are now a minority of the population but still predominate among voters, it is hard to tell whether race or party will command greater loyalty. Because race is so sublimated in public debate, it is also hard to tell whether opinion polls typically overstate support for black candidates.
Larry Hugick, a pollster, analyzed nine biracial elections, including Mr. Dinkins's four years ago. He found that a black candidate's share of the actual vote is typically just 1 percentage point higher than his support in the final poll -- before the undecided vote is allocated.
Race is rarely raised in public forums, which might be fine if it did not preoccupy people so much in private. President Clinton's decision to withdraw the nomination of Lani Guinier to succeed Mr. Dunne as Assistant Attorney General squandered an opportunity to explore her proposed remedies to enhance the political power of minority groups. As Mr. Dunne said last week, "Some of the things she advocated were things we had advanced." The degree of remedy was different, not the underlying premises.
And last week, when Assemblyman Farrell, who is black, was delivering his cautionary message about diversity, he was referring to Part D of the 62d Assembly District in downtown Manhattan, which he has created to help elect the borough's first Asian Democratic district leader, Parts A, B and C having been fashioned respectively for Hispanic, Italian and Jewish leaders.
Bowing to Asian Americans for Equality and other groups, Mr. Farrell warned: "I can create a ghetto, but I can't go floor by floor and apartment by apartment. I can't be held accountable if a district is made up of 90 percent Asians and 10 percent are citizens. If you don't contribute, you can't get."

HEADLINE: Trade Policy Test at Nissan's Tennessee Plant

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SMYRNA, Tenn.

 BODY:
For Sylvia B. Rice, who snaps window moldings onto the drivers' doors of new Nissan Altimas here, there are clear advantages when foreign companies set up shop in the United States.
"This factory has provided a lot of jobs to a lot of people," said the 40-year-old single mother of two teen-agers, as car bodies on an overhead conveyor belt moved past her. 
 But the Nissan Motor Corporation's recent expansion here, which made this car assembly plant the largest in North America, provoked a vigorous debate in the Clinton Administration this spring over whether the United States should encourage foreign companies to build factories here.
A rough consensus in favor of encouraging foreign-owned factories finally emerged at a meeting of top officials in May.
 
Objections to Tax Breaks
 The issue in Nissan's case was whether to grant the company a Federal tax break of $5 million a year for the expansion, which enlarged the factory by two-thirds. It now covers the area of 92 football fields, and sprouts a small forest of chimneys that has given a skyline to the mostly rural Highway 41 here.
Similar tax breaks -- called foreign trade zones -- have been granted routinely in recent years for factories owned by American and foreign auto makers alike. But this time there were objections, and a contest that involved a new aggressiveness on the part of Detroit's Big Three auto makers, philosophical divides within the new Administration and two powerful native sons of middle Tennessee, Vice President Al Gore and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.
The question was ultimately decided in Nissan's favor. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, supported the tax break, contending that foreign-owned factories, by creating jobs, were better than imports, somewhat to the surprise of her critics. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown also weighed in on the side of Nissan, defying top executives from the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.
"We'd prefer not to see it," Harold A. Poling, the chairman of Ford, said in a recent interview. The Big Three had filed legal papers with the Commerce Department last year to block the Nissan tax break, contending that the United States had too many car factories and that building new ones could cause old factories to close.
Nissan is making itself more competitive with American car makers by shifting production to the United States to insulate itself from trade battles and changes in the exchange rate between the yen and dollar.
The Nissan tax break consisted of an expansion of the foreign trade zone that surrounded its original factory. A foreign trade zone allows a manufacturer to pay less each year to the Treasury in customs duties for car parts. The expansion has allowed Nissan to increase production to 450,000 cars a year from 250,000 while continuing to pay the lower duties on auto parts. Nissan has increased employment to 5,900 workers from 3,100 to build the extra cars.
 
Zone Status Has Advantages
 Auto parts imported by factories in foreign trade zones are taxed at the rate of the finished car, which is 2.5 percent, instead of the rate that applies to individual parts, which can vary from 4 percent to 11 percent.
The zone status has also allowed Nissan to postpone paying duties until the finished cars left the factory, instead of paying when the parts entered the United States. This has allowed Nissan to earn interest on the money in the meantime. Parts that are rejected or broken during production are not subject to any duties.
Gail O'Sullivan Neuman, the vice president and general counsel for Nissan's manufacturing operations in Smyrna, said the savings were worth at least $20 per Altima, or $5 million a year, on top of $3 million a year for the original foreign trade zone. The expectation of the tax break was one of the considerations in Nissan's decision to expand production, but Ms. Neuman refused to speculate on whether the company would have proceeded without it.
Defenders of the zones said they had encouraged auto makers to perform at least the final assembly of cars in the United States, rather than importing finished cars at the 2.5 percent rate to avoid the higher duties on cars. "All that the foreign trade zone allows us to do is pay no more duties than we would pay" for assembled vehicles, Ms. Neuman said. "We certainly should not have a disincentive to build vehicles here."
 
Few Politics Involved
 Foreign trade zones are routinely approved by civil servants at the Commerce Department with little political involvement. About 200 zones and subzones are active, most of them auto assembly plants or refineries using imported oil. The large domestic auto makers are among the biggest users of the zones, though their savings per car tend to be modest because they use fewer imported parts than foreign car companies.
The Commerce Department staff was close to approving the Nissan application in March when Mr. Kantor objected, protesting in telephone calls to Commerce Secretary Brown and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
"My biggest concern was, in advance of not having a fully laid-out and coherent Japanese policy, which we're going to have now, the timing was wrong," Mr. Kantor said. "Here is something that had some effect upon our relationship with Japan in a critical area, being autos and auto parts, which we're concerned about, and yet we were granting something at the outset, in advance of coming to a conclusion on how we wanted to handle it."
Other Administration officials said Mr. Kantor was concerned that the approval might hurt the Administration's efforts to woo the support of Detroit auto makers for President Clinton's economic plan, particularly the energy tax.
 
Workers Were Dismayed
 Mr. Kantor had complained in early February about the auto makers' plans to seek steep duties on cars imported from Japan by filing unfair trade cases with the Commerce Department. The domestic auto makers later abandoned the plan for many reasons, including the Administration's doubts.
Workers here -- 15 miles southeast of Mr. Kantor's home town of Nashville -- were, not surprisingly, dismayed when told that Mr. Kantor had wanted to use their factory's customs duties as a bargaining chip.
"I don't think that Nissan has affected his life style and his family the way it has affected people here," said Jeff A. Stacey, a 27-year-old plant worker who assembles pistons and plugs them into engine blocks imported from Japan. "It has put people to work and helped families."
Mr. Kantor's objections came late in the process, and were rejected by other Administration officials for several reasons. They pointed out that foreign trade zones had been routinely granted for years. The large domestic auto makers were among the biggest beneficiaries because they used foreign parts. And Nissan was buying more of its parts from factories in the United States, although some of those factories were Japanese-owned.
Most of all, senior Administration officials said they wanted to avoid frightening foreign investors with an early decision reversing years of routine approvals. "We thought we shouldn't make a change in the absence of a full-fledged review of our Japan policy," Roger Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said.
One of Nissan's backers was Vice President Gore, a former Senator from Tennessee whose hometown, Carthage, is 35 miles northeast of here. "He supported Nissan's application for an extension of their foreign trade zone, which was viewed as part of the normal course of business in these matters," an aide to Mr. Gore said. The aide said Mr. Gore did not use the Vice Presidency simply to help his former constituents.
The final decision to grant the trade zone expansion was made on March 19. Four days later, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich sent to President Clinton a widely discussed memorandum urging the Administration to do more to help foreign-owned companies expand production in the United States, and do less to help American-owned companies with overseas factories.
A rough consensus in favor of this position emerged at a meeting on May 26 of Mr. Kantor, Mr. Reich, Mr. Brown, Ms. Tyson and Robert Rubin, the coordinator of the National Economic Council. In an interview the following day, at which the compromise was not mentioned, Mr. Kantor said foreign investment, "is going to be an increasing part of our lives and we're going to have to learn to deal with it."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Save a Planet, Make a Buck: The 'Green' Industry Ripens

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Adrian Gerstel likes Earth General, a Brooklyn store devoted to selling only such environmentally correct goods as nontoxic cleaners, energy-efficient light bulbs and biodegradable golf tees. But she is torn between the store's high mission and its high prices.
"It's nice and clean and wholesome," said Ms. Gerstel, an architecture student. "You pay a little bit more, but it's almost worth it." 
 Her concern worries Stefan Doering, the owner. He admits that some merchandise, such as toilet paper, is indeed more costly. But office supplies are cheaper. Some items, like light bulbs, may cost 10 times as much as regular bulbs but end up being half as expensive because of efficiency and durability.
That sort of consumer education may be crucial for business owners like Mr. Doering, who are on the cutting edge of the trend toward so-called green retailing. While the market for environmentally sound products is growing rapidly, many fledgling entrepreneurs who have flocked into the field have failed. The success stories come from those who have struck the right balance of idealism and business acumen.
"There's nothing wrong with making money by doing what we're doing," Mr. Doering said, "because that's going to be the vehicle that solves things."
Not to say Earth General is not out to save the world. Mr. Doering, a 28-year-old M.B.A., said he quit his job as a computer systems analyst with a large bank after it resisted his ideas for saving money by recycling paper. He is driven by a conviction that this planet is fast committing suicide.
The trend toward green retailing began to take off after Earth Day 1990, with 250 to 300 stores in the United States now devoted exclusively to such products, according to Carl Frankel, editor of Green Market Alert. He estimates that industry revenues will be $36 million this year, increasing to $95 million in 1997.
This is just the tip of the green market, which is also served by catalogues, health-food stores and, increasingly, mainstream retailers.
 
A Rocky Road
 The number of consumers who base buying decisions in part on environmental criteria was 22 million in 1990 and will increase to 55 million by 1995, said Jacquelyn Ottman, author of "Green Marketing: Challenges and Opportunities for the New Marketing Age," published this year.
But it has been a rocky road for green retailers, with the annual failure rate estimated by Mr. Frankel at more than a fifth. A realization is dawning among survivors.
"You're not going to have any kind of business unless you remain in business," said Kevin Connelly, publisher of Natural Connection, a trade journal for green retailers.
For its part, Earth General is turning a small profit after 19 months in business. Mr. Doering said last year's sales were just under $300,000 and are now running 35 to 50 percent ahead of that.
Setbacks have included the departure of a partner, the theft of the store's computers, an inability to secure bank financing and, most damaging, the sick local economy.
 
Extensive Preparations
 But extensive preparations did much to save Mr. Doering. He says defining the concept was the hardest part. He decided he wanted the character of the homespun general store his grandfather operated in Colorado and also to be "the environmental Wal-Mart." His business plan calls eventually for the sale of franchises.
He then had to raise more than $100,000. Half came from investors. About $35,000 came from loans, including $15,000 from a city fund to help new businesses.
Choosing a location was also vital, and Mr. Doering surveyed areas from the Upper East Side to Coney Island. He settled on Park Slope, a largely affluent area in which he counted 17 environmental groups.
But a Roper Organization poll characterized only 25 percent of the population as "deep green," that is, committed environmentalists. For lighter green types, Mr. Doering says he and his seven employees must constantly teach customers about what they are buying. An organic detergent, for instance, seems more expensive than a regular brand until one learns it takes only half as much to clean a load of wash.
Indeed, Earth General's most important role is as a professional shopper. Each week it receives 15 to 20 new products for inspection, and Mr. Doering applies a dozen criteria to decide which ones to sell. Not that he is always right: A shampoo was promptly pulled after it was found to contain a suspected carcinogen.
Earth General has been scrambling to overcome the limits of an 850-foot store. It offers a mail-order catalogue, what it terms "the nation's first environmental bridal registry" and a service to supply deeply discounted office supplies to companies.
Even as retailing becomes undeniably greener, stores like Earth General may end up as victims of their own success. So many ecological products are appearing in mainstream outlets that the specialty stores may someday not be needed.
But Marc Merson, president of Eco Expo, a Los Angeles company that stages exhibitions to link green manufacturers with retailers, says stores like Earth General will retain an advantage by offering "cutting-edge products" and convenience.
Mr. Doering, who last week met with a group interested in investing in Earth General, is betting on that. "The environmental market is the fastest growing in the country," he said. "Ten or 20 years down the road, we want to be the most effective environmental store in America."

HEADLINE: Emigres Are Holding Off on Their Hopes for Haiti

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
As they do most every day, Creole-speaking men and women gathered yesterday in New York City's barbershops and restaurants, on stoops and street corners, and engaged in a favorite pastime -- exchanging news from Haiti and debating oh-so-passionately the latest twist in the island politics.
But yesterday the conversations lasted a bit longer. The debate grew louder and arms gesticulated wildly as if added energy might help them make sense of a week filled with double-edged victories, tragedies and enduring frustration over their country's longstanding political turmoil. 
 "People feel a lot better now," said Jean-Marie Anthony, a bank officer and Haitian emigre, as he stood outside St. Catherine of Genoa Church in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. "But hope?" he cried. "Hope? The only hope we have is to see what will come at the end of this."
 
A Week of Attention
 Last week, Haitians watched with guarded skepticism as Marc Bazin, Haiti's de facto Prime Minister, resigned. A Federal judge ordered that all Haitians held in a detention camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba be released and that the camp be closed immediately. The United Nations imposed an oil embargo on Haiti as part of a campaign to restore the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
"No one understands what's going on," said Jacqueline Thomas, a Haitian television hostess, her eyes red with tears as she sat in the living room of her Queens Village home.
While men and women alike cheered the court victory and condemned Mr. Bazin, many remained divided about the United Nations plan to use a Naval blockade to enforce the oil embargo.
"Any blockade is an act of war," said Marco Lamothe, a spokesman for the National Regeneration Movement, a Haitian grass-roots political organization based in New York. "We are against all forms of intervention. The sovereignty of the country should be respected."
 
'The Masses Will Suffer'
 Mr. Lamothe, whose organization promotes efforts to restore democracy in Haiti, said the solution to the country's complex problems rests in the hands of Haitians abroad and at home. But he said that the international community, particularly the United States, could play a significant role in the process.
"An economy as fragile as Haiti's cannot sustain any embargo," he said. "The masses will suffer."
As they chatted over bowls of creole beef soup or stopped to visit neighbors in Brooklyn and Queens, where they have forged tight-knit, vibrant communities, many Haitians also said they felt weary of international negotiations that so far have failed to return Father Aristide to power, more than 20 months after he was ousted following a bloody coup on Sept. 30, 1991.
They vented anger about what they saw as lackluster efforts by the United States to help resolve the latest crises in Haiti's tumultuous 189-year history as an independent nation. And yesterday, many spoke of the "phone call," referring to allegations that officials in the Bush Administration telephoned the former Haitian dictator, Lieut. Col. Prosper Avril, advising him to step down because his life was in danger. Days later, and after a visit from the United States Ambassador, the Administration sent a plane to take him to Miami.
And they say the same kind of action could solve the current crisis.
"I think it's very unfair to keep Aristide out of the country," said the Rev. Gerald Dumont as he stood in the back of the St. Catherine Rectory, preparing for his 1 P.M. Creole Mass, which includes a special prayer for Haiti. "If America wanted him to come back, a phone call is enough. Clinton has good intentions but he is too slow."
Even the court decision to allow the refugees at Guantanamo, most of whom are H.I.V.-positive, to enter the United States was welcomed with little enthusiasm.
"Guantanamo was one of the most inhumane things," said Mrs. Thomas, who went into self-imposed exile in 1969, after she protested the Government of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. "It's a shame that a country like the United States would do something so ugly, so immoral."
On Church Avenue in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where thousands of Haitians have settled since Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier succeeded his father in 1971, a half-dozen men gathered under the bright awnings of a barber shop and the empty Cafe Tatou to discuss the latest events with a mix of passion and rancor, saying the Haitian immigrants suffered less-favorable status than other immigrant groups.
"We feel better because the judge asks the U.S. Government to let them come to this country," said Etienne G. Jean, 54, as he sat outside the cafe. "But how come you don't want black people coming from Haiti?"
Three blocks away, on Albany Street, Mr. Anthony stopped before entering the St. Catherine Rectory and insisted that the court cases and embargoes would not be necessary if Mr. Aristide, who in 1990 became Haiti's first freely elected President, were in power.
When asked about the Guantanamo ruling and another case awaiting a decision by the United States Supreme Court that challenges the Bush Administration's policy of repatriating Haitians intercepted at sea without determining whether they are political or economic refugees, Mr. Anthony echoed his refrain to restore Mr. Aristide.
"Political asylum doesn't mean anything," he said. "If the country has a constitutional government, we won't need any asylum for these people. Under Aristide, you didn't see any boat people. This is my point."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In Ad Drought, Magazines Take Root

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
If advertising pages and revenues are barometers of health, the magazine industry is only just limping out of its worst recession in decades.
But how about new magazines as a sign of vitality?
In category after category, the pots are bubbling. Magazines for children. Magazines for parents. Magazines for the health conscious and magazines for the fashion conscious. Sports magazines. Environmental magazines. And there are rumors about might-be magazines. 
 Why now? For no reason, actually. Magazines seem always to be aborning, as if the creative urge simply disdains to distinguish between good times and bad when starting a magazine.
These are some recent start-ups:
HEART & SOUL , a health and life style magazine for African-Americans, will hit the newsstands tomorrow and will have an expected circulation of 250,000. It is the combined effort of Ware Communications, an African-American marketing firm, and Rodale Press, which publishes health magazines like Prevention and Men's Health.
Besides its apt name, Heart & Soul's appeal to health-conscious African-Americans is its focus on diseases and conditions like diabetes, hypertension and strokes, which affect blacks at far greater rates than whites. The magazine will also write about, say, how to make soul food dishes more healthful and about cosmetics designed specifically for black women. A second issue of the magazine is scheduled for October, and plans are to take the magazine quarterly next year.
PARENT & CHILD will be published in September by the Scholastic Corporation with an ambitious newsstand circulation of 1.1 million. The quarterly, which may become a monthly, will be aimed at working parents whose children are in child-care centers or are being taken care of during working hours. The magazine seeks to give parents a better understanding of early childhood education and to provide practical information and basic strategies on talking to teachers and day-care providers.
"In 1990, 58 percent of women who had children under age 6 were fully employed," said J. Fritz Craiger, the publisher. "That is projected to be 65 percent by 1995 and 80 percent by the end of the century. It's not a minority any more, it's the majority."
NICKELODEON , a humor magazine for children aged 8 to 12, will hit the newsstands tomorrow. The bimonthly is being published by Viacom International -- the parent of Nickelodeon, the children's cable television service -- with an expected circulation of 150,000.
Although the magazine was promoted on the cable channel's programs with an "800" number to call for subscriptions, the original intent was not to have it reflect what was on television. But thanks to children who said they wanted to see articles related to the programs, the goal is now to have 15 percent of the magazine's editorial content related to Nickelodeon programming.
"But this is not a marketing tool," said Lynn A. Lehmkuhl, the publisher. "The magazine is an entirely new core business for us."
ECO (as in ecological), a magazine covering issues that affect both business and the environment, also comes out this week. With a controlled circulation of 80,000, the magazine is being distributed jointly with Corporate Finance magazine. Published jointly by ECO Inc. of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and Financial World Partners of New York City, the magazine will be sent to corporate and financial executives, government leaders and others involved in issues that affect the environment.
Plans are to publish twice in 1993 and then to evaluate what the frequency should be in 1994, Igor Gordevitch, the president, said.
 
Format Change for W

 Then there are other magazines in various stages of development.
W magazine, a Fairchild Publication about fashion, parties and celebrities, will change its format in August from a broadsheet to a standard magazine. With a circulation of 260,000, it plans to go head-to-head with leading fashion publications like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Mirabella.
 The first magazine-size W was published in February as a special shopping issue. Stephanie George, senior vice president and group publisher of W and Women's Wear Daily, said newsstand sales increased by 55 percent, persuading Fairchild to drop the broadsheet format for W.
Ms. George said that W would have a shorter turnaround time, from closing the issue to getting it on the newsstand, than other fashion magazines, allowing it to publish more up-to-date fashion news.
W is also planning a men's fashion publication, to come out twice a year, that will be "W looking at men's wear," said Patrick McCarthy, the executive vice president and associate editorial director of W and Women's Wear Daily.
And there are plans from the leading magazine companies.
 In August, Time Inc. will test In Style, a celebrity photo magazine that is a spinoff of People. In September, Time Inc. Ventures and the Quincy Jones Entertainment Company will come out with Vibe, a hip-hop, rap and rhythm and blues magazine that was previously tested on newsstands last September.
Time Inc. Ventures and Angela Janklow Harrington, a Vanity Fair contributor, are also in discussions about a magazine aimed at the teen-age market with the current working title of Mouth to Mouth.
 
NBC Teams With Hachette
 Hachette Filipacchi and NBC are working on a joint venture to publish a new teen-age magazine. The magazine, so far untitled, is scheduled to appear in October with a newsstand circulation of 500,000.
As for magazine rumors, four involve Hearst Magazines. The first is LOOKS, supposedly a new fashion magazine for women over 40, edited by Anthony Mazzola, former editor of Harper's Bazaar. The second has to do with a long-rumored project with Ralph Lauren. The third is a bridal magazine for the youth market, and the fourth is a magazine that was reportedly being started by Gael Love, former editor in chief of Connoisseur, now defunct.
In response to an inquiry about the projects, Charlotte Kelly Veal, a spokeswoman for Hearst, declined to comment " except for the Love project, which is over and out."

HEADLINE: Unlicensed Peddlers, Unfettered Dreams

SERIES: Hidden Economy: Immigrants Underground -- Second of six articles.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
At 11 A.M. on a recent morning, Louis Ndlovu King of South Africa dragged a duffel bag packed with purses to the sidewalk at the corner of Broadway and Duane Street. Minutes later, Luis and Marcelo Yamberlo, father and son, arrived laden with hand-woven sweaters and bracelets from Ecuador, their native land. Following them, M. Hu, recently smuggled in from China, wheeled a cart neatly stacked with imitation Montblanc pens to the same spot.
Within 30 minutes, the sidewalks in front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building were throbbing with the sales pitches of immigrant vendors illegally hawking "Black Is Beautiful" T-shirts, Wayne Newton cassettes, "Pinocchio" videos, batteries, mood rings, sunglasses, flowered panties and butane lighters. 
 These immigrants, most of them illegal, have dared to create a makeshift marketplace directly in front of the Immigration and Naturalization Service headquarters at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. Speaking mother tongues as diverse as Quechua, Wolof and Chinese, they have developed a camaraderie that ignores the fact that many sell the same wares. Together they play cat-and-mouse games with the police. And together they slough off public antagonism with the firm belief that they are earning an honest living.
 
'Better Than Welfare, No?'
 "I love to work!" exclaimed Fatima Fadigh, a Guinean vendor who crouched by her display of T-shirts crooning melodic songs in the Mandingo language. "Give me working papers, and I'll do anything else. I'll sweep the sidewalk. I'll wash the cars. But without them -- this is better than welfare, no?"
About 10,000 vendors work the streets illegally in New York, becoming the most visible and controversial representatives of the city's growing underground economy. Over the last decade, as the recession eliminated jobs and immigration reached peak levels, their numbers multiplied exponentially. The start-up cost was low, and working papers were unnecessary.
Public debate about their livelihood heated up recently as Mayor David N. Dinkins half-heartedly announced a crackdown on peddlers and their suppliers. The Mayor said he was not against sidewalk vending but recognized that it had become "a thorn in the side of small businesses and legal vendors."
 
Pushcart Nostalgia Is Strained
 Mr. Dinkins's ambivalence highlighted the schism between many New Yorkers' heartfelt image of the city as an immigrant haven and others' fear that it is turning into an outpost of the third world. On the one hand, the immigrant vendors elicit nostalgia about pushcarts and an admiration for self-starters; on the other, they bring out a recession-worn frustration with tax evaders who clutter sidewalks and undercut the sales of legitimate merchants.
Aida Di Puma, a florist in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, says she routinely throws away scores of rotting bouquets because her customers find it cheaper and more convenient to shop on the streets. Illegal flower vendors began fanning through her neighborhood in the late 1980's.
"Like 50 percent of my business has gone down the toilet because of them," Ms. Di Puma said. "I like to live in harmony with the world, but it's rotten when someone undersells me, especially when they don't pay taxes, they don't pay rent and they're not citizens."
 
The People
As Different As Homelands
 For the vendors themselves, there is no debate about their primary motivation: economic survival. But they are a diverse lot, and their backgrounds, attitudes and aspirations are as different as the individual immigrants at 26 Federal Plaza.
Mr. King, for instance, speaks fluent English. A recent immigrant from Soweto, he nonetheless wears the baggy jeans, Malcolm X shirt and ever-present Walkman of a native-born city kid. A smooth salesman ("Miss, you need a beautiful bag to match your beautiful smile"), Mr. King, 29, has a green card. But he started selling before he got it. And he continues because the money is good and the hours flexible enough to meld with his schedule as a pre-medical student at Medgar Evers College.
Luis Yamberlo, on the other hand, appears more obviously transplanted from a different world, the highlands of Ecuador. An Otavalo Indian, he wears a black felt hat above the single pigtail that snakes down his back. His selling style is alert but silent.
Bilingual in Spanish and Quechua, Mr. Yamberlo, 40, was a high school teacher until he unexpectedly received the United States tourist visa he had long sought. Quitting his $100-a-month job, he packed a change of clothing and hundreds of sweaters, ponchos and bags from the famous marketplace in Otavalo. He had no doubt that he would be starting out as a street vendor, just like the Otovalan immigrants who had preceded him and settled in Corona, Queens.
Ms. Hu, who requested that her first name not be used, also imagined that she would begin as a peddler. That was the rumor back home in Zhejiang Province, when she first contacted the smuggler who arranged her $20,000 trip to the United States. A 30-year-old illegal immigrant, Ms. Hu speaks a provincial dialect of Chinese and only a few critical words of English: the prices of her wares. If she spoke more English, she said, she would never sell on the streets.
She is occasionally robbed, and she barely makes enough money to feed herself, she said. But she endured a six-week journey here by a series of airplanes that took her through several countries, "some hot weather and some cold." So, she said, she can endure the life of a street vendor, which is still better than what she left behind: unemployment and a dead-end future.
 
Dinkins Was a Peddler
 New York politicians have long harbored a soft spot for immigrant vendors. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch frequently reminded New Yorkers that his father had been a peddler. And Mr. Dinkins, in announcing the new enforcement plan, revealed that he too had been a vendor as a youth in Harlem.
"Oh, my goodness, when I heard Mayor Dinkins say that, I didn't feel ashamed to be a vendor no more," Mr. King said, grinning. "I felt like a part of history."
New York City first started licensing peddlers in the late 1890's. By 1914, the pushcart situation was considered to be out of control, clogging the crowded streets of the Lower East Side. The number of pushcart licenses was frozen at 6,000, and illegal peddling abounded.
Nearly 80 years later, with street peddling revived, the city issues far fewer licenses. It awards 853 licenses for general peddlers, a cap arbitrarily set when the City Council froze the number of existing licenses in 1979. Food peddlers, most of whom are licensed, number about 3,000. War veterans, booksellers and purveyors of religious artifacts do not need a license.
Mayor Dinkins's new plan added 46 police officers to enforce peddling rules and spread them throughout the city's boroughs. That nearly tripled the previous effort, a 25-officer task force that covered only Manhattan south of 59th Street. (The peddlers referred to the Manhattan officers as "Alpha," because they used to patrol in vans that said "Alpha Moving Company" on the side.) At the same time, the plan aimed to establish vendor marts to keep peddlers off congested streets.
Legislation pending in the City Council proposes doubling the number of licensed peddlers, as unlicensed vendors deprive the city of $25 million annually in sales taxes, the state's Department of Finance estimates. But the bill does not appear likely to gain much support. And even if more licenses were granted, most immigrant vendors would be ineligible: a green card, or citizenship, is required.
 
The Routine
Friday Is Payday And Police Day
 In front of 26 Federal Plaza, the rhythm of the retail day is syncopated. During the lethargic off hours, some African vendors go down the street to a mosque to pray; the Chinese peddlers dust their sunglasses displays with feather brushes. During the lunchtime and after-work frenzy, the accented calls of "Check it out" rise even above the din of traffic.
Encounters with the police -- most likely on Fridays, payday for the area's office workers -- force the routine to allow improvisation.
About noon on a recent weekday, without apparent provocation, the vendors at Broadway and Duane bent down, tied the scarves holding their wares into hasty bundles and fled down the street. They had spied the approaching three-wheeled police scooter of the beat cop, Officer Jeff Granowski.
Abdul Ba, a Senegalese vendor, took his time packing up T-shirts. Officer Granowski approached, calling him Moussa, which is a common Muslim name but not Mr. Ba's.
"If I see any other Senegal here the next time I come back, it's you -- King Moussa -- that I arrest," Officer Granowski said.
When he returned, Mr. Ba had not resumed selling, but nearly all the others had. Officer Granowski was angry.
 
Officer Throws Cassettes
 "You out to play games?" he shouted. The officer picked up one vendor's folding table and tossed it by the legs into the street. As the vendor was backing away, the officer grabbed handfuls of cassettes and hurled them at him.
A crowd instantly gathered. "That's no way to do people," Sharona Jones, one passer-by, said to the officer. "I'm going to report you."
Officer Granowski shouted his badge number -- "28287" -- for those squinting to read it.
"They think this is like a peddler-Rodney King tangent," he said. "But I came over here earlier and told the peddlers to get out. The second time it was like spitting in my face. A lot of cops will just handcuff, if they don't scamper fast enough. I try to be a nice guy. But you got to be a little aggressive."
The vendors understood. Officer Granowski rarely confiscates their goods, so they are willing to tolerate some bluster. Besides, it was easy enough to just move temporarily to the other side of Broadway, which belongs to a different precinct.
The police officer says he rarely confiscates the vendors' goods because he is now required to arrest the vendors as well. And then the paperwork keeps him off the streets for more hours than it is worth.
"It is better, what they're doing, than going out and robbing," Officer Granowski said. "If no merchants complained, I would just turn my back."
 
The Money
Better Than Pay From Taxable Job
 The African vendors at 26 Federal Plaza come from Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Niger. They do not know one another by name, using brother, buddy or frere instead. They specialize in cassettes, sunglasses, T-shirts, handbags and the occasional cap or bag made from African cloth. They buy even the African goods from Korean wholesalers in and around the Garment District: $5 for a handbag they sell for $20, $1 for a cassette that sells for $5. Some store their wares in the back of a Chinese restaurant across the street for $2 a day. Some room together in hotels in midtown and Harlem.
On weekends, all the vendors, who work seven days a week, move to Canal Street. Once in a while, they travel together in vans to flea markets across the country, which the men from Niger call "going into the bush."
The Chinese vendors primarily offer lacy underwear and costume jewelry. Ms. Hu buys $100 in inventory, three to four times a week, from an Orthodox Jewish wholesaler on Delancey Street. The wholesaler also stores her goods at night for $100 a month. Ms. Hu says she earns about $40 profit on every $100 in goods sold. On a good day, she makes $60.
Peddlers' earnings vary with the weather and the economy. Mr. King sold 10 handbags during a recent lunch hour, for a profit of $150. The next day during lunch, however, it rained and he received next to nothing. During the winter, he was forced to get a temporary job as a part-time loan officer in a bank, he said. At $9 an hour, 20 hours a week, he made less money than he does working part-time on the street, he said.
"The taxes really kill you," he said.
 
Counterfeit Goods Assailed
 Most vendors who were interviewed consider themselves desperate and wily, not criminal. Some, however, criticize their colleagues who sell counterfeit bags and watches. These are the vendors considered most troublesome by the police, merchants and name-brand companies that have lobbied in Albany to make selling counterfeit goods a felony.
"They give us all a bad name," one vendor from Mali said. "They lie to the customers."
The police say that the African vendors are the most organized. "We have people arrested: they've been in the country two days and already have a New York State picture I. D.,a check-cashing I. D. and they're in business," said Lieut. J. J. Johnson, head of the peddler task force.
Academic experts say that the African vendors are not so much a syndicate as an efficient ethnic network. "I think it's a bit far-fetched to think that there is some sort of Senegalese mafia," said John Gaber, who wrote a doctoral dissertation for Columbia University on New York street vendors.
Several African vendors said in interviews that they arrived at Kennedy International Airport having no idea where to go until taxi drivers took them to a hotel where other Africans lived. There, vendors quickly took them under wing, in the same way that illegal Irish immigrants often find themselves on a construction site within days of landing in the United States.
 
Temporary First Step
 Most immigrant vendors interviewed see their peddling as temporary, an occupation of last resort, the first step into the American marketplace. They know that with time, savings and legalization, other vendors have left their peddling to become wholesalers, cabdrivers, waiters and legitimate merchants.
Mr. Yamberlo puts his hopes for the future on his 18-year-old son, Marcelo, whom he hopes to send on to college and a more secure future. Ms. Hu, whose husband works in a garment shop, is surrounded by other Chinese vendors and garment workers; she knows no role models on which to base her dreams. For the moment, she aims only to earn enough money to pay back the relatives and loan sharks in China who financed her trip here.
Mr. King, on the other hand, is a big dreamer who sees vending only as "something minor, a blessing that is putting me through school."
"Once I finish school, I'm not going to do it," he said. "I'll be armed with my degree. In New York, if you are determined, nobody can undermine you. If a mayor could be vendor, a vendor could be mayor. Everything is possible."

HEADLINE: Tax's Demise Illustrates First Rule Of Lobbying: Work, Work, Work

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Jim Mc Avoy remembers well when he and a cadre of the capital's top lobbyists held their first meeting to plot the demise of President Clinton's energy tax. It was December 1992, Mr. McAvoy recalls: "I left it, and went straight to our Christmas party."
Not only was the tax plan little more than Washington dinner-party grist; the President wasn't even the President yet. Mr. Clinton would not suggest squeezing money from British thermal units until February. Congress would not vote on a B.T.U. tax until May. 
 But opponents were already hard at work.
And last week -- after the proposed tax on coal was lowered; after aluminum smelters and barge operators got a break; after farmers and city dwellers won exemptions for the diesel that heats homes and runs combines; after oil refiners and gas and electric companies moved the tax off their backs and onto consumers'; after grain merchants won and then lost a battle to exempt ethanol; after chemical and glass makers secured protection against untaxed foreign competitors -- last week, after all that and more, the White House gave up on enacting a tax on the heat content of fuels, at least for now.
 
Who Would Have Thought?
 "They've done a very sophisticated job," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday of the anti-tax forces.
Indeed, the lobbyists have ridden a juggernaut. Powered by satellite feeds and talk radio and opinion polls and a blizzard of newspaper advertisements, they had whipped up a froth of outrage over the tax. Mass mailings urged citizens to complain to Congress, and lobbyists offered a toll-free number to make it painless. Meanwhile, the White House slept.
The tax foes' campaign was cheap by Washington lobbying standards -- a few million dollars, its generals say. The ease of the victory shocked some.
"Nobody thought you'd win this fight," said Jeffrey A. Nesbit, head of communications for Citizens for a Sound Economy, which raised several hundred thousand dollars by direct mail last winter to battle the tax. "We've got a Democratic President, a Democratic Congress. Whoever thought you would be able to beat this?"
In hindsight, Mr. Nesbit and others said, it is not so hard to see why.
One reason was that the tax hit every American, including thousands whose anger was easily brought out. "It just took a while for members of Congress and Americans generally to look at it," said Charles Fritts, the chief lobbyist for the American Gas Association. "But when people did look at it, they said, 'This isn't an energy tax -- it's my utility bill; it's how I drive my car.' "
Another is that some arguments against the tax were plausible, not merely political. Some gas utilities could show that the tax exceeded their profits; chemical makers could show how a similar tax, levied on chemicals to finance the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup program, had caused exports to plummet.
 
A Distracted White House
 But the White House also fought a poor fight, the lobbyists said. Saddled with public suspicion of his economic plan and diverted by brush-fire crises, Mr. Clinton never explained why a B.T.U. tax was needed.
Some said the White House fatally erred by handing out tax breaks to silence opponents, rather than insisting on shared sacrifice.
"They allowed their proposal to move from a relatively fair tax, across the board, to one that was riddled with loopholes," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington-based industry lobby.
While Mr. Clinton was absorbed by Bosnia, Haiti and the search for an Attorney General, "we had a very single-minded coalition that focused on defeating the B.T.U. tax and substituting spending reductions in its place," Mr. Jasinowski said. "The Administration never got out into the field."
 
With Friends Like These . . .
 The White House was also crippled by a few powerful Democrats, including Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma and Representative Charles Stenholm of Texas, who opposed the tax fiercely and publicly, and made opposition politically legitimate. Mr. Boren, a swing vote on the Senate Finance Committee, was crucial to the anti-tax effort, lobbyists said.
Then there were professionals like Mr. McAvoy, who spent Christmas to Memorial Day stirring up trouble.
A Republican who ran "truth squads" to spread his party's message at the Democratic National Convention last July, Mr. McAvoy now is president of Advocacy Communications, a unit of the public-relations giant Burson-Marsteller. Advocacy's business is fertilizing the grass roots -- in this case, cultivating anti-tax sentiment for 1,400 lobbies and businesses headed by the manufacturers association and dubbed the American Energy Alliance.
 
Anger in Corn Country
 In February, Randy Cruise, who farms 3,000 acres of corn and soybeans in Pleasanton, Neb., learned that the White House planned to tax ethanol, a corn-based fuel that competes with gasoline, at a maximum rate.
Mr. Cruise is president of the National Corn Growers Association. "We went straight to Bentsen and Panetta," he said. Besides the Treasury Secretary and Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, Mr. Cruise went to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and farm-state Democrats like Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
Joining the cause was the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group that includes the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, maker of 70 percent of all ethanol and a generous political donor.
On March 23, before the tax bill went to Congress, Mr. Bentsen sent Mr. Kerrey a letter. "After studying the impact of the B.T.U. energy tax," he wrote, "we have decided to exempt both ethanol and methanol."
 
More Favors Are Sought
 Emboldened by that bow to the farm belt, Northeastern senators demanded a break for their constituents, too. So on April 1, Mr. Bentsen lowered the proposed tax on home-heating oil. And a parade of favor-seekers began wearing a path to White House and Congressional doors.
Aluminum companies, voracious consumers of power, fought for and won a $500 million exemption. According to the magazine National Journal, 13 House members from aluminum-plant districts wrote Mr. Bentsen to argue that electricity was a raw material in aluminum, not a taxable fuel. Among them was Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House.
The Chemical Manufacturers Association shunned lobbying Gucci-style and used calls and visits by hometown company executives to secure an "equalizer" tax on competing imports. The American Gas Association turned to its 250 members to help move the B.T.U. tax away from pipeline operators and on to gas customers' bills. The White House balked, envisioning millions of mailboxes stuffed with monthly reminders of Mr. Clinton's tax; Congress moved the collection point anyway.
By April, as the modified tax moved from the White House to Congress, the anti-tax coalitions -- the American Energy Alliance and Citizens for a Sound Economy -- opened long-planned efforts to stir up opposition.
 
Plenty of Money
 The alliance was financed mostly by the National Manufacturers Association, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute. But it signed up 1,400 other members, creating the impression of a mass movement, and spent $1 million to $2 million in about 20 states.
The alliance hired a Virginia direct-marketing company to conduct a mail campaign and Mr. McAvoy's shop to execute a public-relations strategy.
The alliance relied heavily on television, radio talk shows and staged news events. From Baton Rouge, La., for example, came a widely reported study by Louisiana State University energy experts warning that the B.T.U tax would cost the state $1 billion.
 
Let's Call a Senator
 In the states of two crucial Democratic Senators on the Finance Committee, Mr. Boren and John B. Breaux of Louisiana, the group spent about $100,000 mobilizing public opinion. Street rallies and full-page newspaper advertisements were employed in the other states, with a twist: a toll-free number that voters could use to call their senators and complain.
How well do such campaigns work? Mr. Jasinowski, Mr. McAvoy and Mr. Nesbit agreed their millions might have been wasted had average people not already been uneasy. "I think we threw a match on something that the White House had already thrown gas on," Mr. McAvoy said, "and that ignited a real brush fire."

HEADLINE: Nevada Town Booms With Proceeds From Gambling Mormons

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST WENDOVER, Nev.

 BODY:
A giant neon cowboy stands with his toes against the state line here, looming over a landscape of salt flats and alkaline-stunted sage. Wendover Will, he is called. The biggest, friendliest cowpoke in the West.
For three decades he has stood at the Nevada-Utah border, his upraised hand beckoning toward Salt Lake City, 117 miles east of here on Interstate 80, his smile promising a little action in the five casinos at his back. 
 Casino border towns are nothing new in Nevada, and West Wendover's $63 million annual gaming industry would be small change at any big Las Vegas casino.
What makes West Wendover unusual is its market. Almost all of its patrons are drawn from Salt Lake City, a conservative bastion dominated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
 
A Minor Evil for Mormons
 In Mormon theology, gambling is not strictly forbidden, like smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol or beverages with caffeine; it is viewed as a lesser transgression, an evil "based on the morally wrong philosophy of getting something for nothing, of taking money without giving fair value in return."
Gambling is illegal in Utah, one of only two states without so much as a lottery. The church's opposition last year helped defeat a measure that would have allowed modest, state-run betting on horse races at county fairs.
So there stands Wendover Will, separated from the world headquarters of the Mormon Church by a two-hour freeway drive.
"If there are Latter-Day Saints gambling in Wendover or anywhere else, they are obviously among the less faithful members of the Church," said Don LeFevre, a Mormon spokesman.
 
'Taste of the Other Side'
 At the roulette wheel, no one asks about religious affiliation, but simple population statistics are telling. There are 1.7 million Utah residents, 1.2 million of whom are Mormons. By some estimates, 90 percent of the 700,000 gamblers in West Wendover each year come from Utah.
"The Mormons who go over there just want a taste of the other side," said a 28-year-old mother of two, who, like most other Mormons interviewed, would speak only if not quoted by name.
For some otherwise devout Mormons, the trip to West Wendover is a chance to slip the bonds for a while, the woman said: "They feel like they've been living a life of restricted behavior all their lives and they feel they can't do that forever without blowing up. It's like going to carnival in Rio. It's the one day of the year you can be something you're not."
Once nothing more than a watering stop for Union Pacific trains crossing the desert, West Wendover is booming today. From one tiny truck-stop-casino at the end of World War II, the town now has five hotel-casinos that employ 80 percent of the 3,400 residents. Mayor Walter G. Sanders said the gambling industry was paying for a new sewage treatment plant, streets and a golf course.
 
'Great Growth Potential'
 A sixth, still-larger casino has been proposed by Walter J. Kassuba, who was one of the nation's biggest developers in the 1970's. He has taken options on 900 acres of desert, hoping to develop a 1,400-room tower, an amusement park and a nearby housing development.
"These border towns that service the Salt Lake market have great growth potential," Mr. Kassuba said.
Although many states are allowing more forms of gambling, West Wendover may be protected from competition. "Of all the states in the U.S., the only one that will probably never contemplate gambling is Utah, because of the Mormon influence," said Dr. Bill Eadington, an economist and director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. "That gives Wendover some measure of security."
As a bus owned by the Donna's Tours company rolled west on Interstate 80 one recent Saturday, the driver, Kent Meeks, clicked on the public address system for the first in a series of jokes intended to pass the time.
"What do Catholics, Jews and Mormons have in common?" he asked his passengers. "Catholics don't recognize birth control, Jews don't recognize Jesus, and Mormons don't recognize each other in Nevada."
Mr. Meeks's comments brought a chuckle from one Mormon woman who has been a regular on the bus to West Wendover.
"The Lord doesn't like you to gamble, but I'm willing to risk it," she said. Many Mormons, she said, "will tell you they go out there for the prime rib, but we have prime rib in Salt Lake City, too."
The woman said she might stop going to West Wendover in a few years when she turns 70 and starts worrying about meeting her maker. But until then, gambling is a matter of principle as much as a hobby.
"This is Mormon territory, and we're L.D.S.," she said, gesturing to her husband, who leaned forward on his aluminum cane in the bus seat beside her. "But it's too confined. I have my religion, but sometimes it's like Communism."

HEADLINE: Time to Make Sense on Rent Control

 BODY:
New York City's rent regulations expire tomorrow, as they do every two years. And legislators are again at loggerheads over rent controls that masquerade as boons to the city's poor and middle class, but actually hurt them by inflating the cost of housing and robbing the city of badly needed tax revenues.
There's not much good about rent controls, despite their undeserved popularity among tenants. They reduce property tax revenues, discourage construction of new rental apartments and speed the deterioration of older housing. Controls are making a sick real estate market sicker. Costs are up, the economy is down and owners cannot recoup their losses through rents. 
 Great, say tenants, many of them wealthy New Yorkers profiting from artificially depressed rents. In fact, the situation is anything but great, with as many as 140,000 apartments on the verge of abandonment. Who will live in them then?
There's a solution to the city's perpetual housing crisis: Lift the rent controls on some tenants in some buildings. A bill pending in the State Senate would decontrol luxury apartments, removing rent controls on apartments whose tenants earn $100,000 a year or more. Another bill would gradually remove controls on all buildings as tenants move out.
Both measures are imperfect but deserve serious debate. The Republican-controlled State Senate held two days of hearings in May, but because rent regulations remain a sacred cow in New York City, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, will not consider decontrol. He and Gov. Mario Cuomo prefer the worst possible alternative -- making the current laws permanent.
That approach would put an end to Albany's biennial battle over rent regulations. But the costs of carving a bad law into stone are unacceptable. Hastily enacting the Senate's decontrol bills is no answer either. They do not, for example, provide a reliable mechanism for verifying a tenant's income that does not jeopardize privacy on the one hand or permit cheating on the other.
Such controversial legislation needs more extensive debate than it's gotten, and that debate cannot be conducted and concluded by tomorrow at midnight, when the law expires. The best alternative would be for Albany's leaders to buy time by approving a temporary extension of the current law; a month would make sense. Then they can sit down at the negotiating table and revise the law to benefit the city, its tenants and its housing.

HEADLINE: Is Clinton Moving to Left, Right or Center?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A History of Gergenism" (editorial, June 2 ), on the ascendancy of style over substance in the Clinton White House with the appointment of David R. Gergen as communications director, was a welcome relief from mass media hype over Mr. Gergen. 
 Unfortunately, you too miss the point that content is itself changing, which is obscured by the focus on style. The line with which we are inundated is that the Clinton right turn is a return to the center policies that elected the President. This is pure spin with little substance.
Candidate Clinton, the one we elected, promised a middle-class tax cut and infrastructure investment to jump-start the economy and make us more productive. Candidate Clinton disagreed with Ross Perot and cited the deflationary danger of focusing excessively on deficit reduction.
But President Clinton seems to have fallen into Mr. Perot's deficit obsession, and we're all being sucked into it. He abandoned a watered down and largely symbolic infrastructure package without a fight, got a $200 haircut and tried to contract out the White House travel service to a friend. This is movement to the left? Then he hires Mr. Gergen of Reaganomics fame to move to the center?
This kind of spin leaves us all dizzy enough to believe that right is center, and left is wrong, but it has nothing to do with reality. It's just more of the same avoidance that got us into this mess in the first place.
Candidate Clinton was at least willing to deal with problems, while President Clinton is backing away from the very issues that elected him and calls it a return to the center. Buying this product will not get the economy moving again.

HEADLINE: A Victim of the Deregulated Road

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The St. Johnsbury Trucking Company, a leader in the Northeast trucking market, said yesterday that it would close after years of struggling with problems that included nonunionized competitors and a soft Northeast economy.
The fate of the company, founded 72 years ago as a milk hauler in St. Johnsbury, Vt., mirrors that of many trucking companies that have fallen since the industry was deregulated in 1980. Of the top 50 trucking companies operating in 1978, by last year all but 9 had closed or merged. 
 "It certainly follows a long, unhappy history of carriers not being able to get their cost structure down from what it was in the 1970's, when carriers were quite well protected," said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the American Trucking Associations. "There is nothing unusual about this."
St. Johnsbury, which has 4,000 workers, has restructured its finances twice since 1991 to lighten the debt incurred in a 1986 leveraged buyout.
"It just goes to show that market leadership doesn't necessarily confer profitability," said Paul R. Schlesinger, a trucking industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
As of last night, St. Johnsbury had not released details of its decision, although it indicated that it did not plan a restructuring.
The move followed several attempts in recent years to ease pressures on the company's finances. Earlier this month, the Teamsters union, which represents roughly 3,000 drivers and dock workers, agreed to a 9 percent wage cut, with a promise that workers would share the company's profits.
The company had asked workers in April to approve a 12 percent wage cut in return for a profit-sharing plan, but the rank-and-file members balked at the proposal.
Industry analysts were aware that St. Johnsbury, based in Holliston, Mass., was having difficulties, but assumed that the wage concession had given it breathing room.
Teamsters officials said they met with St. Johnsbury executives on Thursday, when the company outlined its bleak finances and relayed an order from its bank to liquidate the company. At the time, the company proposed a broad range of concessions, including cutting the work force by half, closing 24 of its 54 terminals and replacing the union's health and pension plans with less expensive St. Johnsbury plans.
The teamsters determined, based on a recent audit of the company's finances, that the company clearly had no chance of surviving. Last year, St. Johnsbury lost $13.4 million on revenue of $88.1 million, far more than the 1991 loss of $2.2 million on revenue of $93.6 million.
"Its another case where workers cannot save a company from management's mistakes and 12 years of deregulation," said Ron Carey, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
 
 
Rivals Have Cut Back
 The impact of St. Johnsbury's liquidation plans on other companies that require transportation of so-called less-than-truckload shipments is unclear. But Walter Riley, president of G.O.D. Inc., a less-than-truckload carrier based in Kearny, N.J., said his company and other competitors of St. Johnsbury would have capacity to pick up only about half of the company's roughly 12,000 daily shipments.
St. Johnsbury was believed to have held about 17 percent of the market.
Companies like St. Johnsbury, whichship smaller loads, have seen increasing competition at both ends of their market niche. Many shippers have restructured their operations to take advantage of the lower cost of full truckload transportation. And companies that have used St. Johnsbury in the past for small but highly profitable loads have been turning increasingly to shippers like Federal Express and United Parcel Service.

HEADLINE: Valuable Diploma or Meaningless Piece of Paper?

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
A year ago, Charisse Dangerfield, a cherub-faced 16-year-old from the Bronx, was just another student bored with the rigors of getting a good education. On more days than she can count, she shortened her misery by skipping math and any other classes she found especially dull.
"I was doing badly," she said, her words accented by the rhythmic smacks of her chewing gum. "I just wasn't doing my work." 
 But before Charisse was backed into a seemingly lightless tunnel between dropping out and being pushed out of school, her mother took a well-intentioned gamble. She enrolled her daughter in a program that would essentially allow her to skip high school by taking classes for a General Educational Development diploma, known in shorthand as G.E.D.
"It's easier than high school," Charisse said, adding that she is never given homework after her two-and-a-half-hour school days. "The teachers try to help you more."
 
Value of Diploma Debated
 Whether students like Charisse are making the right decision is a topic of growing debate among educators, as the city expands its G.E.D. capacity while some academicians question the value of its special diploma.
Nationally, the number of people taking the G.E.D. declined slightly last year, primarily because of sharp drops in Florida and New York State. In Florida, the decline is attributed to the disruptions of Hurricane Andrew, while in New York State officials cite a new $25 testing fee. But in New York City, where public school administrators have been aggressively persuading dropouts to resume their educations, as well as helping needy students get fee waivers for the examination, G.E.D. testing continues to increase, said Shelia Evans-Tranumn, director of the city's Auxiliary Services for High Schools.
Some supporters of the G.E.D. say that attaining the diploma -- which requires passing a test that includes sections on English, reading, science, social studies and math and generally takes students months to prepare for -- can greatly improve a student's scholastic skills and pave the way for college. But detractors argue that a G.E.D. diploma is far less valuable than a conventional high school education and that having a back-door route to graduation can distract some students who should be in high school.
"I wouldn't want my child getting a G.E.D.," said Lester Golden, director of high schools for the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, the union for New York school administrators. It is obvious, Mr. Golden said, that a G.E.D. diploma is "not on the same level as a city diploma or state Regents diploma."
 
Age Limit as Deterrent
 For more than 50 years, G.E.D. has represented a second chance at getting a basic education for nearly anyone who was unable to obtain a conventional high school diploma. Introduced in 1942 by the Veterans Testing Service, the program was primarily designed for Americans who interrupted their high school years to serve in World War II.
The G.E.D. Testing Service, which administers the test nationwide, does not allow anyone under the age of 16 to take the test to prevent students from leaving school too early.
But today, nearly one in seven diplomas, both in New York City and nationwide, is a G.E.D. It is increasingly being seen by some -- particularly those who feel trapped in poor, inner-city schools -- as a shortcut out of a troubled high school experience.
In the last four years, the number of students in the New York school system's G.E.D. program rose to 15,000 from 6,000, said officials for the Board of Education's Auxiliary Services for High Schools, which operates the G.E.D. preparation classes.
Susan Porter Robinson, director of outreach for the Center for Adult Learning, said it is "disturbing" if students are indeed leaving schools in favor of G.E.D. diplomas. The center is part of the American Council on Education, a nonprofit group that administers G.E.D. with each state department of education.
 
Not Intended as Lure
 "We don't want G.E.D. ever to be a lure for students who belong in school," she said. "This is an opportunity for adult learners who did not complete school to earn a diploma."
Nonetheless, Raymond Domanico, director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Educational Innovation, said the potential benefits of earning a G.E.D. diploma are clear for students who have trouble with conventional high school settings.
"Students leaving with a G.E.D. are better having one than not," he said, adding that some go to college.
Mr. Domanico, a former director of data analysis for the New York City Board of Education, said he found that in the mid-1980's about 30 percent of the city's high school students had extreme difficulty handling the demands of traditional classroom instruction. For many of those youths, G.E.D. is a "better option than just dropping out."
But several recent studies suggest that someone with a G.E.D. diploma tends to do no better financially than someone with no diploma at all, and significantly worse than those with high school diplomas.
"It amounts to nothing in labor-market earning," James J. Heckman, a University of Chicago economist who co-wrote a series of research papers on G.E.D.'s last year. Referring to the test itself, he said, "it is not a challenging examination."
And the Army, the last branch of the armed services to accept G.E.D. graduates, last year stopped accepting recruits with G.E.D. diplomas because, it said, they failed basic training at twice the rate as recruits with traditional high school diplomas.
But G.E.D. officials discount the Heckman studies, contending that their sample group of less than 150 all-male G.E.D. graduates was insufficient to properly represent the benefits of the diploma. The value of a G.E.D. should not be "determined solely on a person's income," said Janet Baldwin, director of policy research for the G.E.D. Testing Center in Washington.
 
A Second Chance
 Despite the debate, the program is increasingly being viewed as an attractive alternative to high school in some neighborhoods, like the South Bronx. Many students, like Charisse Dangerfield, who have squandered their chances to graduate with their classmates, view a G.E.D. diploma as a safety net to rebound them into a productive future. And New York school officials count most young G.E.D. graduates as "successful completions," thus lowering the system's drop-out rates.
A student who reads at the eighth-grade level can take three to six months of preparation for the test, G.E.D. officials in New York said.
Ms. Evans-Tranumn attributes the sharp rise in G.E.D. students to several factors. As the number of dropouts has increased, schools have become better at tracking them and helping them find other methods -- like alternative schools and G.E.D. -- of getting diplomas, Ms. Evans-Tranumn said.
In addition, new waves of immigrants settling in New York have helped to create a pool of slightly older high school students with special needs who have turned to the G.E.D., Ms. Evans-Tranumn said.
And there are, she said, students with growing impatience who want "to get in college right away."
 
Largest Single Group
 About half of the city's G.E.D. candidates are 16 to 19 years old, officials said. Every year, more than half a million people take the G.E.D. tests in the United States and its territories. About 33 percent of them are 16 to 19.
It is the largest single group of students taking the test, according to 1992 statistics complied by the American Council on Education.
The city's auxiliary services counsels students on the best method to complete their high school education, its officials said. In many cases, students who had especially poor attendance and few of the required 40 credits to finish high school are encouraged to study for the G.E.D. test, Ms. Evans-Tranumn said.
"We have always gotten students who came from the worst high schools in this city, from the streets, from being homeless, straight out of jails, presently on probation," she said. "But in the midst of that, we've gotten the high achievers, who have come from the top high schools."
Many New York students say that their schools have become too infected with violence and drugs for students to learn, or that their teachers are too frightened or uninterested to teach. So some say they are considering dropping out and opting into G.E.D. classes, which tend to be smaller and more individualized.
"I've seen really sharp, young black men and women who were opting to get G.E.D.'s to leave school early," said Evelyn Reid, a professor at the Department of Curriculum and Instruction for Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. "What's happening in New York is just the tip of the iceberg of what is happening in other parts of the country."
Dr. Baldwin, of the G.E.D. Testing Service, which is also part of the American Council on Education, said a recent survey by her office found that nearly a quarter of students who drop out do so because they feel "disengaged from school." They are bored or unhappy, cannot adjust to school routine or just don't like school, she said.
"This cuts across racial and social lines," Dr. Baldwin added.
Indira Fret of the Bronx said she dropped out of school at 15 because of nothing less than sheer terror.
When she was 14 years old, she said, she was sexually attacked by a group of boys at her school. She was rescued from her attackers but was too terrified to remain in school.
Mrs. Fret, who is now 22, resumed her education years later in a G.E.D. program in the South Bronx.
"I wanted to be a flight attendant," she said, but was disappointed when she was told by a job interviewer that she must at least have some college education. After getting a clerical job in a G.E.D. center in her old Bronx neighborhood, she decided to enroll.
Today, she said, she wants to pursue a "career in computers." A high school or G.E.D. diploma is a requirement for the computer training course she wants to take.
She has been taking G.E.D. preparation courses for several years and has taken the test seven times, she said. But each time Mrs. Fret has failed to achieve the passing grade of 225 out of a possible 385. Undaunted, Mrs. Fret, who has a 5-month-old daughter, is preparing to take the test again.
"I hope to graduate on June 18," she said with a smile brimming with pride and optimism.

HEADLINE: Stock Traders Cautious Ahead of Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks turned in a lackluster performance in sharply slower trading yesterday, but key indexes managed to move a little higher.
Trading was cautious ahead of today's release of the Consumer Price Index for May, which may or may not confirm last week's Producer Price Index report that showed a leveling of inflation. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.68 points, to 3,514.69, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange at 216.2 million shares traded, sharply lower than Friday's 256.8 million. The number of Big Board gainers and losers were nearly even.
Other market indicators were narrowly ahead, including the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues, which rose 3.22 points, to 696.41.
 
 
Drug Issues Cited
 Anthony Ludovici, senior vice president and senior investment analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., described the market as leaderless with the exception of drug issues.
Mr. Ludovici said Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech on Sunday before the American Medical Association in Chicago might have been a factor in moving drug stocks higher. Mrs. Clinton offered doctors "a new bargain" in health-care reform, promising to try to include prescription drugs among areas subject to less burdensome supervision if the association would support the Administration's plans.
In trading yesterday, Pfizer rose 1 1/2, to 72 3/8, and Schering-Plough gained 7/8, to 69.
Among issues bouncing back from recent selloffs, Apple Computer gained7/8, to 44 5/8, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing advanced 1/2, to 109.
Transportation issues, led by airlines and rails, were down and under pressure, with the outcome of the economic package and the energy tax still unresolved. Delta Air Lines slid 7/8, to 52; AMR, American Airlines' parent, fell 7/8, to 68 1/2, and UAL, United Airlines' parent, lost 1 1/2, to 131 7/8.
In other trading, an announcement by U.S. Surgical that it would report a second-quarter loss put pressure on the stock as it tumbled 3 1/8 to finish at 26 5/8. Analysts cut their earnings estimates on the bad news.
Reebok International, which said earnings for the second quarter and the year would be lower than analysts' estimates, fell 4 3/8, to 30. The company said the earnings shortfall came primarily from United States footwear operations, where lack of new products in the basketball category, pricing and repositioning of the casual shoe line resulted in lower revenues.
Atmel, a manufacturer of integrated circuits, announced a technology licensing agreement for I.B.M. to sell a line of ultra-high-speed computer parts from Atmel. Atmel touched a 52-week trading high of 25, before closing at 24 5/8, unchanged.
 
 
Eastman Kodak Gains
 Shares of Eastman Kodak rose 2 5/8, to 53 3/4, in anticipation of a possible restructuring announcement today. The stock accounted for more than half the move on the Dow. Eugene Glazer, a Dean Witter analyst, adjusted his recommendation on Kodak to buy from neutral.
Goody Products, which designs and markets a variety of hair accessories, rose 5 1/8, to 23 1/2, on an agreement in principle with the Newell Company to merge Goody into a subsidiary of Newell.

HEADLINE: Intra-Party Fights Complicate Florio-Whitman Race

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 14

 BODY:
Jim Florio already has his hands full battling the Republicans in his gubernatorial campaign, and Christine Todd Whitman will be under constant fire from the Democrats. That's to be expected.
But just to make things interesting, both candidates also face nagging problems in their own parties that at best are unwelcome distractions, and at worst could undermine efforts to get the vote out in November. 
 Mr. Florio, the Democratic incumbent, has to worry about warring factions in Essex and Hudson Counties, two traditional Democratic strongholds where he must roll up big margins to stay in office. The Florio camp is intent on achieving peace and patching any cracks in party discipline.
The Essex County organization will elect a new chairman on Tuesday. But it is not clear whether that will give Democrats a chance to unite or an excuse to continue the fighting.
 
Leaders May Not Follow
 Mrs. Whitman, the Republican challenger, is in a more delicate situation. Her party controls the Legislature, leaving Mrs. Whitman walking the tightrope of criticizing the state of affairs in Trenton without jabbing her own party's leaders with the barbs. She showed how hard that can be right after she won the primary when she assailed the Governor for "cynically" discussing a tax cut during an election year. Turns out the idea was first aired by Republican leaders in the Legislature.
Moreover, those legislative leaders have been dealing with the Governor on a variety of issues for two years and are not necessarily ready to simply follow Mrs. Whitman's lead during the campaign, when all 120 seats are up for re-election.
This was brought home today when the Joint Appropriations Committee released its version of the state budget for the coming fiscal year.
Instead of a tax cut for the middle class discussed by the Republican leadership and the Governor, the committee's proposal now has a $150 million "taxpayer relief fund surplus." The Republicans say the money would be allocated during the coming year to help offset possible gasoline or other tax increases by the Clinton Administration.
Suddenly left without a tax cut to share credit for, Mr. Florio criticized the lawmakers, and Mrs. Whitman, saying they were setting up a political slush fund.
The problem for Mrs. Whitman is that she had nothing to do with the budget change, according to her staff. She did try to recoup today, however, saying the Republican majority's budget deserved support, and calling Mr. Florio's interest in cutting taxes "a foxhole conversion."
 
Tougher Fight in the Suburbs
 Of the two candidates, Mr. Florio seems to have the tougher road for now with the added burden of infighting in Hudson and Essex Counties. The Governor is hoping that residents' anger at the $2.8 billion in new taxes he pushed through the Legislature in 1990 will not become votes against him. He also has to hope that a Federal inquiry into whether state bond business was improperly steered to certain bond houses uncovers no wrongdoing.
Mr. Florio defeated James A. Courter, a former Republican Congressman, for the governorship four years ago by more than 540,000 votes. But he will find tougher sledding in the suburbs this time, said Neil Upmeyer, the president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton.
"The Governor will be very dependent this time on large turnouts in the Democratic strongholds," Mr. Upmeyer said.
In 1989 Essex County gave Mr. Florio 74,629 more votes than it gave Mr. Courter, and Hudson, Middlesex and Camden counties each added more than 60,000 for the Governor.
In Essex and Hudson counties this year, the Democratic chairmen denied veteran state senators a place on the organizations' endorsed slates of candidates in the primary.
 
Senators vs. County Leaders
 In one of Hudson's three legislative districts, Senator Thomas F. Cowan, a 16-year member of the Legislature, was defeated by Mayor Nicholas Sacco of North Bergen, who was backed by Bruce Walter, the Hudson Democratic Chairman. Mr. Cowan was supported by Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive.
In Essex County, Senator Richard J. Codey, a 20-year legislative veteran, won renomination with 62 percent of the vote, chiefly by campaigning against the man who pushed him off the organization's ballot line, the Essex Democratic Chairman, Thomas J. D'Alessio. Then Mr. Codey campaigned to unseat Mr. D'Alessio as county chairman.
On Saturday Mr. D'Alessio threw in the towel. He announced he would not seek re-election as chairman when the county's Democratic committee meets Tuesday night and said he would support Thomas Giblin, the Essex County Surrogate and former freeholder. Mr. Codey was still mulling whether to run for chairman himself, to back someone else or to agree to support Mr. Giblin.
Mr. D'Alessio, who is also the Essex County Executive, is under indictment on Federal charges of mail fraud and money laundering stemming from a fund-raising dinner.
 
'We Must Be United'
 State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, the New Jersey Democratic Chairman, says he is worried about the splits in the two counties. "The problems are going to have to be settled, but they are going to have to do it," he said. "Any involvement by me would not be helpful." He said, however, that he would tell the counties "in the strongest way possible" that they had to put aside their differences.
"We must be united in November," he said.
Another possible problem for Mr. Florio is that Bret Schundler, a Republican, recently defeated the Democratic organization in Hudson County to win the mayoralty in Jersey City. He promptly announced that the Democratic Party could no longer take the city for granted.
For her part, Mrs. Whitman has to find a way to plot her own course in the coming months without crossing wires with veteran party members.
"She has a problem with her relationship with the Republican Legislative leadership," said Mr. Upmeyer. "Her initial remarks calling a tax cut a 'cynical' idea was a pie in the face of her own party's leaders."
 
A Matter of Trust
 "The legislative leaders weren't with her when she talked to the press," he added, "and they are not as unified a team as you would expect."
But Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian said he heard a simple, coherent message in what others viewed as a flip-flop on the question of taxes. "What she said was that she wouldn't trust Florio to cut taxes but she would trust us," he said.
Mark Herr, the executive director of the State Republican Committee, said it was important that the Republican Party "speak with one voice." That, he said, will become easier as soon everyone realizes there are only two issues in the coming campaign -- "the economy and integrity."
"The Republican Party is more unified than it has been in years, and we have only one person to thank for it: Jim Florio," Mr. Herr said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Mixed Views on New York City

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Two major credit agencies gave mixed reviews yesterday to the $31.2 billion budget approved by the New York City Council.
Both agencies -- Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service -- are reviewing the details of the budget, which has nearly $1.8 billion more in spending than did the budget adopted last year. But the agencies' initial responses, before a thorough reading of the spending plan, differed. 
 Richard Larkin, the managing director who oversees the S.& P. analysts following New York City's finances, said there were some disturbing elements in the budget, which is for the 1994 fiscal year that begins July 1. He said the agency would comment on its current rating of New York City's debt by the end of the month, but he would not indicate whether a change was afoot. S.& P. now rates the city A- with a negative outlook.
 
Improvement Is Noted
 At Moody's, Michael Johnston, a vice president, and Brad Gewehr, a senior analyst, said the city faced difficult problems in balancing its budget over the long term. But they both said they saw no reason to change the agency's rating because the new budget, despite its faults, was better than those of a couple of years ago. They also said that the end of the recession in New York City was improving the outlook. The Moody's rating is Baa-1, which is lower than the S.& P. rating.
Mr. Larkin said the new level of spending, given the current size of the budget gaps, "is not affordable on an ongoing basis." He said some of the one-time savings and revenue items in the budget were not likely to be there next year to support the higher level of city spending.
He said the S.& P. review would focus on "whether there is any significant risk to some of the projections and assumptions in 1994 and if it makes the future gap in 1995 and beyond any worse."
Mr. Johnston and Mr. Gewehr agreed that there were problems with the assumptions in the budget. But Mr. Johnston said that the economy, which he called "the foundation of the city credit rating," was "in the process of stabilizing." And of the budget itself, he added, "Frankly, when you stack it up with budgets done in recent years, it is not as uncertain."
Mr. Gewehr, noting that there had been sharp criticism of the budget as it went through the drafting and approval process, said that some opponents were saying that the credit agencies would have to take action, possibly by lowering the city's rating. But he said that this budget "represents a budget process consistent with the credit rating we have on the city at this point."
 
Financing Trump
 Donald J. Trump is coming back to the junk-bond market, possibly as soon as today, and selling $375 million of bonds, some of which could earn 15 percent or more for the buyers.
The deal, with Merrill Lynch as the lead underwriter, is in two parts. The largest piece is $315 million in mortgage notes due in 2001 to be issued by Trump Plaza Funding Inc.
The second part, which is expected to yield the 15 percent or more, is $60 million in payment-in-kind notes due in 2003 to be issued by Trump Plaza Holding Associates. Only $35 million of these notes will be offered to the public; the rest is going to creditors of Mr. Trump.
The payment-in-kind notes come with a warrant that allows the holder to get an additional $1,000 in principal for each $5,000 of original payment-in-kind notes.
With a payment-in-kind note, the issuer can make the interest payments by issuing new notes with the face value of the interest owed if the cash is not available. Under this deal, payment in kind can be made until some time in 2001.
According to Merrill Lynch, the price talk on the mortgage notes has them priced to yield 11.25 percent to 11.50 percent if they are sold at par or their face value. The talk on the payment-in-kind notes puts the yield 150 basis points or hundredths of a percentage point over the yield on the mortgage notes, placing them in the range of 12.75 percent to 13 percent. The effective yield rises to 15 percent or more if the value of the warrants is included, analysts say.
The bonds are all rated below investment grade -- the junk-bond category. Standard & Poor's rates the mortgage bonds at B and the payment-in-kind notes at CCC+. Moody's rates the mortgage notes at B-3 and the payment-in-kind notes at Caa.
Kingman Penniman, executive vice president at Duff & Phelps/MCM Investment Research Company, said his firm was recommending the mortgage bonds. But he said that if the demand for the bonds was so great that the yield could be cut below 11 percent, he would have to reconsider the recommendation because such a yield might not be enough to compensate for the risk.
His firm has no recommendation on the payment-in-kind notes, but he said they should be evalulated as an equity investment rather than a fixed-income investment.
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices finished slightly lower yesterday after a day in which most traders and investors were biding their time ahead of this morning's release of the Consumer Price Index for May.
With the report Friday that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods was unchanged in May, much of the inflation scare of the last month has dissipated. If the consumer index comes in at the two-tenths of 1 percent that is expected, then investors will breath easier for the time being.
In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond was down 3/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.81 percent from 6.80 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of the yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: In Serbia, Sanctions Fuel Rage

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia, June 11

 BODY:
Under the green plastic roof of the central market, Desa Kukobat fumbled to make change for a customer, slowly counting out a thick pile of 100,000- and 50,000-dinar notes, once a small fortune in Yugoslavia. The head of lettuce she had just sold cost 50,000 dinars; the man, apologizing, said the smallest bill he had was one million dinars, which is worth only about $1.30 at today's rate.
"The embargo is suffocating us," complained Mrs. Kukobat, 53, a sunburned woman selling cucumbers, lettuce and potatoes. "People can't afford to buy anything, we can't afford to produce very much and the money is worthless paper. Why don't you ease these sanctions? We are not America's enemies." 
Like other people in this graceful Danube River city, 50 miles northwest of Belgrade, that is the capital of Serbia's fertile Vojvodina region, Mrs. Kukobat says she does not care so much about the war in neighboring Bosnia, nor about politicians' visions of a greater Serbia.
 
Harder Each Day
 What matters, she says, is that life for her and for her family becomes harder with each day, a grim reality resulting from the United Nations' economic sanctions enforced a year ago on what remains of Yugoslavia. For this she holds the West -- rather than her own leaders -- accountable.
Mrs. Kukobat's opinion is just the sort the most nationalist and militant political leaders in Serbia like to hear.
"This is what we have argued," said Maja Gojkovic, the 30-year-old vice president of the Serbian Parliament and a lawyer from Novi Sad who is a founding member of the Serbian Radical Party. "Instead of achieving their goal of making Serbia surrender, the West has only provoked the people's spite."
The most jingoistic of the Serbian parties, the Radicals won a third of the votes cast in Novi Sad in last December's national elections and now make up the second-largest block of legislators in the Federal Assembly.
 
Strengthened Hard-Liners
 Western diplomats in Belgrade believe that hyperinflation, currently running at an estimated 300 percent a month, and the continuing decline in production in the rump Yugoslavia have strengthened the hand of hard-liners who favor continued support for the Serbian nationalists in Bosnia.
Those problems may also have been a factor in recent moves by the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, to crack down on internal critics.
Goran Golic, a 31-year-old clerk in a bookshop on a cobblestone square in Novi Sad, said many people are turning to the nationalists for their answers.
"They have nothing else to lose, so why not?" said Mr. Golic, whose shop is filled with fading copies of fashion magazines, dating from the time before the embargo.
His colleague, Milorad Vlaisavljevic, 27, added: "The sanctions have closed the circle around the people, diminishing their energy and limiting their access to information. You must know this: The West is not punishing the politicians, it is punishing ordinary people, and strengthening the hand of those who are the most authoritarian."
 
Powerful Still Live Well
 Bojana Krndija, a 23-year-old university student, said that by imposing sanctions to pressure Serbia into ending its support for the Bosnian Serbs, the West is missing the point.
"I don't know how my mother manages to live," she said. "But I am sure the people in political power here still have a good life."
While the sanctions are the handy explanation for everything that has gone wrong, Western diplomats say they account for only a part of Yugoslavia's difficulties. A more important obstacle, they insist, is Mr. Milosevic's determination to preserve the old socialist command economy.
"For Milosevic, the problem is not the war in Bosnia," said Vladeta Yankovic, an opposition member of Parliament. "His trouble is at home."
 
A Scene of Plenty
 On the surface, life in Novi Sad, a regional market center of 179,000 people, appears untouched. Cafes and restaurants are crowded, the market stalls are filled with eggs and vegetables from the surrounding rural areas, and vendors on the central square sell everything from popcorn and ice cream on sticks to cigarettes.
But there are critical shortages of some goods, including soap powder and milk, and wages are not keeping pace with prices. The government monthly minimum wage for May was six million dinars, which at current prices will buy about six cheese sandwiches.
Last week, a Belgrade magazine calculated that if one were to borrow a million dinars today, it would cost 180 billion dinars to repay in a year's time, if inflation does not worsen.
Still, for many like Radoslav Vasic, a 27-year-old shoemaker and army veteran whose business has dropped off to virtually nothing, the sanctions and the economic decline are something good Serbs must endure.
"The sanctions will change nothing," he said. "No matter if you shoot at us, no matter what injustice you do to us, we know we are right."

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
43,412 Stricken Cubans, and Not a Single Answer

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, June 12

 BODY:
On the 15th floor of the Hermanos Almeijeiras Hospital, the towering downtown complex that is the pride of Cuba's medical establishment, new patients arrive each day with a mysterious ailment that has left many people sightless and set off a global scramble to determine its cause.
Some patients with the disease, which has been variously described as optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy, writhe and grimace as muscles in their legs and arms flicker in and out of spasm. Others lie listlessly, their vision blurred and their other senses confused. Since the disorder of the nervous system first surfaced at the end of 1991, the illness has been diagnosed in 43,412 people, the Cuban authorities say. 
 In a sort of hysteria arising in part from fear and uncertainty about the disease's origins, countless others have shown up in clinics and doctors' offices to report everything from burning and tingling in their hands and feet to difficulty distinguishing ordinary colors, only to find that their symptoms, real or imagined, had nothing to do with the epidemic.
"For Cuban scientists, this disease remains an absolute mystery," said Dr. Raul Gomez Cabrera, director of the Hermanos Almeijeiras Hospital. "The one thing we can say with certainty is that it is very different from the usual patterns of epidemic."
So far scientists from Cuba and the growing number of foreign specialists mobilized to study and help contain the epidemic have focused on two possible causes for the disease: toxic or nutritional factors, or some previously unknown virus.
One baffling factor is that outbreaks within families or households, where people live in close contact and eat similar food, do not appear to be especially common, Cuban experts say.
 
The U.S. Sends Scientists
 In a rare show of American cooperation with Cuba, a team of scientists from the National Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and experts from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., visited Cuba recently to examine patients and take samples of bodily fluids back to laboratories in the United States for analysis.
So far the disease is not known to have caused any deaths, and it seems to run its course in four to six weeks, leaving most patients with minor damage to the nerves. Nearly 10 percent of the patients have lost their sight, however, and some suffer from a lingering loss of coordination. Because the disease is relatively new, doctors are not certain that such damage will be permanent.
As another patient in the same hospital room moaned from the painful spasms in her feet, Dianelis Sanchez, an 18-year-old woman from Pinar del Rio in western Cuba, said she had been sent to Almeijeiras Hospital 10 days earlier after her vision deteriorated and she felt tingling in her arms.
"I feel better now, except for the needle I got when they took fluid from my spine this morning," Miss Sanchez said. "I am not in any pain, and my sight seems to have returned to normal."
Unsure of the cause of the disease, Cuban doctors have been injecting patients with high doses of multivitamins and administering ordinary pain killers, both of which seem to provide some relief, even though there is no evidence that the disease is actually caused by nutritional deficiencies.
More exotic treatments have been tried on some patients, including ultrasonic and magnetic therapies and hyperbaric oxygenation, a treatment most often used for victims of severe burns or smoke inhalation.
Hoping to slow the spread of the disease, Cuban public health officials say they are distributing ordinary multivitamins to the entire population at a cost estimated so far at $40 million. The vitamins are not thought to be a cure, but rather seem to improve general health and increase resistance to the disease.
That it would occur to the Cuban authorities here to distribute vitamins so widely is a reflection of the plummeting living standards in what had only recently been one of Latin America's healthiest and most affluent countries. Especially hard hit is the Cuban diet, with is limited by strict rationing.
 
Little Resentment Evident
 Cuba's economic decline has resulted mainly from the collapse of the Soviet bloc and a three-decade American embargo. But the suffering has been aggravated by fierce storms that have destroyed crops and interrupted work on tourist hotels that were a leading economic priority.
Soon after it became apparent that it had a major epidemic on its hands that would require international help, President Fidel Castro's Government seemed worried about the possibility that citizens would blame their leaders for the problem. Initially the Government even hinted that the illness could be the work of foreign sabotage.
But there has been little evidence of strong resentment toward the Government over the outbreak itself. Health care is one of the few areas in which Havana has been able to maintain standards comparable to those that existed before the country's economic crisis began three years ago.
One hypothesis is that substitutes used by individuals or state-owned producers for ordinary food ingredients have had a toxic effect. Because of the shortages, soy products are often substituted for meat, for example, and alcoholic beverages are often brewed at home.
Even more worrying to many medical experts, some of whom who draw comparisons to the sudden appearance of AIDS, is the possibility of a new or recently mutated virus that could conceivably spread to other countries and affect health in ways that are still unknown.
"There is enormous work to be done here before getting to the bottom of this, and the Cubans are in no position to do it all on their own," said Dr. Miguel Marquez, resident director of the Pan American Health Organization. "No one knows where this thing could appear next, or if we will be seeing deaths from it down the road."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Ends Down Slightly; Energy Prices Are Also Off

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices continued their retreat yesterday until a late rally erased most of the loss and left traders uncertain about gold's underlying strengths.
"We're looking to see where this correction will end," said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion dealer at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. 
 The gold market has been in a general decline since late last month when it reached a 28-month high of $384.50.
When gold trading opened at the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, there was a renewal of last week's selloff, attributed to the Producer Price Index and other economic measures showing little inflationary pressure.
"But then the market found some new buying and it zoomed up five bucks on the close," Mr. Mehta said. "We're still uncertain what this means, but it looks like $360 is the lower level for this market."
By the end of the day, gold for August delivery, the most actively traded contract, was down 80 cents, settling at $365.30 a troy ounce after being as low as $361.70. Silver, meanwhile, advanced, with July silver rising 2.5 cents, to $4.218 a troy ounce.
Another analyst, William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, was not much impressed with the late rebound in gold.
"I'd call the recovery today a dead cat bounce," he said. "The short-term trading trend is still negative," he said. "That doesn't mean the market will drop to the March lows of $325, but there is room for further declines."
Gold analysts said they were awaiting the Government report today on consumer prices in May, which is expected to throw some further light on the prospects for inflation and the price of gold.
Separately, most energy futures were lower at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for July delivery lost 9 cents and settled at $18.89 a barrel; July heating oil was 0.56 cent lower at 52.45 cents a gallon; July gasoline was 0.07 cent lower at 54.54 cents a gallon, and July natural gas was 2.2 cents higher at $2.200 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: An Employer Loses Ruling On Pensions

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The Supreme Court unanimously upheld today the constitutionality of the Federal pension law that requires employers to make good on their financial obligations when they withdraw from an industrywide pension plan.
The case was an important test of the law Congress passed 13 years ago to remove employers' incentives to avoid financial liability by pulling out of weak pension plans. 
 The employer in this case, a California-based manufacturer of concrete pipes, told the Court that its withdrawal liability would consume 46 percent of its net worth. It argued that the assessment violated its constitutional right to due process of law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property without compensation.
Writing for the Court today, Justice David H. Souter said that the liability imposed by the law, the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, met the test of due process as a "clearly rational" form of economic regulation. On the property issue, he wrote, "Our cases have long established that mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a taking."
The decision, Concrete Pipe and Products of California v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust, No. 91-904, upheld a 1991 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.
The multiemployer pension law was passed as an amendment to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, the basic Federal law regulating employers' pension obligations. The amendment addressed specific problems facing industrywide pension plans, which are common in industries composed of small employers whose workers move from job to job within the same trade.
While in theory, these pension plans offer stability and risk-sharing for employers and portability for employees, they have been beset by problems of underfinancing. When the law was passed to impose withdrawal liability on employers who leave such plans, the condition of these already weak plans was being weakened further by employer flight.
Under the 1980 law, employers who leave a plan must pay their proportionate share of the plan's unfinanced vested benefits. Calculating that obligation can be highly contentious, and the law created a system requiring deference to the judgments of the plan's trustees, usually a joint labor-management committee.
One of the employer's constitutional arguments in this case was that because trustees are obliged to consider the health of the plan as a whole, the system creates a built-in bias toward imposing the maximum liability on any single employer who withdraws. Justice Souter, however, said that this feature of the law did not make it unconstitutional.
In several earlier cases, the Court had upheld the constitutionality of the multiemployer law as a general matter without examining its operation in the detail provided by this case. One of Concrete Pipe's arguments was that the law was so burdensome as to be unconstitutional in its specific application even if constitutional as an abstract matter.
 
Banks and Insurance
 The Court without comment refused today to hear an appeal from a ruling that the Comptroller of the Currency lacked authority to permit national banks to sell title insurance and other specialized forms of insurance.
The case involved a 77-year-old Federal banking law known as Section 92, which the Court dealt with in a separate case a week ago in ruling that the section remained valid despite having been inadvertently omitted from the compilation of Federal laws more than 45 years ago.
Section 92 permits banks in cities with fewer than 5,000 people to sell insurance. The case before the Court today began as a challenge by the title insurance industry to a 1989 decision by the Comptroller of the Currency permitting the Chase Manhattan Bank to sell title insurance.
Chase Manhattan is obviously in a city of more than 5,000 people; the Comptroller relied for his regulatory decision on another section of the banking law permitting national banks to exercise "all such incidental powers" as are necessary to carry on the business of banking.
Rejecting the Comptroller's regulation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, had ruled that Section 92 had an implicit bar against broader activities by banks situated in large cities. The Federal Government, as well as Chase, appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court. The Second Circuit's decision "calls into question a variety of activities performed by national banks," the Government's brief said.
The appeals the Justices turned down today were Chase Manhattan Bank v. American Land Title, No. 92-482, and Ludwig v. American Land Title, No. 92-645.

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether abortion clinics can invoke a Federal racketeering law to sue anti-abortion groups that organize demonstrations and blockades intended to shut down the clinics.
The Justices accepted an appeal filed by the National Organization for Women, which tried to use the law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, to sue several anti-abortion groups on behalf of abortion clinics in Delaware and Wisconsin. The organization sought to prove that the groups had formed a nationwide conspiracy to eliminate access to abortion by using extortion and intimidation to drive the clinics out of business. 
 Two lower Federal courts dismissed the lawsuit on the ground that the racketeering law, usually known as RICO, does not apply in the absence of "economic motivation." The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, called the demonstrators' actions "reprehensible" but said that "noneconomic crimes committed in furtherance of noneconomic motives" were not covered by the racketeering law.
The Clinton Administration, asked by the Justices for its views on the case, told the Court that the lower courts had interpreted the law in too "narrow and grudging" a way. In a brief filed last month, the Administration urged the Supreme Court to grant the appeal and to rule that the racketeering law should apply in the abortion clinic context. The case will be argued next fall.
 
Second Case on Clinics
 The case brings the issue of protests at abortion clinics back to the Court only months after the Justices rejected the use of another law, a Reconstruction-era civil rights law known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which some lower courts had invoked to protect clinics against violent protests. A bill to overturn that ruling has been introduced in Congress.
The Bush Administration had entered the earlier case on behalf of Operation Rescue, one of the main clinic protest groups and a defendant in the new case, along with the Pro-Life Action League, the Pro-Life Direct Action League and leaders of the groups.
Because the racketeering law is such a powerful legal weapon, providing for triple damages and other heavy penalties for running an "enterprise" through a "pattern of racketeering activity," abortion clinics across the country have tried to use it. The lower Federal courts have been split over whether the law is limited to economically motivated conspiracies, like the infiltration of a legitimate business by organized crime.
 
Little Prior Action
 In answering that question, the Supreme Court's decision in this case, NOW v. Scheidler, No. 92-780, could provide an important interpretation of the racketeering law beyond the abortion clinic context. In past decisions interpreting the law, the Court has expressed unease over the expansive use of the law, which has been widely used in ordinary business disputes far removed from its origin as a weapon against organized crime. But the Court has generally taken the position that any limitations should come from Congress and not the courts.
In its brief, the Clinton Administration said that the economic motive requirement adopted by the Court of Appeals posed "serious definitional problems," because the analysis left it "entirely unclear" how to draw the line between an economically motivated conspiracy that would be covered by the law and a politically motivated one that would not be. Political protests can serve incidentally to attract members and contributions, the brief said.
There were also these developments at the Court today:
 
Set-Aside Programs
 The Court ruled that white contractors could sue to challenge Federal programs that set aside a portion of public works contracts for minority-owned businesses.
The decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, reinstated a constitutional challenge brought by a group of white contractors to a minority set-aside ordinance in Jacksonville, Fla. The 7-to-2 decision overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, which had held that the white contractors lacked legal standing to sue because they could not demonstrate that they would have been able to bid successfully for the contracts from which the program excluded them.
In their underlying lawsuit, the contractors, members of the Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America, argued that by reserving a portion of public works contracts for minorities, the city was violating the equal protection principle announced by the Supreme Court in a similar case from Richmond. The Court today did not deal with that question, which will be addressed by the lower courts now that the lawsuit has been reinstated.
In his opinion, Northeastern Florida Contractors v. Jacksonville, No. 91-1721, Justice Thomas said the appeals court had misconceived the question of standing by requiring the contractors to show that they would actually have been awarded a contract if permitted to compete. The contractors' injury, he said, "is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract."
Justice Thomas noted that in the case of Alan Bakke 15 years ago, the Court permitted a lawsuit by Mr. Bakke, a white applicant to a California state medical school, without requiring him to show that he would been admitted had 16 of the 100 places not been reserved for minorities. Mr. Bakke's injury was being denied the chance to compete for all the places, the Justice said.
The two dissenting Justices, Sandra Day O'Connor and Harry A. Blackmun, did not address the merits of the question over standing. Rather, they said the Court should have dismissed the case as moot because Jacksonville modified its ordinance last fall, shortly after the Court agreed to hear the contractors' appeal.
The ruling today is likely to be important beyond the context of challenges to set-aside programs. At issue more generally is an individual's right to sue the government over the administration of a benefit program without being able to show that he or she would have actually obtained the benefit. Several liberal groups including Public Citizen, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed briefs in this case, warning that the lower court's limited view of standing would close the courthouse doors to many lawsuits of this type.
 
Double Jeopardy
 The Court agreed to decide whether the constitutional protection against double jeopardy applies to a proceeding to determine whether a someone convicted of a crime should receive a longer sentence as a persistent offender.
The case, Caspari v. Bohlen, No. 92-1500, is an appeal by the State of Missouri of a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The appeals court ruled that a man convicted of robbery, and sentenced as a repeat offender in a faulty sentencing hearing, could not be subjected to a new sentencing hearing without violating his right against double jeopardy.
The appeals court based its ruling on an earlier Supreme Court decision that invoked the double jeopardy clause to bar a second death sentence proceeding in a case in which a death sentence has once been set aside. One question in the new case is whether the Court will limit that principle to death penalty cases.
