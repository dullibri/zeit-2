I.R.S. Questions Gifts of Insurance

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Financial advisers fear that a recent ruling by the Internal Revenue Service may place in jeopardy thousands of gifts of life insurance intended to benefit churches, synagogues, educational institutions, hospitals and other charities.
Technically, because it is a private-letter ruling (No. 9110016), it sets no legal precedent for other cases. Still, lawyers and accountants study the I.R.S.'s private-letter rulings to see what positions the service is likely to take, and now they are advising charitably inclined clients in many states to consider other ways of giving. 
 "They've knocked the guts out of one of the most popular techniques for middle-class donors," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, certified public accountants, and an adjunct professor at Fordham University. "This was something people took advantage of, and it was great. My clients are very concerned."
The insurance industry has promoted the idea. The current issue of Assets, a newsletter that many insurance agents send to their clients, says: "One excellent way to provide a very substantial benefit at a fraction of the cost is to give cash to a charity, which, in turn, uses the cash to pay life insurance premiums on the donor's life. For a fraction of the total benefit, you can provide a lasting, substantial gift to the charity. In addition, you will receive an income tax benefit along the way." But the I.R.S. ruling makes the strategy problematic.
Neil P. Myerberg, chief executive of planned giving and endowments for the UJA Federation in New York, said, "We haven't had anyone cancel" who gives the charity money to pay premiums on a policy, "but I'm not recommending this to anybody" at present. He is, however, working to persuade legislators to amend New York law to state explicitly that charities have "an insurable interest" in the donor, which would eliminate the I.R.S.'s problem. Many of his counterparts at other charities and in other states and making similar efforts.
Sam Radin, a lawyer who heads the National Madison Group in New York and is a member of the State Bar Association Committees on Charitable Organizations and Gift and Estate Taxes, has also appealed to Albany, arguing that charities, their middle- and upper-class supporters and the poor who are helped are all hurt by the ruling, which will bring in little additional tax revenue.
In the ruling, the I.R.S. said that because New York State law, like that of 35 other states, does not specifically say charities have an insurable interest, a donor who buys a policy and transfers it to a charity would be circumventing New York law. Therefore, the insurer could refuse to pay the proceeds to the charity, or, if it did, the executor of the estate could sue to recover them, the I.R.S. said. Therefore, it concluded, no income-tax or gift-tax charitable deduction may be allowed. The notion of insurable interest came into law in the 19th century, Mr. Radin noted, to prevent policy buyers from "wagering on the life of a stranger." No reputable charity does that, but the law is nevertheless being used against them.
The simplest solution for a New Yorker who wants to donate to a charity, Mr. Radin said, is to buy a policy issued in Connecticut, where the statute recognizes charities' insurable interest. Many New York brokers also hold Connecticut licenses, he noted, so the donor need not travel there. Other states that recognize charities' interest are Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Wyoming.
People who find they no longer need policies for their original purpose and give them to charity need not worry, Mr. Radin noted, because "insurable interest is measured at the time of issue."
But people who have given a policy directly to charity should "try some damage control," Mr. Radin said. "One remedy is to put a provision in the will that directs the executor not to seek recovery of money paid to charity, and if monies are paid to him to give them to charity," he said. Or, it may be possible to rewrite the policy in one of the 14 states specifically recognizing charities' insurable interests.
Mr. Neumark, who serves as New York region president for the Orthodox Union, the umbrella organization for Orthodox synagogues throughout the country, said, "I advise my clients not to shy away from giving to charities, especially in these hard economic times when charities are most in need," but he is looking into other means of making significant, long-term gifts.
Charitable trusts are one avenue. Another possibility is regular gifts of zero-coupon bonds, he said. A current income-tax deduction can be taken, and if the charity has agreed to hold the bonds to maturity, a university chair, for example, or a special project with the donor's name on it could eventually be financed.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Steadies Credit Markets

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late rally stabilized the Treasury securities market yesterday after prices were slashed earlier by a flow of Government reports indicating that the economy was rebounding or at least bottoming out.
Before the market opened, for example, the Government reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose in April for the third consecutive month, while factory orders rose for the first time since October. 
 "The data showed an economy that was much stronger than the Street had expected and this triggered the selling from the opening," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president and credit market specialist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Bond investors in particular were concerned that the signs of a reviving economy would lessen chances for further easing by the Federal Reserve and it also reawakened the always-latent inflation fears."
What helped end the decline, Mr. Sullivan continued, was a strong demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market late in the day. Although the dollar had been volatile all week, the demand tended to enhance the value of Treasury securities. When the decline ended, some short covering as well as buying by bargain hunters also materalized, he added.
 
 Bellwether Bonds' Range

During the session, the price of the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in May 2021, ranged between an intraday high of 98 27/32 and a low of 98 5/32. Late in the day, the long bonds were being offered at 98 16/32, down 17/32, to yield 8.26 percent, compared with 8.21 percent the day before and 8.29 percent a week ago.
Among other closely watched Treasury debt issues traded in the secondary market, the 8 percent notes of May 2001 fell 9/32, to 99 21/32, for a yield of 8.05 percent. The new 7 5/8 percent notes of 1996 declined 8/ 32, to 99 23/32, for a yield of 7.69 percent; the new 6 3/4 percent notes of 1993 lost 5/32, at 100 4/32, for a yield of 6.68 percent.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on 90-day bills jumped eight basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.53 percent; six-month bills rose four basis points, to 5.67 percent, and the one-year bills gained six basis points, to 5.81 percent.
The Federal Reserve added $1.5 billion of reserves to the banking system for the weekend. The addition was expected and had little if any effect on the key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. The funds traded most of the day at 5 3/4 percent, the Fed's perceived target level for this pivotal interest rate, but closed at 6 1/8 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Up, Palladium Off; Moves Seen as Corrections

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices rose modestly yesterday in a move widely viewed as correcting an overreaction to news that a Japanese car company had developed a platinum-free catalytic converter.
The futures price of palladium, the alternative metal for the converter, drifted lower after having soared on the same news. 
 Platinum futures settled $1.10 to $1.60 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in June up $1.60 at $376.80 an ounce; palladium was $1.50 to $1.70 lower, with June at $96.35 an ounce.
Both moves were reversals from the previous session, in which platinum plunged and palladium soared on news that the Nissan Motor Company had developed a catalytic converter that substituted palladium and other elements for higher-priced platinum.
 
 40% of Platinum Use at Stake

Catalytic converters, which cleanse automobile exhaust of some harmful gases, account for about 40 percent of platinum consumption.
Analysts said Thursday's drop of more than $20 in platinum and gain of about $6 in palladium were overreactions to the Nissan news.
"Nissan still has a lot of testing to do," said Fred Demler, metals economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New York.
He said it was not clear whether the new converter could be used on all cars, whether it would work with United States gasolines or whether it would meet United States pollution-control requirements.
"Technological change tends to be evolutionary, not revolutionary," Mr. Demler said. "The market reacted Thursday on a revolutionary bias."
Platinum is unlikely to recover all of Thursday's losses in the near term, said Anne Orton, president of Barclays Metals Inc. in New York.
"This announcement has really knocked it down quite a bit," she said, "and I think it's going to have some trouble to get back up in the $390's again."
In precious-metal trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold futures settled $1.70 lower across the board, with June at $361.40 an ounce. Silver was 4.7 to 4.8 cents lower, with July at $4.117 an ounce.
Energy futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pulled lower by a plunging gasoline market as traders sold the expiring June gasoline and heating oil contracts to escape delivery obligations.
Crude oil settled 19 to 20 cents lower, with July at $21.13 a barrel; heating oil was 0.22 to 0.89 cent lower, with June at 56.48 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.07 cent to 1.4 cents lower, with June at 66.91 cents a gallon; natural gas was 1.5 cents lower to 0.7 cent higher, with July at $1.333 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade amid worries about Midwestern crop weather and ideas that the Bush Administration might announce a Soviet food aid package over the weekend.
Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher, with July at $2.87 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents higher, with July at $2.45 3/4 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 3/4 cent higher, with July at $1.23 3/4 a bushel; soybeans were 1/2 cent lower to 6 3/4 cents higher, with July at $5.81 3/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges on Optimism At Signs of U.S. Recovery

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged against foreign currencies yesterday as investors rode a wave of optimism over prospects for a rebound in the United States economy.
The dollar ended at 1.7425 German marks, up from 1.7190 at Thursday's close, and it rose to 138.35 Japanese yen from 137.80. 
 Traders were encouraged by Government data that suggested the economy would soon shake free from the grip of the 11-month recession.
Factory orders rose in April for the first time in six months, the Government said, and the index of leading indicators rose for the third month in a row.
"Those were the factors that convincingly changed the market," said Chuck Spence, manager of corporate foreign exchange trading for First Interstate Bank.
"It's too soon to say the U.S. economy has bottomed, but the evidence is beginning to tilt the scales in that direction," said Anne Parker Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Persistent speculation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union may not be able to hold onto power also supported the dollar, dealers said.
"The market sentiment has changed," Mr. Spence said. "Earlier in the week, the market was bearish on the dollar and the United States economy, and civil unrest in the Soviet Union appeared to be calming."
He said the market was turned around by a string of positive economic indicators ending with the two reports yesterday; comments on Mr. Gorbachev from the departing Director of Central Intelligence, William Webster, and a stock market rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 113.59 points this week, or 3.9 percent, to close at a record 3,027.50 yesterday.
"We're now expecting a stronger economy than originally thought, with a turnaround by midyear," said John Krey, international economist at MCM Currency Watch. "The U.S. economy has already bottomed."
But other analysts were less confident about the dollar's direction.
"People should be nervous at these levels," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange in North America for Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
Much of the dollar's gain stems from the mark's weakness, Mr. Martin said.
The British pound fell to $1.6975 from $1.7135. The dollar rose to 1.4855 Swiss francs, from 1.4640 on Thursday, and to 5.9075 French francs from 5.8305.

HEADLINE: Tighter U.S. Mortgage Rules Set

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The Government said today that it was putting tighter lending standards into place for mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration. One lending group charged that the move would reduce home sales by as much as 200,000 annually.
The new rules will require people financing their purchases with F.H.A.-backed mortgages to pay higher closing costs and for the first time they will have to make annual payments for mortgage insurance. 
 "These new regulations could not have come at a worse time," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. "These changes will lock out thousands of families who will no longer be able to afford a home."
 
 'Hits Right at Middle America'
 He added that his group, which represents 2,300 mortgage lenders, would lobby Congress to overturn the new regulations. "This requirement hits right at middle America -- young, moderate-income families trying to insure some measure of economic stability for themselves by buying a home," he said.
The F.H.A. said the requirements, which take effect July 1, were required to shore up a mortgage program that is losing $200 million a year. It estimated that the more stringent requirements would prevent 20,000 potential buyers from purchasing homes.
However, housing groups contended that the new rules, which come as the housing industry is struggling to emerge from a two-year slump, go much further than intended by Congress. Mortgage bankers estimated that the new rules could reduce annual home sales by 100,000 to 200,000 annually, enough to abort a housing recovery and to make it more difficult for the overall economy to emerge from the recession.
Jack Kemp, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said when the Administration first proposed the requirements last year that they were necessary to "protect the taxpayer from bearing the costs of poor management" of the program.
A recent audit by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated that the F.H.A.'s cumulative losses were approaching $7 billion, partly because the agency did not require sufficiently large down payments. With less of their own cash at risk, homeowners were more likely to default on their mortgages.
One of the new requirements taking effect July 1 will limit closing costs that can be financed in the mortgage to 57 percent. At present up to 100 percent of closing costs can be financed.
That would mean a home buyer taking out a $100,000 F.H.A. loan and facing closing costs of $2,500 would have to pay $1,000 of the closing costs out of pocket, rather than financing the full amount as part of the mortgage.
 
New Insurance Premium
 In addition, F.H.A. home buyers now will have to pay a new annual mortgage insurance premium of five-tenths of 1 percent. Previously, they had been required to pay only an up-front premium of 3.8 percent. On a $100,000 loan, the new premium would add $80 to the monthly payment.
The new rules also require that homeowners refinancing existing F.H.A. loans pay the new insurance premiums.
The mortgage program was set up by Congress in 1934 and provides for 800,000 new loans each year.

HEADLINE: Economic Index Posts 3d Advance In a Sign Recession May End Soon

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Posting a third straight advance, the Government's main economic forecasting gauge signaled today that the 10-month-old recession would soon be over.
"The end is imminent," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc. "We're going to have a summer recovery." 
 Although practically no analysts expect a vigorous recovery, those who say the recession will end by midyear have formed a steadily larger consensus in recent weeks. Few now say the recession will extend into the autumn and, in fact, historians may eventually determine that recovery is already under way.
 
Three Consecutive Increases
 The composite index of leading indicators climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department reported today, following increases of seven-tenths of 1 percent in March and 1.2 percent in February.
In another positive economic report today, the Commerce Department said orders received by American factories rose in April for the first time in six months. The two reports helped propel the stock market to a record close, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 27.05, to 3,027.50. [Page 35.]
Three straight advances in the leading indicators have almost invariably signaled imminent recovery during the postwar period, the only exceptions being in 1954 and 1961, when the advances were not as strong and the expansion was delayed for one or two quarters.
The leading index has a far less reliable record in forecasting recessions, having predicted many that have failed to occur and giving little or no notice on others. Four straight declines surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash were not followed by recession, and last year the leading index had gains for both May and June, just before the recession began.
Further buoying hopes today, in addition to the figures on factory orders, was a report of a substantial jump in the industrial index compiled by Chicago purchasing managers. The factory orders were foreshadowed by last week's positive statistics on durable goods, a subgroup of that index.
In all, today's figures, "clearly fit with the impression of the recession coming to its end," asserted Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Currency traders were also caught up in the wave of optimism and pushed the dollar higher against foreign currencies.
The data today followed reports on Thursday that showed sales of new homes and personal incomes both rose for the third month in a row, even though consumer spending dipped.
 The rise in the leading index was broad-based and, unlike preceding months when the gains were concentrated in financial and psychological components, "you've got the real stuff this time," Mr. Harris said.
 Of the six advancing components, by far the biggest factor was an increase in new factory orders for consumer goods. The others, ranked by their contribution, were a decline in average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance, a rise in the proportion of companies getting slower deliveries from suppliers, higher stock prices, a longer average workweek and an increase in building permits.
 
 Some Negative Forces
 By far the most important of the negative forces was a decline in the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations. The others were lower contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a decline in unfilled factory orders for durable goods and the tiniest of declines in the M-2 money supply -- less than one-hundredth of a percent. One or two of these, in fact, would probably have risen had it not been for a drop-off of aircraft orders, already heavily backlogged.
The 11th indicator, materials prices especially sensitive to shifts in the business cycle, was unchanged, the department reported.
Today's report also showed that factories' new orders for consumer goods did not decline as much as initially estimated in March and this was the main reason that the overall index for the month was revised to post a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent instead of five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
 Other Indexes Agree
 Meanwhile, the department's index of coincident indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April, the 10th straight monthly decline but the smallest since August. The index of lagging indicators dropped 1.6 percent, the biggest since November and December 1982, the final months of the 1981-82 recession.
The ratio of the coincident index to the lagging one -- regarded, like the leading index, as a predictor -- rose in April following seven straight declines.
A private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research in White Plains rose six-tenths of a point in April, with 12 of its components up, 9 down and 2 unchanged. More importantly, Kenneth Safian declared, the components assessing the "real" economy posted their first monthly gain since May 1990 and the biggest since March 1987.
"This signals that the recession is over," Mr. Safian said.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private group that dates expansions and contractions, said today that its experimental recession index showed that there was only a 2 percent chance the economy would still be in recession in October. A month ago, it put the odds at 3 percent for September.

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Up First Time in 6 Months

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Orders received by American factories rose in April for the first time in six months, the Commerce Department said today.
The 1.8 percent gain in April orders, following a revised 2.9 percent drop in March orders, was slightly above the 1.5 percent gain forecast by Wall Street economists. The report provided a new piece of evidence that an economic recovery might be near. 
 The department said earlier today that its key forecasting gauge, the index of leading indicators, rose for a third straight month in April.
Both reports were in line with other economic reports released Thursday that showed personal incomes and new-home sales strengthened in April for a third consecutive month, although another report on Thursday showed consumer spending had fallen slightly in April.
The last time factory orders had risen was in October, when they were up 2.4 percent. Orders fell in each month from November through March as the recession sapped demand and cost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the nation's weakened industrial sector.
A key component of factory orders, durable goods, rose 3.0 percent in April after declining 4.6 percent in March. Durables include items like refrigerators and automobiles that are meant to last at least three years.
Military orders, a volatile category subject to wide monthly swings, rose 12.4 percent in April after declining 15.5 percent in March.
Excluding military orders, the "core rate" of factory orders rose 1.5 percent in April after declining 2.4 percent in March.
Manufacturers' inventories of all types of goods fell two-tenths of 1 percent in April after dropping six-tenths of 1 percent in March. The department noted that inventories have fallen in four of the last five months since hitting a peak last November.
Producers have been holding down stocks of unsold goods, which economists say will speed recovery when consumer spending eventually picks up enough to encourage companies to hire more workers and increase output.
The Bush Administration is forecasting a resumption of growth in the second half of the year.
The Commerce Department reported a week ago that durable goods orders rose 2.9 percent in April, with every major industry except transportation sharing in the increase. But that figure was revised upward to a 3.0 percent gain in today's report.
Transportation equipment orders fell 3.8 percent in April after falling by 4.8 percent in March. Within that category, orders for aircraft and missiles dropped by 29.3 percent, after declining by 6.1 percent in March, and more than offset a gain in motor vehicle orders.
Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 2.6 percent in April after a 2.6 percent fall in March.
Originally, overall factory orders were reported declining 2.8 percent in March but that was revised to a 2.9 percent fall.

HEADLINE: Goldome Closed and Split Between Rivals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Goldome, New York State's largest savings institution, will be closed and divided between local competitors -- the First Empire Corporation of Buffalo and Keycorp of Albany, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced yesterday. The troubled Buffalo-based savings bank failed to attract the new investors it needed.
Branches of Goldome will open under their new names either Saturday or Monday with no interruption in service or change in deposit insurance coverage. 
 The F.D.I.C., which insures many savings banks as well as commercial banks, expects to lose about $930 million from closing Goldome, making it the sixth-most-costly failure in the agency's history. With $9.9 billion of assets, Goldome was the 13th-largest savings institution in the country. Ten commercial banks in New York are larger than Goldome.
Keycorp's subsidiary banks in Buffalo and Syracuse will acquire 31 branches with about $3.3 billion of deposits, while the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a unit of First Empire, will acquire 11 branches in Buffalo with $1.9 billion of deposits.
A Goldome savings and loan association in St. Petersburg, Fla., was seized by Federal regulators yesterday and will be operated by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency handling failed savings and loans.
Customers of the Goldome Realty Corporation, which handles monthly payments for about $14 billion of mortgages around the country, will be shifted to a subsidiary of Keycorp, making it one of the nation's 10 largest mortgage servicing concerns.
"Keycorp and First Empire have been the most logical candidates to acquire Goldome because they are already so large in the western New York market," said Donald J. Kauth, a banking analyst at the First Albany Corporation. Earlier this year both Keycorp and First Empire raised additional capital, which allows them to make acquisitions without any signficant sacrifice of financial strength.
The sale ends a three-year struggle by Goldome's management to save a bank that started the 1980's as a financially sound and profitable Buffalo bank with about $3 billion of assets. Its strength was dissipated during the decade as it acquired weaker New York savings banks with regulators' approval and assistance, and expanded into new markets and new businesses.
Expenses rose more rapidly than profits during the phase of rapid expansion, and some acquisitions -- particularly the Florida savings and loan association -- produced unexpected losses. In addition to losses on some loans for multifamily housing developments, Goldome was hurt in 1989 by changes in accounting rules, which meant it could no longer count good will as part of its capital. The good will, which amounted to $532 million, represented the amount by which payments for acquisitions exceeded the worth of those companies.
The change in accounting rules, plus losses totaling $372 million in 1988 and 1989, left Goldome at the end of 1990 with a negative capital position of $452.4 million. Although the company was insolvent under accounting rules, banking regulators allowed it to stay in business while new management returned it to profitability and searched for fresh capital.
 
 Changing Approach

After Thomas A. Cooper, a former president of the BankAmerica Corporation, became chairman two years ago, Goldome cut non-interest expenses to $255 million in 1990 from $438 million in 1989, and began to concentrate on collecting deposits and making loans to middle-income consumers in the Buffalo area, where 35 percent of the households have an account with the bank.
As part of its effort to make a turnaround, Goldome sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufactures Hanover Trust Company during late 1989 and earlier this year.
Because of the strong position of Goldome in the Buffalo area, and its return to profitability -- the company earned $37.5 million in 1990 -- Mr. Cooper said earlier this year that the company was "worth much more than is shown on its balance sheet."
 
 Search for Investors
 But Mr. Cooper's efforts to assemble a group of investors were unsuccessful, and other potential buyers, including GE Capital, decided against investing in the company. Investment bankers said many other banks were interested in Goldome, but none could compete with Keycorp and First Empire, which had the advantage of local branch networks that could be economically merged with Goldome's system.
Keycorp and First Empire, which agreed to add $195 million and $40 million of capital, respectively, to their banking units, face limited risk of loss because the F.D.I.C. agreed to take about $1.8 billion of loans and other assets from Goldome subsidiaries, as well as $400 million of weak loans from Goldome's Buffalo savings bank.
In addition, the two companies may return for three years any Goldome loans that turn bad. To attract the two buyers, the F.D.I.C. agreed to pay $163 million to Keycorp and $40 million to First Empire, a Keycorp official said.
Keycorp and First Empire previously collaborated in 1989 in the purchase of branches and deposits of the Empire of America Corporation, another Buffalo savings bank that ran into trouble during the 1980's, when it expanded outside its local market.

HEADLINE: S.I. Home Port Fight Shifts to Its Closing

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The long fight over opening the Staten Island Home Port has now turned into a fight over its proposed closing.
Just two years after the naval port began operating, a Federal panel yesterday placed it on the Pentagon's list of military installations that might be shut down to save money.
Thirty-four other additions to the list were also announced in Washington by the panel, the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The panel must still make a final recommendation, which will be subject to Congressional and Presidential approval. 
 The decision to add the Staten Island base to the list was praised by a coalition of dozens of environmental, antinuclear and peace groups and other critics in New York City that had waged a losing campaign to prevent the creation of the home port.
 
Concern Over Jobs
 But advocates of the home port argued that its elimination would cost thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars, when the recession-battered local economy can ill afford it.
The only warship now based at the port, the Aegis missile cruiser Normandy, was sent to the Persian Gulf and returned earlier this year.
The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, a supporter of the home port, contended that the opposition of Mayor David N. Dinkins was partly to blame for the possibility that the base would be closed. Mr. Dinkins's predecessor, Edward I. Koch, had lobbied in favor of the Navy's decision to build the $200 million port.
Mr. Molinari and the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, said yesterday that they would try to persuade the commission to reconsider, while opponents said they would be working to insure that the base was closed.
Mayor Dinkins said he would regret any loss of jobs, but he suggested that there might be other ways to develop the Staten Island port. Asked about reports of possible cuts at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn and Fort Totten in Queens, the Mayor said he opposed closing those bases.
After failing to stop the opening of the home port with lawsuits, petitions and demonstrations, critics of the base said they felt a special vindication that the Government itself was moving to close it. The opponents had contended that the port was a waste of money. They also said some ships using it would be likely to carry nuclear weapons and warned about a possible nuclear accident. The Navy never confirms whether a ship is armed with nuclear weapons.
 
Critics Hail 'Wonderful News'
 "It's wonderful news," said Lynda Rodolitz, a representative of the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor. "We've been fighting since 1983. I wouldn't say we gave up, but it was looking bad for a while."
The home port issue has cut across party lines in the city. Mr. Molinari is a Republican; Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Koch and Mr. Stein are Democrats.
Mr. Molinari expressed dismay that some local officials had opposed the base. "Nowhere else does that happen," he said. "Normally you get governors, mayors and congressmen pleading to keep bases open, but not here."
He argued that Federal officials were more likely to close a base that has substantial opposition than one with strong local support. When fully operational, he said, the home port would generate $400 million a year for the local economy, providing more than 1,000 jobs at the base and many more indirectly.
Construction recently began on 1,100 homes for Navy personnel, a $115 million project that will be canceled if the base is closed, Mr. Molinari said. Also facing cancellation is a $100 million expansion of a second pier. And Bayley Seton Hospital, a Catholic institution that serves the Navy and many local residents, would be jeopardized by losing the Federal subsidies it gets as an adjunct to the home port, he said.
Mr. Molinari also offered another defense of the home port. "New York City is part of the United States of America and wants to be protected the same degree as any other area, and that means sharing the responsibility," he said.
But Representative Ted Weiss, a Democrat from Manhattan and the first local Congressman to come out against the home port, said, "With the cold war in decline, the original strategic justification for building new home ports has disappeared." He said the economic benefits of the port had been exaggerated, and denounced it as "a pork-barrel project."
The home port, located near the Staten Island Ferry terminal at St. George, includes a 1,400-foot pier and a large building for servicing and repairing Navy ships. It was officially dedicated on May 3, 1989.

HEADLINE: Highway Project May Bring Boston to a Standstill

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 31

 BODY:
When Boston's Central Artery and Third Harbor Tunnel project was formally presented to the public eight years ago, the price tag for unsnarling one of the most congested, dangerous and unsightly stretches of interstate highway in the country was put at $2.2 billion.
That figure has since more than doubled, to $4.9 billion. But cost is just one of the concerns, now that the project has won final Federal approval. 
 In the 10 years of construction that lie ahead, dirt, noise and detours threaten to bring downtown Boston to a standstill. And despite an eight-year environmental review, there are protests that the project will violate the nation's Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Act and parkland protection laws.
And then there are rats. A similar project undertaken here in the 1950's forced thousands of them out of their underground tunnels onto city streets. That threat is back again.
Still, construction on the project, one of the largest urban highway projects ever attempted, is set to begin. Known as "The Big Dig," it will mean the elimination of an ugly, two-mile elevated section of Interstate 93, which will be rebuilt underground between the historic Faneuil Hall marketplace and the North End. It will also extend the Massachusetts Turnpike into a new third tunnel to be dug under Boston Harbor. All of this will involve moving 12 million cubic yards of dirt and installing 200,000 tons of steel and 4 million cubic yards of concrete.
 
150 Acres of Open Space
 If all goes according to plan, designers say, the artery-tunnel project should ultimately ease Boston's infamous congestion problems and in the process create 150 acres of open space above the tunnel and along the Charles River.
"The congestion is unbearable and irreversible without this project as proposed," said Richard L. Taylor, the state's Secretary of Transportation. "And the artery is in disrepair. There is no solution that does not involve significant public cost."
Construction on the harbor tunnel, the first phase of the project, is now expected to start this fall. Three buildings have already been torn down and bids are now being accepted for a $250 million contract for the tunnel. Construction for the artery will start next year.
Transportation officials say they are doing all they can to assure that disruption to the city will be minimal and that all environmental and design options are considered. All six lanes of the present highway will remain open throughout construction, as will the two tunnels connecting downtown to East Boston and Logan International Airport.
But public opposition, including five lawsuits, continues to nag at planners and could ultimately stall the already belabored project.
On Wednesday, the Conservation Law Foundation announced plans to sue the Federal Highway Administration, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and top state transportation officials. The foundation contends that unless huge mass transit improvements are required by the plan, the project will violate the nation's Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Act and parkland-protection laws.
Two other lawsuits, including one filed by the Sierra Club, challenge the project's plans to control the exhaust fumes from automobiles in the tunnels.
And the city of Cambridge and the Charles River Watershed Association, a non-profit public interest group, have filed notice of intent to sue over a plan for a 10-story spaghetti-loop interchange known as "Scheme Z." But that interchange design was scrapped today in meetings of planners and is expected to be replaced by a sleeker, more costly alternative.
The current artery, built in the 1950's, was designed to handle 75,000 vehicles a day. Last year, 190,000 vehicles a day spent hours inching past the Boston Garden and Faneuil Hall or trying to get around the city and to Logan Airport.
 
Roadway That Spells Accidents
 That kind of congestion, coupled with bottlenecks and entrance and exit ramps that force drivers to careen across two or more lanes in spaces of less than 300 feet, has spelled disaster. The accident rate on Boston's central artery is two times the national average. On one short stretch on the northern side of the city alone, there are more than 400 accidents a year, according to state officials.
The artery-tunnel planners also say the project is needed to revive the economy in Massachusetts, where recession has pushed the unemployment rate to 9.7 percent. At the height of construction, in 1994, the project is expected to create 15,000 jobs, 5,000 in construction alone. So far, about $165 million worth of design contracts have been awarded to more than 100 businesses, most of them based in Massachusetts, state officials say.
The roadways, which will be expanded from six to eight lanes, are also expected to pull up to 40,000 cars off Boston's congested downtown streets, which wander and twist in a pattern created during Colonial times by cows meandering to graze on the Boston Common.
 
U.S to Pay Most of Cost
 About 85 percent of the $5 billion project is to be paid for reimbursed by Federal coffers under the 1987 Surface Transportation Act, an arrangement secured by former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. as a kind of retirement gift to his home town. To date, $1.4 billion has been allocated, according to state officials. President Bush included an additional $2.1 billion for the project in a proposal sent to Congress earlier this year.
But even with the sweet promises of jobs and clearer roadways, the project's path continues to be strewn with complaints from environmental and neighborhood groups who say the artery-tunnel project will do more harm than good. The rats, they say, are just part of the problem.
In 1959, during the construction of one of the other two tunnels, Callahan Tunnel, thousands of rats were forced out of sewers into city streets, report North End residents who say they witnessed the rampage.
This time around, the state will pay more than $2 million for an extensive rodent control program. A 24-hour rat hotline is also on order for residents who spot even a single rodent.
Many residents of Boston's North End, a strip of land wedged between the expressway and Boston Harbor, also say the construction will ruin their tiny businesses that rely on local patronage and tourism.
 
'Project Is Bad for Everybody'
 "This project is bad for everybody," said Salvatore Tecce, whose family owns an Italian restaurant on North Washington Street in the North End. When the first central artery was built in the 1950's, his father, Joseph Tecce, was forced to close his fruit stand as a result of construction havoc, he said.
"Who will want to come here to the North End?" Mr. Tecce said. "With all the dust and the debris, how are we going to survive?
"See that," he said, nodding to a plate of fettucini carbonara. "You'll be eating sand."
Frederick Langone, a former city councilor and one of the most vocal opponents of the project, said it will not only cost Massachusetts money that it does not have, but will attract additional cars into the already congested roadway.
"I was against the original artery 30 years ago and I am against the new one," Mr. Langone said. "There will always be gridlock on the artery even if you build two more tunnels."

GRAPHIC: Photos: The present unsightly cental artery in downtown Boston is scheduled to be replaced with a new 4.9 billion Central Artery that will be enclosed in a tunnel. Officials hope it will ease what has become one of the most congested stretches of interstate in the country; "This project is bad for everybody. Who will want to come here to the north end? With all the dust and debris, how are we going to suvive?" said Salvatore Tecce, whose family owns a restaurant near the sight of the tunnel and who fear the construction havoc will hurt business.

HEADLINE: City Reviving Plan for Tolls At East River

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City transportation officials are drafting a proposal to collect tolls on the four free East River bridges. The idea has often been rejected, but officials say it is more plausible now because of the budget crisis and the cost of repairing the dilapidated structures.
The officials say new systems to collect the tolls would mean that tolls would cause less congestion and pollution than in the past and point to a new Federal law that would increase the financial benefit. 
 Although concern over the long-neglected bridges has grown, the officials concede that there has been little change in the biggest obstacles to new tolls, opposition from residents of Brooklyn and Queens, who would expect to pay the lion's share.
The officials said they hoped to have a formal proposal for the tolls on the East River bridges -- and possibly for nine bridges across the Harlem River -- ready for consideration by Mayor David N. Dinkins by the end of the summer.
 
'Bill Is Coming Due'
 "We have never been more serious about placing tolls on the East River bridges than we are now," Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio said in an interview. "The bill is coming due for 40 to 50 years of deferring maintenance on our bridges, and given the current budget crisis, tolls are a sensible means of paying that bill."
Preliminary estimates of potential revenue from the East River and Harlem River bridges indicate that a $2.50 toll could generate $700 million a year, according to the city's Transportation Department. Some transportation officials said the tolls would initially be priced much lower, at maybe $1, but would be increased over time.
The department estimates that it needs an additional $600 million, on top of the $3.3 billion already allocated, to rehabilitate poor and fair bridges. Although the city has allocated $29 million a year for the next 10 years to clean and operate the bridges, the officials say an additional $16 million a year is needed to maintain them properly.
Although the toll proposal is extremely tentative and a formal agreement may be years away, some members of the Mayoral Management Advisory Task Force, who insisted on anonymity, said the panel was "extremely optimistic" that the plan would go forward. The Mayor has instructed the panel to formulate a plan for the tolls.
But placing tolls on the East River bridges is likely to face strong opposition from political leaders, who argue that the tolls would create even larger traffic jams around bridges and worsen air pollution. The tolls would also create barriers between the boroughs and end a tradition of cost-free access to Manhattan from Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
A spokeswoman for the City Council, Peg Breen, said Council leaders opposed the tolls because they felt there were alternatives to raising dedicated funds for bridge repair and maintenance. She said analysts were working on the alternatives.
"This was a stupid idea when it was first floated decades ago, and it hasn't improved with age," said Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, Democrat of Brooklyn, whose district includes the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. "When it comes time for people from other boroughs to come into Manhattan, they will have to cross economic drawbridges, and the gates will be up."
If the tolls were imposed, they would most likely be for the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges.
The mayoral panel has not decided about the nine Harlem River bridges or whether the tolls would be one-way into Manhattan or in both directions.
The executive director of the panel, Thomas W. Bergdall, said that although the group was very hopeful that tolls would be approved, major hurdles remained. Instituting the tolls would most likely require state and city legislation, perhaps working through an authority, Mr. Bergdall said. A comprehensive environmental study also has to be undertaken.
 
To Change Federal Subsidy
 The officials cited two developments as favoring tolls. The Bush Administration has proposed a transportation spending bill that would for the first time allow Federal money to pay for roads and bridges with tolls. Without the law, New York would stand to lose hundreds of millions of Federal dollars for bridges if it instituted the tolls.
The second development is the advent of automatic collection systems, which would let three times as many vehicles pass than is the case now. The machines pick up radio signals from electronic cards attached to windshields and deduct the tolls from prepaid accounts.
The officials also cited newspaper and other surveys indicating that most New Yorkers did not oppose placing moderate tolls in the East River bridges or an increase in the gasoline tax, if those revenues were used to maintain roads and bridges.
Mr. Riccio said that although he supported tolls on the East River bridges, he would prefer an increase in the state's gas tax. At 8 cents a gallon, New York has the lowest tax in the nation, Mr. Riccio said, and even a modest increase of 10 cents a gallon would generate $500 million statewide, money that could be spent on roads and bridges.
But such dedicated financing, either from tolls or a gas-tax increase, could take years to start, and many bridge-engineering experts doubt that the city can afford to continue to defer maintenance and repairs on its crumbling bridges. The experts say many bridges will have to be closed.

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
At Wellesley, Advice To Seek Creative Path

 BODY:
Madeleine L'Engle, the author of "A Wrinkle in Time" and other books praised for their unusual blend of fantasy, science and autobiography, advised graduating seniors at Wellesley College's 113th commencement exercises yesterday to be aware of the integration of characteristics necessary to become "great human beings."
Borrowing from Greek mythology she told them to "use fully the Apollo, the intellect, which is a great glory, and rejoice equally in Sophia, the wisdom which makes the intellect creative instead of destructive." Ms. L'Engle also advised the graduates to take charge of their lives through the choices they make. 
 Ms. L'Engle, a 1941 graduate of Smith College who was invited by the senior class to speak at commencement, has written 28 books, including "A Swiftly Tilting Planet," which won the 1978 American Book Award, and "A Wrinkle in Time," winner of the 1963 Newbery Award.
Wellesley's president, Nannerl O. Keohane, presented bachelor's degrees to 543 women, including 27 Davis Scholars, graduates of the Massachusetts college's continuing education program, which marked its 20th anniversary this year.
 
George Washington University
 On the 50th anniversary of his own graduation from medical school, the former United States Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, urged graduates at the George Washington University Medical School to hold themselves to higher moral standards than those required by law.
"Sometimes society will call for death over life," he told the 150 graduates at the school's 170th commencement exercises yesterday. "Choose life."
He criticized Dr. Timothy E. Quill, the Rochester doctor who disclosed that he helped a cancer patient commit suicide by prescribing tranquilizers, for shirking his obligations as a healer. "She was not suffering," Dr. Koop said. "She just didn't want to die from her disease. I say, 'How sad for our profession.' " No charges were brought against Dr. Quill.
Dr. Koop, who was awarded an honorary degree for public service, earned his medical degree from Cornell University.
 
 Queens College
 Queens College awarded 3,200 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at its 67th commencement ceremony held yesterday on the school's campus in Flushing. The college honored the 135 members of the class of 1941, the first class to graduate from the college. Members of the class, wearing gold robes, marched at the head of the academic procession.
Raymond C. Kurzweil, the inventor of the Kurzweil reading computer for the blind, was awarded an honorary doctorate of science degree. Mr. Kurzweil is the founder and chairman of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc. and chairman of the Kurzweil Reading Machine division of Xerox.
 
 Fashion Institute Of Technology
 Mayor David N. Dinkins told 2,445 graduating students at the Fashion Institute of Technology yesterday, "New York remains the greatest city on earth, and you can make this city a more beautiful place."
Speaking at the school's 45th commencement at Radio City Music Hall, the Mayor added, "Your fresh ideas fuel the economy while adding an unmatched luster to this metropolis of steel and concrete." He stressed the diversity of New York City, which he said was reflected in the graduates of the school.
At the ceremony, William F. Passannante, who was the most senior member of the State Assembly until his retirement this year, received an honorary doctorate of humane letters.
George Simonton, the women's wear designer, received the Mortimer C. Ritter alumni award.
 
 Pratt Institute
 State Senator Roy M. Goodman of New York urged the 1,100 graduates of Pratt Institute yesterday to "depart from what is tried and true" at the institute's 102d commencement on the campus in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn.
"The artist's job is to experiment," said Mr. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, "to imagine, to find new ideas and new ways to express those ideas. That means taking chances. It means that some artists will be self-absorbed and self-indulgent. Others will have an unhealthy preoccupation with what is bizarre or forbidden. Still others will create the works of genius. And civilization will advance a little bit more."
Senator Goodman was one of six people awarded honorary degrees.
Dennis Ray Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, who was acquitted of obscenity charges stemming from an exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, received a standing ovation when he was awarded an honorary degree.
Other honorary degrees were given to Iris Cantor, a philanthropist and patron of the arts; the painter Pat Steir; Robert M. Wilson, an artist known for his innovation in theater and design, and Henry Luce 3d, president of the board of the New Museum of Contemporary Art.
 
 John Jay College
 John Jay College of Criminal Justice awarded 595 undergraduate degrees and 130 master's degrees at its 26th commencement exercises yesterday at Carnegie Hall. Dr. James P. Comer, associate dean of the Yale School of Medicine, gave the commencement address and was one of four people awarded honorary degrees. The others were Charlayne Hunter-Gault, national correspondent for "The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour"; Carmen Jovet, a journalist and producer based in Puerto Rico; and Harry T. Edwards, Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, received the college's Presidential Medal for distinguished service to the college and to the people of New York City.

HEADLINE: AIDS-Like Virus Is Found At High Rate in U.S. Cattle

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
After four years of research, scientists from the Department of Agriculture have found that a virus similar in genetic structure to the AIDS virus is more common in cattle in United States than researchers had anticipated. The scientists say there is no evidence that the virus can infect people.
The virus, bovine immunodeficiency-like virus, or BIV, is spread through the blood and is a member of a family of slow-acting viruses that have been shown to reduce the activity of an animal's immune system. Such immune suppression, veterinarians said today, can open the way for other infections. The virus, which was first isolated in 1969, has been shown to cause illness in calves, a top scientist at the Department of Agriculture said today. Scientists say they believe that the virus causes immune suppression in adult cattle, but how powerful it is remains uncertain. 
 Researchers said much more needs to be found out about the virus to understand its importance to the $55 billion cattle and dairy industries.
"We will continue to do research on this virus because it will help create a body of information that may provide a way to reduce the costs of production," said Dr. Harry Mussman, the deputy assistant Secretary of Agriculture for science and education. "It is very important that the public understands that this is not the AIDS virus. We do not have the AIDS virus in cattle."
 
Millions Lost to Disease
 Dairy and cattle producers now lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year because sick animals must be culled from their herds. In addition, cattle and dairy farmers spend $300 million to $500 million for anti-bacterial agents, antibiotics and other drugs to treat sick animals. The Food and Drug Administration has sought in the last two years to crack down on the use of such drugs because some are known carcinogens and residues have been found in meat and milk, posing a threat to public health. It is uncertain what the findings about the bovine virus infections will mean for the agency's effort.
Until now, most agricultural experts have attributed the rise in veterinary drug use to modern husbandry practices in which greater numbers of animals are being confined in pens and dairy barns. Whether the cattle virus is also related to the increasing drug use by causing immune suppression in adult cattle has not yet been studied, scientists said.
"The short-term research conducted so far won't give us an answer," said Dr. Matthew A. Gonda, a molecular virologist and head of the Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Structure at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center in Frederick, Md. "We really have to go back and do more research, take fresh isolates of the virus and put it into more animals and see what happens."
Another important consequence of the research on the cattle virus could be the effect on American exports of semen, embryos, and breeding stock, a $68 million-a-year industry, according to the Department of Agriculture. European countries, the major purchasers of American genetic material, are scrupulous about avoiding the risk of contamination by animal infections.
The bovine immunodeficiency-like virus was first isolated in 1969 by Dr. Martin J. Van Der Maaten, a veterinarian at the Agriculture Department's National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa, who found it in a cow's blood serum collected in Louisiana.
The virus did not receive intense scientific scrutiny until the mid-1980's, when Dr. Gonda began to study the cattle virus and determined that its genetic structure was similar to the human AIDS virus. Both viruses have eight genes, Dr. Gonda said today, and magnified by an electron microscope, they look remarkably alike.
Prompted by a petition from The Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based public interest group concerned about the virus's effects on the farm economy and human health, Dr. Van Der Maaten and his colleagues in Iowa began a new study in 1987. The research had four goals: to determine how prevalent the virus was in cattle, see whether it could produce illness in people, determine if it could cause significant infections in the nation's 99 million dairy and beef cattle and find out how it was spread.
 
No Human Infection Found
 The early research shows that the virus is much more common in cattle than Dr. Van Der Maaten thought. He and his colleagues in Iowa have identified the virus in blood serum collected from cattle in Louisiana, Texas, Kansas and Iowa.
Dr. Cecelia A. Whetstone, a microbiologist at the National Animal Disease Center who was in charge of the studies on human health, said in an interview that the "potential for human infection from BIV is zero." Laboratory workers who handled the virus in concentrated form, animal caretakers exposed to the virus and two workers who accidentally pricked themselves with infected needles are regularly tested for antibodies to the virus. The tests showed none of the workers had been infected.
There is circumstantial evidence that the cattle virus may be causing production problems in some herds. Dr. Van Der Maaten noted that dairy herds he has examined that had more illness from common diseases also had more cows infected with the virus than herds that were performing well. "We need a sound statistical study nationwide to help us understand what this could mean," he said.
Dr. Van Der Maaten and his colleagues also determined that the virus is spread in cattle through blood. Farmers could prevent infections from spreading by taking greater precautions in how they handle their animals. Using the same needle to draw blood or administer veterinary drugs on 60 or 70 animals is one way to spread the virus in a herd, he said.
The Foundation on Economic Trends today filed a formal petition with the Department of Agriculture asking the Government to take immediate steps to quarantine infected cattle, and accelerate the pace of research.
Al Strating, a director in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Agriculture Department division that orders quarantines, said the Government had no plans for a nationwide program to quarantine or cull infected cattle.

HEADLINE: U.N. CHIEF RATES IRAQI REPARATIONS

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 31

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General recommended today that the Baghdad Government pay up to 30 percent of its annual oil revenue as reparations for the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf war.
Iraq agreed to pay reparations out of current oil revenues as part of the terms of the gulf war cease-fire. But in a letter this month to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Baghdad asked for a five-year moratorium on reparations payments to give it time to rebuild its shattered economy. That request is under study by the United Nations Compensation Fund, which received the Secretary General's recommendation and will determine what the actual payment level will be. 
 Iraq has not been permitted to resume oil exports since the end of the war, pending United Nations certification of its compliance with other sections of the cease-fire agreement.
A reparations figure of 20 to 30 percent of oil revenues had been widely expected, even though the United States had called for a ceiling of as much as 50 percent. It was assumed that the American figure was a negotiating stance to offset figures as low as 5 percent proposed by Security Council members sympathetic to Iraq like Cuba.
 
Ceiling Set by OPEC
 With a 30 percent cap and current oil market conditions, including the ceiling of 3.14 million barrels of Iraqi exports per day set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the most Iraq could be asked to pay in any year would be roughly equivalent to the $5 billion or so it spent annually buying foreign weapons before the gulf war.
In the words of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq is liable "for any direct loss or damage, including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources, or injury to foreign government, national and corporations, as a result of unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait."
Iraq expects to reach its 1989 export level of 2.85 million barrels a day in 1993. At an adjusted price of $20.04 a barrel for Iraqi crude, export earnings could be expected to reach $21 billion in 1993, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said.
With imports absorbing about 48 percent of Iraq's oil export earnings and service on its $42 billion foreign debt consuming 22 percent more, reparations should not exceed 30 percent, the Secretary General said.

HEADLINE: 35 More Bases Considered for Closing

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The politically charged effort to select military bases that will be closed or consolidated took a new turn today when a commission reviewing the issue nearly doubled the number of installations under consideration.
Three dozen additional military installations, including Fort Drum army base in Watertown, N.Y., and five new naval home ports championed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, could be affected under the plan released today by the base closing commission. 
 The commission plan expands the list of 43 potential base closings that Mr. Cheney released in April, adding Wisconsin and Alaska, plus Guam and Puerto Rico to the 34 states that had been affected. New York, which was to have gained jobs through the expansion of the Staten Island Naval Home Port, and California would be the hardest hit under the new proposals, with six bases added each. Florida and Virginia are home to four of the affected bases each.
The commission's action caught some members of Congress by surprise and provoked fresh outcry from elected officials who represent the affected areas.
 
'Won't Rubber-Stamp'
 "I have said all along that we won't rubber-stamp the Defense Secretary's proposals," the commission chairman, James A. Courter, said in a statement today. "And I have cautioned everyone not to assume that their installation is safe just because it is not included in the Pentagon's report."
A spokesman for the commission cautioned against overreacting to the inclusions on the new list and said it should be treated as a "menu of options" designed only to give commissioners greater latitude in making the final decisions on which installations should be closed or consolidated.
The spokesman, Cary Walker, said the commission has not yet made a full evaluation of the military or economic merits of closing any of the additional bases.
Many of the new installations included on the list appeared to have been added at the insistence of local communities who pleaded their own cases by suggesting that bases in other states be closed instead.
 
Pointing at Others' Bases
 For example, Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, told the commission at a recent hearing that Lowry Air Force Base in her district was being recommended for closing on Mr. Cheney's list as a way of saving Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Tex.
"Many of the facilities listed by the commission today were recommended for study by individuals seeking to void their own base closure or realignment," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York. "This kind of finger pointing is to be expected and is nothing new."
The commission, which was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, plays a central role in the base-closing process. Established by Congress to review and modify recommendations made by the Pentagon, the panel was also designed to absorb some of the political heat generated by the potential economic impact of base closings. Congress has often found it difficult to close bases without some outside impetus.
The commission has until July 1 to review the Pentagon proposal and send it to President Bush. The President must approve the commission report without changes by July 15 or return it to the panel with recommended alterations. Congress also cannot modify the report but can accept or reject it within 45 days. If either the President or Congress disapprove of the final report, there will be no base closings this year.
The seven-member Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission commission, led by Mr. Courter, a former Republican Representative for New Jersey, is made up of business executives and former secretaries of the Army and Navy. Since the Pentagon list was released, the commission has conducted several hearings in Washington and around the country, soliciting advice on Mr. Cheney's suggestions. The panel is scheduled to meet again Thursday to further whittle down the list of proposed closings.
 
Importance of Home Ports
 At an April news conference in which he released his recommendations, Mr. Cheney strongly defended the strategic home ports in Washington, New York, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi, four of which are still under construction.
The new naval home ports are considered to be state-of-the-art facilities that make more efficient use of Navy personnel and equipment because of the proximity of deep water harbors and of nearby naval air stations.
But the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, criticized the Navy's evaluation process and suggested that those ports might be candidates for reductions.
"We continue to believe that list is a good one, and we hope that the commission will agree," the Pentagon said in a written statement today.
Some members of Congress briefed on the new list today offered muted responses to the commission's action, pointing out that no final decisions have yet been made.
 
Anger About New Candidates
 "The fact that they put the shipyard back on the list for consideration is not really all that distressing," said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, the Republican from California who represents the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. "It's basically being done to lower the octave levels coming from Philadelphia."
But other members who were convinced they had dodged a bullet when Mr. Cheney's list was released were angrier today.
"The commission's options constitute a clear and present danger to our national security and to New York's economy," said Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, who questioned whether "political considerations and parochial interests are really at the heart of these ill-conceived proposals."
Mr. Courter said in his statement: "I want to emphasize that this is not a list of closures. Nor is it a list of recommended realignments. It sets forth a wide array of options."
Besides the 35 military installations, the Army Corps of Engineers was added as a candidate for reduction. Mr. Cheney said in April that the Department of the Army had recommended reduction of the corps, which has projects around the nation, but that the commission process was not the correct way to accomplish it.
The members of the base closing commission are Mr. Courter, William L. Ball 3d, former secretary of the Navy and president of the National Soft Drink Association, Retired Air Force Gen. Duane Cassidy, Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the American Stock Exchange Inc., James Smith 2, vice president of the Houston engineering firm Brown & Root and Robert D. Stuart Jr., a former ambassador to Norway who is chairman of the Quaker Oats Company.

HEADLINE: Peace, but Little Else, Crystallizes for Angola

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

 BODY:
A quarter-century of bloodshed financed in large part by the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba and South Africa preceded the handshake yesterday between Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, and Jonas Savimbi, the longtime leader of the Angolan rebels.
And with memories of a generation of violence still vivid in the minds of Angolans, the peace accord has laid to rest none of the questions about the country's future. 
 "It is not at all clear from this what government will emerge," said Michael Clough, senior fellow for African studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "If the people of Angola had their way, they would probably vote out Savimbi and dos Santos both."
Angola is one of Africa's richest countries in natural resources, including huge reserves of oil and diamonds. But that untapped wealth did little to ease the welter of ethnic, personal and ideological conflicts that fragmented both the struggle for independence -- which began in the 1960's and was won from Portugal in November 1975 -- and the nation after independence.
 
Independence as Byproduct
 Even independence was won not so much as a product of successful rebellion but as the fallout of a coup d'etat in Lisbon, which set Portugal on a course toward democratic government and led to its hasty pullout from Angola in 1975.
In the months after independence, Mr. dos Santos's party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or M.P.L.A., which had received most of its arms and money from the Soviet Union and its allies, moved swiftly against its two principal rebel rivals.
One guerrilla organization was destroyed. The other, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, which was led by Mr. Savimbi, retreated in disarray into the desolate southeast, despite the covert backing of South Africa and the United States.
In 1976, after the extent of American clandestine support for Mr. Savimbi was exposed in press reports and Congressional hearings, Congress enacted the Clark Amendment, barring further assistance to Unita. Only South Africa, on the pretext of insuring security in neighboring Namibia, which it controlled at the time, continued military actions against the Angolan Government. Soviet and Cuban aid to the dos Santos Government remained at a high level.
 
American Involvement Deepens
 American involvement in Angola deepened under President Ronald Reagan, who condoned cooperation with South African forces. In 1985, the Clark Amendment was repealed and the United States began supplying military aid to Mr. Savimbi.
In the 1980's, Unita and the South Africans made gains on the ground, only to lose them to counterattacking Cuban troops, who had been invited into Angola as a bulwark against South African forces stationed in Namibia.
The war dragged on, although Washington's appetite for underwriting Unita weakened after several independent authorities, including Human Rights Watch, a New York-Based agency, documented ritualistic killings and policies of forced labor and conscription under Mr. Savimbi.
Ultimately, the inability of either side to win a decisive victory had as much to do with yesterday's cease-fire agreement as did Namibia's independence from South Africa.
 
'Settlement From Exhaustion'
 "What finally happened is that the M.P.L.A. and Unita just basically ran out of options," said Mr. Clough. "It's a settlement from exhaustion. The Soviets were tired. The U.S. was tired. The South Africans are basically out. The analysis is, 'Nobody is going to pay us to keep fighting, so let's settle.' "
Last week, the final contingent of Cuban troops left Angola as part of the 1988 accord that assured independence for Namibia.
Despite Washington's support for Unita and its refusal to establish diplomatic relations with the Government in Luanda, the capital, Angola remained Washington's third-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa.
Almost all of Angola's crude oil is exported to the United States, making up about 90 percent of the country's revenues. Other untapped and potentially vast mineral reserves offer still greater potential for exploitation, including uranium and copper.
Years of war have left Angola's roads, railways and rural electrical sytem in shambles. And while the country's economic potential remains considerable, its political future is still largely uncertain.
Some analysts, however, are optimistic about the country's future, while at the same time hinting that yesterday's handshake in Lisbon will not necessarily define Angola's political shape. In an article to be published next week in the Center for Strategic and International Studies Africa Notes, Sean McCormick, a specialist on Angola, writes that "the competition between the M.P.L.A. and Unita for support from the electorate over the next 15 to 18 months could be fractious, but the entry of new political forces into the fray suggests that the contest will be truly multiparty, rather than two party in nature."

HEADLINE: Weicker Vetoes Budget Bill; Special Session is Expected

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 31

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. tonight rejected the Legislature's plan to resolve Connecticut's budget crisis through a huge expansion of the sales-tax system, calling it unfair to lower-income residents and destructive to the state's economy. It was the first time in 20 years that a Connecticut governor had vetoed a budget.
The decision, which lawmakers said all but guarantees a special legislative session after mandatory adjournment next Wednesday, was not unexpected. But it was closely watched for the tone that it would take in rejecting the budget and for the language that might suggest a direction for compromise. 
 In his two-page veto message and in his comments to reporters in his office after signing the veto at 9:50 P.M., Mr. Weicker repeatedly mentioned that some elements of the proposal could still be salvaged, though he declined to describe them specifically. The veto letter aimed almost all of its fire at the tax proposals in the legislative plan, rather than at the package of spending controls, which had been a major element in drawing support for passing the plan in the General Assembly.
"Many parts of the whole merit adoption," Mr. Weicker said. "But the sum total of the whole merits veto."
Mr. Weicker, who was inaugurated in January as Connecticut's first third-party independent governor since the Civil War, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the tax system in February and the introduction of a long-avoided income tax, only to see the plan rejected out of hand by lawmakers. They substituted -- and approved on Thursday -- a traditional tax package that would rely on the sales tax and the corporate-earnings tax, both of which would have been expanded.
In turning that plan down, Mr. Weicker said tonight that with the economy "in tatters," raising business taxes now would mean greater deficits and fewer jobs. Lawmakers had argued that the opposite was true, that by avoiding the income tax, consumers would have more money to help fuel the recovery.
 
Tensions Are High
 The last time that a Connecticut governor vetoed a budget bill was in 1971, when Gov. Thomas J. Meskill, a Republican, rejected the legislature's efforts. The further historical parallel that Governor Meskill's veto resulted in Connecticut's only other flirtation with the income tax has not been lost on lawmakers. After returning in a special session in June of that year, the legislature passed an income tax but repealed the law less than two months later amid a storm of public protest.
Tension is already high in the Capitol. The Senate, after giving final approval to the budget Thursday afternoon, refused to send it to Mr. Weicker immediately, as he had requested. Instead, the senators slogged through an entire calendar of business before ordering the documents transferred for Mr. Weicker's consideration about 9:30 P.M. Twenty minutes later the 349-page bill was dead.
Mr. Weicker previously identified four general principles that would have to be included in any budget, and his budget office issued a critique last week before the first vote on the legislature's plan saying that it fell short on all four.
A successful plan, Mr. Weicker said, would have to balance the budget and repair the revenue shortfall, which is about $900 million for the year that ends on June 30 and about $1.8 billion for the following year, in a preliminary spending plan of $8.6 billion.
Second, it could not rely on any "gimmicks," or "one-shot" revenues that would leave the state with a deficit next year.
Third, it would have to keep down the cost of borrowing to pay off the $900 million shortage in the current year.
Fourth, it would have to encourage economic development by cutting taxes paid by business.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Feeling 'More Positive' On Kremlin Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
President Bush said today after meeting a high-level Soviet economic delegation that he felt Moscow was really moving down the path of radical economic reform and therefore he was "feeling more positive" about the question of aiding President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Speaking after meeting for nearly an hour with the Soviet team headed by the Gorbachev adviser Yevgeny M. Primakov, Mr. Bush said: "I had the impression that they are undertaking what for them is, and what the world will see as, radical economic reform. When you've had a totally controlled economy, to try to move to a market economy, it's not easy. You need help along the way." 
 The President continued, "I liked what I heard."
American officials said that Mr. Bush let Mr. Primakov know that he would try to obtain associate membership in the International Monetary Fund for the Soviets, which would give them access to its expertise in reform economics.
Both the Reuters news agency and The Washington Post reported tonight that Mr. Primakov had asked the I.M.F. for as much as $250 billion in loans over the next five years to help the Soviet Union repair its battered economy and move to a free-market system.
A spokesman for the I.M.F. said he could not confirm the accounts.
The President, the officials said, also left Mr. Primakov with a strong hint that he is going to find a way to extend all or part of the $1.5 billion in bank credits to buy grain that the Soviet Union has been seeking. Mr. Bush also suggested sending a team of American oil executives to Moscow to work directly with the Soviets in exploiting their resources in exchange for hard currency.
Aides said the President would also announce by June 3 that he is waiving the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions on the Soviets for another year, because of liberalized emigration policies. That will allow Moscow to continue to be eligible for American credit guarantees to finance Soviet imports from the United States and American investments in the Soviet Union.
The Administration is also committed to granting the Soviets the lowest possible tariffs into this country because of the passage in the Soviet Parliament of the law liberalizing travel. But the President declined to specify when he would grant that treatment, known as most-favored-nation status.
 
Criterion for a Summit Role
 But while the President signaled a willingess to move on those smaller steps, he left open his options on some of the bigger, politically charged decisions. Officials said that Mr. Primakov formally asked the President if he would support an invitation to Mr. Gorbachev to the meeting in London next month of the world's seven leading industrialized democracies.
Mr. Bush responded, officials said, that the key criterion for him was whether Mr. Gorbachev would come with a real, comprehensive free-market economic-reform plan in hand.
While the President indicated to Mr. Primakov that the ideas presented today were moving in the right direction, he also said they were not there yet. If Mr. Gorbachev produced such a plan, and going to the London summit meeting would help fulfill it, then Mr. Bush said he would likely lean in that direction. But simply to go to the summit meeting without a plan would raise a lot of unfulfilled expectations on both sides, he said.
The President and Mr. Primakov's delegation also discussed the concept known as the Grand Bargain, now being broached by some American and Soviet economists. That approach envisions that the Soviets would agree to institute free-market changes, democratic changes and political revisions, like halting aid to Cuba and harassment of the Baltics and reducing defense spending, in return for a long-term commitment of Western aid. American officials said they tried to dissuade the Soviets from such a notion.
"The Soviets are expressing a serious intention to work toward market reform, but they are still uncertain about how to do so," said the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, Robert B. Zoellick, who took part in the talks this week with Mr. Primakov. "The idea of a Grand Bargain, though, is a political fantasy. For both sides to assume that the Soviets could commit in writing to such sweeping political and economic changes, in exchange for a commitment from the West of a big pile of money, is not realistic. The President's message was that we have to move step by step."
That view is not shared by some leading Congressmen. The House Majority Leader, Richard A. Gephardt, for instance, argued Thursday that "if rewards to the Soviets are only paid out for concrete results, I don't see how we lose."
Mr. Bush's public response today to the latest Soviet proposals were far more positive than the one offered on Thursday by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But Administration officials said Mr. Bush, because he tends to see the relationship with the Soviet Union through his personal relationship with Mr. Gorbachev, wanted to try to put the best cast on things in order not to undermine the Soviet leader.
 
Lobbying for an Invitation
 Aides also said Mr. Bush was highly aware of the fact that key allies, like France and Germany, have been lobbying him to invite Mr. Gorbachev to London, and he does not want to be totally out of tune with them.
But asked whether he was now more inclined to invite Mr. Gorbachev to the economic summit meeting, as Germany, Italy and France are urging, the President said: "Well, that matter was obviously discussed. I've got a little homework to do now before I make comments on that. But I'm feeling more positive on a wide array of specific questions, and yet that isn't to suggest that there are not some big problems -- big problems out there."
The latest Soviet thinking was presented to Mr. Bush by Mr. Primakov, the member of Mr. Gorbachev's national security council responsible for economics; First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shcherbakov and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a private economist.
American officials said there were two clearly different proposals coming from the Soviet side: one from Mr. Primakov and Mr. Shcherbakov, which seemed to reflect Mr. Gorbachev's current economic thinking, and another more far-reaching proposal from Mr. Yavlinsky, which American officials say could represent where Mr. Gorbachev would be prepared to go if he felt he had at least some Western backing.
The Primakov plan for resolving the Soviet economic crisis, the officials said, referred to a lot of the right objectives from the American point of view -- lifting some price controls, converting the ruble to a hard currency, and selling some state-owned industries.
But the problem with the plan, American officials said, was that the means for achieving free-market changes in the near future included using greater centralized control to get goods to and from the markets rather than using the market alone.

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Nowhere Budget

 BODY:
Connecticut's General Assembly adopted a budget that was going nowhere, and the legislators knew it. Its no-income-tax budget, concocted by a coalition of Republicans and nervous Democrats, barely squeaked through the House. Given the certainty of Gov. Lowell Weicker's veto and the remote chances of overriding it, the Assembly has wasted its time -- and its public trust.
Connecticut faces a $2.8 billion deficit, equal to almost one-third of the total budget. New revenues are essential. Governor Weicker has proposed a 6 percent income tax; he would also slash the state sales tax and cut taxes on corporate profits. The Assembly clings to the notion that Connecticut can eke out another year of precarious solvency by keeping the sales tax at 8 percent -- the highest state sales tax in the nation -- and broadening it to include goods and services now exempt. 
 Reliance on a sales tax means wide swings in state revenue, up and down with the economy, which explains Hartford's current deep distress. An income tax is more stable and, above all, it's fairer. Sales taxes are notoriously regressive; the poor pay the same as the rich. Mr. Weicker's flat 6 percent tax is marginally progressive; it exempts the first $12,000 of income ($25,000 for couples).
A graduated tax would be better, but even the flat tax is fairer than the legislature's alternative. A new analysis by the Assembly's nonpartisan budget office says families earning less than $40,000 a year would fare better with an income tax than with the Assembly's plan. And the latest Hartford Courant poll, published this week, indicates that the public is catching on; it doesn't like the Assembly plan any better than Mr. Weicker's.
Armed with these facts -- that an income tax is fairer and that the alternative is no more popular -- perhaps the legislature can now rise to its responsibility and approve the Governor's more sensible approach.

HEADLINE: Electricity Markup Penalizes Small Businesses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For years, commercial landlords in New York City have resold electricity to small businesses, marking up the bill an average of 30 percent to 35 percent, in some cases more than 100 percent. This unfair practice affects thousands of small businesses, many in the garment and printing industries, and costs them more than $100 million a year in electricity overcharges. The leases often conceal the basis for these markups. 
 This is the only unregulated sale of electricity in New York; unlike other commercial or residential consumers, these small businesses cannot look to the Public Service Commission for protection. (State law has long prohibited electricity resale to residential tenants.) With electricity costs in New York already among the highest in the country, small businesses should not have to suffer additional charges by landlords who can mark up the bill with impunity.
Legislation introduced by Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler and State Senator Guy J. Velella would cap the electricity markups at 12 percent and require leases to disclose the basis for the charges. It would allow landlords to recover the costs of distributing electricity to their tenants, but provide some protection for the affected businesses. The city, small business associations and the P.S.C. strongly support the bill.
But similar legislation has been defeated in the past by lobbyists for landlords. They argue that landlords would simply recover the additional revenue by raising rents. That may be so, but at least it would be understandable to tenants and undisguised, and would not skew the economics between the utility and real estate markets. If commercial landlords want to enter the electricity business, they should get authority from the P.S.C. and do it out in the open.
Small businesses are entitled to the same protection in their use of electricity as other consumers. These added costs impose an unfair burden on many companies that are striving to maintain their place in a difficult economic climate. The NadlerVelella bill warrants immediate enactment.

FROM LENIN TO LENNON
A Memoir of Russia in the Sixties.
By David Gurevich.
307 pp. San Diego:
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $21.95.  
 When I was 12 years old, I talked my parents into subscribing to Soviet Life, a Life-style propaganda magazine published each month by the Soviet Government for the benefit of gullible American readers. Not that I was particularly gullible. Even at 12, I knew the Soviet Union was a land of brutal oppression. What I vainly sought in the slick pages of Soviet Life was the answer to a deceptively simple question: how did ordinary Soviet citizens get through the day in the land of Big Brother? For me, that was -- and is -- the essence of the Soviet enigma.
I picked up a copy of Soviet Life the other day, surprised to find that it was still in business and positively astonished by the first headline I spotted: "What Is a Free Economic Zone?" But glasnost and perestroika have done little to answer the question that intrigued me a quarter-century ago. The same, oddly enough, is true of the many emigre memoirs published in recent years. These books, fascinating in their own right, are the work of exceptional people: scholars and scientists, glamorous sopranos, fearless dissidents.
David Gurevich's "From Lenin to Lennon: A Memoir of Russia in the Sixties" is a different kind of book. Mr. Gurevich was no dissident, no child prodigy -- merely a bright young man with a knack for languages who endured the rigors of the Soviet system, grew to loathe them and then, by the accident of his Jewish birth, found a way of escape. Not coincidentally, his dryly witty account of everyday life in the workers' paradise is one of the most revealing books ever written about the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gurevich, now a playwright and novelist, grew up in Syzran, a seedy little town on the banks of the Volga River. Uninterested in politics, bored to tears by the Marxist-Leninist doctrine his teachers rammed down his throat, he yearned not for the large abstractions of liberty but for such commonplace things as a decent job, a few good books and records and, most important, a bit of privacy. ("There is no Russian word for this concept; it came to me from English, with a flash of recognition: Aha, that's what I've always liked.") But he kept running into politics at every turn, from Young Pioneer summer camp to elementary school: "At the age of eleven you discovered whether you had an appetite for power and the willingness to take and give orders; or, if you didn't mind being one of the sheep, then you learned to develop the skills necessary for ovine survival. You learned to nod, to raise your hand in a unanimous vote, to weather the endless boredom of meetings."
Instead of following the narrow path of party-line orthodoxy to a translating job at "Exportthis Importthat," Mr. Gurevich spent his free time getting drunk and reading subversive books like "The Gulag Archipelago," "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and "The Catcher in the Rye." He discovered 1960's America through bootlegged rock albums ("my Tocqueville to America") and Hollywood movies, which he "read" in ways inconceivable to ideologues of any persuasion: "Easy Rider's free and loose ways seemed like something concocted by the USIA for foreign consumption. We argued about it interminably in the wee hours around Moscow kitchen tables: it was easy to accept the reality of convertibles and swimming pools and other signs of economic prosperity; it was so much harder to accept the reality of so much freedom."
In the end, Mr. Gurevich found it impossible to make it as a nonpolitical man. Falsely accused by a student informer of being the leader of a nonexistent Zionist cell, he was blacklisted from working abroad as a translator, with predictable results: "The word 'Zionist' was not unfamiliar to me, but I certainly knew and cared more about Eric Clapton than Herzl or Zhabotinsky. Sometimes a search for cultural and ethnic identity starts with an informer's report. Now I was interested in Herzl." He left the Soviet Union under a Jewish quota in 1976, coming to America to grapple with the daily problems of life in a free society: "And if freedom sometimes seems like a burden, it's one worth carrying; as a destination, it's also worth all the stumbling on your way to it."
To read "From Lenin to Lennon" is to learn an important (and easily overlooked) lesson about life under a totalitarian regime: its most typical horrors are not the savage methods by which open rebellion is put down, but the day-to-day humiliations to which the average citizen is subjected in a society ruled by ideology run rampant. It is a lesson that the self-righteous prigs of the 90's, who measure all things against the blunt yardsticks of their preferred political orthodoxies, would do well to take to heart.

The Magnificent Eight

BYLINE: BY CARRIE DONOVAN

 BODY:
WHEN THE NEW YORK FALL COLLECTIONS CAME TO A close this past April, the general feeling was that America's contribution to new fashion was somewhat less than visionary. There were some nice small changes -- the infusion of colorful tweeds and plaids, for example, and the sway of flippy, pleated skirts. (Hemlines, however, stayed above the knee.) But coming on the heels of the forward-looking shows in Paris, the American shows for the most part lacked the slight silhouette changes and the imaginative accessorizing that nudge fashion forward. It was especially disappointing that several of the newer talents who had brought excitement to the last season settled for doing the same stuff over again in winter fabrics.
The reluctance of so many American designers and manufacturers to go off into uncharted territories, though regrettable, was understandable. These collections had been produced amid the uncertainties of the Persian Gulf war. More important, the fact that the recession had already cut deeply into the retail and fashion industry and still showed no sign of receding made the status quo a safer route. Nevertheless, the majority of the new clothes were O.K. and, mercifully, from a store buyer's point of view, quite wearable. 
 But then there were the eight designers whose collections were both solid and studded with nuggets of newness. This small cluster transcended the general lie-low mood and gave American fashion a firm footing. Of these, two are without a doubt the country's top stars.
Geoffrey Beene's controlled creativity is of such a fine caliber that it has earned him a place among the world's elite designers. His new clothes maneuvered around the body in ways that were at once highly sophisticated and powerfully sexy. There were new variations on his shockingly bare, lacy slip dresses, his enveloping coats and his razor-sharp suits with jackets scissored off at asymmetrical angles.
Isaac Mizrahi's showings, usually held in a downtown loft, are rowdy romps reminiscent of the most exciting Paris events. They have become a mecca for fashion professionals, assorted celebrities, the social and theatrical avant-garde, visiting European designers and whatever fashion hangers-on and groupies can manage to sneak in. Mizrahi's models came flying down the long runway, unleashing a torrent of fascinating ideas, silhouettes and directions. The mix included Indian beadings, Western fringes, street trappings, Star of David pendants, biker leathers, Scottish tweeds, overblown trench coats, impeccable men's pants suits, schoolgirl jumpers and neat little outfits for Park Avenue matrons. Not only was the show a tour de force, but when the clothes were inspected on the showroom racks, devoid of their madcap accessories, their true wearability, even practical qualities, stood out.
After these two creative blasts, the other American offerings might well have seemed subdued, yet the collections of Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Louis Dell'Olio for the Anne Klein Company, Calvin Klein, Christian Francis Roth -- and, if you erase some of the misguided accessorizing at the actual show, Bill Blass -- played to their strengths.
As always, Ralph Lauren's clothes had a freshness that enlivened their studied, classy mien. He has moved his military might -- the spiffy way he has of sprucing up women's clothes with brassy touches, like gold buttons, braidings and epaulets -- to his sleek, active ski wear. These pieces will no doubt start a trend. Meanwhile, Lauren's town clothes of tweed or tartan showed a little flair at the hip of a suit jacket or the hemline of a dress. Everything looked proper but desirable.
Donna Karan has the ability to transform a variety of women into modern-day goddesses. Her ideal customers are confident, sexy and career-driven. Next fall, they will be molded into bodysuits of shining Lycra armor and powerful ensembles of soft black leather or luscious woolens deceptively shaded such faint hues as celadon green and pale peach.
Everything having to do with a Calvin Klein production is calm and sybaritic. The models, impossibly beautiful to begin with, were artfully made up to look natural yet as sexy as all get-out. Granted, Klein's debt to the work of Giorgio Armani is often evident, yet his simple, easy separates were polished to perfection and so carefully thought out that every sweater, jacket, coat or pair of pants had a throwaway elegance.
Christian Francis Roth is a newish American talent, and a promising one. Only 22 years old, he has the designing ability and the technical expertise to stay around for a long time. For fall he chose two narrow channels of inspiration -- hobo attire and Amish quilts -- to realize a small, charming collection of eccentric, witty clothes for women who collect such things.
Louis Dell'Olio drummed out just the right rat-a-tat line for the vast number of women who believe in and buy the Anne Klein Company's products. In the best American manufacturing tradition, it was a summation of the season's ideas: long-line zippered jackets, pleated or pencil skirts, hot colors, tweeds, plaids and deep-tone velours. And he didn't leave out the all-important all-black outfits or short puff-ball evening skirts and long slinky sequined ones. Dell'Olio had one idea, though, that gave pause for thought -- the all-in-one legging-shoe. When it needs refurbishing, do you send it to the dry cleaner or the shoe repair?
Bill Blass also did well by his customer, who is usually rich, snappy and American. He offered suits with longer jacket, unusual cashmere sweaters and superb coats. Everyone looks to Blass for evening attire, but he, along with the other designers, seemed stumped. Where to go after the little slip dress? Blass's attempts at evening separates fell short.
A footnote: after everyone else had shown, up popped Byron Lars. A former Californian, Lars had considered becoming an architect but after learning to sew in his senior year of high school developed a passion for designing fashion. His 30-piece collection was so fresh and naively chic that it reminded old hands of Kenzo's beginning years in Paris. Talent aside, the hurdles Lars will face in order to make it in the tough world of American fashion are staggering. One hopes he'll keep plunging ahead.
Despite these contributions, this round of American shows once again ceded the crown of creativity to Paris.

Sex, Lies and the Trouble With Videotapes

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
"Rape is not a serious crime," says Sut Jhally in the narration of his videotape "Dreamworlds: Desire/Sex/Power in Rock Video," "because, after all, she deserved it and she was asking for it. Hell, she must probably have enjoyed it."
Mr. Jhally, a communications professor at the University of Massachusetts, doesn't mean that. In fact, his videotape, which his department is selling for classroom use, offers a quiet yet vehement argument against that attitude and against the video images that, he believes, contribute to it. But I've wrenched his words out of context and given them lurid placement at the top of the column in order to imitate the professor's own methods. "Dreamworlds" uses the illusory logic of video; it tears images out of context, then proceeds as if juxtaposition equals logical connection. 
 Mr. Jhally reaches his conclusions within a zone of political correctness, decrying the victimization of women, reciting shocking rape statistics and using academese like "the gaze" and "gender and sexual power relationships." But his tactics and inferences -- first the raunchy pictures, then the scary statistics -- bear an uncanny resemblance to those of "Rising to the Challenge," the video sold by the Parents' Musical Resource Center of Arlington, Va., which pressured the record business into placing warning labels on potentially offensive albums.
MTV has made threatening legal noises because "Dreamworlds" includes an MTV station identification and shows an MTV logo on its promotional brochure, and usually anything that cracks MTV's corporate cool is fine with me. But watching "Dreamworlds" alongside the 1991 update of "Rising to the Challenge" makes it clear that academics are just as prone as fundamentalists to misunderstand rock video.
Just as Mr. Jhally offers "Dreamworlds" as an examination of "rock video" -- no qualifiers -- "Rising to the Challenge" asserts that its nasty bits represent a "cross section" of what is available in "most local record stores," even if most of its malefactors are admittedly obscure. "Rising to the Challenge" (no Freudian implications, I'm sure)was co-written by Jennifer Norwood, the center's former executive director, and Robert DeMoss, the youth-culture specialist of Focus on the Family, a fundamentalist Christian group.
The new version of "Rising to the Challenge," narrated by Art Linkletter, looks shopworn. Many of the groups the center was complaining about when it got started in 1985 (and still cites) have either cleaned up their acts or returned to obscurity. Lawsuits against Jello Biafra, Ozzy Osbourne and the 2 Live Crew have been largely unsuccessful. The section on "occultism" -- a bugbear of certain fundamentalists, who apparently don't believe that law-abiding Satanists are entitled to freedom of religion -- admits that "occult themes in music are declining" yet reports of Satanic crimes are increasing, which would seem to argue against any connection between art and life.
A new section on bigotry, which points out genuinely ugly things sung by Guns 'n' Roses and rapped by Audio Two, closes with statistics on bias incidents that took place before most of the albums mentioned were released, once again suggesting that the music reflects the culture instead of driving it. And after the inevitable juxtapositions of leather-clad rockers, scantily clad women in music videos, clothed strippers and bondage magazines, Mr. Linkletter says, "Hard-core pornography, records, albums, posters, fan magazines, concert stage, music videos -- it's sometimes hard to distinguish between the two." Two?
Best of all, the videotape concludes with survey results showing that teen-agers' values reflect "the ethnic and social class life style of their parents more than the universal teen culture." Perhaps the Parents' Music Resource Center should start working on the parents instead of the music.
While the center's ax has been ground to a nub, "Dreamworlds" has a veneer of academic respectability. Over creepy new-age music, the videotape shows what must be virtually every glimpse of revealing clothing and suggestive movement Mr. Jhally could tape from MTV. As the snippets flicker, Mr. Jhally argues that by objectifying women -- by showing them as nymphomaniacs who exist purely for men's pleasure and who mean yes even when they say no -- rock video contributes to attitudes that legitimize rape.
The professor has a good eye for the cliches used by many hard-rock bands. The high heels striding down the streetlighted sidewalk, the bikinis on the beach, the singers' heads framed by a pair of legs, the adoring women clinging to the singers, the leather and lace, the cleavage and rump close-ups -- all might as well be stock footage. (Of course, they're also staples of prime-time drama and tabloid news.)
"Dreamworlds" doesn't bother to track down the source of those images in movies, advertising and, especially, men's magazines. Nor does it distinguish between straight-faced sexist spectacle and over-the-top self-parody of acts like David Lee Roth, Aerosmith and Sam Kinison. And from the beginning, it misreads the lusty admiration shown by all those willing women -- they're not undiscriminating nymphomaniacs, they're star-struck fans of the band.
"Dreamworlds" also shows many female dancers. And, gosh, they're dressed in the same kinds of short skirts and low-cut tops seen at actual clubs on Saturday nights. In "Dreamworlds," people moving to the beat becomes another example of objectification; but for all but the must prudish observers, dancing simply demonstrates how the music can be used.
 "Dreamworlds" is deaf to the music of rock videos, and it pays no attention to lyrics. We're not told if a sequence of a man following a woman down a street, being pushed away but then sharing an embrace acts out a story line about a lovers' quarrel and reconciliation, and since "Dreamworlds" doesn't list sources, there's no way to check it out. But the scene is clearly not a documentary. Most rock songs aren't about real life; they're about love, lust, good times, frustrations, fantasies. "Dreamworlds" is valid in its suggestion that popular culture can mold fantasies, but songwriters also try to tap into what's already there; students were getting crushes on teachers long before Van Halen wrote "Hot for Teacher."
Does all "rock video," or even a majority of clips, conform to what "Dreamworlds" describes? Hardly. I watched sizable chunks of MTV and tallied about one in six video clips showing ornamental women dancing or sexy women paying fealty to bands. Even in the hard-rock "Headbanger's Ball" or "Yo! MTV Raps," where there are more pretty people, shots of female faces and bodies are squeezed in between much longer sequences of male band members performing the songs and, often, preening.
Surprise: many of the males are bimbos, too, with longer hair, more outlandish costumes and just as much makeup as the women. Why doesn't some professor analyze male roles in music video? It's a man's world on MTV, and sooner or later most of them take off their shirts. If MTV presents any kind of overarching world view, it's a vision of male camaraderie, where women are more often absent or marginalized -- a bad idea, obviously, and the males' loss -- than victimized. As in advertising and most other television fare, music video prizes attractiveness; unglamorous people of either sex are reduced to comic walk-ons.
Even if sex-object women appear infrequently, "Dreamworlds" might make its case if that were the only role women were allowed. Wrong again. While there's perhaps two minutes per hour of female bimbofication, along with such various non-bimbos as moms, teachers, old women and children, there are also full-length songs with women singing them -- lately, Amy Grant's "Baby Baby," in which she and her chosen beefcake act out a romantic weekend, and Paula Abdul's "Rush Rush," in which Ms. Abdul and Keanu Reeves try to remake scenes from "Rebel Without a Cause."
Mr. Jhally's narration says that rock video detracts from thinking about women as "real people with feelings, emotions, intellects, their own dreams and ambitions." (Like whom? The members of Poison?) Although Ms. Grant and Ms. Abdul try to be three-dimensional characters, that's a lot to ask of a three-minute video -- and more than television provides in the average cop show or sitcom.
Near the end of "Dreamworlds," after admitting that "explicit violence is a small part of the dreamworld," Mr. Jhally cheats most blatantly. "Dreamworlds" shows long stretches of the rape scene from "The Accused" and intercuts snippets of rock videos over its soundtrack. Suddenly, Billy Idol shaking his fists on stage in a cloud of smoke, looking silly, is equated with men cheering on a gang rape. "Removed from their normal context, the rock video images did not look too different from the horrendous images of the rape," he narrates, as if similarities in lighting technique are the same as similarities in content.
The greatest flaw in both "Rising to the Challenge" and "Dreamworlds" is the attempt to connect the perceived evils of popular music to the real world. Both narrations reject simple cause-and-effect mechanisms -- "We realize that a normal healthy teen will not commit suicide because of a song," Mr. Linkletter says -- only to go on into fuzzy zones about how music and video are "important" influences on "attitudes," while ignoring other likely factors. (How about correlating the scary statistics with teen-age unemployment?)
When a teen-ager sees some guy with waist-length two-tone hair, wearing leopard-print spandex and studded leather, standing in a spotlight holding a guitar, he or she can probably figure out that it's a performance, a show, a fantasy -- part of a privileged arena far away from daily life.
Given the evidence, I wish I could say the same about their elders.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Sacramento

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO grew up near Sacramento.

 BODY:
For years the best thing that could be said about Sacramento was that it was centrally situated, a short drive from the ocean, the wine country and interesting places, like San Francisco, Lake Tahoe and Yosemite. But these days, California's sprawling state capital can consider itself interesting in its own right.
Sacramento's charms are subtle. It's a pretty enough place, with a nicely restored downtown area, a splendid collection of refurbished Victorian houses and enormous suburbs that extend for miles. The city is bound by two fish-filled rivers, the American and the Sacramento. And with more than 120 parks and acres of municipal golf courses, there's an abundance of cool greenery. 
 The setting isn't dramatic, however. And while winters are mild, summer temperatures can shoot past 100 and fade the flowers. (Fortunately, everything in town is air-conditioned, except the great outdoors.)
But Sacramento is rich in a commodity that's almost as rare and precious in California as water -- history. By 1850, when Los Angeles was still a dusty dot, Sacramento was booming, with an economy based on agriculture, manufacturing and shipping. It was also the supply center for the gold rush in the nearby Mother Lode. In 1854 Sacramento easily beat out the competition to become the permanent capital for the four-year-old State of California. The city was also the logical choice for the first western terminus of the transcontinental railroad, completed in 1869.
Sacramento discovered its impressive past, and its tourist potential, in the 1960's, when a historic but slum-riddled area was threatened by plans for a new freeway. Instead the district was declared a state park, and restored as a living museum of the Gold Rush era. Old Sacramento, with its gas lights, cobbled streets and frontier-style wood buildings, is now home to the California State Railroad Museum, the fine Sacramento History Museum, the Towe Ford Museum, with a display of over 150 vintage Fords, and more than 100 restaurants, theaters and shops.
Sacramento's turn-of-the-century State Capitol building was also transformed into a municipal treasure in 1982. Completely gutted and restored to its 1907 splendor, it has served as a model for other states eager to revive early capitols.
Along the way, Sacramento has grown less provincial, with a symphony orchestra and ballet company, several theater groups and a zoo known for its chimps. It has a fine selection of restaurants. (Reservations at the best-known ones are a must, particularly at lunch.) And though the Kings, Sacramento's franchise in the National Basketball Association, don't have a terrific record, home games at the new Arco Arena are enthusiastically attended. In short, Sacramento has become a city of the 90's -- clean, pleasant and a nice place to take the kids.
 
 Events
 Free summer concerts are offered in McClatchy Park, 33d Street and Fifth Avenue, (916) 321-1792, on selected Saturdays, June 22 to Sept. 7. Concerts begin at 11:30 A.M. with local bands and end late in the day with a featured act. Performers include the jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard (June 22), the Latin drummer Pancho Sanchez (July 20), the Duke Ellington Orchestra (Aug. 17) and the Les McCann Orchestra (Sept. 7). The 15-acre park is well shaded and popular with picnickers.
Sacramento's biggest event of this, or any, summer, is the California State Fair, 1600 Exposition Boulevard, (916) 924-2015. The fair, Aug. 16 to Sept. 2, will have a pavilion devoted to the food, art and culture of Spain. Open 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. Admission $6.
Jill Trenary, Peggy Fleming and Kristi Yamaguchi are among the skaters performing in World Tour Figure Skating, June 11, 8 P.M. at Arco Arena, 1 Sports Parkway, (916) 928-8499. Tickets $22.50, $35.
The boxers Loreto Garza and Edwin Rosario head an evening of fights, June 14, 6 P.M. at Arco Arena. Tickets $27, $42, $62, $100.
 
 Sightseeing
 If Sacramento issued a postage stamp, the California State Capitol, 10th Street and Capitol Mall, (916) 324-0333, would probably be on it. Dignified, with an enormous copper dome, the neo-classical building houses the Governor's offices, a museum and the flamboyantly decorated chambers of the State Assembly and State Senate. (Visitors can watch debates when each house is in session.) The meticulously restored building has crenelated ceilings, intricate mosaic floors, stained-glass windows and witty touches, like carved grizzly bears, the state mascot, on the wooden banisters. Open daily, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Free admission.
Until 1967, when Gov. Ronald Reagan requested newer lodgings, California's governors resided at the Governor's Mansion, 1526 H Street, (916) 323-3047, a 26-room Victorian mansion (and one of California's first homes with indoor plumbing). The eclectic furnishings include an old-fashioned claw-footed bathtub with red fingernail polish on its toenails. Open daily from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., with tours on the hour. Admission $2.
The California State Railroad Museum, corner of Second Street and I Street, (916) 445-4209, has more than two dozen vintage engines and cars, which visitors can inspect. Train rides are offered on weekends in the summer. Open daily, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission $5.
The Crocker Art Museum, 216 O Street, (916) 449-5423, houses an appealing, if uneven, collection of European, American and northern California art in a restored Victorian art gallery and mansion. (The richly wallpapered ballroom is magnificent.) The museum is best known for its fine European drawing collection; an exhibition of French drawings, including renderings by Jean Honore Fragonard and Jacques Louis David, will run through June 30. Also on view is "Artful Deception -- the Craft of the Forger," June 21 to Aug. 18. Visitors are invited to spot the fakes in a group of 28 paintings and sculptures. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Thursday until 9 P.M. Admission $2.50.
The 135-year-old Leland Stanford Mansion, 802 N Street, (916) 324-0575, the oldest house in Sacramento open to the public, is being restored. Visitors wishing to see how a major restoration is done can view this work in progress.
Stanford, founder of Stanford University, was president of the Central Pacific Railroad Corporation and a governor of California.
Open for tours most Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:15 P.M., Saturdays at 12:15 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. Call to verify schedule. Free admission.
Sacramento's modern history began in 1839, when John Augustus Sutter arrived from Switzerland, built an adobe fort and named his land New Helvetia (New Switzerland). Sutter's Fort, 2701 L Street, (916) 445-4422, housed workers who tilled Sutter's fields.
The fort also provided free shelter and supplies for pioneers, including surviving members of the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846. June 15 is Living History Day, with re-enactments of events from 1846. Open daily 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission $2, special events $3.

Where to Stay
 For years Sacramento was a city of big, styleless motels with overworked air-conditioners. These days it's possible to find something considerably more elegant.
The Sterling Hotel, 1300 H Street, (800) 365-7660 outside Sacramento and (916) 448-1300 in Sacramento, opened three years ago in a spotlessly restored Victorian mansion near the State Capitol. Guests ascend the imposing central staircase to the 12 rooms, which are mostly large, with high ceilings, handsome wood furniture and big, marble-tiled bathrooms with whirlpool baths. Rooms for two from $110 to $225.
Under the same ownership, the Driver Mansion Inn, 2019 21st Street, (800) 456-2019 outside Sacramento and (916) 455-5242 in Sacramento, is a nine-room bed and breakfast inn in a large white turn-of-the-century house. Rooms, from $75 to $225, blend antiques and traditional pieces from the 1920's and '30s. The largest have whirlpool baths.
Sacramento has several other bed and breakfast inns in handsome old houses. Aunt Abigail's, 2120 G Street, (916) 441 5007, has a spacious, light-filled sitting room and a window-lined dining room where guests breakfast on blueberry-filled french toast. Doubles from $70 to $115. The Bear Flag Inn, 2814 I Street, (916) 448-5417, has five rooms, from $75 to $125, in a 1910 California Arts and Crafts-style house.
The 502-room Hyatt Regency Sacramento, 1209 L Street, (800) 233-1234, opened three years ago and is a cut above most chain hotels. Directly across from the State Capitol, its window-lined piano lounge is a popular place to watch passers-by. Rooms, from $162, are huge, furnished in pastels (front rooms have wonderful views).
The 353-room Radisson Hotel, 500 Leisure Lane, (800) 333-3333, covers 18 acres in east Sacramento and has a lake where guests can rent a canoe or paddle boat. Doubles from $94.
Budget choice: The Vagabond Inn, 909 Third Street, (916) 446-1481, is near Old Sacramento and has a swimming pool. Doubles from $55.
 
 Where to Eat
 Since opening five years ago on a busy corner near Sutter's Fort, Biba, 2801 Capitol Avenue, (916) 455-2422, has been popular with legislators and locals. Biba Caggiano, author of several books on Italian cooking, chats with her customers, then disappears into the kitchen to oversee dishes like homemade ravioli stuffed with eggplant and duck with port and sweet cherries. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine about $70 plus tip.
With its thick green carpets, handsome wood furniture and candlelight, Mitchell's Terrace, 544 Pavillions Lane, (916) 920-3800), is probably the most romantic -- and expensive -- restaurant in town. The California-French offerings, which change monthly, can include roast loin of arctic moose with carmelized shallots. Dinner for two about $100.
Chanterelle, 1300 H Street, (916) 442-0451), is small and chic, with tables in three little rooms on the ground floor of the Sterling Hotel. Among the California-style specialties are quail with chestnuts and rosemary. Dinner for two about $80.
Caffe Donatello, 2627 Town & Country Place, (916) 973-1800, serves northern Italian dishes and crispy breads in an airy building with a cathedral ceiling in Town & Country Village. Individual pizzas are a specialty, with prosciutto, artichokes and mushrooms ($8.75) or mozzarella and Roma tomatoes ($6.95). Dinner for two about $50.
Paragary's Bar & Oven, 1401 28th Street, (916) 457-5737, and 2384 Fair Oaks Boulevard, (916) 485-7100), is lively and casual, known for brick-oven pizzas and huge plates of pasta salad. About $20 for two.
The Tower Cafe, 1518 Broadway, (916) 441-0222, is an arch 1990's version of the classic 1950's-style coffee shop. Open all day, the cafe is ideal for a hamburger ($6.95 for an All American Burger, with bacon and cheese) or meatless Earth Burger (made with nuts, $5.95).

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Times Square Signs;
Things That Go Blink in the Night

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THEY say the neon signs will be even brighter on Broadway, as the Ramada Renaissance hotel rises over Duffy Square with blazing billboards. But there is some darkness around the edges.
"We feel the recession, but not nearly as much as the retail business or the real-estate market," said Richard Schaps, president of Van Wagner Communications of Manhattan, who estimates that his company handles 85 percent of the signs around Times Square. 
 "Five or six years ago, we had a waiting list," he said. "At this time, we have some space. But it's not wide open.
"Signage in Times Square is never part of an advertiser's original budget," Mr. Schaps said. "We are always looking for companies with additional promotional dollars outside their normal advertising budget. In these times, it's more difficult to scour up these additional dollars. At the same time, advertisers do know the advantages of having that name in front of the public 365 days a year, and the additional benefits of being photographed millions of times.
"It's the most expensive real estate in the world, if you figure it on a per-square-foot basis," he said. "It's much, much greater than any office or retail space in the world" -- which would mean well over $200.
Besides an increase in supply and a slackening demand, Mr. Schaps has noticed another trend: "We see a resurgence of American advertisers very much in the Times Square area. That is due to the fact that we have eight or nine new hotels and you're really seeing Times Square turn back into the entertainment mecca that it once was."
Of the two dozen or so giant signs in Times Square, more than a third currently advertise Japanese electronics and photographic concerns. But more than half advertise domestic products or services.
Other signs are on the way. In recent weeks, the Ramada Renaissance hotel has taken form, showing the facade on 47th Street on which three giant signs are to be hung, for Coca-Cola, Suntory whisky and Samsung electronics. (For now, the only sign is the workers' graffito: "The Moose Is Loose.")
At the base of the building will be an "enormous electronic cube, 20 feet off the ground, smack in the middle of Times Square," as described by the developer, Jeffrey Katz. At the top will be, again in his words, a "big, elliptical sign with concentric rings like the rings of Saturn and a 50-foot radio tower." Neither has been leased yet.
That is not all. There are to be two more signs projecting from the Broadway side, one shaped like an accordion, the other like a wedge. The architects are Mayers & Schiff Associates of Manhattan.
"What we're selling here is visibility," the developer said. "When movie-makers want to say, 'This is New York,' this is what they shoot."
Mr. Katz said he expected the Coke, Suntory and Samsung signs to be ready in time for the Thanksgiving Day parade. The hotel is not to open until next February.
The Ramada Renaissance tower may be the most conspicuous, but it is not alone.
Although Ian Bruce Eichner's One Broadway Place tower, at 45th Street, is missing its office tenants, shopping mall and movie theaters, it does have the new 34- by 65-foot "Qlinn" display, which sits on a setback overlooking Broadway. This is to be joined soon by a neon spectacular for Gold Star, a Korean electronics concern.
Qlinn (pronounced KEW-linn) is composed of 84,000 cubes, each of which has four visible faces: red, blue, white and green. As these rotate, they form distinct patterns, images and letters in dozens of colors.
Hiroji Hamanaka, the president of Qlinn New York, said advertisements, news, time, weather forecasts and general information would be displayed on the board 22 hours a day. The parent concern, Nihon Advanced Products Company, already operates such boards in Asia, Europe and South America, but the one in Times Square, Mr. Hamanaka said, is the biggest.
MCI Communications Corporation is operating a huge digital display between 46th and 47th Streets that constantly ticks off the number of dollars that "America Is Saving By Using MCI Instead of A.T.&T."
ANOTHER sign is also being added to One Times Square, the former Times Tower, between 42d and 43d Street, which is already caked with advertisements for New York Newsday, Pepsi, Minolta and Sony.
In addition, a spot on the Embassy Suites hotel, Broadway and 47th Street, has been leased to Warner Brothers.
Many of the new signs result from zoning rules adopted in the 1980's. These were meant to perpetuate the "nature of the signs that gave character to Times Square," while allowing a "wide choice" in design and placement, said Lauren Otis, chief urban designer for the City Planning Department.
The rules apply to all new developments on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 43d and 50th Street. In simplified form, they establish the following formulas:
* At ground level, there must be at least one illuminated sign for each establishment on Seventh Avenue or Broadway.
* There must be illuminated signs with 12 square feet of surface for each linear foot of frontage on Seventh Avenue or Broadway, as well as a portion of any intersecting side street. These must be installed between the height of 10 and 60 feet.
* There must be "super" signs -- illuminated and animated -- with 50 square feet of surface for each linear foot of frontage. These must be installed between the height of 10 and 120 feet.
The most conspicuously unblazing towers are 1585 Broadway, at 47th Street, and 750 Seventh Avenue, at 49th Street, both developed by Solomon Equities.
Although signs are required at both sites, the regulation does not take force until a certificate of occupancy is requested for more than half of the new building.
"For 1585, we have leases out that will bring the building up to 60 percent, so we're working on that signage right now," said Jean W. Solomon, president of Solomon Equities. At 750 Seventh Avenue, she said, leases are out for 40 percent of the building, so the question of signs is also "of concern."
"THE signage we're displaying we want to be in keeping with the first-class quality of the buildings and the tenants," Mrs. Solomon said. "While we could have gone out and leased to outside advertisers, we've decided to have the input of our tenants and to use certain signage for tenant identification in the building." She said there was also room for building identification. Some signs will be supported by the vertical "fins" that hang over the Broadway sidewalk. There would be super signs above the first setback.
At 750 Seventh Avenue, the signs would be behind glass, so there would be no framework on the exterior. In addition, the spire at the top of the tower would be illuminated.
Perhaps the only place beside the Solomon buildings where restraint is deliberately being exercised is on the Seventh Avenue facade of the Ramada Renaissance. That is to be a plain, dark glass wall with a single sign for the hotel.
"The hotel guest's experience is one of the Seventh Avenue exposure, with a discrete entrance," said Bruce W. McIntosh, regional vice president of Ramada International Hotels and Resorts, and general manager of the Times Square hotel. "They don't get the impression of being in a building with signs hung all over it."
The sign itself is at an oblique angle to the guest rooms, which are further protected from it by double panes of tinted glass. "This isn't a cheap motel sign or an 'Eat at Joe's' sign," Mr. Katz said. "You won't hear it or see it."

HEADLINE: Talking: Refinancing;
Shopping For a Deal For a Co-op

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
A GROWING number of New York City co-ops are scrambling to refinance their underlying mortgages and many are encountering unexpected -- but not insurmountable -- roadblocks.
 Sagging real estate values and difficulties with financially troubled sponsors are making lenders more conservative about the amount they will provide and the buildings they deem acceptable. As a result, boards are being forced to learn how to cope with new realities to get what they need. 
 The underlying mortgage on the building is separate from any loans shareholders in the co-op corporationmay have made to buy their apartments.
 Some co-ops, such as the 60-unit building at 878 West End Avenue, at 102d Street, are eager to refinance because they want to lower monthly payments by taking advantage of today's exceptionally low interest rates.
 Others are eager to get out of the mortgage loan placed on the building by the sponsor at the time of conversion. "Loans that looked so great at the beginning are now starting to hurt," said Marcie Waterman, a Manhattan laywer specializing in co-ops. She explained that many were structured to carry an artifically low rate for the early years in return for higher costs later.
 Still other buildings have no choice because individual unit sales are being affected. "Lenders have become reluctant to finance shares unless the building's underlying mortgage has at least two or three years to run," said Bernard G. Walpin, a lawyer on the Upper West Side who specializes in co-ops and has several clients facing such a predicament.
 And finally, more and more co-ops are reaching the end of the 5- or 10-year term on existing mortgages taken out in the heyday of conversions in the late 80's. Unlike a one-family house with a personal mortgage, a multifamily building is normally limited to a balloon mortgage that must be refinanced or renegotiated every 5 or 10 years even though monthly payments may be based on a 30-year amortization schedule.
 Strategies for getting a commitment on a new mortgage will initially hinge on whether the sponsor still owns some units. If the sponsor owns more than 30 percent it may be futile to shop around, say mortgage brokers. Many bankers are still refusing to deal with these buildings, fearing financial difficulties should the sponsor default.
"So you will have to stay with the original lender," said Daniel Cunningham, an associate with Harvey P. Katz & Associates, a mortgage broker that often handles co-ops.
 This may mean higher, not lower, interest charges. Mr. Cunningham insists it is so because the loan is considered riskier. But before rushing to pay such a premium, consider the approach of Bernard Liebman, a laywer in Rockville Centre, L.I., who has managed to get reduced interest charges even in these situations.
The original underlying mortgage of $1.1 million on a 50-unit building in Greenwich Village was coming due for refinancing this year, but 30 percent of the units were still owned by the sponsor. Mr. Liebman made a point of showing the lender how the shareholders were already struggling to meet rising maintenance costs caused by higher water and sewer charges and real estate taxes. Thus, he noted, it would not be in anyone's interest to place even more pressure on them.
AS a result, said Mr. Liebman, an agreement was reached to refinance the outstanding balance at a special low introductory rate of 7.5 percent for the first three years, rising to 10 percent for the remaining two years (the old loan had carried a fixed interest rate of 10.7 percent). In return, the co-op agreed to pay the lender the proceeds from its 4 percent flip tax levied on profits realized by individual shareholders when they sell their units. Further, by staying with the same lender, said Mr. Liebman, the co-op saved on closing costs.
 Mature co-ops -- those where all units are now privately owned or where less than 30 percent are still sponsor-controlled -- can still shop around for the best deal. But even these co-ops should be prepared to encounter more stringent limits on the amount the lender is willing to provide.
"One of our buildings that was offered $12.5 million in the late 1980's will be lucky to get $8 million today," said Ms. Waterman. As a result, boards should no longer automatically count on refinancing as a way to generate auxiliary funds for major capital improvement, say the experts.
 Boards should be prepared, too, for tougher and more detailed questions. For example, lenders may insist on a clause that gives them the right to mandate increases in maintenance costs if payments become delinquent, warned David A. Tane, a colleague of Ms. Waterman.
Other lenders, said Mr. Tane, are requiring co-ops to pledge assets from their operating or reserve accounts. Some lenders may also want financial information on individual shareholders -- "to see if they can pay increased charges if needed," he added. Further, even if the sponsor owns only a handful of units the lender may require details about that sponsor's financial condition, too.
 Closing costs must be monitored carefully, since some of the lenders' added requirements are raising such charges. Mr. Cunningham, the mortgage broker, has found that lenders are asking for an "environmental" report -- actully a euphemism for a professional inspection -- to determine whether a building has any asbestos. An updated engineering report may also be required. All this can add $5,000 or $6,000 to the tab.
 Care should also be taken to minimize the impact of the state's mortgage recording tax, which is now 2 percent for loan under $500,000 and 2.75 percent for loans of $500,000 or more. The tax can usually be eliminated, said Ms. Waterman, by having the old mortgage assigned to the new lender. If an additional sum over and above the original amount is being borrowed, the mortgage recording tax would be due only on the excess.
Another way to eliminate these taxes would be to borrow from the National Cooperative Bank. Formed by Congressional charter in 1978, it is exempt from all these levies. The bank has refinanced the underlying mortgages of some 130 buildings in New York City in the last three years, said Sheldon Gartenstein, vice president and regional manager. His office is at 101 East 52d Street.
Finally, boards should not overlook help that may be available to them from the managing agents of their buildings. Some management firms have specialists in mortgage finance who know the market and can suggest lenders willing to offer refinancings. Directors can then compare the terms of those lenders with what other lenders offer.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
Foreclosure Stalls East Lyme Project

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE Bride Brook Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, under construction on two acres at Rocky Neck Corporate Park in East Lyme, is the only sign of life on the stalled 38-acre development.
Abandoned construction trailers with outdated building permits in the windows, and weeds bending to the wind, dot the landscape. But the $5 million, 62,000-square-foot health facility continues to rise at a brisk pace, headed for a fall opening. 
 "Speed and quality of work are high," said Kevin Morrissey, project manager for the builder, C. R. Klewin Construction Company of Norwich. "A lot of good men are out of work and we get the cream of the crop."
The center got town approval as part of a plan for 600,000 square feet of office, light-industrial and nursing-home space on 15 lots. It was proposed in 1987 by the E & F Company of Bridgeport, a 65-year-old construction and development concern that went bankrupt last year.
The buildings were to resemble mills and ship chandleries along winding, tree-lined streets in a New England village concept. But only four lots besides the nursing-home site were sold before the recession and bad investments by E & F forced foreclosure on the unsold 26 acres, and on E & F's only completed structure, a vacant office building. Two empty lots are for sale by the owner, Donald Brodeur of Old Saybrook, who said, "We'd consider anything."
 The 120-bed Bride Brook facility for subacute care, a type of licensed skilled nursing service, will receive reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and private insurers. It is one of seven such facilities owned and operated by Mariner Health Care of Mystic.
 Mariner accepts patients over the age of 14 who are too well for a hospital but not well enough to go home. Fees vary, but they average a third to half the cost of a hospital stay, said Sandy Lawson, vice president of marketing. Jennifer Gallagher, vice president of development, said: "We are cost-effective because we don't have to support an emergency room or operating room."
 The building resembles a large seaside cottage. The architects, Design Group One of Hartford, used a mix of clapboard and shingles treated with bleaching oil for a natural exterior with white trim and balconies.
 Local realtors are not having much luck selling the park's remaining lots. They had been marketed at $125,000 an acre and are currently valued at about $90,000 to $100,000 with electricity and water lines in. Sewer lines will be operative in September.
 "We have to clear all offers with City Trust in Bridgeport or Fleet/Norstar in Providence, the banks that hold the property," said James Moore, former vice president of E & F. Current zoning permits professional offices, light-industrial use, warehousing and garden centers. Dutton Realtors of Mystic, Dunham Realtors of Lyme and MCR Property Management of New Haven are among those handling the open listing.
 Structured Technologies Corporation, contractors of engineering software for the Navy, was scheduled to rent E & F's office building but backed out over a dispute about construction and a setback in its own finances. Andrew Macy, co-president with Pat Haftaris of S.T.C., said: "we are now talking to Fleet/Norstar about moving in. We feel that the park and the community will bounce back."
 E & F began developing the project, which is off Exit 72 of I-95 before the effects of the 1987 stock market crash took hold. It got into trouble when its construction division started funding the development division in real estate deals that turned sour.
LAST month the park's prospects were darkened further by the announcement by the Department of Defense that it may move substantial portions of its naval installations out of the New London-Groton area. "The whole southeastern Connecticut region would be seriously affected," said David Mills, vice-president of Schnip Development Corporation in Norwich, a major regional company. Most area businesses depend on the Navy.
 When Electric Boat was awarded a Navy contract on May 5 to build a Sea Wolf submarine at the Groton plant, the news was greeted with joy. But a few days later the Newport News Shipping & Dry Dock Company in Virginia sued in Federal District Court, alleging improper bidding. Judge Robert G. Doumar issued an injunction stopping work on the sub and set a July 11 court date.
 "We are confident that the Sea Wolf will be awarded to Electric Boat," said William Moore, executive director of the New London Chamber of Commerce, who has been attending Congressional hearings in Washington as an advocate of preserving the region's defense industries. "But we are seeing the decommissioning of the U.S.S. Fulton submarine with 1,500 naval personnel and the relocation of a possible 3,000 Navy people out of the area."
 Another Department of Defense proposal would downsize the Navy Underwater Sound Systems Center in New London from 1,500 civilians to 400 by moving most of them to Newport, R.I. The center is the Navy's principal research and testing arm for submarine warfare and surface ship sonar systems.
 According to S.G. Payne, the center's public affairs officer, "the proposal is a cost-containment measure."
"It will go to President Bush in a package around July 1 for his approval or disapproval," he said, "after which the package goes to Congress for a vote. No item-by-item deals."
 "Taking people from here and putting them in Newport is no savings," said David Cini, First Selectman of East Lyme. "We think it will take the Navy 25 years to break even."
 A drain of engineers and scientists is as worrisome to the region as the economic ramifications, and alternatives for the future are being sought by the Southeastern Economic Development Coalition of business and community leaders of all New London County towns, meeting regularly since last fall.
"We expect to complete a guide for action by the end of this year," said Richard Erickson, director of the Southeastern Regional Planning Agency in Norwich.
 Neil Runzel, communications officer for Electric Boat and an East Lyme resident, believes that "we will get Sea Wolf, but we can't live on one submarine a year -- we must find another source of income."

The Co-op/Condo Troubles

 BODY:
Eighteen months after serious financial problems began to emerge in recently converted New York City co-ops and condominiums, the fallout has spread across all five of the city's boroughs. Accordingly, the five borough presidents are for the first time sponsoring a public forum on what they call "The Co-op/Condo Financial Crisis" at City Hall. It is scheduled for Wednesday evening, from 6:30 to 9 P.M., in the Board of Estimate chamber.
Among the speakers will be Frederick K. Mehlman, the assistant attorney general in charge of New York state's Real Estate Finance Bureau, which regulates co-op and condominium conversions, and Stuart Saft, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who has respresented several co-op boards seeking to work out problems with their sponsors and avoid foreclosure on their buildings by lenders. Borough Presidents Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, Claire Shulman of Queens and Howard Golden of Brooklyn have promised to attend, while Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island will either attend or send representatives, according to a spokesman for Ms. Schulman, who first proposed the joint forum. 
 Mr. Mehlman's office, which requires disclosure of the financial condition of co-ops and condominiums, has reported that sponsors have fallen behind in their obligations at more than 200 buildings. Those sponsors were in default on maintenance payments, loan payments and taxes. Many of them retain large numbers of rent-regulated apartments, whose tenants elected not to buy them in noneviction conversion plans, and whose rents are less than is necessary to cover monthly maintenance charges. The officials said the forum was designed to provide information on the legal rights of co-op and condominium owners, as well as tenants, and strategies for financial workouts.

HEADLINE: Postings: Sonny Mae Program;
Wider Mortgage Eligibility

 BODY:
The State of New York Mortgage Agency -- known as Sonny Mae -- makes home mortgages with below market rates available to first-time homebuyers who aren't too rich and whose dream houses are not too costly. Under new income and cost guidelines established last month, threshold standards have been raised, making it easier for more people to qualify for the program.
Although income and home cost limits vary by region of the state, the income maximum for households to qualify for the mortgages has been raised $4,200, on average, statewide, to just under $50,000. Housing cost limits for one-family properties were raised by an average of $11,900 for all regions, and now range from about $120,000 in much of upstate to $176,000 on Long Island. 
 Sonny Mae sells tax-free state bonds to make the mortgages, which are issued through participating lenders. The agency, which has issued $2.4 billion in mortgages to 41,000 families in the last eight years, currently charges 8.4 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, about one percentage point below market rate.
In New York City, the new income limit is $42,520 and the cost limit for a one-family house is $159,000. But there are ways around the limits, for those who move into an economically blighted area. In these so-called target areas, city residents can earn up to $50,520 and buy a house costing $193,600, while Long Islanders may have incomes to $65,400 and pay $201,300 for a house. The Sonny Mae information line is (800) 382-HOME.

HEADLINE: HOBOKEN JOURNAL;
Night Life With 'Music Coming Out of Every Doorway'

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA JOHNSON

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
IT used to be that some young New Jerseyans would hang out in Hoboken only if they didn't have the cash to get through the tunnel.
But now all kinds are coming to carouse on Washington Street, the main boulevard. They can be seen lined up at the bank machines: young women in wobbly white heels, musicians in spray-painted combat boots and college students in sneakers. They watch where the young men in tasseled penny loafers are going and then bolt in the other direction. 
 The rapid gentrification that squeezed artists out of their lofts, split up ethnic neighborhoods and let in the young professionals has charged Hoboken night life with purpose. People who wear suits to bars have replaced the police as the thing to avoid.
"The yuppies provided everyone with a common enemy," said Robin Shamburg, a 22-year-old writer who has been frequenting Hoboken night spots since she had fake identification at 14.
"All kinds of people from different political and social stratas started hanging out together," she said, "people who normally wouldn't have been caught dead in the same bars."
Ms. Shamburg and her friends from neighboring towns hang out and roll cigarettes in a narrow bar called Boo-Boo's on Newark Street, next to a former sailors' hangout, the Clam Broth House. One habitue describedBoo-Boo's decor, which includes little drink umbrellas stuck in the ceiling and Christmas lights tangled up on the walls, as a "Gilligan's Island boutique." When there isn't a blues band playing, there's reggae or house music on the jukebox.
Late on a recent Friday night, people in their 20's, in jeans, boots and motorcycle jackets, were sitting on the rickety chairs at Boo-Boo's, waving friends over to their wobbly tables. If they hadn't gone to high school with the cashier at the door, they paid $2 to get in, which is $2 more than most bars charge. Susan Shaftan, the manager, who wears a smock, black sneakers and a crystal around her neck as she works the crowd, said there was a cover charge to keep the number of customers under control.
All night long, bits of the crowd at Boo-Boo's cross the street to Red Heads on Hudson Street, a good place for beer in long-necked bottles and free Cheese Doodles. It's locally famous as the place run by a former showgirl for lonely sailors.
But there are others who prefer the bars on the opposite side of town. Peter Keane, a 39-year-old owner of a Harley-Davidson Sportster and a self-described "crisis specialist," says he avoids yuppies in Hoboken, whom he calls "insidious and annoying." He says he goes where they wouldn't go.
 
A Place for 'Intelligent Conversations'
 "Fabian's," Mr. Keane said, "is the best place to hang out and have some intelligent conversations." There the other night, he said, he had a drink with a lawyer who gave up his practice to be a delivery boy.
Rich young professionals, Ms. Shamburg said, can be credited for contributing something to Hoboken pub culture. "Hoboken didn't know 'happy hour' before yuppies came along," she said.
In those twilight hours when caffeinated breezes from the Maxwell House plant waft through town and beer is only a dollar, the sidewalks can be teeming with people doing the pub crawl. More than one observer has noticed unusually large numbers of college-age men at the bars.
Shayna Felts, who works in the student center at the Stevens Institute of Technology, at Sixth Street, said she had a clue as to why.
"There are five men to every woman at Stevens," said the 24-year-old Ms. Felts, a computer science graduate student there. "They say we have attitude, but it's no big deal. Nine out of ten of them are dorks."
This could be part of the reason why there are so many friendly young men in places like Good & Plenti, where waitresses and female patrons are encouraged to dance on the bar, and Stinky Sullivan's, a place that stands out in this city because it doesn't have a pool table. They also go to Shooters, a large dance club with lots of mirrors, which has been nicknamed the Hair Bar for the women's unusually large coiffures.
This is not to be confused with the new-wave club called Down Under, which is nicknamed the Cop Bar. It is across the street from the police headquarters.
Off the beaten path on Jefferson Street, a gay club called Excalibur caters to a mostly male crowd. Upstairs, where they have summer barbecues, and downstairs on the dance floor the crowd seemed relaxed and friendly.
When people head off the dance floor and go to the bar, they find more than liquor in the glasses. In neat bundles are neon orange business cards, and on the back blank lines with the words "name, address and phone number." A glass of pencils is within reach.
No matter how they have changed bar-hopping, Hoboken's new residents have had little effect on the music scene. People still come from as far as Philadelphia to hear all kinds of bands on the cutting edge.
"You walk downtown on a Saturday night, and it's like you're walking down the boardwalk at Asbury Park," said Jim Testa, the music columnist for Gold Coast, a local weekly. "There's music coming out of every doorway."
If a pub or pizzeria can squeeze in a band, it will. On a recent Friday night, a blues band called Haley and the Hand Jives performed in the corner of Red Heads. The lead singer sang behind a mirrored column, so she was the only one who saw her perform.
On Washington Street at the Brass Rail, a bistro known for its raspberry beer, Tim Cafaro's band was jazzing it up at the bustling bar. At a swanky restaurant called Frankie and Johnnie's On the Waterfront, at 14th Street and Garden, a pianist and his baby grand sat right next to the tables.
The most talked-about music scene, though, is in the alternative rock category. There's a club called Live Tonight!, where the bartender stuffs his ears with cocktail napkins, and then there's the city's pride, Maxwell's.
"It's a landmark," Mayme Jurkat said of Maxwell's. "It's a place where young musicians can get a hearing; it's very much an institution." Ms. Jurkat is the director of Hoboken Advantage Inc., a nonprofit economic development company.
Emilio China is the 21-year-old lead singer of a Hoboken band that plays the local clubs. The band is called Sweet Lizard Illtet, and Mr. China described its sound as "somewhere between hip-hop, hard core, and funk industrial rock." Last month the band was offered a recording contract, he said.
 
Influences on the Music
 Mr. China, who wears mismatched sneakers and multicolored braids in the chunks of hair he hasn't shaved off, said Hoboken's changing demographics had affected the music heard around town. "It's a standard rock-youth, big-hair, heavy-metal thing," he said, but "mixed up with the New York club scene." He said the Latin and black street music sounds popular in the local neighborhoods could be heard in the music.
Residents of Hoboken don't mind visitors, but prefer them to take the PATH train or the bus. A look at Washington Street shows why: cars are double and triple parked. Once, the $5 ticket was no big deal, but at the turn of the year the fine shot up to $31.
"My sister lived here for two years," said Patti Moorehead of Montclair, who was eating at East L.A., a trendy Mexican restaurant. "She finally came home because she couldn't find a parking space."

Cross-Cultural Program Looks at 2 Areas in U.S.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
John Sims says he be lieves in a hands-on approach to African-American cultures, especially when those cultures are in the United States and readily available to students. So for last six weeks, Mr. Sims, assistant to the dean of the faculty at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, has led six Antioch students into direct encounters with two distinct black communities in the southeastern United States -- the Gullahs of South Carolina's Sea Islands and the townspeople of Keysville, in rural eastern Georgia.
"If you want to talk about the African-American experience you have to look to the roots of that experience in the Southeast," Mr. Sims explained on the group's return from the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, the last leg of the field trip, which ends tomorrow. 
 "The Gullahs, which were isolated from the mainland for many years, have retained many Africanisms," Mr. Simms said. "Keysville, by contrast, offers students the opportunity to live with, learn from and work in a contemporary rural African-American community that is going through political, economic and social change."
 
 Retaining Sense of Family
 Renee Davis, a third-year communications and visual arts major from Washington, said she was surprised to find that "there are a lot of communities that retain Africanisms as a survival mechanism." Keysville, she noted, has retained a strong sense of family and community involvement. "They are meeting their problems, the same problems we face in a lot of urban areas, with different strategies."
The students' field work, combined with community service and anthropology, history, cross-cultural studies and environmental courses, constitutes the Cross-Cultural Field Program, the domestic component to the multicultural curriculum being developed at Antioch. The curriculum will require all undergraduates to be proficient in a foreign language and to study another culture first hand, either in foreign countries or in the United States.
Mr. Sims said the program challenged students to think "that cross-cultural studies don't always happen somewhere 'out there'; they also happen here."
Antioch students are already required to hold paying or volunteer jobs for six academic quarters. Both programs, Mr. Sims said, show Antioch's commitment to "experiential learning -- learning by doing."
Mr. Sims, a 1990 Antioch graduate in mathematics, said he was inspired to create the program when he was an undergraduate studying in Europe. "I was amazed at the level of attention the Europeans gave to African-American culture and at the low level of such attention in the United States."
 
'Diversity Exists'
 "I wanted students to understand that diversity exists in African-American experience along many lines -- culture and language, for example -- and that there are also some shared experiences and knowledge," Mr. Sims said. "And I wanted them to recognize that we are all Americans. White students, too, should understand that part of their experience as Americans is the black experience."
In preparation for the field work, students took three weeks of seminars and lectures at Antioch and became involved in the African-American Cultural Week celebration that Mr. Sims started. "The idea is that if we are going to talk about race relations in the South, we must talk about them in Yellow Springs, Ohio," Mr. Sims said.
The bulk of the field work was done among the Gullah community and in Keysville, where 80 percent of the 400 residents are black.
The community work centered on Keysville, where students helped in the local library and tutoring children, Mr. Sims said.
"Part of Antioch's history is the belief that social action is important," Mr. Sims said. "And I believe that institutions of higher learning have a responsibility to deal with social ills and should not be disenchanted with or divorce themselves from those problems."
The group's itinerary also included stops at the Avery Center for African-American Culture in Charleston, S.C.; the Highlander Center near Knoxville, Tenn., an important meeting place and training ground for leaders of the civil rights and union movements, and the King Center in Atlanta.
The students will spend the rest of the quarter, which ends on June 22, preparing papers and oral presentations on specific topics studied in the field.
The lessons of the program extend far beyond the specific subjects studied, said a first-year student, Sharane Antonette, a cross-cultural studies major from Baltimore . "We need to learn all the things we can about other cultures, their ideas, the way they approach problems, and see what works," Ms. Antonette said. "We didn't save Keysville; Keysville saved us."

The students are participants in the Cross-Cultural Field Program, which was started by the college to broaden students' knowledge about diverse cultures within the United States. This quarter the program focused on African-American culture and its development in the South. Students, from the right, were Kilima Glenn, Twonnette Pack, Justin Gunn, Renee Davis, Sedar Chappelle and John Sims. (The True Citizen, Waynesboro, Ga.)

Disneyland As Antidote For Poverty

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
After winning $100 in a lottery, a homeless young California family splurges on a day at Disneyland. While there, the father (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decides to prolong the experience by staying on in the theme park after closing time. He and his wife and their daughter camp on Tom Sawyer's Island, and the couple have a romantic interlude in the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse. As might be expected, the reckless idyll ends disastrously. But within months the family has become fabled among other homeless people as the ones who lived at Disneyland.
This is the fanciful but grim beginning of Jane Anderson's "Food and Shelter," at the Vineyard Theater. At the outset Ms. Anderson sets her polarities: the magical though manufactured kingdom against the dreariness of those whose only residence is a car and whose life is otherwise circumscribed by food stamps and soup kitchens. If the playwright had been able to sustain the initial feelings aroused by her work, this might have been a disturbing portrait of what it means to be down and falling out in recession-struck America. 
 For all its flashes of quirky humor and its realistic depiction of everyday frustration and anguish, "Food and Shelter" wanders over the landscape. The play shifts in and out of Disneyland and loses its best intention on the road to social commentary.
With the family split after the overnight adventure, the mother and daughter embark on a desperate struggle for borderline survival -- and to overcome the red tape and recalcitrance of those who are supposed to be offering them help. Unable to work because she has no place to leave the child, the mother waits impatiently for word from her prodigal husband.
Despite one's natural sympathy for the mother's predicament, she soon becomes irritating as she moves helplessly from one unwelcome place to another. Although some of the encounters make their point, scenes are repetitive. A curious reversal takes place. We feel an annoyance with the woman even as she faces obstacles. Kelly Coffield's single-edged performance as the mother does not enhance the situation, although admittedly the playwright has not given her an interesting character with which to work. As the daughter, T-F Walker seems overly quarrelsome.
In an evident attempt to inject imagination into the script, Ms. Anderson creates a fantasy friend for the girl, who is suddenly enabled to read and to see through mailboxes. The flirtation with magical powers leads to a few comical moments, but it is ultimately as fleeting as the family life itself. While Ann Sheffield's design is elaborate -- a mock Matterhorn towers over the first act -- it also means unwieldy changing of scenery. Andre Ernotte's staging is unable to conceal the episodic nature of the narrative.
Not until the father returns after months of abandonment does the play regain its dramatic stride. With the enthusiasm of someone who has been reborn on the road, Mr. Hoffman tells shaggy tales about riding the rails and discovering untarnished beaches. At one point he describes two Beverly Hills professional men who once a year pretend to be homeless, traveling with hoboes while keeping their credit cards sewn in their clothing for a quick return to prosperity.
These and other stories -- and Mr. Hoffman's vibrant performance -- make one think that the playwright may have concentrated attention on the less rewarding half of the family, or at least that she should have been more equitable in her split-focus vision of people "living on the outside of regular life."

Protecting Limited Partners . . .

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
Limited partners are the Rodney Dangerfields of the investor community. They get less information on properties they own than shareholders of most public companies. They rarely have annual meetings and thus have few opportunities to compare notes. And their interests are rarely protected by a board of directors.
"Limited partnership is just another name for a totalitarian state," said Barry Vinocur, editor of Stanger's Partnership Watch, in Shrewsbury, N.J. "There is no such thing as shareholder democracy in limited partnerships." 
 In good times, limited partners have few complaints. Indeed, since 1970, they have poured close to $150 billion into various partnerships, half of which financed real estate deals. But now, with so many partnerships in trouble because of lower real estate values, the loss of tax benefits or an ailing general partner, it seems only natural that limited partners have begun to organize to improve their clout.
One would-be Pied Piper for limited partners is Eggert Dagbjartsson, a 29-year-old senior vice president of the Equity Resources Group in Cambridge, Mass., who goes by the name of Dagson for short. Equity Resources buys illiquid partnership units that others are desperate to sell for anywhere from 45 to 70 cents on the dollar.
Since its inception 11 years ago, it has put about $30 million of its own limited partners' money to work. And though it has avoided many of the biggest disasters, the frail condition of many partnerships has persuaded the firm to take a hands-on or adversarial role in about 30 of its 500 deals.
That is where Mr. Dagson fits in. A strapping, fresh-faced blond who joined Equity Resources in 1985 after dropping out of Harvard College, Mr. Dagson appears to have a knack for finance and law despite a lack of formal training.
A native of Iceland who did not know English when he came to the States as an exchange student in 1977, Mr. Dagson is now fluent in English, as well as French, Swedish and Icelandic, and has a smattering of Japanese, a vestige of his East Asian studies in college. Unfailingly polite in a rough-and-tumble business, he rarely loses his cool beyond the occasional "yak manure," uttered in response to objectionable comments.
Unlike some "work out" experts, Mr. Dagson insists that his firm is merely protecting its own interests and is generally uninterested in charging fees for its work beyond the sums it solicits from limited partners to cover its expenses.
Though many of the deals are pending, Equity Resources has had some success. For instance, it was instrumental in keeping two apartment complexes managed by Southmark out of a 1987 restructuring that proved disastrous for investors who were included. These days, much of Mr. Dagson's attention is focused on deals where VMS Realty Partners, a troubled Chicago real estate firm, or its affiliates are general partners.
To settle its debts and stay out of bankruptcy, VMS is seeking to sell some of its prize properties despite the soft real estate market, a move Mr. Dagson opposes. "The story here is that you've got limited partners fighting back," said Mr. Dagson. "We don't want to see a property sold today in a recession simply because VMS is short of cash."
Other limited partners generally appreciate having Equity Resources around. "Their reputation is very good," said Robert Sonnenblick, a partner in the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation, an investment bank that specializes in commercial real estate and a limited partner in a VMS deal.
VMS officials, who have gone so far as to force Mr. Dagson to fly to Chicago to pick up monthly financial statements, did not return phone calls left last week at their Chicago office seeking comment.
But others who have clashed with Equity Resources are not always complimentary. "They're gadflies," said Ronald Schy, a Chicago lawyer who represents thousands of limited partners who have lost money in VMS deals in a class-action lawsuit in United States District Court in Chicago.
He and other lawyers complain that Equity Resources is too willing to egg on the limited partners to withhold their consent on certain transactions until the general partners agree to concessions. The lawyers also contend many investors do not understand that by acquiring many of its positions at estate sales and auctions, Equity Resources may have different economic incentives than the typical limited partner.
They blame Equity Resources, for instance, for organizing the limited partners who ultimately scared off the buyer VMS had lined up for the Raleigh-Spring Forest Apartments in Raleigh, N.C. "They killed the sale, the partnership went bankrupt and the limiteds got no money," Mr. Schy said.
For his part, Mr. Dagson argues that the firm occasionally has helped general partners sell their plans to limited partners. And in adversarial cases, he says, other limited partners must take his firm's side for it to have any influence because Equity Resources has only small, minority positions.
But in the VMS case, the firm may have used inappropriate tactics to make its case. Equity Resources has urged the limited partners of some of the more valuable VMS properties to question the proposed settlement of the class-action lawsuit that Mr. Schy has negotiated because it could give VMS the right to sell certain properties without their consent.
VMS's lawyers convinced the judge in the case, James B. Zagel, that Equity Resources had sent misleading materials to other limited partners to marshal support for its point of view, and last month the judge ordered Equity Resources to submit all future mass mailings to the court for review. Equity Resources, which says the order violates its constitutional right to communicate freely with its partners, is studying whether to appeal.

Why Swiss Bank Shunned Gold

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
When the Swiss Bank Corporation's private banking group did its projections for financial markets in the second quarter, it predicted that the price of gold would rise to $370 an ounce by the end of June, an increase of 3.6 percent.
This was one of the better returns projected as the group looked at financial markets around the world and forecast outlooks for stocks, bonds and short-term interest rates on cash. But when it came to allocating clients' money among these numerous markets, the bank did not buy gold. 
 This was the second quarter in a row that Swiss Bank had taken the position that gold would rally but then did not buy it for clients' portfolios.
Why? For Swiss Bank's customers, gold was perceived as too risky. Or as Malcolm A. Clinger Jr., vice president and chief investment officer of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said, "It is a volatile world, and we would rather pull back when the confidence is not as high as we would like."
This non-allocation of gold shows how optimistic forecasts for individual markets can be turned upside-down when they are adjusted for the investment goals of the client or the money manager. In fact, the Swiss Bank's recommended mix of investments changes quite dramatically with just a small shift in the assumptions about a client's bias toward or away from risk.
In the bank's outlook for the current quarter, the best performing stock market will be Spain, with a projected rise of 10.8 percent. Australia is expected to be second, with a 7.86 rise; Switzerland third, 7.53 percent; Hong Kong fourth, 6.78 percent; Singapore fifth, 5.98 percent, and the United States sixth, 5.27 percent.
But when allocating clients' money among the world's financial markets, the bank recommends putting most of the cash in the United States.
The main reason, according to Mr. Clinger, is that the Swiss Bank portfolios are based on the dollar, and the bank wants to avoid the risk of a rising dollar, which can eat sharply into capital gains when dollars are invested in non-United States markets, as was the case in the first quarter of the year.
Another attraction of the United States is its bond market, which the bank expects to be the second-best performer of the 10 bond markets it follows. But in cash returns, the United States is last on the list with the lowest short-term interest rates.
In Swiss Bank's classifications, the most risk-adverse investors, many of whom are Latin Americans, are in the fixed-income portfolio category and have 87.5 percent of their investments in the United States. Of this amount, 75 percent is in bonds and the rest is in cash. The next largest country allocation is Canada, where clients are advised to have 5 percent of their total portfolios in Canadian bonds.
The growth portfolio, for investors who are most tolerant of risk, is more heavily invested overseas. Only 59 percent of the entire portfolio is in the United States. Of this allocation, 70 percent is in the stock market and 30 percent is in cash. This leaves these investments more open to the risk of currency fluctuations. But Swiss Bank will move to hedge against these losses if the dollar begins to move sharply above its current levels. The dollar closed Friday at 1.7425 marks to the dollar and the Swiss Bank projection has it rising to 1.75 by the end of June.
The rest of the growth portfolio is distributed among other stock markets around the world, including 8.5 percent in Switzerland, 7 percent in Japan, 6.5 percent in Spain, 3.5 percent in France and in Singapore, and 3 percent in Hong Kong.
Japan gets a higher allocation than Spain, Singapore and France, although these stock markets are projected to provide a higher return. Mr. Clinger said the allocation is higher because he has more confidence in the Japanese market projection than those for the other markets. In addition, the Tokyo stock market offers a wider variety of stocks and greater liquidity for the investor who needs to get in or out of the market quickly.
For a growth-oriented portfolio with less tolerance of risk, the lineup changes significantly. The portion allocated to the United States rises to 70 percent. Of this, 40 percent is in the stock market, 45 percent in bonds and 15 percent in cash.
The rest is distributed more conservatively among other countries' bond and stock markets. Instead of 7 percent in Japan, the allocation is 4 percent. But the amount in Hong Kong is raised slightly to 3.5 percent because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the American dollar and this lessens currency risk.
The income-oriented portfolio cuts the risk even more, putting 80 percent of the money in the United States with 55 percent in bonds, 20 percent in cash and only 25 percent in stocks.
Most of the investors who are willing to take the least risk, Mr. Clinger said, are non-United States citizens who "are very sensitive to losing any capital." The investors willing to take the most risk, however, tend to be Americans "who are knowledgeable about global markets and are long-term investors."

Separating Plastic Wheat and Chaff

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J.

 BODY:
Plastic bottles rush along a conveyor belt here at Rutgers University's Center for Plastic Recycling Research. They are a diverse mix: clear, green, translucent, opaque; some are intact, some partially crushed.
As they whiz along at 150 to 200 feet per second, they pass between light sources and sensors. Blasts of compressed air blow the bottles off the line into the appropriate bins. The line is sorting the containers by chemical type and color, with a goal of producing materials with more value than the mixed varieties used to make things like plastic lumber. 
 Finding a way to sort mixed materials quickly and accurately may be the key to making plastics recycling practical. Unlike aluminum cans, which are of uniform composition, plastics come in a variety of colors and chemical formulations, called resins.
The chemical industry is eager to demonstrate that plastics are recyclable, because legislation restricting or taxing plastic products is pending in most states.
Two industry giants, the Du Pont Company and Waste Management Inc., have formed a joint venture, the Plastic Recycling Alliance, to demonstrate that soda bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate and milk bottles made of high-density polyethylene can be commercially recycled.
But at one recent conference on plastics, Jane Witheridge, Waste Management's vice president for recycling, said the project "is not working for us." Because manufacturers have been unwilling to take back many types of plastic, recycling is "not now economically sustainable," she said.
 Officials of the Council for Solid Waste Solution, a plastic industry trade association concentrating on recycling, said sorting is the main problem. "The people who buy recycled plastics require a quality sort," said Jean Statler, a council official. "If they are buying blue bottles, they want blue, not orange or red. The markets are there if the materials are sorted by color."
Now, most sorting is done by hand. Workers stand next to a conveyor and try to identify the different types of plastic and toss them into the right bins. Color is simple; beyond that, it can be difficult.
For example, most clear bottles are made of polyethylene terephthalate, generally known as PET. But some of the clear containers -- a small percentage -- are made of polyvinyl chloride. The only way to tell the difference is to look at the code number on the bottom of the bottle. PET is 1; PVC is 3.
The problem is that PVC can contaminate PET. PVC melts at a lower temperature than PET, so when the PET is processed, the PVC burns, mixing black particles in the clear plastic. "One PVC bottle in a bale can spoil the whole load," said Jose R. Fernandes, a project manager at the Rutgers center.
That is why the first detector on the line looks for PVC. Unlike PET, each molecule of PVC contains a chlorine atom. This causes it to fluoresce, or glow, when subjected to X-ray radiation.
The detector emits a low-powered X-ray beam at the bottles passing by. If it detects a glow (invisible to the human eye), a valve opens and a blast of air with a pressure of 80 pounds per square inch blows the bottle off the line and into a bin.
Optical detectors continue the separation. Light shining through clear bottles activates the air blast. A more intense light detects transparent green, and one that is still more intense separates translucent milk bottles. Other types, mostly opaque colored bottles, run off the end of the line into a container.
Mr. Fernandes and his colleagues have been debugging the line for nine months. One problem concerns the random orientation of the bottles on the line. Looking through the handle of a bottle, a detector might falsely conclude it is transparent. The answer was to add a detector on top of the line, as well as alongside it.
Another problem involves labels and dissimilar materials. Encountering a heavily printed paper label or a solidly colored base on a soda bottle, the detectors might conclude the bottle is opaque. So the detectors have now been programmed to act on the most intense transmission of light through a container. Thus, the transparent part of a bottle, not other sections, would trigger the air blast.
Once they are separated by resin and color, the bottles are ready to be recycled. Paper labels, polypropylene labels and aluminum caps, as well as residual soda and milk are contaminants to plastic and must be removed.
The bottles are chopped into flakes about one-quarter-inch square) and washed with hot water and industrial detergent. This cleans off the milk and soda and reduces the paper to a fine pulp that is carried off with the wash water and filtered out.
An electrostatic precipitator pulls out most of the aluminum shreds. The plastic and remaining metal are poured onto a rotating drum and subject to 12,000 volts of static electric charge. The metal, being a good conductor of electricity, falls off the drum. The plastic, a poor conductor, sticks until the charge is canceled.
The plastic flakes are run through a cone-shaped piece of equipment where swirling water separates the lighter, high-density polyethylene from the heavier PET. The flakes are dried and loaded in large cardboard boxes for shipment to plastics users.
The current system represents first-generation technology, Mr. Fernandes said. Under development is another system that would group all the detectors in one location. As a bottle came past the detection station, the identification would be loaded into a computer's memory, which would assign a gate where each bottle would be blown off. Knowing the rate of movement of the conveyor, computer-managed relays then would activate the air blast when the bottle reached the appropriate gate.
Other detectors could be added as well. Since each type of resin has its own infrared "fingerprint," infrared detectors could separate different types of plastic.

Market Message: From Bust to Boom?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The recession seems to be ending. But the overwhelming consensus is that the recovery will not amount to much. There is talk of a "double dip" downturn, and few expect strong growth.
The stock market, however, seems to have a different opinion, That contrary notion, of coming strength in the economy, is conveyed not just by the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average last week rose 113.59 points, to 3,027.50, setting a record and closing above 3,000 for the first time since April 17. It may also be significant that it is no longer the recession-resistant consumer stocks, like Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, that are leading the charge.
 Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, four are now at least 10 percent higher than they were when the average first closed over 3,000. All are big, grimy, cyclical stocks: Du Pont, Goodyear, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. International Paper and Union Carbide have risen almost as much. If those moves are to make sense, then this economy needs than a weak recovery.
 The bond market's refusal to rally may also be sending a signal of surprising economic strength,. The Federal Reserve has pushed short-term interest rates dopwn sharply, and American investors have taken the hint. Sales of mutural funds are booming.
 And yet, as Fred Leiner, an economist at Continental Bank, points out, long-term interest rates have been stalled for six months, making minor moves but essentially going sideways. "I'm concerned by some similarities with late 1986," he said. "We see money pouring into bond funds, yet the bond market is unable to move higher. Those similarities suggest the market may move lower from these levels."
 In late 1986 and early 1987, he recalled, the bond market stalled while stocks leaped. Then bond prices crashed in the spring, and stock prices followed the fall.
 This year, there are certainly plenty of reasons to doubt that the economy can rebound strongly. The debt overhang that helped to bring on this recession has not disappeared, and the Government's efforts to fight the recession have been limited by the severe fiscal problems brought on by the profligacy of the 1980's. It is hard to imagine a new boom in commercial construction.
 Moreover, the evidence that the recession is ending, while persuasive to a lot of stock traders, is still limited,. The leading indicators have risen for three consecutive months, and factory orders turned up in April. Consumers tell pollsters the present is bad, but the future will be better, and they seem to translate those beliefs into cautious spending, not a panicky increase in savings. Stock market analysts note that secondary stocks, which were leaders in the winter rally, are lagging as summer begins, Their particiaption would make this rally a more impressive one.
 But for all that, it is a fact that the economy usually finds a way to surprise the seers. A strong recovery this year would certianly qualify as a surprise. Perhaps, just perhaps, that is the current message of the markets.

HEADLINE: Why 'Green Taxes' Won't Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Sandra Postel indulges in wishful thinking ("The Greening of America's Taxes," Forum, May 19) when she says that new corporate taxes -- "green taxes" -- on industries that hurt the environment could fight pollution and help the economy at the same time. 
 She cites the figure of $130 billion in annual tax revenue. That's quite a bit of "green," but estimating tax revenue isn't that easy. The recession has made a mockery of state sales tax revenue estimates, and at the Federal level, the volatility of corporate profits has befuddled revenue estimators. She suggests replacing a portion of the income tax to correspond with these green tax estimates, but practically speaking, green taxes are more likely to be collected on top of income taxes, not in place of them.
Another weakness of these "green" taxes is that no one knows who will be paying them. A basic principle of sound fiscal policy is that when a new tax is passed, taxpayers should know who is going to pay it. Green taxes do not meet that test.
Finally, there is the problem of identifying whose activities do not harm the environment. Will sheep farmers be taxed on the methane their sheep introduce into the atmosphere? What about the noise pollution caused by automobiles and airplanes? Tax policy cannot be the vehicle to achieve every societal goal. Restructuring our Federal tax system is not the answer to environmental problems.

HEADLINE: Angolan Revelers Celebrate the End of Civil War

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, June 1

 BODY:
Thousands of Angolans danced and cheered in the streets early this morning in rousing imprompu celebrations marking the formal end of this country's 16-year civil war.
I was too early to tell how well the cease-fire was being observed, Western diplomatic sources and relief workers said today, but so far there were no reports of renewed fighting. 
 Although the cease-fire was initialed Friday night in Lisbon, the Luanda Government had delayed a series of events here to commemorate the occasion until today to coincide with the return of Angola's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
But people began lining the main avenues of this war-ravaged port city Friday evening, and by midnight the streets were crowded with revelers shouting "We've got peace! We've got bread!" -- an expression of hope that with the end of war will again come prosperity. Angola is one of the most richly endowed countries in Africa, but its economy has been devastated.
"I've been waiting all my life for this," said Dolce Henriques, a 23-year-old student as she danced around Kinaxixe Park. "Look at this," she said, pointing at the crowd, "this is what peace is about. We're free."
Bursts of automatic weapons fire could also be heard throughout the night. Firing weapons is a risky practice that often punctuates festivals here and a reminder that much of the civilian population is heavily armed.
"This is probably one of the most armed countries on earth," said Susan Hurlich, an American anthropologist doing research here. A Western relief worker added, "Nobody is really going to feel safe here until they get rid of the guns -- and there's nothing in the cease-fire about that."
The peace agreement came after more than a year of arduous negotiations in which Portugal, which was Angola's colonial master, and the United States and the Soviet Union, which backed the opposing factions, played a key role in encouraging the two sides to end a war that has taken 300,000 lives and produced no winners.
Later this month, a United Nations force of 600 men is expected to arrive here to monitor the cease-fire. At the same time, a joint political and military commission will form a single 40,000-member army and prepare for internationally supervised elections in the second half of 1992.
A de facto cease-fire has been in effect since May 15, and the two sides have largely complied with it, African and Western diplomats said today. Scattered and inexplicable incidents of violence have continued, however.
 Last Wednesday, a bomb exploded in the main market in Huambo, a provincial capital in the central highlands, killing 8 and wounding 20. The next day on Huambo's outskirts, a truck carrying civilians hit a land mine, killing 17 and wounding 30.
The last full-blown fighting between the two sides took place in the eastern city of Luena in early May, Western relief officials said, when the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, besieged the area and the Government sent reinforcements in an effort to oust the rebels. The Angolan news service has also reported rebel incursions in Bia, Huambo and Kwanza Sul provinces in the west, but most of the incidents occurred before May 15.
The celebrations here were notable not only for their high spirits, but also for the virtual absence of any visible Unita presence. A senior Unita delegation is expected to arrive here later today, Government officials said, but the rebels are not likely to take part in any of the commemorative events in this capital of 1.3 million.
In Washington, a spokesman for Unita said the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, would make his first trip to the capital in at least 15 years, sometime in July. For most of the bloody civil war, rebel forces have been headquartered in Jamba, a town in the southeast.
Also conspicuous by their absence are the Cuban forces, at one point numbering 50,000. The Cuban Government hurriedly withdrew its remaining forces a week ago, a month before their scheduled departure, saying they had accomplished their mission.

HEADLINE: Paying for 'Eternal Vigilance'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I would like to add a comment to Prof. Seymour Melman's article ("When the Pentagon Walks Away," Forum, April 21, ) suggesting a conversion process rather than a total shutdown of outmoded military bases. 
 Brookley Air Force Base, Mobile, Ala., was the only Air Force base offering air, land and sea transportation access in the continental United States yet President Johnson ordered it closed down because Alabama and Mobile had voted overwhelmingly for Barry Goldwater. The economic result was disastrous, and took years to recover from, but this was pure politics: Brookley's work was moved to another base and continues today.
Professor Melman seeks to alleviate only the economic impact of our military restructuring, without full consideration of our geopolitical future. America is the guardian of the free world and we are so entwined with other nations that we have to maintain a credible and efficient military stance. Unfortunately, our citizens seem to regard military security as somewhat akin to police, fire and health services, calling on their instant response when they need them, ignoring them when they do not. This leads to "crisis management" when we should install the commercially accepted system of "risk management," as in fire, casualty and life insurance solutions. The "premium cost" would be whatever military budget was necessary to cover the risk.
It is projected that within a few years, as many as 15 nations will possess intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities. Since we are basically reactors to military threats, we need capable forces with adequate standby reserve forces. This is what our forefathers meant by "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

HEADLINE: China's South Is Finally Getting Some Respect

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANTON

 BODY:
Ask a northerner about the people here in southern China and he would probably say they are oily, conniving, uneducated and nouveau riche and would do anything for money. But he might add that he would love to move down here.
This part of southern China used to be scorned as a land of rustic peasants, far from the sophisticated and cultured centers in the north. But these days, thanks to Guangdong Province's blossoming wealth, it is gaining grudging respect, as people on opposite ends of the Chinese map are re-examining their place on the nation's ladder of status. 
 "Southerners were poor, we worked in the sun and our skin was dark, whereas northerners stayed inside and their skin was light," said a Cantonese film maker in Guangdong Province. "But all those attitudes are changing now."
China's center of gravity, the backdrop for people's dreams, the place where they want their children to live, has moved south. It used to be that the north of the country was what mattered: Manchuria, in the northeast, had heavy industry; Beijing was the seat of power; and Shanghai was a center of industry, culture and education. But in the last few years, Guangdong, abutting Hong Kong, has come to be regarded as the richest and most advanced province in the country.
 
Fastest Growth Rate in China

"Northerners all want life styles like people in the south," said a Beijing entrepreneur who has traveled to Guangdong.
Part of it is luck, as Guangdong benefits from Hong Kong investment, as well as from easy access to Hong Kong television and radio programs, fashions and lifestyle. A flood of people cross the border in both directions, and Guangdong for a decade has had among the fastest growth rates in all of China. An entrepreneurial spirit has developed that is not unlike Hong Kong's, and these days Guangdong's cities -- especially Canton and Shenzhen -- radiate a siren's call of modernity and easy money.
Countless hairdressers throughout the country are named "Guangzhou hairdressers" (referring to the Chinese name for Canton) or "Shenzhen hair stylists," because there is a common perception that those cities have the most modern fashions and styles. Television commercials for consumer products often show people raving about the product in a Cantonese accent, because it is thought that the Cantonese are more discerning and choosy than other Chinese.
Indeed, the Cantonese are aware of their new place in the nation, and often refer to people living in the interior as "savages." They say they have always been more outward-looking and receptive than northerners to new customs brought in from outside China. In fact, the first Chinese immigrants to the United States were from Guangdong.
 
More Envy Than Scorn

At the same time that provincial leaders from China's interior complain about Beijing's favoritism toward Guangdong, they send business delegations here to learn from local managers. In the past, university graduates overwhelmingly preferred job assignments in Beijing; these days some prefer jobs in the south, especially Shenzhen, because the money and opportunities are greater.
Northerners still say southern people -- and they mean Guangdong, rather than its impoverished neighbor, Guangxi -- are shrewd, wily and untrustworthy. But their voices contain perhaps more envy than scorn.
Even the Cantonese language, a cacaphony of sounds, is assuming new attributes, as Guangdong travelers to the north get better service in hotels when they speak Chinese with a Cantonese accent. On some occasions they are mistaken for Hong Kong visitors.
"The Cantonese language has been elevated," said an official in the Guangdong city of Shenzhen. "People associate the Cantonese dialect with wealth, so that if you speak Cantonese, even if it's not native, then it's easier to get things done."

HEADLINE: No-Tax Vows and the Party Line Put Albany Republicans in a Bind

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 1

 BODY:
When Joseph R. Holland ran for State Senate last year, the Rockland County Republican printed brochures declaring, "Joe Holland knows how to say no to new taxes and spending." His radio advertisements boasted that as an Assemblyman he had "voted against over $1 billion in new taxes pushed by the Governor and the legislative bosses."
Now, as a freshman Senator, Mr. Holland faces the prospect of voting for a $51.9 billion state budget negotiated by his own legislative boss -- Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader -- that includes more than $1.8 billion in new taxes, fees and other revenue measures. 
 Like Mr. Holland, many members of the Republican majority in the Senate are torn between competing loyalties -- one to their campaign promises and one to their party's leadership. Both have been important to the Republicans' electoral success, and many members said they feared the political consequences of sacrificing one for the other.
"I campaigned against taxes and I'm a fiscal conservative," Mr. Holland said. "It's going to choke me if I have to vote for this thing."
If Mr. Holland has to gulp hard and swallow when the Senate votes on the revenue bill, he will find himself in good company. Last year, President Bush broke his pledge of no new taxes by signing a budget raising taxes by $140 billion over five years.
 
A Mathematics Problem
 "There are a lot of Republicans who are voting for tax increases who have campaigned on some platform of no tax increases," said Eddie Mahe Jr., a Republican political consultant in Washington. "The box they got themselves into is that they made the pledge when the economy was going up and now the bill is coming due when the economy is going down. But none of them, as far as I know, said, 'No new taxes, except . . .' "
The problem facing Mr. Holland and other Republican legislators in New York who campaigned against taxes is rooted in the mathematics of the Senate. There are only 35 Republicans, and 31 votes are needed for a majority in the 61-member Senate. Unless Mr. Marino concludes that he can depend on Democratic senators to vote for the revenue bill, almost all of his members will have to vote "aye."
That vote in support of new taxes is a particular political risk for local and state legislators whose actions are often more closely tracked by their constituents, who are quick to register their displeasure at the next election.
The revenue measure was negotiated by Mr. Marino and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, as an alternative to the plan Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed to close a budget gap estimated at $6.5 billion. Mr. Marino and Mr. Miller met with members of their houses today to review elements of the plan, and said votes could be scheduled Sunday or Monday.
A spokesman for Mr. Marino, John E. McArdle, said that even if the Republicans had more than enough votes to pass the bill, the majority leader might ask all his members to vote for it. "Right now we're assuming all our members will vote yes," he said. "As a conference, we're all in this together."
 
Help From Campaign Fund
 Mr. Holland fully understands the meaning of party unity. To a certain degree, he owes his election to a pair of campaign committees controlled by Mr. Marino. The Senate Republican Campaign Committee and the Fund for a Republican Majority spent $460,000 on Mr. Holland's campaign, according to financial reports. That was far more than Mr. Holland raised for himself and more than the committees spent on any other candidate.
"First of all, I owe the constituency," Mr. Holland said. "But these other things do enter your thinking."
Mr. Holland's thinking also is affected by the knowledge that the budget agreement announced this week by Mr. Marino and Mr. Miller would restore funds for a number of Rockland County programs that would have been cut by the Governor.
The measures include funds for the Nathan Kline Institute, a state psychiatric research center that Mr. Cuomo had proposed closing, a $350,000 study of a major highway expansion and $260,000 for a program for the elderly at Rockland Community College.
Another argument that may persuade Mr. Holland and many of his Republican colleagues is that the tax increases included in the compromise bill are preferable to those proposed by Mr. Cuomo and initially by the Assembly Democrats. The bill does not include the personal-income-tax increase proposed by Mr. Miller or the gasoline-tax increase pushed by the Governor.
 
'I'd Love to Keep My Word'
 The Republicans failed in their efforts to minimize tax increases by financing part of the budget with $1 billion in nonrecurring revenue measures, a plan that was rejected by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller as fiscally irresponsible. But Mr. Marino ultimately decided that his members could live with a compromise plan that includes canceling a scheduled cut in income-tax rates, a heavy increase in taxes paid by producers and importers of petroleum, a new tax on natural gas, and the extension of the sales tax to products including noncustom computer software, shipping and telephone answering services.
"It's the best deal we could hope for given the fact that we were outnumbered two to one in the process and nobody would support our proposals," Mr. McArdle said.
Mr. Holland said he had not decided how he would vote on the tax bill, but planned to discuss his quandary with Mr. Marino. "I'm certainly going to go to him and explain that I ran on a no-tax-increase platform," he said. "I'd love to keep my word."
The tax dilemma is particularly thorny for the four freshman senators who left positions in the Assembly minority to join the Senate majority -- William J. Larkin Jr. of New Windsor, Stephen M. Saland of Poughkeepsie, William R. Sears of Woodgate, and Mr. Holland. Each campaigned vigorously against tax increases, pointing to their antitax votes in the Assembly.
In the Assembly, where the Democrats hold a 95-to-55 majority, Republican votes are rarely needed to pass legislation, leaving Republican members free to cast protest votes against taxing and spending measures. On Friday, for instance, the Assembly Republicans voted unanimously against a series of spending bills.
 
Help From Democrats?
 Republican senators said there was little question that Mr. Marino could deliver the votes needed to pass the budget. But some said they hoped the majority leader might be able to free some members to vote no if Democratic senators provide a cushion by voting for the revenue package.
Senator Kemp Hannon, Republican of Garden City, L.I., said, "I think it would be safe to assume there would be plenty of volunteers" to vote against the plan.
Last year, the Senate Democrats voted unanimously against a revenue bill that included $1.8 billion in new taxes and fees.
The Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, a Manhattan Democrat, said he recognized that if Democrats voted for the compromise revenue plan, they might be freeing Republicans to vote no and later to trumpet those votes in campaigns. But given the outcome of last year's campaigns, when some Republican incumbents who had voted for tax measures were able to successfully portray themselves as tax opponents, Mr. Ohrenstein questioned whether the electorate really paid attention to budget votes.
"Have the Republicans gotten away with it?" he asked. "I feel to a degree they have."
Mr. Mahe, the consultant, said the problem facing the Democrats had less to do with a lack of voter vigilance than with Republican success in painting Democrats as big taxers and spenders.
"It shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans in their next elections, because polls show the public tends to trust them more on management and taxes," he said. "Even though they have broken their word, there are few Democrats who can take advantage of the issue."

HEADLINE: Patients and Profits/A special report.;
When Healers Are Entrepreneurs: A Debate Over Costs and Ethics

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR with ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
In 1984, Atlanta had one magnetic resonance imaging machine. Now it has at least 30. Most are owned by doctors, and not just any doctors: they are often the same ones who send their patients for imaging scans, at $600 to $1,000 a visit.
Nobody disputes that magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., is an invaluable diagnostic tool that allows doctors to visualize abnormalities in the brain, spine, knees and other parts of the body. But the rapid proliferation of doctors' investments in M.R.I. clinics and in clinical laboratories, outpatient surgery centers and other health-care businesses has set off one of the most passionate ethical debates in medicine today.
 
More Than 10% Are Involved
 Critics, who are seeking to outlaw doctor referrals to services in which they have invested, charge that the practice is a blatant conflict of interest that encourages costly overuse of procedures. Defenders say it serves patients by speeding the availability of new technology. 
 Studies by the Government and private groups have found that more than 10 percent of the nation's doctors have invested in businesses to which they refer patients. In Florida, where state officials worried about excess costs are urgently studying the matter, the proportion of doctors making such investments has reached one-third.
The studies also find that doctors who share ownership of laboratories and other health-care businesses order more services than other physicians. Critics say many of those extra procedures are medically unnecessary. With the nation's health-care bill soaring, many experts say, it is time to ban the spreading practice known in the health-care industry as "self-referral."
 
'Patient as Economic Commodity'
 "You don't have to be an Einstein to see that the more patients you refer, the larger your profits will be," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine and a crusader against what he sees as a dangerous new business ethic in American medicine. "When you earn money by referring to a facility where you are an investor, you're just using your patient as an economic commodity."
Concerned about the spread of self-referrals, Congress in 1989 passed a law to restrict some of them. Starting Jan. 1, the Government will prohibit doctors from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to clinical laboratories in which the doctors have a financial interest. Now Congress and several states, including New York, Florida and California, are considering similar prohibitions on referrals to other doctor-owned ventures as well.
 
'The Entrepreneurial System'
 But defenders of the physician investments, including the American Medical Association, insist that they are proper and even beneficial. "It really does bring new things to the market," said Dr. Howard B. Krone, an Atlanta orthopedist, who has bought shares in two magnetic resonance imaging centers here, one near each of his offices. "If there's a profit involved, that's fine. It's the entrepreneurial system."
Proposals to ban ownership of M.R.I. centers or other businesses by referring physicians are "hogwash," he said, adding, "The doctors I know in Atlanta aren't abusing this."
 
The Atlanta Market
Doctors Share In $60 Million
 Physician investment in health-care businesses grew rapidly in the 1980's as the medical marketplace became more commercial and more competitive. Federal cost-control policies inadvertently encouraged such investments. Medicare's payment of flat fees for hospital stays, for example, gave hospitals an incentive to discharge patients faster, creating more demand for outpatient services. And as doctors' fees were newly limited, many doctors looked to investments to supplement their income.
Such investments have proceeded fastest in the Sun Belt, where patient populations have boomed, the entrepreneurial spirit is strong and regulation of medical investment is often not stringent. Data on the practice are most complete in Florida, where doctors now own or have invested in two-thirds of the state's outpatient surgery centers and three-fourths of its diagnostic imaging centers, according to a study by the state's Health Care Cost Containment Board.
The quick spread of imaging centers in Atlanta is typical.
 
Crucial Diagnostic Tool
 Magnetic resonance imaging, which did not become widely available until the late 1980's, uses magnetic and radio waves to provide sharp images of soft tissue and has become a crucial tool for diagnosing problems in the brain, spinal column, knees and other joints. The machines cost $1 million to $2 million each.
About 2,000 magnetic resonance scanners are now operating nationwide. Doctors hail M.R.I. as a marvel of technology; the procedure is cheaper and safer than surgery that might otherwise be required to determine the extent of an injury. And it can save money in other ways -- for example, by ruling out the need for months of worker's compensation payments to an employee feigning injury.
But the procedure can easily be overused. Many experts say costly magnetic resonance scans are often used to acquire information that is marginal or can be gained more cheaply by other techniques, or to rule out slight risks as a defense against potential lawsuits.
The number of scans is climbing, creating a huge new market. Here in Atlanta alone, experts say, M.R.I. fees this year will total at least $60 million, up from $4 million in 1985. Physicians share ownership of more than half of the area's magnetic resonance imaging machines, including many in freestanding centers and even some run by public hospitals.
 
Free-Enterprise Spirit
 Dr. Maurice Jove, an orthopedic surgeon here, said Atlanta doctors were imbued with the free-enterprise spirit. "The cowboys and Indians want to make a lot of money," he said, in explaining why so many doctors had invested in the new machines. "Why should large corporations be the only ones entitled to make money in medicine?"
Dr. Jove helped put together a partnership of doctors that leases an M.R.I. machine to the DeKalb Medical Center, a 525-bed public hospital in Atlanta's eastern suburbs.
Wherever the new machines were purchased, profits depended on their heavy use, and that required a steady flow of referrals from neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other doctors. There could be no surer way to guarantee the supply of patients than to bring referring doctors into the business.
At the same time, many doctors, whose ability to refer patients was increasingly recognized as a valuable commodity, began to ask why they should not get a piece of the new business. Direct kickbacks for the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients are forbidden under Federal law. But doctors may legally profit from part ownership of a business to which they refer patients, provided they do not receive any payment or other remuneration in return for the referrals.
 
Why Not Take a Profit?
 "Originally, I was sending my patients all the way across town to get M.R.I. scans," said Dr. Krone, the Atlanta orthopedist. "Then I started to think, Why shouldn't there be a financial benefit if it could be done honorably?"
Dr. Krone joined the partnership at DeKalb Medical Center, which opened its diagnostic imaging center in 1989.
Officials of the DeKalb Medical Center say they invited local physicians to join in the new diagnostic center to avoid a situation in which two machines would exist side by side, one owned by the hospital and one owned by doctors who controlled the patient referrals.
 
Duplication in a Suburb
 Such potentially wasteful duplication was not avoided in the south Atlanta suburb of Riverdale, where three machines are operating in an area of less than one square mile. One center, Atlanta Magnetic Imaging-South, opened in 1987 and is owned by Health Images Inc., an Atlanta-based company that operates centers nationwide.
Two more opened last year: one owned by a hospital, the Southern Regional Medical Center, and right next door in a small trailer-like building, Tara Magnetic Imaging, owned by a group of local doctors.
One result of the proliferation of machines is fierce competition for patients. Health Images, which runs two M.R.I. centers in Atlanta and 26 others around the country, says that more and more doctors who formerly referred patients to its sites are now channeling patients to centers in which they have invested.
Robert D. Carl 3d, founder and president of Health Images, a publicly traded company, said: "The laws of supply and demand don't operate when physicians refer patients to their own facilities. It's a captive market."
These fetters on a free market may also help explain why the fees for magnetic resonance imaging have remained so high despite the growing number of machines.
 
The Financial Schemes
Investors Tied To Referrals

Physician investments often take the form of limited partnerships. Doctors are asked to make relatively small investments with the prospect of high returns, in many cases over 50 percent a year. Critics say the high returns show that the arrangements are intended more to secure doctors (and their patients) than to raise capital.
One limited partnership, Premier Imaging Associates, opened an M.R.I. center on the north side of Atlanta in July 1990. In a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required for certain limited partnerships, Premier said, "Management hopes to develop a large base of practitioners who will be inclined to refer their patients to an M.R.I. facility in which they have a financial interest."
Premier estimated that investors would get back more than twice the amount of their original investment by December 1992. The firm is well on the way to achieving that goal, investors report.
An imaging center in Texas projected even bigger profits: a return of $6,190 in the first year for each $500 of cash invested.
 
Nailing Down Referrals
 Dr. Robert E. Windsor, an orthopedic specialist at Sunbelt Spine and Sports Medicine, an Atlanta group practice, described his investments in four local imaging centers.
The general partners in those businesses "approached us and suggested that we invest in their centers because they wanted to solidify referral patterns," Dr. Windsor said, adding that 60 percent of his patients who need M.R.I. scans go to the four centers in which he has invested.
Dr. Windsor said that when doctors invested in a limited partnership here, they expected to get back profits equal to their initial investment in the first two years. Already, he said, he has recovered his $1,750 investment in Premier Imaging, opened last summer.
Premier was formed by Andrew M. Zeldin, a 34-year-old former real-estate developer, and Dr. Jonathan S. Gallen, a 35-year-old anesthesiologist. "If the doctor has an ownership interest in a facility, he has an incentive to support it," Dr. Gallen said. "He may profit from it at the end of the year."
Dr. Gallen said that 75 percent to 80 percent of the patients sent to Premier Imaging came from doctors who had invested in the business. But he added that 10 to 15 percent of the physician-investors have never sent a patient to Premier. This, he said, showed that "patients are referred on the basis of need, not greed."
 
No Government-Insured Patients
 Premier, like a number of the new centers, does not take patients under Medicare or Medicaid, the Federal health programs for the elderly and the poor. Such patients can be referred to other imaging centers. Premier's reason for excluding them was explained in its prospectus: this policy was adopted to insure that the firm and its owners would not violate any Federal "proscriptions against self-referrals."
The investment arrangement at DeKalb Medical Center on Atlanta's east side likewise suggests that securing a steady flow of patient referrals was a prime reason for getting doctors to invest. There, a partnership of 59 doctors (26 general partners and 33 limited partners) leases the imaging machine to the hospital.
The 1988 partnership agreement specified that the limited partners must be doctors on the medical staff of DeKalb Medical Center -- in other words, investors who could bring in patients. Since then, as concern rose about possible Federal regulations on self-referral, the agreement has been amended to allow others to invest, said Dr. Russell W. Wallace Jr., a neurologist who is a general partner.
 
Return Rises With the Number
 Another provision of the agreement could also encourage a high rate of referrals. Not only the return to the physician investors, but also the rate of return for each scan, rises with the total number of scans performed. Under the arrangement, if 1,200 imaging procedures are performed in a year, the hospital pays the investors 15 percent of all revenues, in addition to a base rental fee. And if more than 1,700 procedures are performed, as they were last year, the investors receive 30 percent of the revenues from all scans.
This arrangement could create a financial incentive for use of the procedure. But several partners said in interviews that they were unaware of this provision or that the additional money involved was so negligible that it would not influence their decisions.
In the mid-1980's, the heady early years of magnetic resonance imaging, the link between physician investment and the referral of patients was often explicit. Mr. Carl, the president of Health Images Inc., which opened Atlanta's first M.R.I. center in October 1984, said, "Banks and other lenders required us to have physician investors." Banks making loans for the new centers wanted doctors to have a stake in them in order to guarantee the flow of patients, and revenues, in what was then an untested market, said Mr. Carl and other officers of his company.
He and his company originally took doctors as partners in several imaging centers. But they later decided to buy out the doctors after they found physicians demanding "bigger and bigger cash distributions," Mr. Carl said.
 
The Ethics Issue
Would Cures Cause Harm?

The American Medical Assocation defends a doctor's right to invest in health-care operations, saying doctors are often the first to see the need for new medical technology or services in their community. Kirk B. Johnson, general counsel of the A.M.A., acknowledged that "there plainly are abuses going on." But he said it would be wrong for the Government to impose a complete ban on physician investment in businesses to which they refer patients.
Such a ban would be particularly harmful in rural areas, where physician investment may be the only way to raise capital for new health-care ventures, he said.
Some medical groups, including the American College of Radiology and the American College of Surgeons, have called on the medical association to repudiate self-referral. Radiologists have a personal stake: Many are losing business as neurologists, orthopedists and others invest in the imaging field and, in some cases, even take over the lucrative task of interpreting the images.
Defenders of self-referral, while admitting the potential for abuse, argue that the situation is not fundamentally different from other areas of medical practice in which a doctor's integrity and judgment are the bulwark against wrongs.
"To say this is a conflict of interest is like saying that every time a surgeon operates he's doing it for his own benefit," said Dr. Wallace.
 Critics like Dr. Relman, while agreeing that the potential for abuse exists throughout medical practice, say there is a more clear-cut ethical problem when doctors earn money from referrals than when they are paid for personally providing care.
"The whole climate in medicine is becoming more commercial and competitive," Dr. Relman said. "It's putting doctors in situations that force them to behave like entrepreneurs to survive."

Windsor, an orthopedic specialist at Sunbelt Spine and Sports Medicine, a group practice in Atlanta, has investments in four local imaging centers.

HEADLINE: New York City to Resume Listing Health Violations by Restaurants

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
New York City's listing of restaurants with health hazards and other sanitary-code violations -- a program suspended three years ago when a bribery-extortion scandal engulfed half the inspection force -- is being resumed with a virtually new staff of inspectors and an array of safeguards against corruption.
The new listings, dubbed "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," will be issued by the Health Department for publication every two weeks and will include three categories of restaurants: those that have passed recent inspections, those ordered closed for operating without a valid permit and those closed for serious health hazards. 
 To minimize potential corruption, the department plans to rotate inspectors so they will not make repeated visits to restaurants, require inspectors to bring in evidence of health hazards and explain closing orders in detail, and have supervisors double-check "approved" restaurants within 24 hours.
"There are checks and balances, and it's a more cumbersome system now," said Pamela T. Miller, the deputy health commissioner for environmental health services, who set up the new system. "Nothing is foolproof, but this is as close as we're going to get."
 
Publication Halted
 The New York Times and other newspapers had printed the listings since 1971, but discontinued their publication in March 1988 after an undercover investigation led to charges against 28 health inspectors. They were accused of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from 300 restaurants by threatening to close them or cite them for sanitary violations.
Eventually, nearly 40 inspectors were convicted in the case, and health officials acknowledged that to protect their undercover investigation, they had allowed listings they knew to be inaccurate and incomplete to be published for more than a year.
When The Times suspended publication of the incomplete and erroneous lists, Max Frankel, the executive editor, said that if the city ever resumed issuing the lists, The Times "will not publish them until it is satisfied of their accuracy and honesty." Mr. Frankel said yesterday that The Times would examine the new procedures.
The city's system of publicizing the results of health inspections at 15,000 restaurants and other food outlets in New York is intended to protect the public from health hazards and to encourage restaurant dining, a major contributor to the local economy.
Armed with the city health code, inspectors may fault a restaurant for any of hundreds of violations, including evidence of vermin, improper food storage, improper handling of food and unsanitary personal habits by cooks and food servers.
Over the years, low salaries, poor morale, inadequate training and strict performance quotas fostered widespread corruption.
After the scandal broke in 1988, the city continued inspections to investigate complaints against specific restaurants, but suspended regular annual inspections until last summer.
Ms. Miller, who became deputy commissioner last February, said that the resumption of fair inspections and accurate listings was one of her highest priorities.
More than 90 percent of the department's 50 inspectors are new since the scandals of 1988, she said, and the entire staff has been given extensive training. She said the inspectors would visit 2,000 food service establishments every month.
 
Good, Bad and Ugly
 In releasing its first restaurant inspection results in three years yesterday, the Health Department said the biweekly listings would be issued in three categories.
One, the "good" list, would be of restaurants that passed a recent inspection with no condition needing correction. This category would include only restaurants subjected to an unannounced periodic inspection, not those that were the focus of a complaint or visited in a re-inspection.
A second category, the "bad" list, would be of restaurants ordered closed for operating without a valid Health Department permit. These might include restaurants that have tried to reopen prematurely after losing a permit, or those that have begun business without a permit.
A third category, the "ugly" list, would be of restaurants ordered closed because of immediate health hazards, such as sewage backups in food-preparation areas, lack of running water or proper refrigeration or the refusal of the restaurant to discard unsafe food.
Less serious code violations, like the presence of vermin or dirty food-preparation areas, Ms. Miller said, would prompt fines and orders to correct the deficiencies; if a restaurant does not clear violations in two later inspections, it may be closed.
To minimize possible corruption, Ms. Miller said, inspectors will be rotated periodically to new supervisors, and weekly to new restaurants and other businesses requiring inspections.
In addition, every restaurant placed on the "good" list will be re-inspected by a supervisor within 24 hours, Ms. Miller said. Those placed on the "bad" list will have their permit status checked with department records.
And an inspector who places a restaurant on the "ugly" list for serious health hazards will have to provide supervisors with samples of bad food or other evidence of the violations being cited, and will be required to immediately explain his decision in detail to a supervisor, who will also interview the restaurant's owner.

HEADLINE: Europeans Want Gorbachev at Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 1

 BODY:
Although Britain and the United States say they have not yet made up their minds, there is growing pressure from Europe to invite the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to London next month when the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies gather for an economic summit meeting.
In recent days, France and Germany have joined Italy in publicly endorsing Mr. Gorbachev's attendance in London, if not as a formal participant in the summit conference, at least to take part in separate discussions on the Soviet economy with Group of Seven members. 
 In addition, Jacques Attali, who is a former aide of President Francois Mitterrand and now the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, issued his own invitation Friday to Mr. Gorbachev, asking him to attend a "working session" at the bank's London headquarters in July.
Although he did not specify any dates, the invitation is presumably intended to insure that Mr. Gorbachev is at least in London sometime around July 15, when the two-day conference is scheduled to convene.
 
Symbolic Importance
 European officials say they believe it is symbolically important to have Mr. Gorbachev meet with the Group of Seven leaders, to show support for his efforts at domestic and economic change, as well as to map a plan for supporting the Soviet economy. In the last few weeks, aides to Mr. Gorbachev have made it clear the Soviet leader very much wants to meet with Western leaders in London.
Among the Group of Seven, only Britain and the United States so far have refused to say whether they want Mr. Gorbachev at the meeting, where presumably he would press for vast amounts of economic aid at a time when some in London and Washington are still wary of his commitment to economic reforms.
On Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d issued a statement that seemed to tie Mr. Gorbachev's attendance in London to the reforms. "If President Gorbachev were to attend the economic summit," he said, "it is important that it be done in a way that would help promote the reform program in the Soviet Union and move the Soviet Union toward a free market economy."
At the same time, President Bush said Friday that he felt more positive about helping the Soviet Union, after discussing Soviet economic reforms in Washington with Yevgeny M. Primakov, a Soviet envoy.
In London, the British Government continues to adhere closely to Washington's position, in both its public and private statements. Despite pressure from Europe to tender an invitation to Mr. Gorbachev, a spokesman at 10 Downing Street would only say today that the question "is being considered."
"As the chairman and host of the G-7 summit," the spokesman said, "we are obviously consulting with other members and we are looking for a consensus." He said he did not expect a decision on the invitation question "until we get a little closer to the summit itself."
Among others, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may be putting some private pressure on her successor, John Major, to invite Mr. Gorbachev to London. While Mrs. Thatcher made no public statements about the matter when she met with Mr. Gorbachev during a private visit to Moscow this week, she said last year, before she was forced to resign as Prime Minister, that she was in favor of inviting Mr. Gorbachev to attend the London conference.
On Thursday, after a two-day French-German meeting in Lille, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said they wanted Mr. Gorbachev in London next month to meet with the leaders of the Western world.
 
France Wants Him There
 "I desire the presence of Mr. Gorbachev in London," Mr. Mitterrand said. He suggested that Mr. Gorbachev should not attend the actual two-day conference itself but rather should be there "only for consultations on subjects which are common to him and to us."
When pressed by reporters whether an invitation would imply a Western commitment to offer aid to the Soviet Union, Mr. Mitterrand replied: "I hope so, but the amount will depend on the conversation."
Until joined by France and Germany, Italy had taken the lead in pressing for an invitation, to emphasize Western support for Soviet economic reforms.
"We must decide quickly and act quickly at the London G-7," said Gianni De Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister. "If we don't decide, we will be giving a signal of nonconfidence to private industry, which could just write off the Soviet Union as a target for investment."

HEADLINE: Vote in a 'Melting Pot' of Los Angeles May Mirror the Future of California

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 1

 BODY:
The ethnic politics of the future are germinating here in a race for a State Assembly seat from a crowded immigrant neighborhood that some politicians call the new Ellis Island.
Fifteen candidates, some representing tiny immigrant constituencies, are maneuvering for votes in the 46th District in central Los Angeles, but as in the state at large, the heavily registered white voters are expected to determine the outcome. 
 Political analysts say this immigrant point of entry, where nearly 50 languages can be heard among the schoolchildren, offers a lesson in the gap between population numbers and political power.
"I contend that, like it or not, my district is what all of California is going to look like by the year 2025, if not before," said Michael Roos, the incumbent, whose resignation touched off this special election, scheduled for Tuesday.
 
Diversity of Candidates
 "It seems like every faction in the community has fielded a candidate," said Mr. Roos, a Democrat. "The gays have a candidate, the Jews have a candidate, the Filipinos have a candidate, the Latinos have a candidate, the Koreans have a candidate, the Japanese have a candidate."
But while the district has a population of more than 360,000 people, mostly immigrants and their children, it has only 63,000 registered voters, and fewer than 15,000 of them are expected to vote. Whites, though they account for only 15 percent of the residents, make up at least 60 percent of the electorate in this district.
Thus, political analysts predict that even though California's exploding Hispanic and Asian populations are expected to put minority groups in the majority by the turn of the century, their political power will continue to lag behind their numbers for some time.
"Every time I read an article about how something dramatic is going to change, I want to laugh," said James Hayes, a political consultant who said he was advising 12 of the candidates here. He pointed out that even though the state's minority population is growing rapidly, the electorate remains overwhelmingly white. Although minorities already make up 43 percent of the state's population, 80 percent of the voters in last November's election were white.
But as in the state at large, the white population of the 46th District is aging, while the mostly Hispanic immigrant population, many of whom are not yet citizens, is young and growing.
One Democratic candidate, John Emerson, the Chief Deputy City Attorney, said, "This is a district with one of the highest percentages of children living in it, whereas when the votes are tallied, more than 45 percent of those voting are over 65 years of age."
Another candidate, Michael Cacciotti, a Democrat who is a former aide to Mr. Roos, said this demographic picture was vivid as he campaigned from door to door. "I can see the dying population of Anglos and Europeans, by themselves or with their spouse, in their 80's and 90's," he said. "In another room, 20 kids are running down the hallway where Latino families have moved in."
With three white candidates and one homosexual candidate expected by most political experts to divide the white votes, some minority candidates are taking heart from predictions that the seat could be won with no more than 2,000 votes.
Victory seems possible if there were bloc voting by the 1,800 registered ethnic Japanese, the 1,200 Chinese, the 2,500 Koreans, the 300 Vietnamese, the 9,000 Mexican and Central Americans, the 4,000 Filipinos, the 1,000 Armenians or the 1,500 blacks.
 
Political Consultant's Advice
 But Mr. Hayes said he had counseled his clients that the route to victory in California's emerging multi-cultural politics was an appeal to a broad base beyond an ethnic constituency. He noted that several black and Japanese politicians have had success without strong racial or ethnic power bases. City Councilman Michael Woo won his seat in a district that is only 5 percent Asian, and Mayor Tom Bradley, who is black, has served for 17 years in a city where the black population now stands at 13 percent.
Although none of the 46th District's minority candidates may win, they are preparing the politics of the future in a community that includes what a demographic expert, Leo Estrada, termed "staging areas" for immigrant arrivals similar to New York's Lower East Side early in the century.
Like that neighborhood, he said, this is a district that offers low-cost housing and low-paying jobs, from which the various immigrant groups will eventually move on.
The 46th District runs from the affluent Silver Lake community in the north to a high-crime area along Pico Boulevard in the south, and includes most of Koreatown and slivers of Chinatown and the Armenian community of East Hollywood, as well as a Little Salvador and a miniature Manila.
Most strikingly, said Mr. Estrada, the ethnic groups here commingle more intensely than in almost any other place in the country, with nationalities shifting from building to building along a street.
"I know a place along Rampart Street that turned from white to Mexican to Filipino all within about a year and a half," said Mr. Estrada, who is a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "You'll find some villages re-emerging in the form of an apartment building in which a half to two-thirds of all apartments are being rented by people from the same village back home."
Crowded along a few blocks of Santa Monica Boulevard are the Panderia Salvadorena, Taslikian's Armenian Pastry, Lutong Bahay Filipino Food, Spicy B.B.Q. Thai and Chinese Food and the Tavlian Middle Eastern, Greek and Italian Grocery.
Sri Lankan Tamils and Mixtec Indians from Mexico's Oaxaca Province share shady neighborhoods with Sufi and Vietnamese Buddhist temples.
At the Hoover Street Elementary School, students speak Thai, Spanish, Portuguese, Filipino, Laotian, Korean, Khmer, Italian, Hindi, Hawaiian, Vietnamese, Amharic, Cantonese and other Chinese dialects. Only 30 percent speak English well.
At the Hobart Boulevard Elementary School, said Mr. Cacciotti, "P.T.A. meetings are like a three-ring circus."
"The principal gets up there and talks and most of the people can't understand him," he said. "Then one vice principal gets up and talks Spanish. Then the other gets up and talks Korean."
As with the state and the city at large, demographers say, new immigrants are lured here by the climate, the economy, the geographical location and the presence of others from their countries who came before them.
"In the 70's and 80's, everyone in the world that was going to get killed got out and came to L.A.," said a demographer who asked that his name not be used because he is a consultant to several of the candidates.
"They had these little tiny communities that were already here," he said. "Then climate, location, size, infrastructure and rents as a percentage of income -- if you were to create all that somewhere on the globe it would show up here in the 46th Assembly District."

HEADLINE: Top Ethiopia Rebel Talks of Democracy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, June 1

 BODY:
The guerrilla leader who heads the new interim government here returned to Ethiopia today and promised to work for democracy and free enterprise.
The official, Meles Zenawi, arrived before dawn aboard a charter flight from London. His arrival was without public ceremony, and foreign diplomats who had contacts with the rebels said Mr. Meles had chosen the low-key entrance because he realized that his forces from Tigre Province, in the north, were widely distrusted by the ethnic Amhara group that dominates Addis Ababa. 
 Since Mr. Meles's forces overwhelmed the Government on Tuesday, they have forcibly suppressed a series of hostile demonstrations by civilians in the capital, resulting in at least 10 dead.
Mr. Meles's first public appearance was an afternoon meeting with the foreign diplomatic corps and a few members of the press, in which he attempted to dispel any notion that his Tigre People's Liberation Front remained committed to installing the Albanian-style Communist system it espoused several years ago.
"We're talking about a democratic and peaceful transition," he said. "We are not going for vendettas, retribution or kangaroo courts."
 
Some Free-Market Solutions
 He also said he favored dismantling state controls over agriculture and generally favored free-market remedies for Ethiopia's dire poverty.
Mr. Meles emphasized that the first priority of the interim administration was to establish order.
Longer-term policies, he said, will have to be set by a provisional government organized after leaders of his group and the two other major guerrilla armies meet by July 1. And he added that national elections would come "in a year or two," rather than immediately.
Mr. Meles responded carefully when questioned about the sensitive issue of independence for the Red Sea province of Eritrea, in the nation's far north. This has long been the aim of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, with which the Tigreans are loosely aligned.
He said he favored a referendum on Eritrean independence, but in deference to popular sentiment in the capital, which is strongly in favor of keeping the nation united, Mr. Meles told the diplomats that their portfolios still included Eritrea.
Questioned about the widespread impression that his forces only entered the capital after receiving permission from Washington, he replied that they were prepared to take Addis Ababa with or without American consent.
"We would not let any country invite us into our own capital," he said.
 
Eritrea a Touchy Subject
 A senior Middle Eastern diplomat said Mr. Meles "made a good impression," but the envoy warned that Ethiopia would again become consumed by civil war if the Eritrean rebels pressed for independence. "Eritrean independence is not acceptable here," the envoy said.
The Eritrean guerrillas, who represent the oldest and strongest fighting force in the country, already control all of their province and have formed their own provisional government in the capital, Asmara. Moreover, their command of Assab and Massawa, the nation's two principal ports, gives them tremendous leverage over the Tigreans in Addis Ababa.
Eritreans developed an independent identity because they were dominated for centuries by the Ottoman Empire, and later by the Egyptians, British and Italians. But a large number of Amharas, who have traditionally formed Ethiopia's governing elite, reject such aspirations as the illegitimate legacy of colonialism.
Later today, the Italian Ambassador, Sergio Angeletti, asked for a meeting with Mr. Meles to discuss the interim Government's first diplomatic imbroglio.
Tigrean fighters have surrounded the Italian Embassy since Friday night, after it became known that the former acting President, Lieut. Gen. Tesfaye Gibre-Kidan, and six other senior officials of the old government had taken refuge there. The Tigreans are demanding that the former officials surrender.

HEADLINE: Bush Assails 'Quota Bill' at West Point Graduation

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST POINT, N.Y., June 1

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he wanted to "destroy the racial mistrust that threatens our national well-being as much as violence or drugs or poverty" and called for support for his civil rights bill, saying it would avert employment quotas.
"We must think of ourselves not as colors or numbers," he said at the 193d commencement of the United States Military Academy here, "but as Americans, as bearers of sacred values." 
 Mr. Bush presented diplomas to each of the 915 graduates of the academy, which he hailed as an institution where people are measured by "merit, heart and will -- not creed or sex or color or national origin."
He attacked the competing civil rights bill, backed by the House Democratic leadership, as a "quota bill, regardless of how its authors dress it up." A provision declaring quotas illegal was added to the bill last week, but Mr. Bush said, "You can't put a sign on a pig and say it's a horse."
 
Bush's Veto Threat
 The Democratic bill, designed to overrule a series of 1989 Supreme Court decisions that made it harder for victims of job discrimination to sue and collect damages, is expected to be passed next week by the House. Supporters hope, and the White House apparently fears, that they can muster the two-thirds majority that would be necessary to override a threatened Presidential veto.
Mr. Bush, who has been hammering against the bill in recent days, said, "It invites people to litigate, not cooperate, and this is no way in our country to promote harmony."
"And so, let us cast off now the politics of division," he said. "Let's build a society in which people respect each other, work with, not against each other, and strive to illuminate the American character."
The audience of cadets and their families gave him a polite hearing, without the heckling or demonstrations that met him recently at Hampton and Yale Universities.
The crowd gave his civil rights message modest applause at only two points, when he said his bill would "not force employers to choose between using quotas or the risk of costly litigation," a charge he has made against the Democratic bill, and when he said his Administration "will strike at discrimination wherever it exists."
The speech today was the fifth of six commencement addresses this spring in which Mr. Bush has sought to define his Administration's position on major topics, ranging from China policy to "politically correct" speech.
Today's topic, Mr. Bush's view of race relations in America, had been planned for several weeks. But it gained relevance when House leaders put off a vote on the civil rights bill. They had hoped to vote on it this week. Now they plan a vote on Tuesday.
The bill is very similar to the one Mr. Bush vetoed last year. But a few changes, including the anti-quota section, and alterations in the makeup of the House since last year's election, have given sponsors serious hopes of mustering the critical two-thirds majority.
Today Mr. Bush also made a point of noting that the academy was graduating both its thousandth black and its thousandth woman, Michael Mayweather of St. Louis and Kimberly J. Ashton of Williston, N.D.
Fifty-four of the graduates who tossed their caps in the air at Michie Stadium after being commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army this morning are black. Eighty-six are women. The academy also said that 38 were Hispanic-Americans, 30 were Asian-Americans and 3 were native Americans.
In his speech, Mr. Bush contended that today's civil rights leaders had forgotten the message of their predecessors of the 1960's when the goal was "equality of opportunity and equality under the law." When Mr. Bush was running unsuccessfully for the Senate in Texas in 1964, he attacked the landmark Civil Rights Act of that year. But in 1968, as a member of the House, he cast a vote for that year's Fair Housing Act, a measure that few Southern Republicans favored.
 
Goal of 'a Fair Chance'
 "Government's responsibility," he said today, "is to enhance, not redistribute, opportunity, to insure that all people get a fair chance to achieve their dreams.
"Today some talk not of opportunity but of redistributing rights. They would pit one group against another, encourage people to think of others as competitors, not colleagues. That's not the way to achieve justice and equality here in America. We need to adopt a more unifying, moral and noble approach."
He said his Administration's commitment to equality involved not only the civil rights bill but a "comprehensive attack on the problems facing disadvantaged Americans." That plan included its efforts to promote innovation in education, individual ownership of public housing and economic enterprise zones he said.
He said his anti-crime program was also essential "because no American is free if imprisoned by the fear of crime."
"These policies," he said, "give power back to the people and they move us toward achieving the goal of equal opportunity. They do not -- cannot -- insure racial success."

HEADLINE: Soviet Jews Would Be Settled In Co-op City, State Plan Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
A year after an attempt to relocate Soviet Jewish emigres at the Starrett City housing complex in Brooklyn collapsed amid accusations of discrimination, a more ambitious plan to settle up to 250 emigre families at Co-op City in the Bronx has been approved by New York State.
The proposal to bring emigre families to Starrett City was doomed, officials said, because the Brooklyn complex has a waiting list of about 8,000 families and its owners could not overcome the implication that white foreigners would be receiving preferential treatment over minority applicants in renting the apartments. 
 But at Co-op City, instead of a waiting list, there is a list of more than 500 units available for sale.
And to further avoid the appearance of singling out one group for special treatment in the government-subsidized complex, applications for the apartments and for subsidized loans to purchase them have been opened to all immigrant groups that have sponsoring organizations.
"What we have done here in effect is to create an affirmative-action program for immigrants," said Angelo Aponte, Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the state agency that oversees both Co-op City and Starrett City, and which approved the Co-op City plan.
Under an agreement signed last week by the state, the Riverbay Corporation, which runs Co-op City, and the Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, Soviet Jews would purchase mostly two- and three-bedroom apartments for an average of $10,000 each with interest-free loans from the Hebrew Free Loan Society, a 99-year-old philanthropic group.
 
15,372 Apartments
 David Cohen, the executive director of the Council on Jewish Poverty, a 19-year-old social-service organization, said that final agreement had not yet been reached on the financing, but that a decision was expected in two weeks. Without such funds, the agreement could collapse, he said.
Housing advocates who opposed the Starrett plan took a wait-and-see attitude on the Co-op proposal.
Under the terms of the agreement, newspaper ads will run this weekend offering apartments for sale to all comers. Managers of Co-op City, one of the largest apartment complexes in the nation with 15,372 apartments in 35 high-rises, expressed confidence that they could absorb hundreds of buyers in addition to those sponsored by the Council on Jewish Poverty.
The ads are believed to be the first ever run for units at the complex, said Al Zezula, a spokesman for the Co-op management. "It has always been word of mouth, but wham -- suddenly, like everybody else, there are vacancies," he said.
Besides Soviet Jews, assistance will be available to other immigrant groups under the loan program administered by the Hebrew Free Loan Society, which provides loans to needy people who require temporary assistance. The society is nonsectarian, but as a matter of tradition the vast majority of its services are provided to Jews, said its executive director, Arnold Teitelbaum.
 
30 Families a Month
 Under the terms of the agreement, which was reached after more than a year of often emotional debate among Co-op City residents, purchases would be arranged for 30 emigre families a month for three months, after which the program would be reassessed.
Last week, the board of the Riverbay Corporation voted 10 to 1 to approve the plan. One factor that overcame doubts about granting any one group special status was the specter of the vacancies that cut into everyone's equity in the complex.
"The Russian emigres are mostly professional people, and their presence will be a terrific shot in the arm for Co-op City and the Bronx," said Representative Eliot L. Engel, a 20-year resident of Co-op City and grandson of four Russian emigres, whose Congressional district includes the complex.
A chief architect of Co-op City was Herman J. Jessor, known for the amenities of his designs such as entrance foyers, eat-in kitchens with windows and large rooms that are the main selling points of the Bronx apartments. Mr. Jessor, who died in April 1990 at age 95, was himself a Russian immigrant who came to the United States when he was 12.

HEADLINE: Prison Unrest Shakes Elmira's Peace

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTHPORT, N.Y. June 1

 BODY:
The two state prisons in the Elmira area have provided jobs for residents for generations, a local historian says, but until recently they never thought of it as a prison town.
Instead Elmira identified itself with another resident -- Mark Twain, who spent summers here for 20 years. 
 Then the state decided six months ago to move its toughest and most jailwise inmates into the area's second prison, and then last week some of those prisoners staged a daylong rebellion that has shaken and angered residents and maybe changed the way Elmira looks at itself.
"I think it's changed the concept of Elmira for many people," said the town's retired historian, Thomas Byrne. "I never thought of it until now as a prison town."
 
'Pressures Are So Great'
 Officials said today that 50 of the 52 inmates involved in the incident had been transferred from Elmira to maximum-security prisons.
As far back as the Civil War, when 12,000 Confederate soldiers were interned at Elmira Prison Camp, inmates have been part of the population here. And until Southport Corrections Facility was made into a "maxi maxi" security prison for the state's worst inmates six months ago, Richard Gunderman, who has been a correction officer for 15 years, had the kind of job he hoped his son might pursue.
Standing last Friday within a stone's throw of Southport Corrections Facility, where he had earlier in the week spent nearly 27 hours without sleep as the inmates took over the prison and held three of his colleagues hostage, Officer Gunderman said he had told his son not to go through with his plan to apply for a guard's job.
"The pressures are so great here that I just go home and break down," said Officer Gunderman, 44 years old. "There's no release. I just want to go home and sit alone."
Southport opened in October 1988 as a maximum security prison intended to hold 750 inmates. It joined Elmira Correctional Facility, which opened in 1876 as a reformatory for boys, but later became a maximum security prison for adults.
Assemblyman George Winner Jr. led the fight to bring the second prison to Chemung County, whose economy had been rocked by a series of plant closings, including America La France, which had manufactured fire engines here for 150 years.
In the mid-1980's Chemung County had the highest unemployment rate in New York and ranked sixth nationally on the list of economically depressed areas, said Larry Bowman, president of the county Chamber of Commerce.
Given the local economic problems and the longtime acceptance of the older prison, there was little opposition to Southport. But last November, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced that Southport would be converted into the state's first all-solitary-confinement prison for nearly 800 of the state's worst inmates.
State officials said Elmira Correctional Facility has an annual payroll of $25 million and Southport one of $13 million. But their economic impact is estimated at triple those figures, counting the ripple effect of those salaries.
Mr. Winner, a Republican from Elmira and a 13-year veteran of the Assembly, said the state was able to force through the conversion to "maxi maxi" on the county without the agreement of legislators or county officials.
"They quieted the system down statewide by the removal of the most dangerous and the most disturbed inmates and made a nightmare out of Southport," Mr. Winner said. "The community is satisfied that there is no realistic risk that there is going to be a massive escape, but the community is concerned about the safety of its relatives and friends who work there."
This week's takeover prompted many guards and their families to reconsider the pressures that have increased -- at work and at home -- since Southport was converted.
"He got more sensitive to everything and was snapping a lot," said one guard's wife who spoke on condition of anonymity. She blamed her husband's moodiness on the longer hours -- sometimes 16 hours a day -- that he had been forced to work because of the transfer of 49 of the prison's 255 guards as part of statewide cutbacks.
"We have been a community with a prison for so long that I think for the most part it's been viewed as just another place where people go to work every day," said Mr. Bowman of the Chamber Commerce. "But the disturbance at Southport was a startling and graphic reminder that the prison jobs don't really compare to work in many other places."

HEADLINE: Today's Threat to Peace Is the Guy Down the Street

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SOON after word reached Washington that Rajiv Gandhi had been assassinated in India, President Bush remarked: "I just don't know what the world is coming to." That was a startling comment, coming from a man who only weeks earlier was proclaiming the birth of a new world order in the wake of the gulf war. In a way, though, there was no contradiction. The world is coming to a new order, but it is not the one that President Bush envisaged -- or one that he will have much ability to shape.
The main principle President Bush invoked to justify his opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was that unless international boundaries between sovereign nation states are respected, the alternative is chaos. But the sort of threat posed by Saddam Hussein -- one nation state simply devouring its neighbor -- is increasingly obsolete in world politics today. 
 Instead, what are becoming increasingly common are challenges to the sovereignty and sanctity of nation states from within -- from ethnic, tribal and religious groups dissatisfied with the shape or the content of their nations and ready to use any sort of violence to bring about change.
So it is not the gulf war, but events that have taken place since that really characterize the dominant trend and challenge in the post-cold war world -- the Kurdish drive to split off from Iraq, the assassination of Mr. Gandhi by opponents amid ethnic strife in India, the takover of Ethiopia by secessionist rebels from Eritrea and others seeking to replace Ethiopia's traditional tribal elite. Indeed, it is the same from Yugoslavia to Quebec and from the Soviet Union to South Africa: the predominant threat to stability is conflict within nations and not between them.
"The gulf war is the wave of the past," remarked Michael Mandelbaum, director of East-West studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "India, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia and the breakup of the Soviet Union are the wave of the future.
"Most nation states arose as a result of the breakup of great empires following World War I and World War II," he said. "But the third great cataclysm of this century, the end of the cold war, is shaping up to be a story not so much about the unmaking of empires and the birth of nation states, but the unmaking of nation states that were born earlier in the century."
It is not surprising that the end of the cold war has been accompanied by the fragmentation of some nation states. The cold war not only held together by force such artificial nation states as Yugoslavia; it also enabled regimes in many weak states, such as Ethiopia and Iraq, to strengthen and sustain themselves far longer than they might have otherwise. They accomplished this by getting economic help and diplomatic backing from superpowers eager to bid for their support in the grand contest between East and West.
But those days are over, and life promises to be much more complicated not only for many weak nation states but for the superpowers as well. Generally speaking, the sorts of threats to international stability that the United States is likely to face now -- those coming from within states that are imploding -- will not easily be treated by classic great-power diplomacy. Nor will these threats offer the moral clarity that was available when there was a clear-cut villain or an "Evil Empire" challenging America. They also may not be responsive to brute force.
The NATO allies more or less acknowledged the changed environment last week, when they announced that they were revamping their forces from a massive dam designed to resist a Soviet invasion across Europe, to smaller mobile units better able to put out brush fires ignited by small states or tensions between European ethnic and regional groups.
Standard international relations texts -- including all the classic balance-of-power theories from Clausewitz to Kissinger -- will have to be revised somewhat, to teach statesmen how to improvise for these new challenges. For example, when the United States wanted to get a new Security Council resolution that would dispatch a United Nations police force to protect Kurds wanting to return home, and to replace the American troops, the Soviets and Chinese balked. They said they were afraid that if the United Nations could intervene to protect the Kurds in Iraq, it might later be asked to do the same for the Baltic peoples or those of Tibet. In the end, a murky compromise was cobbled together.
"What I am struck by," said Stanley Hoffmann, a professor of government at Harvard, "is the fact that the world order, or whatever there is of it, is still very much based on state sovereignty, and that is quite inadequate, and indeed dangerous when you consider that many of the most destabilizing troubles are likely to come from within states -- either because of ethnic strife or terrifying repressive measures that governments, like South Africa or the Soviet Union, might take that invite external intervention."
Mr. Hoffmann added: "There is very little in our repertoire of ideas that helps us to cope with such internal disorders. Each time statesmen have opened this Pandora's box of what goes on inside states, they have closed it in horror."
Washington also has less influence in these internal conflicts because in most cases they are going to be decided by small arms, an assassin's bullet or backwoods deals between peoples with whom America has little contact or understanding. If the Soviet republic of Georgia declares its independence tomorrow, with whom will Washington deal?
Moreover, the United States is not only less capable of intervening, but less interested in doing so. In the post-cold war world, when America no longer feels impelled to compete with the Soviet Union for every corner of the globe, it is far less urgent to many people who rules in Ethiopia, or whether it is one country or three.
But in another sense the United States has also acquired new leverage to influence some of these internal contests. This is because America's triumph in the cold war was not a territorial victory but a victory for a set of political and economic principles: democracy and the free market.
Many third-world countries that, in the first flush of independence, rejected capitalism for socialism, have now concluded that the free market is the wave of the future -- a future for which America is both the gatekeeper and the model.
It is precisely this economic leverage that the United States has over the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- whether to grant him everything from food credits to access to international lending agencies -- that enables Washington to press him to open his society more, to give more freedom to the republics and different ethnic groups and to loosen the reins of central economic control.
Call it diplomacy by the Federalist Papers. It is being used in Ethiopia too, where the once-Marxist rebels have gone from preaching Communism to pragmatism. The Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, who has been helping to mediate in the Ethiopian civil war, bluntly told Ethiopia's new leaders: "No democracy, no cooperation."
But such diplomacy by moral and economic suasion has its limits, as last week's anti-American protests in Ethiopia demonstrated. There is no more violent cocktail than ethnic and tribal hatreds combined with uneven economic growth. In an era when there is far more economic advice than resources to implement it, and far more ethnic passions than traditions of pluralism to contain them, there are going to be far more new world disorders than new world orders.

New York's City Workers: Freeloaders or Scapegoats?

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
WHEN Mayor David N. Dinkins outlined his worse-case solution to the city's $3.5 billion budget deficit, he said he was looking to three sources to help ease the crisis: the state, the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the city's labor unions.
With the state's budget more or less in hand and the assistance corporation back on the sidelines, rebuffed by rating agencies when it tried to help, the focus is on the unions. But many people inside and out of the government worry that the unions feel such a deep sense of entitlement that they will be unwilling to contribute in the way that the Mayor clearly hopes. 
 The pressure on them is enormous. The Mayor has asked his legal counsel to prepare legislation that if passed by the state, would enable him to impose furloughs. The business community, emboldened by the panoply of higher taxes it now faces, is urging him to force the municipal unions, which encompass 310,000 members, to sacrifice more.
In a letter to the Mayor last month, the New York City Partnership, a business lobbying group, asked him to impose a wage freeze on city workers for at least the next fiscal year, beginning next month. It also complained about benefits for city employees that it considers inordinate: three weeks of vacation for new employees and 12 days of paid vacation compared with 9 or 10 in the private sector. If the number of vacation days was reduced by two, the group said, the city could save more than $100 million.
Whether it is fair or not, the image of city workers sitting at their desks pushing pencils while raking in handsome salaries and fringe benefits is not an uncommon one. That impression is only heightened by the 30-second sound bites on the evening news in which municipal union leaders frequently come across as blustering and intransigent, seemingly oblivious to the possibility that the public might think the unions should feel some obligation to give some of their wages and benefits back.
 
The Unions' Arguments
 Despite these impressions, the unions have a number of arguments to support their stance. City employees suffered heavily during the last fiscal crisis. Not only did they put almost a third of their pension fund at risk by buying city bonds, but their work force was reduced by about 25 percent and their inflation-adjusted wages fell by about one-sixth, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.
During the 80's, of course, many of the unions got wage increases that helped make up the difference. But even with those increases, the average wage of a nonuniformed union worker has not kept pace with inflation. From 1975 through 1991, inflation was 155 percent, while the average wage rose 130 percent, according to Program Planners Inc., a labor consulting firm. The uniformed workers -- police, firemen, corrections and sanitation staff -- merely stayed level with inflation.
Work conditions for city employees also leave something to be desired. A survey of the city administration that was conducted by a private-sector group in 1989 found workplace overcrowding and lack of ventilation so serious that it concluded, "We have seen many situations which would suggest that an expert review of safety conditions would be beneficial."
Given the difficult conditions that many city workers work in, it is not surprising that union leaders feel their members are more than entitled to what they earn and find the notion that they are under a moral obligation to give something back almost bizarre.
"Why would you ask the teachers -- the classroom teachers -- to subsidize education for children?" said Sandra Feldman, head of the 106,000-member United Federation of Teachers, in a recent televised interview.
Even some who have been highly critical of the city's financial situation do not consider the unions' attitude to be the problem. "I don't think the unions are any more or any less wrapped up in the concept of entitlement than any other group," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.
Stanley Hill, executive director of District 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Unions, said he and his 140,000 members recognize that the city has problems and are more than willing to talk with the administration about ways to save money. It was his union's suggestion that the city suspend all nonessential payments, a city official confirmed. City Hall finally took that step four months later.
James F. Hanley, the acting commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Labor Relations, said that while union leaders sound supportive, "the few times we've scheduled meetings they have not been fruitful."
In a recent report, the Citizens Budget Commission argued that the goal should be a smaller, better-paid, more efficient city work force. If the city replaced only half the workers who left every year of their own accord, the commission said, it could reduce the work force by 20 percent by the mid-90's, annually saving $2.8 billion.
But unless that work force changes how it operates, poorer service would seem inevitable. This emphasis on productivity leads the commission to propose that everything be put on the negotiating table: restrictive work rules as well as wasteful management practices.
The question is whether both sides are going to continue debating the merits of givebacks and deferrals, or whether they will eventually discuss a more fundamental issue: how the city and its work force can deliver services more effectively.

HEADLINE: The World;
Is Iran's Urge to Prosper Overtaking Its Islamic Zeal?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was the Persian version of George Bush's new world order, a crystallizing moment that set forth a guiding postwar vision of the world as seen through the eyes of Iran's leadership. Last week, when 250 Western, Asian and Arab oil officials met in the ancient imperial city of Isfahan, they heard a clear message of Iran's pragmatic approach to its neighbors: When it comes to the economy, the revolution is over.
If there had been any doubt that economics, not revolutionary fervor, is now the driving force behind Iran's domestic and foreign policy, it was dispelled when Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati bluntly told the group that "a new order" is emerging in the world in which "economic considerations overshadow political priorities." If the conference participants had closed their eyes, they might have thought they were listening to the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi. 
 Iran's main problem is that its per capita income is half what it was in the time of the Shah. Even though the drop in oil prices and the devastation left by eight years of war with Iraq account for much of the decline, many ordinary Iranians blame the revolution.
The new approach is a radical departure from the early days of the revolution, when the regime nationalized the banks, forced foreign companies to close and stressed self-sufficiency in agriculture and industry. Now the Government encourages foreign investment and accepts foreign loans, and foreigners are allowed to own up to 49 percent of joint projects and administer the projects themselves. In the last year, the Government has introduced a more realistic exchange rate, sold off shares in many Government-owned companies, moved to eradicate price controls, and increased imports. It even recently started a global campaign to lure Iranian businessmen -- and their capital -- back from exile.
The driving force behind the policy is Iran's President, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, who, as an heir to his family's pistachio-growing and exporting empire, is versed in the ways of the bazaar. Although Mr. Rafsanjani campaigned for the presidency two years ago on a prosperity ticket, it was the war to drive Iraq from Kuwait that substituted Iraq for Iran as the regional pariah and positioned the Iranian leader to portray his country as a reliable and trustworthy partner.
His attempt at old-fashioned state-building dovetails with Iran's determination to play a key role in any future security arrangements in the region; to that end, Iran has moved to re-establish ties with the same regimes it once vowed to throw into history's dustbin. Since the restoration of relations with Saudi Arabia -- at a time when American troops were still there -- the two countries have agreed on a common oil strategy. Iranian pilgrims will attend the hajj in Mecca for the first time since 1987, when Iranian-led demonstrations set off riots that left 400 people dead. Egypt and Iran have arranged for diplomatic representation in each others' capitals. And Iran and Kuwait, which has traditionally been suspicious of Teheran's motives, recently signed a contract for Iranian technicians to extinguish 60 of the oil well fires set by retreating Iraqi troops.
Perhaps the best proof of Iran's new sense of limits was its resistance to what must have been a powerful temptation to take revenge on Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of Iraq's military defeat. There was no Iranian intervention, not even a big demonstration, after the Iraqi regime attacked the holy Shiite Muslim cities of Karbala and Najaf during the short-lived Iraqi civil war. There have been pinprick attacks across the border, but these seem to be nothing more than reminders to Mr. Hussein that he must watch his eastern flank.
The Persian Gulf states seem to feel that they have little to lose in trying to moderate the policies of Iran by embracing it, particularly since Teheran poses no military threat these days. As the country with the longest coastline on the gulf, Iran feels it is destined to play a role in securing the region around those waters, and the gulf Arabs would now prefer to include Iran in security arrangements, rather than have non-gulf regimes like Egypt and Syria station troops on their soil.
For Washington, Iran is still not a country to be trusted. The Bush Administration remains convinced that Teheran holds the key to the release of six American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite groups in Lebanon, the main obstacle to normalizing relations. And the State Department's annual report on patterns of terrorism, released in April, concludes that although the number of incidents of Iranian state-supported terrorism dropped last year, the country's intelligence services have assassinated dissidents and used embassies abroad to finance terrorist groups.
The Iranians botched a golden opportunity to curry favor with Washington when they mishandled American overtures to help the one million Iraqi Kurds who had taken refuge in Iran. Iranians harassed American relief workers, charged foreign relief companies exorbitant fees to land their aircraft and accused the United States of sending them second-hand blankets and clothes. The country's chief spoiler is Ahmed Khomeini, the son of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini; he announced that the American pilots should have been shot after they landed, and he has invoked his father's name in explaining why Iran can never have relations with the Untied States.
The young Khomeini has only a limited constituency, but no Iranian would dare directly attack the son of the late Imam. So his words serve to remind analysts in Washington that whatever movement there has been toward a "new order," for some Iranian leaders the revolution is still alive -- if not as active as it used to be.

HEADLINE: Inattention to Its Neighbors' Fears Could Compound India's Problems

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
THE domestic problems facing India in the wake of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination are enormous: social disorder, political instability and violence, an economic crisis and the uncertainty of the monsoon rains, on which food crops depend. But whoever wins the national elections now rescheduled for mid-June is also going to have to pay careful attention to India's relationships with its neighbors -- particularly Pakistan -- or New Delhi will only compound its domestic woes.
India's turmoil at home is, in many ways, a reflection of the ethnic conflicts tearing at hopes for peace in this and other regions. If New Delhi doesn't mend its prickly relationships with many of its neighbors -- a result of overbearing behavior indulged in for decades -- the tensions could stand in the way of getting needed help from the developed world, and cooperation from its most powerful neighbor and adversary, Pakistan. 
 Over the last two years, the most serious threat to India's domestic integrity has been posed by the secessionist movement that has exploded over the Kashmir Valley, a disputed territory populated mostly by Muslims that straddles the India-Pakistan border.
Alarms have gone off in Washington more than once over this dispute, because India and Pakistan are not only perennially locked in confrontation but are also thought to be capable of turning their antagonism into nuclear war.
Since 1947, the two nations have fought three wars, all of them to one degree or another involving Kashmir. And since the last war, in 1971, India has set off a nuclear explosion and has successfully tested several missile delivery systems. For its part, Pakistan is now barred from receiving American aid because President Bush cannot certify that Islamabad is not developing nuclear arms.
If the ethnic conflict in Kashmir is a threat to India's national integrity, it is also inextricably linked to tensions with Pakistan because Islamabad, almost without trying, has been able to fan the flames of revolt in the valley. No cause is more popular in Pakistan than "free Kashmir," though Islamabad is silent on whether such freedom should also apply to its part of the territory.
To compound the problem India faces, New Delhi can no longer simply cut a deal with Pakistan over the territory without the involvement of the Kashmiris themselves; they are determined to bring this issue back to the United Nations, where resolutions calling for self-determination have been pending for more than 40 years. Members of the British Parliament from the Labor Party have now taken up the issue of Kashmiri rights. New Delhi, however, has never allowed a plebiscite.
In Kashmir, as in the Punjab, human rights violations by Indian military, paramilitary and police forces are beginning to draw the sustained attention of international human rights organizations, creating a new and less obliging environment in the West and Japan for "the world's most populous democracy."
 
A Reputation as a Bully
 And in such a world, less sympathetic to India, new light will inevitably be shed on India's years as South Asia's bully -- an issue that has been put into momentary eclipse by the turmoil at home.
Under the last two Prime Ministers of the Nehru dynasty -- Jawaharlal Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv -- New Delhi played havoc with the stability of its much smaller neighbors. Militants from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were trained and armed here. The small Kingdom of Sikkim was undermined and destroyed by Indian agents. Nepal suffered a crippling economic boycott and Bhutan has had to put up with a large contingent of Indian troops, ostensibly in the country to train the minuscule Bhutanese army.
For decades after the British left in 1947-48, India made the regional rules. If a desperate Bangladesh wanted to convene an international conference on rivers and floods, for example, India said it was a bilateral matter. Now, international organizations and European nations, in particular France, have begun to ignore those limitations and have taken the plight of Bangladesh to the world over the heads of New Delhi's neo-imperialists.
The United States, on the other hand, has always seemed predisposed to allow India a free hand. Sri Lankans say they got a clear message that Washington was not prepared to challenge India's policies in the region, even when Indian aircraft violated Sri Lankan airspace with impunity to drop supplies in rebel areas.
When a mercenary Sri Lankan Tamil band tried to invade the Indian Ocean nation of Maldives in 1988, India rushed in troops and was rewarded by a public pat on the back by Washington. A tremor went through Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.
All around the region, the interrupted elections soon to be completed in India are of immense importance. For about 18 months, with the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi in opposition or behind the scenes instead of in the halls of power, the region has enjoyed a breathing space -- except, perhaps, for Pakistan, which had its own internal turmoil to contend with, in addition to its worries about the course of the insurrection in Kashmir.
But one hope for a lessening of tensions in the region is that Pakistan now has a pragmatic Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is determined to go down in history as the man who modernized his country economically while allowing it to come to terms with its Islamic soul.
Mr. Sharif made his first official trip to India to attend Mr. Gandhi's funeral. He made the most of it, meeting the leader of every major Indian political party, and thus all the potential prime ministers of the country. Islamabad's challenge to India to end hostilities in Kashmir (while giving the people of Kashmir a fair deal) and join hands in developing two of the world's poorest countries is a new one.
This new proposal may flummox the hawks in India's foreign policy establishment. But it could also provide the first chance in decades to talk about something other than war.

HEADLINE: Clash Of '91;
Higher Education Feels the Heat

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
IN laying out his plan to propel American schools into the 21st century, President Bush barely mentioned colleges or universities. But that doesn't mean everything is all right on the nation's campuses. In the absence of any strategy for coupling an improvement in higher education with the reform of elementary and secondary schools, there is plenty of evidence, much of it provided by the Administration itself, that there is a fundamental rethinking about what colleges do and how they ought to do it.
The splendid seclusion of the university has been shattered by a barrage of criticism, both from within and outside. Nothing seems settled anymore -- not the tradition of learning, nor the system of admissions on merit. 
 Should college be the liberal education based on the Great Books that Allan Bloom stubbornly supports, or, as envisioned by a new generation of administrators represented by Marguerite Ross Barnett, president of the University of Houston, should it be the scientific crucible that will help the nation's economy in the next century?
Much of the friction arises from the contrast between the romanticized, ivy-covered vision of what college once represented, and the raw, boisterous and disruptive experience it is today. Once provinces of white male privilege, the universities now more accurately reflect society, with all its tensions, conflicts and outbursts of bad blood.
In this year of war, many campuses were rocked not by political agitation as in the 1960's but by nagging doubts about the nature and worth of a college education.
The turmoil has made the campus less a retreat from reality than an immersion in it. The average tenure of a public college president is now less than four years. The overwhelming majority of faculty members retire before reaching the mandatory age of 70. And students have grown increasingly discontent. Diversity has bred divisions and alliances by minority grouping. And there is no escape from complex politics on campus, the forum for the debate over "political correctness" and whether it stifles free speech.
 
A 'Loss of Confidence'
 The academic year just ending has seen an outpouring of critiques of higher education -- the way it does business and its relationship with government.
"Such criticism reflects a profound skepticism and a loss of confidence," said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and a former United States Commissioner of Education. "People are no longer willing to grant colleges and universities the unchallenged right to stand above public judgment."
Stanford University is accused of padding Federal research expense accounts with inappropriate charges like cedar closets and sailing yachts. The elite members of the Ivy League, charged with antitrust violations, have agreed not to collaborate on student aid. Lamar Alexander, the new Secretary of Education, is questioning the standards used by private regional agencies that accredit colleges and universities.
But perhaps a stronger clue to the Bush Administration's thinking about higher education is its plan, disclosed last week, to revise its student financial aid program to heavily favor students from poor families over those in the middle class.
The plan calls for restructuring the largest student grant program -- the so-called Pell grants -- which provides $5.3 billion in aid to 3.4 million students. The maximum amount of a grant would rise from $2,400 to $3,700 but eligibility standards would be tightened so that 400,000 fewer grants would be awarded each year for all families earning less than the $35,000 cutoff. Generally, students from families with the lowest incomes would receive most of the grants, with the amount of each grant depending on income and the cost of tuition.
The plan underscores a division over whether Federal policy on student aid should favor middle-class students, who have a range of college options, or the poorest students, who often have little choice but to attend a community college or public university.
Mr. Alexander said he wants to concentrate aid on the lower-income students, "where it will do the most," and leave middle-income students to borrow more money to pay tuition or to lower their expectations and forgo private universities for less expensive state and community colleges.
For years the number of high school graduates heading for college has been flagging. At the same time, the number of minority students in the high schools has increased. By the year 2000, a third of all elementary and high school students are expected to come from minority groups, making this pool of students even more important to the future of post-secondary education.
Most colleges realize that to survive they will need to attract and keep this new type of student, who often comes with greater educational and economic needs than the typical students of years past.
Congressional leaders opposed to the new financial aid plan call it an attempt to turn higher education into a poverty program, and many educators, including Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, said it moves in the wrong direction because middle-income families need more help, not less.
Some recent developments point to a changing perception of colleges and universities -- from institutions beyond reproach to aggressive enterprises to be regulated and watched. The result seems to be a re-examination of the longstanding partnership between the Federal Government and higher education.
Unlike other countries, the United States has never directly supported a system of national universities; the financing of higher education is generally left to the states and to private interests. But the benefits of a first-class system -- originally thought to consist of trained ministers, capable political leaders and responsible citizen-voters -- were so desirable that indirect support has always been deemed warranted.
During the Civil War, the Federal Government provided land for the first public colleges. During World War II, the Government first employed universities for scientific research. The post-war period also brought the G.I. Bill of Rights, which put millions of veterans in school.
Neither Government nor the universities are eager to classify the relationship a partnership, preferring the semblance of independence, but the reliance is substantial. Federal assistance -- including appropriations, grants and contracts -- has grown from less than $39 million at the beginning of World War II to $13 billion today.
The first cracks in this solidarity may have appeared during the anti-war protests of the 1960's, but they found a special voice in the mid-1980's with the attacks by William J. Bennett, then the Secretary of Education. Mr. Bennett lampooned Harvard, Stanford and other prestigious universities for caving in to the demands of students who wanted to ditch traditional studies for what were, in his opinion, faddish courses.
Mr. Bennett's remarks seemed to signal an open season on colleges. Critics emerged, like Prof. Allan Bloom of the University of Chicago, whose book "The Closing of the American Mind" chronicled the fall of higher education.
While the prestigious private universities took much of the heat during this time, state universities grew larger, stronger and more sophisticated. They also were becoming increasingly expensive as tuition had to be raised to pay for their expansion. The spiral seemed to break this year as some of the largest and most respected public university systems, including those in California and Massachusetts, were forced to scale back substantially.
Congress, meanwhile, seems to be getting impatient with higher education. Recent legislation requires colleges and universities to report campus crime, graduation rates of athletes and, in the wake of the Stanford research cost allegations, Congress is likely to impose a new, stricter system of compensating universities for the research they do.
Even though the actions of his department and the Administration seem to be taking away some of the schools' automomy and imposing a more rigid view of how colleges should be run, Mr. Alexander, a former governor of Tennessee and more recently the president of the University of Tennessee, says he is concerned about such intrusion. Sounding more like a university administrator than a voice of the Administration he has been with for just two months, Mr. Alexander said he would rather see the relationship between higher education and the Federal Government kept at arm's length.
"It's beginning to look a lot like meddling," Mr. Alexander said. "And that's not a good trend."

HEADLINE: Poverty, Not Politics, Drives Cubans Out Now

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 1

 BODY:
When his only income dried up, money from the sale of secondhand clothes sent to him by relatives in the United States, Juan Alfredo Molenillo Grenup decided that he had had enough of spartan life in Cuba and set out in desperation on a raft for Florida.
Three days later, after being picked up by boaters off the Florida Keys, Mr. Molenillo had arrived, joining more than 600 other Cubans who have escaped their country on makeshift vessels this year in the largest wave of refugees from the island since the Mariel boatlift in 1980. 
 But while many of the hundreds of thousands of Cubans who fled after Fidel Castro's Communist revolution in 1959 spoke of political motives for their flight, today's boat people talk of a stark austerity they say has begun to make life unbearable for many.
Though they still complain of a lack of freedoms in Cuba, today's boat people dwell with grim detail on an existence without necessities, from underwear to soap and medicines, that has taken hold since the collapse of Communist partners in Europe.
Andrew Zimbalist, an expert on the Cuban economy at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., said the country's per capita income had shrunk by 5 to 7 percent in 1990, adding, "We are looking at a similar decline for this year."
In recent months, as Mr. Castro's Government has tightened the nation's belt as part of an adjustment program, refugees say that even supplying a healthy diet has become a struggle for most Cuban families.
"For three months, we had eaten no meat," said Mr. Molenillo, a 36-year-old laid-off welder, interviewed along with half a dozen other recent arrivals at a detention center of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami, where they waited for their papers to be processed. "Without food, there was nothing to do but leave."
"In March, I traveled to Oriente, and people there told me they had been washing themselves with plain water because there was no soap," he said, referring to Cuba's eastern province. "I told them it had been three months since we have seen socks in Havana. We laughed and cried together."
In the past Cuba's Coast Guard aggressively patrolled the island's waters against escapees. But recent refugees report that Cuba's efforts to prevent flight by small boats, rafts and inner tubes has all but ended.
"There are so many people putting out to sea nowadays that the one or two patrols they have cannot really hope to stop them," said Mr. Molenillo, who left a wife and two children behind when he fled the island. "In any event, they don't seem to have much gas."
Economists say supplies of petroleum products from the Soviet Union have fallen sharply and deliveries have become irregular in the last year, largely a consequence of that country's own growing economic disorder.
The skin still wrinkled and peeling on his face from the exposure to the sun, Julio Lazar Rodriguez Siscard, 24, who drove a bus in Havana until his route was suspended, also spoke of hardships.
"Just basic products, clothes, you can't get anymore," said Mr. Rodriguez, who left Cuba on a raft, arriving in Key West with two brothers and three friends three days later.
Like several other refugees, Mr. Rodriguez castigated the "system" in Cuba, but spoke mainly of poverty and frustrated material desires. "What can I do with that?" he asked dismissively of the 350-peso monthly salary he said he was paid until he was laid off. "Find the bare necessities if I am lucky, nothing more."
Mr. Rodriguez's salary was considerably better than the average of about 195 pesos a month, or about $175. But with store shelves empty and almost all staple foods rationed, even many with relatively high wages have begun to look for ways out of the country.
"Our system is not something with a future," said Jorge Luis Torres Morales, a 25-year-old employee of a Havana food processing plant who arrived by small boat in May. "I made 350 pesos a month. That is not bad compared to some, but even if you work five years, you have nothing to show for it. A simple pair of pants, if you can find them, costs 50 pesos."

HEADLINE: Compromise Clears Way for Virginia Power Plant

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
The National Park Service and two electrical power companies announced Friday an unusual environmental compromise that will help clear the way for construction of a coal-fired power plant in Virginia, provided that an existing plant reduces air pollution that is threatening the Shenandoah National Park.
Park Service officials and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., along with power company officials, hailed the compromise as a "significant new pollution-reduction agreement" that would protect the environment and still permit industrial development. 
 But Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat whose House Subcommitee on Health and Environment monitors pollution issues, called the compromise "an outrageous paper sham." He said it was vaguely written without any enforcement teeth and asserted that the Park Service had been forced to accept it by White House officials more concerned with company profits than the environment.
An environmental group that has opposed the plant, the Southern Environmental Law Center of Charlottesville, Va., questioned whether the agreement was broad enough. Center officials warned that they would challenge the compromise in court if it proved to have shortcomings.
 
Park Service Took Tough Stand
 The agreement, reached with the Virginia Power company and the Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, provides that the utilities may construct a new coal-fired generating plant in south-central Virginia so long as there is a reduction in pollution flowing from an old plant situated north of Shenandoah Park in West Virginia. The reduction is to be 1.1 times greater at the old plant than emissions from the new plant, and discussion may be reopened if Park Service officials conclude that the reduction is not achieved.
The agreement came about after the Park Service took an aggressive anti-pollution step and decided to actively oppose construction of the $1.2 billion electric plant rather than simply express concerns about pollution.
Park officials argued that the plant would add to industrial and urban pollution that is slowly killing the northern Virginia park that stretches 85 miles along the Blue Ridge Mountains and is famed for its cliff-hugging Skyline Drive. They said the pollution, much of from sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants that falls to the earth as acid rain, was poisoning trout streams, searing trees and shrubs, clouding vistas and endangering the health of park visitors.
 An agency of the Interior Department, the Park Service had previously expressed concern about air pollution in a number of its parks, including Shenandoah, the Great Smokies on the Tennessee-North Carolina border and the Grand Canyon. But until it opposed the Virginia plant, it had avoided taking a stand that could affect the pace of industrial development, leaving such portentous action to the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
White House Pressure Denied
 The agreement is the kind encouraged by the Clean Air Act and the Bush Administration on the theory that trade-offs in pollution emissions achieve both environmental and economic goals. Spokesmen for the Interior Department and the power company said the White House kept close watch on the negotiations that led to the agreement. But they denied that there was any undue pressure on the Park Service to reach a compromise so that the power companies could avoid costly construction delays.
"The agreement resulted from negotiations, not pressure," said Carl F. Baab of Virginia Power.
Power company officials said they hoped work could start on the plant shortly. But they expressed concern over delays, should the agreement with the Park Service be challenged in court.
David W. Carr Jr., a lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said his organization would study the details of the agreement over the weekend and then determine whether there would be a challenge.

HEADLINE: North Korea to Earth: Coming Back

 BODY:
North and South Korea are now both set to assume full United Nations membership this fall, following Pyongyang's reluctant decision to submit its own separate application. That's a welcome sign in one of the last corners of the cold war. By responding promptly, the U.S. can help encourage a wider thaw.
The North's move is a pragmatic response to the South's courtship of Moscow and Beijing. It offers Washington an excellent chance to upgrade its own discussions with Pyongyang. They have a lot to talk about, from de-nuclearizing the peninsula to ending Pyongyang's dangerous isolation. 
 Koreans long for reunification. Their 46-year division interrupts more than a millennium of shared history. But the two Governments differ over what a united Korea would look like. Each naturally sees its own society as the model.
Seoul has tried to move Pyongyang closer to its own positions by reaching out to the Soviet Union and China, long North Korea's main allies. Moscow and Beijing both want South Korean investment. Seoul and Moscow now have diplomatic ties. China's economic relations with the South have blossomed; diplomatic relations may follow.
The Soviets and Chinese insist that better relations with Seoul have not come at the expense of the North. But the improved ties made it unlikely that Seoul's U.N. application would be vetoed. Pyongyang has now bowed to this new diplomatic reality.
South Korea correctly notes that separate U.N. seats did not prevent reunification of the two Germanys. That precedent of Communist collapse brings no joy to North Korea's orthodox Stalinist rulers. It's in America's interest to assuage Pyongyang's bitterness and help make its policy shift a source of new momentum for regional detente.
North Korea's nuclear program remains a source of justifiable worry. Pyongyang has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but has long resisted full international inspections, demanding that the U.S. first withdraw its own nuclear weapons from South Korea and renounce any intention to use them against the North. Last week, Pyongyang offered to begin talking about inspections.
North Korea has no right to demand concessions in return for what it is already obliged to do. But the U.S. can assure South Korea's security just as well with offshore nuclear weapons. And anything that would subject North Korea's nuclear installations to inspection would actually enhance South Korean security. Why not test Pyongyang's good faith by withdrawing a few U.S. nuclear weapons from Korean soil?
By applying for U.N. membership, Pyongyang has taken a clear step away from self-isolation. That step, however reluctant, warrants a constructive U.S. response.

Idea Gunslingers . . .

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Bush Administration bureaucrats are not enthusiastic about grand plans for big Western bucks to aid Soviet reforms. They say they need more details. There's a surprise.
 The bureaucrats -- diplomats, political appointees or civil servants -- are pessimistic about the Soviet capacity to reform. Aren't we all? 
 They are also doubtful that the U.S. and others can produce the necessary money. Nothing like a good doubt when it comes to cash.
 The last time the national security bureaucracy transcended doubts and pessimism about big ideas was in 1947. Then, in the flash of weeks, State Department bureaucrats fashioned the Truman Doctrine to contain Communism and the Marshall Plan to provide aid to Western Europe.
 Now, almost 45 years later, and with the threat to peace coming from Soviet weakness and not Soviet strength, the bureaucrats mostly wring their hands. Now, when aides say President Bush may well be interested in a new big idea to ward off chaos once again, Administration experts want to wait and see.
 Into this vacuum leaped two intellectual entrepreneurs: Grigory Yavlinsky, a Soviet economist and former Minister of the Russian Republic; and Graham Allison, a Harvard political scientist and former dean of its Kennedy School. They had an idea -- that the West and Moscow share a vital interest in promoting political pluralism and market reforms in the Soviet Union, and that they need a common plan to encourage quick and hard decisions in Moscow.
 The two principal framers of this scheme are actually a pair of idea gunslingers, the type the bureaucracy loves to squash or assign to policy planning staffs.
 Grigory Yavlinsky, acclaimed for his Western-style economic skills, sounds like the next-generation Russian politician, a man with plans he would like to implement himself. He is preparing himself to talk to people, not bureaucrats. Asked last week about Soviet investment policy, he answered: "In order to invest it is necessary to have money, and we have neither money nor pockets."
 Graham Allison is part scholar and part salesman. Not content with just having an idea, he always wants to sell it. He can open Democratic and Republican doors. That makes him a good counterpart for Mr. Yavlinsky, who seems to be representing both Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.
 For a month now the Allison-Yavlinsky duo and their impressive binational brain trust have been germinating a plan. It starts with the premise that a complete fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the reversion of its parts to authoritarianism could have catastrophic consequences: several Soviet republics with nuclear arms, locked in power struggles with each other and their neighbors. Refugees flooding into Eastern Europe, unsettling those fragile countries.
 Many Pentagon and White House officials downplay these alarms. Fortunately, State Department and C.I.A. bureaucrats take the risks most seriously. But the experts and their bosses preoccupy themselves with smaller decisions like whether to provide $1.5 billion in new food export credits or whether to invite Mr. Gorbachev to the West's economic summit talks.
 The Allison-Yavlinsky team sees these issues as sideshows. To them, nothing less than a great vision and a comprehensive joint blueprint can help a dying yet dangerous empire make the transition to democracy and free enterprise. To them, Moscow will not make tough choices without the prospect of help along the way. And they are right.
 They are also hardheaded and practical to advance their vision in stages, with Western aid dependent at each stage on Soviet performance. No performance, no money. (They should also insist on replacing Communist functionaries with reformers.) They have not officially revealed the price tag, but expect between $15 billion and $30 billion yearly, mostly for consumer goods and infrastructure, over five years.
 That is a small coin to implant freedoms, diminish Soviet military spending (one of the conditions) and forestall the potential costs of chaos on the Eurasian continent.
 Bureaucrats in Washington and Moscow will tarry on the sidelines of such great threats and opportunities. At such moments, great leaders will ignore them and embrace the intellectual gunslingers.

HEADLINE: Strong City Council, Strong Smell

 BODY:
Councilman Robert Dryfoos has now stepped aside as chairman of two influential New York City Council committees pending an investigation of his financial affairs. His troubles suggest two urgent tasks for the Council.
One is to devise ethical safeguards to match the Council's enhanced powers over the budget and real estate development. An intriguing first step has been taken by Council Speaker Peter Vallone with his proposal to require financial background checks for members being considered to head committees. 
 The other task is for all members of the Council running in this fall's special election to join the city's new campaign financing system.
The voluntary system, expressly designed to minimize conflicts of interest, offers public matching funds to candidates who accept strict limits on private fund-raising and enhanced public disclosure. More than 200 challengers for the 51 seats on next year's expanded Council have signed up.
Astoundingly, however, only 16 of the Council's 35 incumbents have agreed to participate. Among them is Mr. Vallone. But as the roster on the right shows, others whose leadership duties could attract special-interest money are conspicuously absent.
Council members who don't sign up will escape the law's disclosure and auditing provisions, thereby depriving voters of crucial information about who's bankrolling Council campaigns and buying influence with city government.
Participation in the system does not guarantee integrity. It didn't deter Mr. Dryfoos, for example, from establishing a special fund, ostensibly to cover office expenses, and then using it for personal purposes. But the system is a giant improvement over lax state rules. The next step toward Council credibility is to extend the deadline for joining the program -- and for Mr. Vallone to make clear that participation is a prerequisite for leadership jobs.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND SOVIETS BRIDGE GAP ON CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS AND PLAN FOR SUMMIT SOON;
Soviets' Real Issue: Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
In clearing away the last obstacles to the treaty reducing nonnuclear forces in Europe, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has today sent another strong signal that he wants to focus on what for him is a real life or death issue: economic assistance from the West.
The increasingly desperate requirements of the Soviet leader for Western economic help bring with them both opportunities and demands for the Bush Administration. The opportunities are for Washington to squeeze the Soviets for as many concessions on arms control as possible, while at the same time pressing Mr. Gorbachev to undertake economic reforms far more sweeping than he is now prepared to consider. 
 But there are also limits on how far Mr. Bush can push the Soviet leader, because the Administration is committed to his political survival at home, and also, the European allies are likely to press Washington not to shove Mr. Gorbachev over a cliff.
In his meeting with a group of Soviet citizens in the Kazahk Republic on Thursday, Mr. Gorbachev all but confirmed his vulnerable predicament, saying: "Some people state that the results of our foreign policy activity mean a strategic defeat. It is being asked now why the President is engaged in the foreign policy so much? We need favorable conditions now that we have embarked on profound reforms."
Mr. Gorbachev added that arms control agreements that meet Soviet military doctrines are necessary to "reduce the military spending, and make our economy, overburdened with military affairs, turn to human interests."
 
Focus Shifts to Strategic Arms
 What he might have added was that without completing agreement on the conventional arms treaty on essentially American terms, there was a slimmer chance of talking to Mr. Bush at a summit meeting, where the Soviet leader could intensify his appeal for Western economic aid.
But if Mr. Gorbachev becomes more desperate, the cautious Mr. Bush will find himself under more pressure to make stronger demands on Moscow.
For instance, now that the conventional arms treaty is out of the way Mr. Gorbachev seems eager to remove the other obstacle to a summit -- the uncompleted strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start. So, too, does Mr. Bush. As a result, the Soviet leader might be ready to show a little more flexibility on the last remaining technical issues holding up the treaty.
But in the view of many arms control experts, the real problem in the Start talks is not the Soviets but the Americans. These experts say that because of internal differences, officials in the Administrationcannot agree on what positions to adopt in the endgame of negotiations.
Indeed, many Western diplomats complain that the White House has consistantly evinced a great deal of ambivalence about the Start treaty and that the President, caught between conflicting advice, is now going to have to finally make up his mind about where he stands on the treaty and to fight the necessary beauracratic fights to get it done. Is he ready?
"The Soviets interestingly enough are saying that we need a Start agreement," a senior Administration official said. "They have been complaining that we've lost religion on Start."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that negotiators would now resume work immediately on a "much more intensive basis than before" to try to settle the remaining Start issues, so this treaty slashing nuclear superpower nuclear arsenals by one-third can also be signed at a summit in June or July.
But Administration officials added that if it appeared that they could not resolve the remaining differences, there still might be a Bush-Gorbachev meeting, but probably a much shorter, lower-key affair.
The same two-way pressures also apply in the economic realm. A Soviet delegation -- led by Yevgeny Primakov, one of Mr. Gorbachev's chief economic advisers, and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a private economist -- spent the last week in Washington getting the reaction of the President, his aides and the International Monetary Fund to some of Mr. Gorbachev's latest ideas for reforming the Soviet economy.
 
$30 Billion Mentioned
 Although Mr. Primakov did not ask Mr. Bush for money, Reuters reported that he had told officials of the I.M.F. that Moscow would need between $30 billion and $50 billion in foreign finance a year over the next five to six years if its economic reform program is to succeed.
Senior Administration officials literally scoffed at such numbers, for two reasons. First, there is no way the West would ever be able to come up with such levels of assistance, but more important, it is absurd, they say, to even talk about any figures until the Soviets have a clear-cut, workable reform plan in hand. The problem with Mr. Primakov's mission was that it revealed that the Soviet leadership, while it is now talking about moving to a free market, still wants to do it initially through central planning and control.
Mr. Yavlinsky, who has been working with a team of Harvard-based economists on a more sweeping reform program, right now has only a tenuous connection with Mr. Gorbachev. One of the messages that the President sent back to Moscow with Mr. Primakov was that Mr. Yavlinsky's approach is the right one and that the more he and economists like him are brought into the Kremlin, the more credibility Soviet reform proposals will have.
But what if on the next visit Mr. Yavlinsky arrives as Mr. Gorbachev's chief economist? That is when things could get very interesting for Mr. Bush, who will have to decide how far he is ready to go in aiding the Soviets, how far he feels the American taxpayers are ready to go and what the implications will be for the Western alliance if he wants to go slow and key allies, such as Germany and France, want to push faster?
As Jeffrey Sachs, one of the Harvard economists advising Mr. Yavlinsky said, the President has said there will be no help without Soviet reforms first, "but he has not spelled out what help there will be if there are Soviet reforms."
Already the Democrats are joining this issue, with House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, asking last week whether it would not in the long run be a lot cheaper for the American taxpayer to spend a few billion dollars a year to prompt the Soviets to make specific economic and political reforms that will make them a more open, democratic and less dangerous adversary?
Already, in an effort to deflect such pressures and to shape the coming debate, Administration officials are letting their limits be known.
"If you are talking about a grand bargain in which on one day they say we're going to do X things and we hand them a suitcase of money, that's impossible," a senior Administration official said. "If we're talking about something that's almost like an arms control process, in which we're doing confidence building measures, giving Western assistance in return for genuine reforms, that we can sell to our taxpayers, we're not dismissing that."

Akers Rattles a Few Cages at Buttoned-Down I.B.M. 

Rarely does the International Business Machines Corporation reveal its inner workings to the world. But last week it did when the contents of a tough speech given to a group of managers by John Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, leaked out. It was an accident, the company said. Initially, investors did not like what they saw. I.B.M.'s stock dipped to $104.25 from $105.12 while the market rallied to new highs. Later, investors had a change of heart. The speech showed Mr. Akers struggling to do exactly what Wall Street wants: toughen up the company's country-club culture. According to the notes of the speech, Mr. Akers said I.B.M. had "too many people standing around the water cooler." Mr. Akers also said he would tolerate no further loss of market share. By the end of the week, the tough talk sank in. Big Blue's stock closed on Friday at $106.12. The only question now is whether the accidental release happened on purpose.
 
A Fast Train for Texas?
 
Japan's bullet trains cruise at 150 miles per hour and France's TGV -- for Train a Grande Vitess -- was clocked at 320 m.p.h. American coaches lumber along at less than 100 m.p.h. That may change. Last week, the Texas High-Speed Rail Authority voted to award GEC Alshom of Paris -- the builder of the TGV -- and the Morrison Knudsen Corporation of Boise, Idaho, a construction company, a contract to build a 200 m.p.h. rail line between Dallas and Houston by 1998. San Antonio would be added later, creating a 620-mile triangle. There is one catch: The consortium has to raise its own money to build the system, at a hefty estimated cost of $5.7 billion. So far, the companies have just $167 million in capital. Will they be able to raise the rest? "There is a feeling of confidence that the TGV consortium can pull it together," said Steven Polunsky the Texas High Speed Rail Authority.
 
Macy's Inexplicable Strategy
 
R. H. Macy & Company has big plans. The retailing chain figures if it opens 11 new stores over the next five years it can increase sales from $2.2 billion last year to $3.6 billion. That is a gain of 41.6 percent. It also wants to invest in technology and a new advertising campaign. Very aggressive actions in such a sluggish market. The trouble is, Macy's has little cash -- less than at any time since a leveraged buyout took it private in 1986. And it has a storeroom full of debt, $3.4 billion. It is losing money too -- $100.9 million last quarter -- as sales slide and margins thin. This has the analysts scratching their heads about Macy's plans. They are concerned about opening new stores "I am concerned about Macy's acceleration of store openings at a time when it is so important to gain existing-store productivity." said Walter F. Loeb an independent analysts in New York. The big store's creditors are getting nervous.
 
A Disney Bails Out L.A. Gear
 
L.A. Gear Inc., the athletic footwear maker, grew quickly by spotting fads on the playground. But now it's stumbling badly. It lost $12.5 million in the first quarter on sales of $171 million on top of losing $9.1 million in the final quarter last year. L.A. Gear's creditors, jittery from the losses, cut its credit line to $300 million from $360 million. The company needed cash. Last week it got it. Roy E. Disney, said he would buy 30 percent of the sneaker company for $100 million. The deal is the first for Trefoil Capital Investors, a $450 million investment fund formed by Mr. Disney's firm, Shamrock Capital Advisers Inc. of Burbank, Calif., to rescue ailing companies. In exchange for the money, Mr. Disney gets control of the compay's operating plan.
 
Ameritech Spruces Up
 
The Ameritech Corporation, based in Chicago, provides local telephone service in five Midwestern states. Pretty ho-hum, as businesses go, but a good provider of cash. Last week the company decided to dump its dowdy image and said it would buy Cybertel for $512 million from JMB Reality of Chicago and its partners. Cybertel is one of two companies providing cellular telephone service in St. Louis. Analysts think Ameritech cut a good deal. It will pay $195 for each "pop" -- slang for a cellular customer. Prices have been as high as $350. Best of all, Cybertel has only 40,000 customers, plenty of room for growth. That gives Ameritech's image an overhaul.
 
A Challenge to T.W.A.
 
To pare down some of its $2.7 billion in debt, Trans World Airlines Inc., sold its routes to London to American Airlines for $445 million. Last week the sale was put in doubt. The city of St. Louis, T.W.A.'s hub and its unions asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal to reverse the sale. The challenge is moot, T.W.A.'s lawyers said. The deal is already done.
 
T.W.A. negotiated a deal to buy back some of its debt from Connecticut National Bank at 77.5 cents on the dollar. The bank was threatening threatening to reposses 10 airplanes and 62 engines.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Resistance to Favoring China
 
ast week, President Bush told the graduating class at Yale University that he would renew China's trade privileges for another year. But he added a disclaimer. He was trying to "chart a course through a world of lesser evils," he said. Maybe so, but getting Congress to agree that China is a "lesser evil," will not be easy. Three measures have already been introduced to revoke China's most-favored-nation status, which grants its goods low tariffs. China has not changed policies since 1989 when it cracked down on political activity, the bills' authors say. To mollify Congress, Mr. Bush said exports of supercomputers, missiles and nuclear technology would be restricted. Not enough to stop a fight in Congress. "The issue is joined," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. Mr. Bush may lose the fight.
 
A Reward for Egypt
 
uring the gulf war, Egypt's crippled economy lost billions of dollars. But now it is being rewarded for having joined the fight against Iraq. The United States and other Western creditors agreed last week to forgive $20.2 billion of Egypt's Government debt -- almost half of Egypt's $50 billion in debt. Welcome relief for this struggling nation. But what will follow forgiveness? Most economist say more borrowing.
 
Primakov on a Mission
 
Yevgeny M. Primakov, the wily Soviet envoy who tried (and failed) to get Saddam Hussein to quit the war, saw President Bush last week. He said he thinks Washington will come up with $1.5 billion in credits so the Soviet Union can buy grain. The Administration is not so sure. It wants to see a reform plan for the Soviet economy it can believe in. So far it has not. The last plan called for more (not less) central control. Precisely the wrong direction. The latest plan, Mr. Primakov said, will do the opposite. But it is not quite finished. The Administration wants to see more before it gives the nod.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Good News, With a Caveat
 
There was optimism but it was tinctured with a dash of gloom. Sales of existing homes were up 3.4 percent for April, the third increase in a row according to the National Association of Realtors. The Commerce Department confirmed the good news. Sales of new homes climbed 1.2 percent in April. These figures indicate the housing slump may have reached its final days. But the Mortgage Bankers Association cast some doubt. It said 4.95 percent of the nation's homeowners were at least 30 days late on their mortgage payments in the first quarter, a sign that tough times remain. The delinquencies rate was 4.71 percent in the fourth quarter. Before the recession hit, the rate was 4.41 percent. Rising delinquencies mean future foreclosures -- bad news for the nation's home lenders. "The economy is staging a recovery," said Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "But we don't expect it to be terribly strong."
 
The Factory-Orders Omen
 
Factory orders rose 1.8 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department, the first increase in six months. Spending increased for both durable and nondurable goods. It was a better showing than most analysts had expected and followed declines of 2.9 percent in March and 0.6 percent in February. The new figures, released last week, show that inventories are shrinking and companies are ordering new goods. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, last month said an increase in factory orders would indicate that the economy is turning around. But economists caution the lag can be long between a pickup in orders and employment growth.

The G.N.P. Inches Back
 
The gross national product fell by 2.6 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. Everybody already knew that. But they did not know that the G.N.P. was down two-tenths of 1 percent less than the department's original estimate. The recession may be deep, but it's no Grand Canyon. Even better, the Commerce Department reported that corporate profits in the first quarter fell less than in the two preceding quarters. They were down three-tenths of 1 percent following declines of 1.9 percent and 3.9. The recession may have reached its nadir.

Hope From Consumers
 
Consumer spirits remain up, but they are not as buoyant as before. "We got dancing in the streets when the war was over," said Fabien Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "That is giving way to a somewhat more sober assessment." Nothing to worry about -- so far. Confidence, which is measured by a survey of current attitudes and future expectations is still in what analysts call the "hopeful range." That means consumers are willing to spend.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Love and Hate in Black and White

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman, the author of "Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and Their High School," is writing a book about a black church in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
"Jungle Fever," Spike Lee's new film, opens with a still photograph of Yusuf K. Hawkins, the black teen-ager killed by a white mob in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn two summers ago. But if the screen had remained blank, the memory of that murder would have suffused "Jungle Fever" just as palpably, for it explores the nexus of race, sex and place that in one instance cost a 16-year-old innocent his life and in a broader historical scheme has tormented America for centuries. After touching these issues to both serious and comic effect in his earlier work, Mr. Lee with this latest film has driven to their core.
Hawkins was not shot, after all, because he crossed the line into a white neighborhood; he was shot because he was mistaken for being the companion of a local girl who was considered a pariah for dating blacks and Hispanics. And in the art Mr. Lee has forged from reality, the threatening prospect of interracial intimacy is embodied by Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes), a married architect, and Angie Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), the temporary secretary who becomes his lover. 
 What begins as a standard-issue office affair, with late nights over Chinese take-out leading to desktop consummation, evolves by its racial nature into an affront to two families and two communities, Flipper's Harlem and Angie's Bensonhurst. When the pair begin living together midway through the film, it is less as willing mates than fellow traitors, and when they uncouple toward the end, Flipper says, "I give up. It's not worth it. I don't love you and I doubt seriously you ever loved me . . . . Love-can-overcome-everything . . . is only in Walt Disney movies, and I've always hated Disney movies."
Those words come as much from Mr. Lee as from the character. Even before "Jungle Fever" had its world premiere last month at the Cannes International Film Festival, he had said its purpose was to inspect and thereby demolish the sexual stereotypes of the black man as stud nonpareil and the white woman as beauty incarnate. But as he acknowledged in a recent interview -- in anticipation of the film's opening this Friday -- his concerns extend beyond the affair to its volatile, even violent consequences.
"I hate this whole Hollywood process of breaking down a movie to one sentence," he said. "My films don't deal with one theme. They interweave many different things. You have to think. I'm not saying interracial relationships are impossible. Flipper and Angie are not meant to represent every interracial couple in the world. They are meant to represent two people who got together because of sexual mythology instead of love. Then they stay together because they're pushed together. They're outcasts. And since their relationship isn't based on love, when things get tough, they can't weather the storm."
The sexual politics of race (or the racial politics of sex) has been a recurrent issue throughout Mr. Lee's career. "School Daze," his 1988 satire on an all-black college similar to his own alma mater, Morehouse, turned the friction centered on color into a pointed burlesque. The college's women divided into two camps, the dark "Jigaboos" and the fair "Wannabees," who taunted each other in one scene with the epithets "pickaninny," "Barbie doll," "tar baby" and "high-yellow heifer." The anti-apartheid activist who was the film's hero selected a dark girlfriend at least partly to establish his black nationalist credentials.
For exposing that color seam to white audiences, and so contravening the ideal of black unity, Mr. Lee received no small criticism from African-Americans. Not that it dissuaded him from raising the matter again and again. In "Do the Right Thing," the white owner of a pizzeria (Danny Aiello) treated a much younger black woman (Joie Lee) with affection that hovered ambiguously between paternalism and lechery. A black pianist's white girlfriend was the object of ridicule by his fellow musicians in "Mo' Better Blues." And Malcolm X, the subject of Mr. Lee's next film, spoke frequently about issues of color and appearance, whether castigating blacks for straightening their hair or wishing aloud he could drain the white blood from his veins, coming as it had from the rape of his maternal grandmother.
"You might call those sketches," Mr. Lee said of the scenes in his earlier films. "I really started thinking about 'Jungle Fever' while we were doing 'Mo' Better Blues.' I thought it was time to go back to the No. 1 problem in America -- racism -- but to try to broaden the canvas from 'Do the Right Thing.' That was about race alone. This is about race, sex, class, drugs -- and that's a more combustible mixture."
It is also about history. Ossie Davis, playing a retired minister who is Flipper's father, gives a speech that recalls the rape of black slaves by white masters and alludes to the case of Emmett Till, a 15-year-old black lynched for whistling at a white woman in Mississippi. "It really has to do with sexual inadequacy," Mr. Lee said, speaking of such violence. "If you look at the cases of black men who got lynched, they usually got castrated, too. There's something about black men being with white women that threatens white men. And that's why Yusuf Hawkins was killed."
It was in the fall of 1989, in the months immediately after the shooting, that Mr. Lee began making notes for "Jungle Fever." In his usual method, he transferred the best ideas from a legal pad to index cards, then arranged the cards into a sequence of scenes. Only then did he begin to write dialogue, guided not only by the skeletal plot but by his desire to tailor parts for Mr. Snipes, Mr. Davis, John Turturro and others.
Shaping issues of class as well as race, Mr. Lee made Flipper the white-collar half of the film's central couple. He lives in a restored brownstone on Striver's Row in Harlem, with The New York Times on the doorstep and a Romare Bearden collage on the wall. His wife works as a buyer at Bloomingdale's and their young daughter dresses for success in a Spelman College sweatshirt.
Angie, by contrast, is a child of the working class, visiting Manhattan only on assignment from a temporary agency. With her mother dead, she is expected by Old World custom to cook dinner for her father and brothers, preferably early enough so they can turn on the Mets game and heckle Darryl Strawberry. Angie's longtime boyfriend, Paulie Carbone (Mr. Turturro), shares her longing for a future outside the neighborhood, yet settles for running the family luncheonette.
The film unfolds largely through parallel scenes -- Flipper and Angie each confiding their affair to a close friend; the couple going on dates to the Harlem restaurant Sylvia's, where they have trouble being served because of her presence, and to the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy; Flipper being kicked out by his wife and Angie beaten by her father after friends betray their secret. And if there is one set piece that rises above the rest, however powerful and well observed audiences may find them, it is the conversation among Flipper's wife, Drew (Lonette McKee), and her friends after his eviction.
The screenplay sets the scene this way: "What we have here is a WAKE. A MOURNING for another SISTER who has been WRONGED. Drew. . .and her girlfriends sit in the living room, laughing, crying and discussing the state of THE BLACK MAN." Mr. Lee's camera then gives public exposition to private candor.
"Most of them are homos, drug addicts or in jail," a woman named Nilda says of single black men. "And the good ones know" they are, "so they see 10 women at a time, leaving babies all over the place." To which Drew rejoins: "Even though my marriage is wrecked, I still believe there are good black men out there. The problem is a lot of these good men just might be working class. A bus driver, garbage man or whatnot. There is nothing wrong with them."
A few moments later, the topic turns to white women. "It's ridiculous the way they act around the brothers," Drew says. "These white bitches think he's the best thing since sliced bread. This sacred thing that their daddies tried to keep them from all their life and when they get a chance, they gonna get some."
Mr. Lee devoted nearly three days to rehearsing the scene and an entire day to filming it, using two cameras at all times. Sam Pollard, the film's editor, culled two hours of usable dialogue, much of it ad-libbed at Mr. Lee's urging. "I can't write dialogue." he said, "as good as they're gonna say it."
For the actresses, the performance ventured deeply into their personal lives. Ms. McKee, the daughter of a black father and a white mother, was embraced only by her black relatives and yet has been spared certain racial indignities by virtue of her fair skin.
"There was a lot of truth in that scene," she said. "For nearly 500 years, we've been enslaved and told that white women are superior, that everything white is superior to anything black. How would a black woman compete with a white girl? We've been brainwashed for so long."
So intense and rending was the scene that it created several off-screen friendships between the actresses. And when Ms. McKee saw the finished film for the first time several weeks ago, she said the emotions felt as fresh as ever.
"I carry heavy baggage," she said, "and when I saw the scene I wept. It was just heart-wrenching for me. Because there's so much reality in that film. And I live it every day."
The mirror images of the black women in Drew's living room are the white men in Paulie's luncheonette. For them, too, color is a concept freighted with pain and irony. The customer quickest to bellow his bigotry listens to the rap group Public Enemy. The regular who reviles Angie for seeing Flipper curses the women who will not date him because, as a swarthy Sicilian, he is too dark. Paulie interrupts a customer's anti-black diatribe to recall the lynching of five Italian immigrants in Louisiana earlier in the century.
"There has to be a reason there's so much conflict with blacks and Italians," Mr. Lee mused. "Maybe it's because we're not that far apart. Sicily's not that far from Africa. Somewhere down the line, Hannibal or somebody. . . ." He let the sentence trail off, then continued: "New York has a lot of ethnic groups. Now we know there's conflict with blacks and Jews, with blacks and Koreans. But the violence is always between blacks and Italians."
Despite that atmosphere of lethal antagonism, Mr. Lee has shown the ability to write Italian characters as complex and varied as his black creations. And that artistic even-handedness has brought an integral tension and poignance to films like "Jungle Fever," based on confrontation.
Sal, the pizzeria owner, dominated "Do the Right Thing" with his mixture of pride, temper, tenderness and hate. In the aftermath of the Hawkins murder, Bensonhurst was often depicted as a monochromatic realm of racists. Mr. Lee in "Jungle Fever," however, has peopled the neighborhood with a far more complete range of humanity, from the gentle and yearning Paulie to the thuggish Vinny, whom the director modeled on Joseph Fama, the man convicted of murder in the Hawkins case.
Mr. Lee's familiarity and facility with such characters derives at least partly from his childhood. His family lived in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn when the neighborhood was largely Italian, and his closest friend on the block was Louie Tucci, his teammate for stickball in the schoolyard of P.S. 29. Louie's surname, of course, belongs to Angie in "Jungle Fever," and elements of his personality appear in Paulie. At the same time, Mr. Lee learned in Cobble Hill the limits of acceptance when he tried to join an all-white Cub Scout troop that operated from a nearby church. He was refused membership because, he was informed, he was not Roman Catholic.
Still, Mr. Lee said, he does not view the Italian and black communities in "Jungle Fever" as equally culpable, morally equivalent. Flipper's father may insult his child for crossing the racial line, but he will not exile or attack him. Even Drew Purify, it develops, is the child of a mixed marriage, who was accepted and raised in the black hemisphere of her bifurcated world.
"It's very rare," Mr. Lee said, "for a black family to disown a member for marrying someone white. This is not to say we view these couplings with open arms. But when you're oppressed, when you're at the bottom of a socio-economic system, you have a different perspective."
 
DRUGS IN HIS 'JUNGLE'
 While "Jungle Fever" is largely the story of an interracial affair and its aftershocks, the film also includes Spike Lee's first reckoning on film with the drug epidemic. Some critics took him to task for not portraying drug abuse in "Do the Right Thing," but Mr. Lee maintained that the inclusion of such material in "Jungle Fever" is not at all reactive.
"This was the film to deal with drugs in," Mr. Lee said. "In 'Do the Right Thing' it would've been a bogus subplot. And in 'Mo' Better Blues' it would've been a movie we've seen before -- the genius musician ruined by drugs. This time it could be organic to the story."
Drug abuse is personified in "Jungle Fever" by Gator Purify (Samuel L. Jackson), a crack addict who is the son of the Good Reverend Doctor (Ossie Davis) and his wife, Lucinda (Ruby Dee, in photograph with Mr. Jackson), and the older brother of Flipper, the successful architect portrayed by Wesley Snipes. At one point, after Gator has stolen the family television set, Flipper tracks him to a vast crack den called the Taj Mahal. So central did the issue of drugs become to "Jungle Fever" that Mr. Lee chose to end the film with Flipper's wordless cry of anguish when, as he walks his daughter to school, an addict offers to perform oral sex for $2.
"Which is more important," the director asked, "whether a black man should love a white woman, or what drugs are doing to the black community?"

HEADLINE: SOUND;
American Speakers -- Loud and Clear

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
While many American products have trouble competing overseas, American loudspeakers get an eager welcome. This week, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, a large number of buyers from abroad are expected to bolster an otherwise sluggish business.
"Our company has always maintained a global outlook," says Sidney Harman of Harman International, which makes speakers under well-known brand names like Infinity and JBL. "But lately, the export side of our business exceeds domestic sales." 
 Mr. Harman has a special reason to be pleased at this reversal of a trend. As Undersecretary of Commerce in the Carter Administration, he witnessed the drastic decline of America's share in the world market for home electronics. According to the economist Robert Kuttner, that share fell from 70 percent to 5 percent over the last few decades.
American loudspeakers, however, survived and are now flourishing once more. This renaissance is not confined to prominent brands. Inventiveness by newcomers is also being recognized in the world market. For example, Linaeum of Portland, Ore., a new company, is attracting attention with speakers based on a radically offbeat invention by a musician-engineer, Paul Paddock. In 1989, its first year, more than half of Linaeum's output went abroad.
Of course, the United States has no monopoly in the field. Britain, in particular, is known for producing excellent loudspeakers, and several German companies -- notably MB Quart -- have earned praise from audiophiles. But American speaker manufacturers hold the lead.
Much of this has to do with a technical assurance rooted in a long tradition. The modern high-quality loudspeaker is largely an American development dating to the 1950's, when engineers like Henry Kloss, Roy Allison and Paul Klipsch -- all still active -- created some of the first full-range speakers for the home. Before that, people relied on scaled-down versions of movie theater speakers.
Neither in bulk nor in timbre were those speakers suitably domesticated. They loomed in the living room like outsize armoires. Moreover, their trumpetlike tweeters -- originally meant to project movie dialogue to the far corners of a theater -- tended to be sonically overwhelming rather than musically pleasing.
It was Roy Allison's invention of the dome-shaped tweeter and Henry Kloss's design of the acoustic suspension enclosure that finally made it possible to package high-fidelity sound in relatively small boxes, thereby setting new quality standards for home audio. During the 60's, American companies like Acoustic Research, Advent and Allison Acoustics refined these principles, making American loudspeakers household items almost everywhere.
It is paradoxical that even in Japan -- the leading producer of audio equipment -- American speakers outsell Japanese products. For despite intense efforts, Japanese engineers have not been able to come up with loudspeakers that deal convincingly with symphonic music.
Given the unmatched competence of Japanese engineering in so many other aspects of audio, the consistent deficiency of their speakers in regard to orchestral sound has caused much puzzlement. It has been suggested that Japanese engineers, accustomed to the high-pitched plucking and piping of Oriental music, may lack esthetic sympathy and the proper feel for the more massive orchestral textures underlying the Western symphonic tradition. Such ethnically based theories may perk the interest of anthropologists; they certainly lie beyond the realm of engineering.
The high regard in which American speakers are held does not mean they all sound alike. Each model has its distinctive tonal character. Yet there are common attributes. As a group, they tend toward deeper and fuller sonorities than speakers made elsewhere. There is a sense of tonal coherence and blending rather than the analytic unraveling of distinct sonic strands. Especially pronounced in brands like Boston Acoustics, a/d/s/ and B.I.C., these qualities are highly flattering to the massed strings that form the basis of orchestral sound. Of course, this characteristic is shared only by speakers designed mainly to reproduce classical music, not to put a hard edge on the sounds of rock.
In at least one notable case, American dominance in this field has reversed the pattern of foreign companies' acquiring American manufacturing plants. Jensen International, a Chicago company that makes speakers under the names of Advent, Acoustic Research and NHT, is reaching across the Atlantic. "European sales are a growing part of our business," says Robert Shaw, the company's chief executive officer, "so we decided to move production closer to the market. Already we have plants in Italy and France and are now about to open up a new factory in what used to be East Germany."
Loudspeakers are only a drop in the total economic bucket. But moves like this, Mr. Shaw believes, are "the beginning of a rebirth" -- at least for certain specialized branches of American industry.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Sound column in the Arts and Leisure section on June 2 misattributed the invention of the acoustic suspension speaker and the dome tweeter. A reader's letter, sent two weeks after the column appeared, pointed out that both were invented by Edgar Villchur. (This correction was improperly delayed through an oversight.)

HEADLINE: Using Lessons of Xerox to Run Education Dept.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
David T. Kearns, lately chairman of Xerox, now Deputy Secretary of Education, is shuttling these days between his Government-issue office and the no-frills Holiday Inn across the street. Gone are his corporate jet, $1.3 million salary and undisputed authority as head of one of the country's largest corporations.
But Mr. Kearns's biggest challenge will not be learning to live with diminished perquisites and power and a tenth of his former salary. He faces the formidable task of proving that a businessman using business practices can marshal a Government bureaucracy to help American schools. 
 In his years at Xerox, which he joined in 1971 and headed for nearly a decade, Mr. Kearns (it rhymes with learns) did what many thought was impossible: He rescued a company reeling from Japanese competition. He led a sweeping reorganization that not only changed manufacturing and design processes but also transformed Xerox's bureaucracy and labor-management relations.
Many of the techniques he used at Xerox, he said, can be transferred to government and education. "The idea of putting decisions down at the level where people do the work," he said, offering one example. "Look at where the money is spent: in the school or the bureaucracy? Look at the huge bureaucracy we built in business that ended up not having a lot to do."
Mr. Kearns is not simply pontificating about how to run schools more efficiently. For the past several years, he has toured the country giving speeches and meeting with educators to convey the same message he outlined in a 1988 book published by a research organization: that the United States must catch up with the educational performance of competitors like Japan.
 
'Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig'
 Company rules required him to relinquish the title of chief executive officer at the age of 60 last August, although he stayed on as chairman. So he was willing to listen to Lamar Alexander, who became Education Secretary in March, who coaxed him to take the No. 2 position at the Education Department.
The resulting team, educators say, is the strongest ever at the 12-year-old department, and has helped make it a popular place to be in Washington. "It's like having Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig on the same team," said Denis P. Doyle, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who was co-author with Mr. Kearns of the book, "Winning the Brain Race: A Bold Plan to Make Our Schools Competitive."
President Bush has put the business ideals of competition and markets at the core of his strategy to improve American education. Mr. Kearns said his task is to promote the President's new education strategy while running the day-to-day operations of the Education Department and building relations with the business community.
But even those who wish him well warn that Mr. Kearns is stepping into a very different world.
"In a place like Xerox, the boss is the boss unless something goes really wrong," said Marc Tucker, president of the Center on Education and the Economy, a Rochester research institution on school improvement. "In Washington, if you wait long enough, there will be another boss, with another set of priorities."
Mr. Kearns's friends are cheering for him, but are also protective. "I think he's entering a jungle," said J. Richard Munro, the chairman of the executive committee of Time Warner Inc. and a longtime neighbor of Mr. Kearns's in New Canaan, Conn. "He has no affectation, no presumptuousness, no nonsense and no politics. Those kind of guys -- I'm not sure they make it in D.C."
 
Needed: Coaxing, Not Ordering
 Some of these very qualities, however, may help him allay the suspicions of bureaucrats who are secure in their jobs and may need more coaxing than ordering to follow his lead.
"He's easy to underestimate partly because he is so accessible," said Mr. Tucker, who has enlisted Xerox employees to help reorganize the Rochester school bureaucracy. "But he clearly has the capacity to lead, to somehow help others in the organization to share his values and his aspirations."
Mr. Doyle said Mr. Kearns's unpretentiousness helped endear him to employees at Xerox. "He drives a Jeep, carries his own bags and buys suits off the rack from Jos. A. Banks," he said.
Nevertheless, anyone who makes it to the top of a major corporation is probably not a pushover. Friends describe Mr. Kearns as tightly wound, a man whose refreshing lack of imperiousness does not hide his determination, competitiveness and drive.
Mr. Kearns pleads guilty. "People tease me about not being patient," he said. "I am impatient. You've got to walk a fine line. A certain amount of impatience is good because it stirs you to do things."
At Xerox, Mr. Kearns preached and practiced a more participatory management style, in which workers had a voice in forming policy.
By contrast, few of the 4,800 Government employees Mr. Kearns will manage had any voice in shaping the new education strategy, which was the work of a small cadre of outside advisers and top aides to Mr. Alexander.
 
Can Toe the President's Line
 Mr. Kearns said that everyone had been too polite to hint of any disagreement, but that he was certain he would encounter it and was optimistic he could win people over. He also said he accepted that he was not the boss and could toe the President's line.
In his book, Mr. Kearns called on the Federal Government to finance fully the Head Start preschool and Chapter One remedial education programs for poor children. He advocated sharp increases in Federal money for research on education. He wanted to restrict educational choice -- the idea that money can follow students to whatever school they choose -- to public schools, while Mr. Bush wants to extend it to private schools.
Mr. Kearns said he and Mr. Doyle had been revising the book to reflect their new view that choice should be extended to private schools, a conclusion he reached before his appointment, he said, because he was frustrated that public schools had not changed fast enough.
The immensity of the task before him is keeping him at the office late and prompting calls from his wife.
"The other day I called her at 10 P.M. and she said, 'You're not 30 anymore,' " he said, smiling. "It's invigorating, frankly."

Bush Resumes Hyperspeed; Is He Up to It?

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH, the Eveready President, just keeps going and going and going.
Despite a thyroid condition that left him thinner, wan and tired, Mr. Bush has recently seemed for all the world like the mechanical bunny with the bass drum on the battery commercials. 
 Boom. Boom. Boom.
He pops up on the golf course at Kennebunkport, Me., playing 63 holes of golf over the Memorial Day weekend -- laughing with delight as he scatters startled aides and reporters with his speeding golf cart, giving a rambling news conference on the 18th hole.
Boom. Boom. Boom.
The President is on the telephone, dialing up Mikhail Gorbachev, Brian Mulroney of Canada, John Major of Britain, Yitzhak Shamir of Israel and the Emir of Kuwait.
Boom. . . well, you get the idea.
The Commander-in-Chief jets off to Colorado for the afternoon, speaks at the Air Force Academy commencement, shakes hands with all 980 graduates, hugs and kisses the women in their ranks, announces a much-delayed arms control initiative for the Middle East.
All of this activity was just part of a week that saw Mr. Bush travel thousands of miles aboard his Air Force Boeing 747 to deliver three other commencement speeches -- at Yale, West Point and the F.B.I. Academy -- and make pronouncements on civil rights and trade with China.
Though somewhat diminished by his illness and the drugs he is taking to combat it, Mr. Bush has, if anything, stepped up the pace of his Presidency-on-the-run, full of high-level diplomacy, high-speed travel and high-stakes conflicts with Capitol Hill.
Is all of this merely sound and activity, or is there substance behind it? And, in his condition, is George Bush really up to it?
Clearly Mr. Bush is involved as deeply as ever in the business of governing, the trait that more than any other sets him apart from Ronald Reagan. Some of his speeches last week, and in the weeks since his heart flutter and thyroid problem were first diagnosed, contained major initiatives. A case in point was his decision, announced at Yale University on Memorial Day, to extend China's "most favored nation" trading privileges for another year despite his misgivings about Beijing's human rights record.
Many of these events were scheduled well before Mr. Bush's illness was diagnosed. But Mr. Bush and his aides are anxious to demonstrate that this President is not going to let a little thyroid problem get him down.
So the speeches are still being delivered. And Mr. Bush still misspeaks, as he did on Wednesday, closing his speech at the Air Force Academy with, "Congratulations. And Godspleed."
But now, such a blooper at the podium, a confused answer to a reporter's question or another energetic Presidential golf match makes people begin wondering if Mr. Bush is exhibiting the ups-and-downs that can accompany his thyroid problem, caused by a condition known as Graves' Disease.
By Mr. Bush's own admission, and that of his doctor, Burton Lee, the drugs he has been taking slowed down his mental functions at first, at least temporarily, and may have been to blame for his worn appearance and confused answers at a recent news conference in the Rose Garden.
The President has visibly bounced back since then, gaining back about 5 of the 13 pounds he lost, and he has angrily rejected any suggestion that the thyroid condition can be blamed -- or credited, depending on your point of view -- for decisions made during the gulf war or since then.
Mr. Bush's ailments have been examined minutely by both the press and his own physicians. Last week, even the Bushes' dog, Millie, was under scrutiny to determine whether her case of canine lupus could have been caused by some environmental factor, like iodine in the First Pup's drinking bowl, that may in turn have contributed to the President's illness and that of his wife, Barbara, who last year was also treated for Graves' Disease.
Presidential aides say they have not added events simply to prove that Mr. Bush is fit. But in the White House these days, there is more than ever a sense of an Administration racing against the clock. The President and his aides are hurrying to decide what to about Moscow's requests for financial aid before the Soviet economy collapses further. Administration officials are fighting to stop Congress from passing a civil rights bill that Mr. Bush will feel compelled to veto, for the second year in a row.
They are scrambling to prevent lawmakers from attaching conditions to the President's extension of China's trading privileges for another year. And they are speeding to push their objectives in the Middle East before what Mr. Bush likes to call "a window of opportunity" slams shut.
And even while the United States is trying to paint itself an exit from northern Iraq and solve Arab-Israeli disputes in the sloppy peace that ended the gulf war, Mr. Bush raised the ante on Wednesday by proposing an arms control initiative for the Middle East during his speech at the Air Force Academy.
Under this plan, the countries of the Middle East would abandon their decades-old arms race and agree to ban ballistic missiles, stop the production and acquisition of material for making nuclear bombs and eliminate chemical and biological weapons. The five major arms producers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- would agree not to sell "especially destabilizing" weapons to the Middle East.
How strongly Mr. Bush plans to pursue this plan was immediately called into doubt by his own treatment of it -- two short paragraphs that were slipped into the speech at the last minute.
White House aides made a point of saying that the United States would continue to supply what they consider their allies' legitimate defense needs. The proposal was characterized as a call for "an exercise in collective restraint."
In this area, at least, the White House may be racing against a political deadline -- the 1992 election. With Democrats in Congress already questioning Mr. Bush's post-war record in the Middle East, some Administration officials said the plan was in some measure a defensive action.
The President, meanwhile, is racing into summer, not as a leisure break, but as an extention of his peripatetic spring. Already on his schedule are more commencement speeches, a trip to California, a meeting in London with six other heads of state, a visit to Greece and Turkey and the increasing likelihood of a summit meeting in Moscow. That is not to mention three weeks in August in Maine, where, of course, he'll relax, intensely, no doubt.

HEADLINE: Global Executive Becomes Global Writer

BYLINE: By CAROL STRICKLAND

 BODY:
IN business, Chapter 11 means bankruptcy. In a new novel about the world of business, by chapter 11 an assassin wielding kung-fu knives has assaulted the company controller and demolished his North Shore house, and an audit of the company's deficits has occasioned five murders.
"A Whisper of Treason" is no ordinary business novel, just as its author, Sandy London, is no ordinary executive. 
 Ms. London is seeing the book, her first novel, released this month as a Fawcett paperback, and she is director of international operations at Cybex in Ronkokoma, a manufacturer of physical therapy, sports medicine and fitness equipment. Cybex is a division of Lumex Inc. of Bay Shore, which has $90 million a year in sales.
Ms. London, who has lived in Northport for 12 years, drew on her professional background as well as her imagination for the book. She heads a staff of 15 that sells equipment in more than 40 countries.
"Because of what I do for business," she said, "I have an opportunity to go places and meet people. "They say to write about what you know."
 
Scribbling on Trips

When Ms. London traveled on business to Italy, Austria or Switzerland -- all locales in the novel, along with many scenes on Long Island and New York City -- she scribbled notes.
She used "elements of different people, different conversations and different situations I've been in," she said. But "I didn't take any incident specifically and graft it onto the book."
One character, the Viper, can kill by merely shaking hands with a victim. "I don't handle violence real well," Ms. London said of real life.
Her international experience helped in another way. "Plane trips are great for doing the creative side of drafting a novel," Ms. London said. On 14-hour flights to Tokyo, while other executives plotted corporate maneuvers, Ms. London plotted different intrigues, her suspense thriller. She also wrote at night and on weekends, completing the novel in 1986.
Her agent sold the manuscript in 1989. "I was ecstatic," Ms. London said. "You couldn't peel me off the ceiling. Then came the contract, then working with an editor, then seeing it in the bookstores. It's been one high after another."
Although major publishing is new to Ms. London, "I've written ever since I was a child," she said. When I was in grammar school, I wrote novels for the amusement of my friends. I had my first short story accepted for publication when I was 10."
While growing up in rural California, she wrote westerns. "I was very much a tomboy," she said. By her mid-teens, under the influence of James Bond movies, she switched to "spy novel stuff." She conceded that she had difficulty describing exotic locales when she was just a Fresno County schoolgirl.
When she graduated from Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in 1972, "people didn't consider writing a viable economic alternative," Ms. London recalled. She started in a 9-to-5 job and became an international specialist "by accident," because of her fluency in Spanish.
"Whomever I worked with, I ended up in the international side of their business," Ms. London said. "I finally decided I didn't want to be told what to do. I wanted to make the decisions. In order to do that, I had to get a master's degree. So I did.
 "I wasn't a real writer. I was a dabbler."
Her husband urged her to market her work, and she demurred until he pointed out: " 'You have a master's degree in business, for crying out loud. You can sell what you write, just like you sell anything else.' "
"I really started taking my writing seriously when I moved to Long Island," Ms. London said. After taking an adult-education course at Northport High School, she helped found a writers' workshop. She has completed two additional novels and is working on another.
All the books deal with international intrigue. "I really like the mental challenge," she said. "It's like putting together a gigantic jigsaw puzzle when you don't have the top of the box."
Her most satisfying moments are when the characters come alive. "When your pen takes off and the character runs with it and you didn't intend the scene to happen that way," she said, "that's when you know you've really created a strong character that has some substance."
 One difference between "A Whisper of Treason" and many other suspense thrillers is that a strong female protagonist shares the spotlight with a male hero. "That element is missing in most novels of this genre," Ms. London said. "Some authors' women characters are very cardboard. They don't come through as human beings. I wanted to create a work with a suspenseful plot built around characters that mattered to the reader."
After the easing of the cold war, Ms. London incorporated an Iraqi as villain in her novel "long before Saddam moved on Kuwait."
"I just guessed right," she added.
Ms. London, who is 40 years old, said: "I have a splintered personality. Like most modern women, I'm doing more than one thing. I'm a wife, I'm a mother. I work full time at a very demanding job, and I write.
"I'm pulled in about eight different directions. Every once in a while, I feel like I'm pushed against a wall, and something has to give. I obviously can't give up my husband, my child, the mortgage or my job. That leaves either my sanity or the writing, and, if I give up the writing, I will lose my sanity."
After celebrating Mother's Day with her family, Ms. London flew to Italy on business.
"There are a lot of women who have multiple roles, and somehow manage to fulfill all of them," Ms. London said. "I don't regret a minute of it."

HEADLINE: Growing Produce and Community Pride

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
LAND preservation is Louis McCagg's chief concern. Two years ago he founded the nonprofit Westchester Land Trust, based in Bedford, which has worked successfully to protect large open tracts from development. But another thing the group has done is help communities transform small empty sites into community gardens.
"The concept of the community garden fits right in with our goal of preserving open land in the county," said Mr. McCagg, suggesting that empty lots in dense urban areas represented even more valuable land. 
 "We figure a quarter-acre of open land in Yonkers is as valuable as 10 acres in Bedford," he said. "Our first venture was setting up two gardens in Yonkers last year with the help of the Yonkers Department of Parks and Recreation and the Yonkers Rotary Club. It was so successful that we were inspired to help establish as many as 10 community gardens by this spring's planting season. And we're right on target."
Three more gardens have been added to Yonkers, and similar gardens are being dug in Mount Kisco, Greenburgh, New Rochelle, Ossining and Peekskill.
Ralph Crosby, a landscape architect in Yonkers who works as a volunteer with the program, coordinating the garden program, said the Land Trust acts as a catalyst.
"We start working with municipal parks departments and local neighborhood groups and businesses to find an appropriate site, and then we supply them with technical assistance, which includes preparing the soil, fertilizer and fencing," he said. "We also help them get sponsorship from businesses, civic groups, government agencies or foundations who will underwrite the project."
Mr. McCagg, who describes himself as "a product of the 60's," said civil rights work led him to a career in the inner cities. "It was there I saw what happened when an abandoned lot was turned into a garden," Mr. McCagg said. "It became an oasis. People cherished the garden. It gave them a feeling of neighborhood. Even vandalism to the area declined."
The Land Trust is financed through private donations and a few government grants, and is staffed mostly by volunteers. "We're a lean organization," Mr. McCagg said. "We have only three people on the payroll."
Mr. Crosby said he spends several hours a week at his volunteer work. "In my practice, I've seen some terrible abuses of land," he said. "A community garden is a win-win project. Not only will it do the obvious -- beautify the neighborhood and bring people together -- but it gives the people who work it the deep pleasure and satisfaction that comes from growing some of your own food."
An average 400-square-foot community garden plot can yield the equivalent of $500 worth of fresh produce over a growing season, said Paul Winkeller, a consultant with the Land Trust.
 
Transfer of Duties>
 Once the garden is established, Mr. Crosby said, daily management is turned over to a community group like a tenants association or a club for the elderly.
Gerard J. Byrne, the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation for Greenburgh, said 15 garden plots were laid out in April adjacent to three Montrose Housing Authority high-rise apartment buildings and were flourishing.
Mark Brown, who heads the Tenants Association at the apartment complex, said, "We could have had twice the number of gardens, the demand is so great." Mr. Brown, who is retired, said the gardeners come from all walks of life and engage in "a friendly competition," but also help each other.
"Retired fellows like myself water the whole thing when we water our own plots," he said. "There has been very little vandalism. What I can't use I'll give away, but there is one stipulation: The people I give the vegetables to have to pick them."
 
'A Terrific Experience'
 "The tenants are really excited about the Farm, which is the name of the garden project," Mr. Byrne said. "We have two of them in Greenburgh now. The other we call the Garden, and that's located near Woodlands High School." Mr. Byrne's assistant, Karen Watts-Cabe, is the coordinator in charge of both projects.
"The Land Trust worked with us and gave us the technical assistance we needed to get started," Ms. Watts-Cabe said. "Now we're on our own and it is really a terrific experience."
Each garden is fenced and is 15 by 20 feet, but "all of them are different," Ms. Watts-Cabe said. "Some gardeners plant circular beds; others use straight rows. And a variety of vegetables -- from beets to zucchini to garlic -- are being grown."
Another Montrose gardener is Evangeline Kelly, a child-care worker who was raised in North Carolina. "I work at night," she said, "but every morning when I come home, I can't help myself -- I stop and work in my garden. Then I go out in the evening as well. My husband is a great cook and when we harvest our fresh vegetables I can some and we freeze some for the winter."
All the gardeners exchange ideas, she said. "The more seasoned gardeners help the ones who are just beginning. For example, on the farm in North Carolina, we always hoed a row and piled the soil on top of the row and that's how we planted beans. And that way if a hard rain comes along, your beans don't get washed away. I showed that technique to a couple of gardeners who are using it now in their plots."
 
Two Lots Donated
 In Ossining, Patricia Knapp, head of the Ossining Chamber of Commerce, said two empty parcels of land in the heart of the village off Main Street were being transformed into community gardens.
"We got started when Mr. McCagg wrote to me about the feasibility of starting community gardens in Ossining," Ms. Knapp recalled. "I met with him, and the project sounded so appealing that I presented the idea to the village. And they thought it was so good that they offered to donate the empty lots."
Individual Chamber of Commerce members are financing the project. "Everyone, including the gardens' immediate neighbors, is enthusiastic," Ms. Knapp said. "We figure we'll probably have room for two dozen individual gardens, which, being in the center of town, will have high visibility."
 
Growing Pride, Too
 In Yonkers, the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, Sal DeSantis, said community gardens in densely populated areas had proved their value. "We've seen numerous benefits, both social and economic, coming out of our community garden projects," he said. "Among them is the development of community pride. And people becoming more self-sufficient. We've had community gardens in Yonkers for a number of years, but now we have the Land Trust as a silent partner. They are a good resource for technical assistance and provide us with supplies and materials that we couldn't afford otherwise."
Those interested in starting neighborhood community gardens or working as volunteers with the Land Trust can reach Mr. McCagg at 241-6346.

HEADLINE: FASTBALLS FROM THE EDGE

BYLINE: By Bruce Buschel; Bruce Buschel, a New York journalist, writes frequently about sports.

 BODY:
WHEN ROGER CLEMENS TOES the mound, you can't take your eyes off him. Standing erect, he exhales deeply as his empty right hand falls politely to his side. Like a chubby-cheeked choirboy lifting an open hymnal, he raises the black Wilson mitt on his left hand to a resting place in front of his solemn game face. After a gentle rock backward, he reaches into his glove, as if to remove a bookmark, grasps the ball and, with a grimace and a grunt, commences the same windup that he had rehearsed before a full-length mirror after every Little League game.
Clemens is a 6-foot-4-inch time machine, a throwback to an era when uniforms were baggy and throwing hard was everything, when the guy hurtling thunderbolts down from the mound was Cy Young or Walter Johnson or Bob Feller. His high hard ones rip across the ages, punching holes in fancy hitting theories and computerized strategies. In 1986, he struck out 20 batters in a single game, a major-league record. Grab a bat and feel the heat. Crowd the plate and he'll brush you back easy as spit. If the opposing pitcher plunks one of his mates, Clemens'll nail the next batter he faces. He even has a good old-fashioned monicker: the Rocket. 
 In the first inning on this crisp New England afternoon, three Indians come up, three Indians sit down. No ball leaves the infield. It will be a long and frustrating day for the batters from Cleveland, a club with two rookie starters who have never faced a pitcher of this caliber.
The 28-year-old Clemens is off to a dazzling start this season, already racking up six victories and 30 consecutive scoreless innings, striking out five times as many hitters as he walks. At this rate, by season's end he will have compiled 25 victories, struck out 200-plus batters for the sixth time, posted an earned run average in the neighborhood of 2.00.
Springtime, when pitchers are perennially ahead of hitters, always produces a few fast starters, but when the weather heats up, bats do likewise. Timing improves, pitchers' patterns are revealed. None of this applies to Clemens. He does not have slumps; barring injuries, he has only good stretches and dominating stretches. Last season, from early August until early September, he went 8-0 with an 0.80 e.r.a.: in 67 innings, he gave up six runs and six walks, registering 65 strikeouts.
Six Indians up, six Indians down. Already, Fenway Park is abuzz with talk of a no-hitter. It would be Clemens's first. In Section 21, the seats behind home plate, a kid, all of 10, in a tattered Red Sox cap with a red B, turns to his father and says, with all the wisdom of youth: "It's no fair, Dad, he throws too hard. They can't hit him."
 IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND THAT COMPLICATED. When Clemens throws his 97-m.p.h. fastball, a batter has 38/100 of a second to find it and hit it. Batters have nowhere to practice such an act. Most major-league fastballs are in the range of 85 m.p.h.
As if the super-octane gas weren't potent enough, Clemens pumps four different high grades. He will move a right-handed hitter away from the plate with a couple of fastballs that rush toward him, then deliver one that tails away, low and unreachable. When he holds the ball with his index and middle fingers across the seams, an underspin is produced that causes the ball to rise. (Physicists argue that this is a gravitational impossibility. Batters know only that it's a tough pitch to hit.) When Clemens grips the ball along the red stitching, the ball becomes "heavy" and sinks as it approaches the plate. After he makes the hitter "climb the ladder," sending successive pitches higher in the strike zone, the "seamer" comes as a complete surprise.
The rare hitter who manages to time the hard stuff may see the "89 slider," a pitch that veers away from a righty at a slightly slower pace. Or the old reliable curve, humpbacked and unexpected. And finally, Clemens has perfected a new pitch this season, the forkball, a nasty number that drops out of the strike zone entirely, but not before looking suspiciously like a fastball.
Baseball has a few pitchers who can match Clemens's speed, but none with his accuracy. Indeed, only a handful of pitchers in the history of the game have been able to throw the variety of pitches Clemens possesses with his pinpoint control.
"You can't watch for the fastball any more," reports Joe Carter, the Toronto Blue Jay slugger who has returned to the American League after a season in the National League. "I had to update my file on Roger -- everything he throws now can be a strike."
Control has always been Clemens's forte. In high school, where wildness is the norm, he walked only 24 batters while striking out 112 in 108 innings. In his two years at the University of Texas, there were 56 bases on balls and 241 whiffs in 275 innings. With conditioning and confidence, the power has increased over the years but the control has remained the same: last season, in 228 innings, he fanned 209 and walked 54.
"I could always throw strikes in the dark," says Clemens with his Texas twang. "It's a God-given thing."
Clemens has hit a silver dollar from 60 feet, 6 inches. During a game, 9 out of 10 pitches go exactly where he means them to go. His catcher, Tony Pena, says he simply sets up a target and waits for the thump. If the ball does not hit the padded pocket of his mitt just so, Pena's hand is numb for three innings.
 TWELVE INDIANS UP, 12 INDIANS DOWN. Cleveland is having no luck with the cross-seamer. Last week, against the fastball-hitting Toronto Blue Jays, nearly half of Clemens's pitches were forkballs, sliders and curves. Today, he picks up the speed.
 If anyone thought Clemens's concentration would be corrupted by his newly minted contract or the fallout from his explosion in last season's American League playoffs, they don't know him. He is inspired by tumult; he loves to disappoint his detractors.
And there are plenty of them. After carrying the Red Sox to a division title last fall, Clemens became unhinged during Boston's disastrous playoff loss to Oakland. He got into a series of verbal, even violent, imbroglios with a Boston photographer, sundry Oakland A's, umpires, his own manager and an innocent, if unyielding, clubhouse door, which he smashed with his pitching hand on the eve of the American League Championship. Ejected from the final game of the series for cursing, he ran through one umpire in order to threaten another with off-season retaliation. The Rocket had exploded. Indelible remains the memory of that lip-readable frenzy that caused one of the Red Sox owners, John Harrington -- not to mention millions of startled fans -- to question the mental stability of the star hurler.
Then, only three months later, Clemens was arrested for aggravated assault on a policeman. The officer had been in the process of arresting his older brother Randy Clemens for causing a disturbance in a crowded Houston saloon called Bayou Mama's Swamp Bar. The brawl was front-page news in Boston: Good Ol' Boy in Bad New Scrap.
How did the conservative Red Sox organization react to all the controversy? By awarding Clemens a four-year contract, averaging $5.3 million per season, making him the highest-paid player in baseball history (basketball and football history, too). Befuddled fans, especially in recession-plagued New England, questioned the mental stability of Red Sox management.
 THE WAY CLEMENS IS pitching today, it's easy to forgive his transgressions. After all, what's a freakout and a felony and five million bucks compared with the promise of a pennant? In the bottom of the third inning, the Red Sox had scored their first run on two Cleveland errors. Clemens watches Pena cross the plate on the monitor in the clubhouse, where he has gone to change into a fresh jersey and to confer with Bill Fischer, his pitching coach since his second season.
 "No one knows how [expletive] hard this guy works," Fischer, a grizzled ex-marine, says later. "Every [expletive] day, he works on his fastball, slider, curve, forkball, his mechanics, his pick-off move. He runs and he studies and he's [expletive] obsessed with being a great pitcher."
Fischer pitched for five teams during a nine-year major-league career distinguished by one record: 84 1/3 consecutive innings without a walk. You take a man who has spent his entire adult life around leathernecks and ballplayers and you are hard-pressed to hear an expletive-free sentence.
 "There's something the public doesn't understand about pitchers -- they're freaks. Roger Clemens is a [expletive] freak. Every great pitcher I ever known is a [expletive] freak. Any time you can throw a ball 90-plus m.p.h. over the plate whenever you want, you're a [expletive] freak of nature. There was Gibson and Palmer and Seaver and Ryan, and now there's Roger Clemens. He's the big bully on the block. He says he's the best, and he backs it up. That kills people. His only problem is that he works too [expletive] hard, and he overpitches sometimes. That's my job -- some guys you gotta calm down, some guys you gotta kick."
The pitching coach has his work cut out for him this year. After Clemens, the Red Sox staff is a collection of kids, castoffs and free agents acquired by the front office during a winter of irrepressible largess. Matt Young has a three-year contract that will give him $6.35 million. He has never won more than 12 games in one season in the majors. Danny Darwin signed for four years and $11.8 million. Darwin, 35, has never won more than nine games in a single year as a starter. Over all, the Red Sox agreed to pay six players a total of $66.2 million for 20 years, an average of $3.3 million a year.
In this great baseball bazaar, Roger Clemens may turn out to be one high-priced bargain.
"The marketplace is crazy," says the Red Sox's affable general manager, Lou Gorman. "The Red Sox payroll seven years ago was $6.7 million. The payroll this year is $34 million. You have no choice. I believe that if the escalation of salaries continues, there are going to be some clubs in bankruptcy."
The Red Sox are not one of those teams. Despite the fourth-highest payroll in baseball, there is little fear of red ink. Local television will bring in about $25 million a year until 1995. Fenway Park sells itself. The fans are crazy loyal.
Of course, the biggest news of the signing binge was Clemens's $5,380,250 per season. Based on last year's stats, this will break down to $256,202 per victory, $25,742 per strikeout. The numbers addle the brain until one considers that Ted Danson, the star of the long-running television hit "Cheers," earns comparable money per laugh and pickup line. And he only pretends he pitched for the Red Sox.
"If Clemens walked away, I believe the fans of New England would have hanged me from the centerfield flagpole," says Gorman, quickly adding, "in effigy. We had no choice. Leverage controls any negotiation. Clemens had total leverage. Look, we couldn't afford not to sign Clemens. We made the best deal we could, although no one would agree. Personally, I think we got off easy."
Before the signing, Clemens's arm was inspected by three specialists. Nobody probed his psyche. Gorman doesn't put much stock in that psychiatry stuff.
"I never thought about Roger seeing anyone," the general manager says. "He's just a very intense competitor who blew up last year. Off the field, his personal habits are good. He's a good family man. He never has more than one beer. He's a health nut. If I worry about anything, I worry about him running around the streets of Boston and getting hit by a car."
If not for $5,000, Clemens might be running through the mean streets of Manhattan. When he was a 19-year-old prospect at San Jacinto Junior College, the Mets tried to sign him. They drafted him in the 12th round and sent two officials to Texas to recruit him. The pair trapped him in a parking lot after a game and offered him $30,000. Roger wanted $5,000 more.
The vice president of the Mets nixed the deal. His name was Lou Gorman. Ten years and several zeroes later, he didn't let it happen again.
 IN THE FIFTH INNING, AS the 14th straight Indian is retired, the no-hitter talk takes on new earnestness. A number of fans invoke the name of Nolan Ryan, the 44-year-old Texas Ranger who will pitch his seventh no-hitter a couple of weeks later.
 As a teen-ager, Roger Clemens walked around with a photograph of Nolan Ryan in mid-pitch. He studied the still, intuiting that flawless mechanics were the key to both dominion and longevity on the mound. As a 10th grader, after his family had moved to Houston from Dayton, Ohio, he'd sneak off to the Astrodome to watch his local hero, then pitching for the Astros. When Ryan faced Tom Seaver, it was a masters' class in Advanced Power Pitching. Clemens's style is now a hybrid of those two classicists. Never more than acquaintances, Clemens and Ryan are separated by a generation, conflicting schedules and the 40 miles between two small Texas towns -- Clemens's Katy and Ryan's Alvin. Clemens jokes that if Ryan would only act his age, there might be a line or two in the record book left for him.
With two outs in the fifth inning, dreams of a no-no bounce up the middle, just beyond the reach of rookie shortstop Tim Naehring. Clemens hastily mops his brow with the tip of his glove, then glowers at the runner on first.
 According to John Marzano, the Red Sox's backup catcher and Clemens's best buddy on the team, the pitcher gets indignant when a runner reaches first; if said runner should find his way safely to second, Clemens gets downright livid. For Clemens, pitching is an angry meditation. Every hitter is an enemy, every game a mission. So fierce is his intensity that it irks fellow professionals. Willie Wilson, of the Oakland A's, once complained: "Who does he think he is? He struts around out there like 'Hey, man, I'm God. I'm Roger God Clemens, and nobody's going to hit me.' "
Clemens is a 230-pound workhorse who prances upon the mound on Clydesdale thighs that have been developed by running three seven-minute miles every day for over a decade. "I don't jog -- I run!" he proclaims. In the off-season, he ties tires to a harness and pulls them across the parking lot of his alma mater, Spring Woods High School in Houston. During the season, no matter the city in which he awakes, Clemens runs in the streets every morning, wearing a black Los Angeles Raiders cap turned backward, revealing short, spiky hair into which he has scupltured thin parallel lines.
For half the year, he lives in a self-imposed exile from fun. No carousing, no late-night revelry. He brings this purposefulness to the mound. With athletes like Rickey Henderson or Michael Jordan, you see their exuberance, their delight in sharing their delight. Clemens keeps his pleasures to himself -- the joy is in the work and the work is solitary.
Few teammates pretend to know Clemens. While they gratefully acknowledge his leadership and his accomplishments -- and are in awe of his combative nature -- few are friends. When one taped the words "Possessed Rebel" on Clemens's locker, it was both compliment and dig. The pitcher took a fancy to the image. Possessed? You bet. A rebel? In every sense -- the soul of an insurgent and family roots that stretch back to Robert E. Lee.
"That's where my fire comes from," says Clemens. "I've always been doubted, and I've always responded. That's what keeps me going, keeps me focused. If someone says I can't do something, I gotta show him he's wrong."
The fire is further fueled by the special burdens of performing for the Boston Red Sox. To say the Bosox are a secular religion in New England is neither blasphemy nor hyperbole. "Pope Dies -- Sox Still Alive!" was a newscast teaser in 1978. Clemens is the last best chance for the Red Sox to exorcise the demons that have denied them a world championship for three score and 12 seasons. Of this obligation, he is well aware and unafraid. In fact, he welcomes the responsibilities. He approaches the world like Atlas.
"I think about it all the time," he says. "How could I forget? People tell me their grandfather's sick, and he has to see the Red Sox win before he dies. The media's always writing about the monkey on our backs for 73 years. I was there in 1986 when we lost to the Mets -- I know about the curse. These people in Boston deserve a championship. My teammates deserve it, the ones on the field and the ones who aren't here any more. There are a lot of people counting on me. Believe me, it's on my mind all the time."
 BILL CLEMENS WAS not a responsible man. He was selfish and abusive and gone by the time his son Roger was 5 months old. The truck driver couldn't handle the pressures of supporting a wife and five children. Bill Clemens's interest in athletics involved a bottle of beer and a television set. He would not have understood, much less approved, what would become his youngest son Roger's obsession.
Roger spoke to his father only once, on the telephone, gave the old man hell, told him never to come around again. Roger was 10 years old. His stepfather had died the year before. In very different ways, Clemens lost two fathers in the first decade of his life. He was the only one of the five Clemens kids who refused to attend his father's funeral.
"I never knew my blood father until he passed away," Clemens says. "I'm sure he saw me pitch in the College World Series. Friends close to the family told me he watched me on television. He didn't pass until the end of that season, and seeing me might have contributed to his passing. I know if I were in his shoes, and I saw my boy do what I did, well, it would hurt, hurt real bad."
The finale of the 1983 College World Series was the game his natural father saw. Texas versus Alabama. In the ninth inning, protecting a one-run lead, Clemens gave up a leadoff double to Dave Magadan, currently the Mets first baseman. The Texas coach walked to the mound. "I ain't coming out," said the pitcher resolutely. "I want this one." And he got it. Celebration followed. As Clemens emerged from the pileup of Longhorns, too near an ESPN microphone, he raised his clenched fist to the heavens and shouted: "You tested me, you [expletive]! Don't test me!"
These are no small games Roger Clemens is playing.
"Roger was always more intense than the rest of us," recalls Mark Vennerholm, who has gone from catching the Rocket in Little League to designing rockets for Texas Instruments. "He was not an outstanding athlete, but you couldn't convince Roger of that. He was a bulldog, more motivated than anyone I've ever known. He was working on this long-term plan. And he was only 10 years old!"
 TO END THE SEVENTH inning, on a two-two count, Clemens suddenly drops sidearm and delivers a heater that immobilizes the hitter at the plate. His release point, on which batters time their swing, has just changed. It is a new Rocket wrinkle. A few of his teammates smile as they jog off the field.
 "On days when Roger pitches," says Red Sox utility man Steve Lyons, "some guys on the other team decide to rest their sore hamstrings or come down with stomachaches. Good timing, eh?"
Though hard to fathom, Clemens is still improving. Over the last five years, his 100 victories and 2.71 e.r.a. are the best in the majors. His statistics last year rival those of the great seasons of the modern era. He went 21-6, with an e.r.a. of 1.93, nearly a full two runs less than the league average. All this pitching in Fenway, a hitters' haven, without benefit of great defense or stalwart bullpen. "Clemens and Lemons," a local phrase last year, may have been an unkind characterization of the pitching staff, but the Red Sox were less than a .500 team without their ace on the mound. Had he not missed a crucial span in September with a sore shoulder -- the Sox folded like napkins in his absence -- he might have won his second Most Valuable Player Award and his third Cy Young Award.
Clemens went into the playoffs against the highly touted Oakland A's with a sore shoulder and fragile psyche. He was worn down by the demands of the long season, by the ghosts of failures past.
On the last day of the regular season, after unsuccessfully lobbying for a longer celebration before the news media were permitted into the locker room, he threw a tantrum and punched the door with his pitching hand. Despite his pitching well in the first game against Oakland, the A's were victorious. In the second game, his ragging of both umpires and opponents got so vicious that Clemens had to be restrained by his own manager, with whom he ended up in a shouting match. (Clemens denies both the bench jockeying and discord.) Moments before he was to start in the fourth game, his team down 0-3 in the best-of-seven series, Clemens rammed his shoulder into a photographer, Jim Davis of The Boston Herald, who was leaning against the backstop screen. (Clemens contends it was a light brush.)
"He went out of his way to hit me," Davis says. "I tried to think of the worst thing I could possibly say when he came back on the field. Remembering that he was 0 and 7 against Dave Stewart, when he ran by, I yelled, '0 and 8, pal! 0 and 8!' "
Since Dave Stewart became the ace of the Oakland staff five years ago, Clemens has not beaten him, lost to him four times last season alone. There is bad blood between the two best pitchers in the American League. Stewart resents all the accolades and awards Clemens has won. Clemens resents Stewart's three trips to the World Series, not to mention his fielders, hitters and bullpen. "What makes Dave Stewart so good," he says flatly, "is that he has eight guys behind him that could be on the All-Star team. I wish the writers would give him a Cy Young Award so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore."
The hex has a hold on Clemens. When he squared off against Stewart for the fourth game of the championship series last October, he wore an unfamiliar Fu Manchu mustache and war-paint eyeblack. He was facing not only his old nemesis, but also the bitter prospect of being swept by a team whose showboating style he abhors.
He was not sharp that afternoon in Oakland. His fastball was not popping, his slider was missing. After walking second baseman Willie Randolph on a close call in the second inning, Clemens stomped around the mound cursing. Home plate umpire Terry Cooney shouted at him to shut up and pitch. Clemens shouted back at Cooney: "I'm not [expletive] talkin' to you. Get back behind the [expletive] plate and call the game." The next thing Clemens knew, Cooney had ejected him -- without warning and with questionable provocation. Baseball's unwritten rule allows players to use obscenity as long as it's not directed at an umpire personally.
When Clemens realized he had been tossed, he went wild. Racing across the infield grass toward home plate, where his manager was quarreling with several umpires, Clemens rushed at Cooney. Pushing umpire Jim Evans out of the way, the raging pitcher was finally restrained by teammates a few feet shy of his target. Unable to reach Cooney, he settled for terrorizing him. "I'm going to find out where you live and come after you this winter!" he yelled.
Clemens was suspended for five games this season and fined $10,000. He fought the decision, appealing twice, losing twice, and ended up missing one start in late April.
"I don't dispute bumping an umpire," he says now, "and I'm at fault for cursing a couple of times and threatening Cooney, but all that happened after the ejection. The ejection is the nucleus of the thing, and the umpire was falsifying all over the place. The decision was unjust."
Clemens feels persecuted by umpires, forgetting that throughout last season he had unleashed many a four-lettered tirade at various men behind the mask. Back in July, umpire Jim Evans had said, "If he's constantly having trouble with umpires, maybe he should look in the mirror and ask himself if maybe he's the problem." Clemens assumes no accountability, sees no cause and effect at work.
Similarly, Clemens believes the Boston news media are out to get him. Though his clippings are 99 percent positive, he remembers every negative story, as well as the byline above it. He thinks members of the press use him to sell papers and, in the process, cause him undeserved grief. And when Clemens feels bushwhacked, he strikes back. "Someone's gonna get hurt if they write about my family," he said a few years ago. "Whether it's physical or whatever, I'd take action -- severe action." Over the years, his relations with reporters have ranged from the embargo of 1989, when he refused all interviews, to this season of attempted accommodation, when he talks mostly after games in which he has pitched, and only about pitching.
 IN THE EIGHTH INNING, with a 4-0 lead, Clemens is on cruise control. Pitching with a lead makes him all the more effective; he does not have to worry about a single mistake costing him the game.
 The incident in which he was arrested in Houston last winter served only to corroborate Clemens's view of a world populated by hostile people. Clemens, along with his older brother Randy and two friends, had gone to Bayou Mama's after seeing an Andrew Dice Clay concert. They planned to meet some other friends at the saloon. A fracas broke out at the crowded bar, and Clemens saw his brother being arrested by an off-duty policeman who doubled as a bouncer.
Clemens went to his brother's aid. He says he tapped the cop on the shoulder, introduced himself, hoping that his name would turn things around, and tried to talk the officer out of making the arrest. The officer claims Clemens grabbed him from behind and crushed him in a headlock. A group of fellow officers subdued the Clemens brothers, arrested them for aggravated assault and took them to jail. The felony offense has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor charge for hindering an arrest. A hearing has been scheduled for next month. Maintaining his innocence, Clemens will not plea-bargain.
He sees the incident as a turning point in his life, when the dark side of fame and fortune was revealed to him, when the general public joined umpires and news media in turning against him.
"When I walk into a place like that," he says in pained tones, "everybody knows I'm there, so somebody has a chip on his shoulder or thinks I'm a tough guy. I never thought my life was gonna change. I never thought money would come back at me because of my name. Now I got people coming at me everywhere."
 To protect his wife, Debbie, his two young sons and himself from the perils of superstardom, he is building a 13,000-square-foot house on a three-acre plot just outside of Houston, complete with office, pitcher's mound, track, gym, weight room and 14-seat theater. The contractor is his wife's stepfather. The family is looking for a 100-acre ranch nearby, where his mother and brother Rick can live. When the compound is complete, his off-seasons will be filled with kith and kin. Father and sons will ride horses and watch movies and play catch in the spacious backyard.
"I don't know whether it's a phobia or what," he has said, "but I have a hard time dealing with a lot of people I don't know around me. Sometimes I'm with my family and the crowd gets too aggressive. If my family should get hurt by these people, then I'm either going to hurt somebody or go berserk."
Clemens has the Cleveland game well in hand. He has scattered three feckless singles and walked none. His fastball is still in the upper 90's and dead on. The Red Sox are on the verge of 4-0 victory.
Fenway fans are standing now, in noisy anticipation of the last out. Clemens looks in for the signal, blocks out the cheering throngs. He hears only his inner voice and the faint sparks of the plaque-maker sharpening his tools in Cooperstown.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
An Italian Table With Many Partisans

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
CAN more than 1,000 Long Island restaurantgoers be wrong? The recent Zagat Suburban New York City Restaurant Survey tabulating diners' responses ranks Navona in Great Neck as the Island's No. 1 Italian restaurant.
Recent visits confirm that much of its food is scrumptious. But there were also enough duds on the menu, including a few overly dry, dull entrees, to question the lofty rating. Navona does, however, make my Italian Top-5 list. 
 Navona is a small, elegant white-tablecloth storefront place. Yet, its mammoth mirrors create a feeling of spaciousness. Huge paintings of the restaurant's namesake, the Piazza Navona in Rome, share the walls with those mirrors.
While no one would ever accuse Navona of having bargain-basement prices, the restaurant makes it easy for diners on budgets to hold the line. Complimentary miniwedges of pizza one evening and bruschetta, garlicky toast piled high with fresh tomatoes, on another could substitute for appetizers. For those who feel a meal is incomplete without an opener, fried zucchini at $4.50, is an economical and delicious choice. A doily-covered platter is heaped with enough crispy wisps for the whole table.
At meal's end, there is a generous plate of gratis biscotti, the trendy Italian almond cookies. One night, they were joined by an even sweeter treat, chocolate-dipped strawberries. Therefore, it is possible to skip dessert, but I would not recommend it.
Navona delights with sensational homemade sweets including a feather-light chocolate cake, a luxuriant Napoleon, a crackly topped creme brulee and, best of all, crisp-crusted fruit tarts. Tiramisu, however, had a runny custardlike texture rather than the creamy one expected.
Star beginnings are the bacon-infused pasta e fagioli, the robust peasant soup; glistening seafood salad loaded with tender goodies, velvety polenta under a mantle of melted Gorgonzola cheese and scampi Ischitani bathed in white wine and masses of garlic. The sole loser among the starters was hot antipasto gypsy style, featuring a sharp tomato sauce playing host to sausage, chicken and mushy potatoes and peas.
Three pasta specials that shimmered were angel hair covered with a chunky tomato sauce and crowned with lobster medallions; pappardelle, wide noodles, enrobed in a bosky brown sauce loaded with porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and large pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta and spinach under a creamy pink sauce.
The salad sensation is the Charlotte. Three supersize radicchio leaves contain greens, roasted red peppers, onions, tomatoes and asparagus, all chopped, making a luscious meld. Asparagus spears nestled in endive spokes encircle the creation. It costs a whopping $8.50, but is large enough to share and outshines lesser lights.
At entree time, swim straight for the fish. The three top main courses sampled all had fins. A hefty swordfish steak smothered with shiitake mushrooms, elegantly simple Dover sole and red snapper topped with julienned peppers, onions and tomatoes, then steamed in foil, were lightly and splendidly turned out. They were far better than the arid, routine chicken scarpariello and broiled veal chop. Even less rewarding were the veal scallops a la Napoletana. Their tomato-mushroom sauce was tasty, but the meat was tough and dry.
More successful meat choices were the rack of lamb, rosy rare, thinly sliced and fanned on the plate, and a veal chop special. The chop, still on the bone, was pounded, breaded, crisply fried Milanese style, then mounded with cold crunchy salad.
Vegetable accompaniments nearly redeemed some of the drearier entrees. A souffle of cauliflower, carrot and broccoli purees and wedges of roasted fennel were perfect partners.
The mostly Italian wine list has a sprinkling of French and California choices. Although prices soar into the hundreds, 14 of the more than 60 selections are $14 to $20. One is a light subtle 1985 Villa Doria barbaresco riserva at $18.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Long Beach, Calif.;
A Cambodian Centerpiece

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
AN office-retail building with a roof designed to suggest a Cambodian temple is the centerpiece of efforts by Asian immigrants and this city's officials to revitalize a depressed commercial district.
Susan Shick, the city's Director of Community Development, said the $2 million, 22,000-square-foot UCC Plaza will be a "catalyst" for the redevelopment of the Anaheim Street area, a watershed of several immigrant neighborhoods. 
 The two-story building is a makeover of an existing 15,000-square-foot theater. Manny Perez, a local architect, enlarged and remodeled the building. The street level is for stores, the second floor for offices. The building, which was 75 percent leased when it opened in April, stands amid an aging retail strip where Hispanic businesses alternate with immigrant Asian concerns.
There are 45,000 Cambodians in this port city 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, one of the largest concentrations of Cambodians outside their native land. "The Cambodian community would like to become self-sufficient," said Than Pok, executive director of United Cambodian Community, the nonprofit developer. To sustain the community's growth, he said, the organization looked for a place "right in the middle" of where the Cambodians lived.
The notion of an office building in a working-class neighborhood was a tough sell to lenders, particularly at a time of recession and high office vacancy rates, said Mr. Pok. As a result, the financing for UCC Plaza is nearly as elaborate as the building's pagoda-like roof.
Mr. Pok's group bought the site for $121,000 in cash and the Local Initiative Support Corporation, a national nonprofit organization based in New York, contributed $30,000 in predevelopment costs, including architectural fees. The organization, which provides loans and technical assistance for community-sponsored housing and commercial projects, also provided $250,000 in equity.
A local lender, Queen City Bank, agreed to a $1.6 million construction loan andSecurity Pacific National Bank made a commitment to provide a $1.5 million mortgage to the project upon completion; the arrangement removes the difficulty of finding a second lender to pay off the construction loan, at a time when most lenders are shunning new projects.
Finally, the City of Long Beach tapped its Federal Community Development Block Grant funds for $172,000 for traffic improvement. The city also paid the project's development fees. Despite the help, Mr. Pok said, the project still needs $300,000 to cover cost overruns.

HEADLINE: Medical Waste Law Draws Criticism

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
A TWO-YEAR-OLD state law that strictly regulates the handling, disposal and tracking of the medical waste generated by thousands of hospitals, laboratories, doctors and others is being widely criticized.
State environmental officials say enforcement of the law has been hampered by insufficient funds and staff. Hospitals say the law is in conflict with a Federal statute, adding to the morass of costly regulations that the hospitals are already required to comply with. 
 Doctors say the law has been administered with too heavy a hand. Environmentalists say the law was never a priority for protecting the state's coastal areas.
 
No. 10 on List
 "If we had a list of 10 critical environmental concerns, and medical waste was on that list, it would be No. 10," said D. W. Bennett, the executive director of the American Littoral Society, an environmental group based in Sandy Hook.
Even the critics agree on the need to regulate the treatment of medical waste, but they are troubled by provisions of the current state law.
In 1988, when reports that used syringes and vials of blood had washed ashore prompted beach closings in New Jersey and New York, Congress and the Legislatures in both states began to take steps to address the problem.
Congress passed the 1988 Medical Waste Tracking Act, which set regulations on medical waste. It also provided New Jersey with $1.2 million for the creation of its own law. The Federal law expires June 24, and its reauthorization is working its way through Congress.
 
A Yearly Fee
 The New Jersey law, the Comprehensive Regulated Medical Waste Management Act, was signed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean in March 1989. It covers the handling, disposal and tracking of the refuse produced from the diagnosis and treatment of humans and animals as well as from embalming, medical research and blood banks.
Sites and practititioners who produce medical waste must register with the state and pay a yearly fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing the law.
John R. Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Protection, which, with the Department of Health, administers the state law, said the Federal law's revision or continuation would "probably have a negligible affect" on the state measure. He defended the state law as "one of the best in the country."
R. Scott Brubaker, chief of the Bureau of Inspections and Investigations in the Department of Environmental Protection, said the enforcement of the state law had been hampered by staff shortages in the last two years because of a state hiring freeze. As a result, with only two to seven medical waste investigators assigned to the entire state, roughly 10 percent of the 15,000 medical waste producers have been inspected since the law took effect, according to figures provided by Mr. Brubaker.
State investigators said that one in five of the generators inspected so far had been violating the law, either through failure to register or noncompliance with the rules for packaging, labeling, storing and transporting the waste, all of which fall on the individual generator.
 
Fees Reduced for Doctors
 Robert M. Confer, chief of the Bureau of Special Waste Planning in the Department of Environmental Protection, said the law called for registration fees that would have provided an operating budget of about $6 million a year for administering and enforcing the law.
But he and Mr. Brubaker noted that a 1990 amendment to the law had reduced the fees charged to mostly small generators, like doctors and dentists, thereby reducing the agency's medical waste budget by 40 to 50 percent annually. Fees generally range from $100 to $1,000 a year, depending on volume, whereas they had originally been proposed at $528.50 to $1,000.
In addition, Mr. Brubaker said the agency had received a special exemption from the Governor's office last month to hire more investigators with a current $600,000 grant from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. The combination of the hiring freeze and the cut in fees "has caused us to revise our anticipated monitoring and compliance schedules, and I don't think we can make a commitment to regular inspections down the road," Mr. Brubaker said.
Mr. Confer said this meant that medical waste generators would be inspected only once every four and a half to five years, instead of every 12 to 18 months, as his bureau had originally envisioned. So far, he said, 12,700 generators have been registered.
 
Many Failed to Register
 A fiscal statement issued in February by the Assembly said $4.5 million a year was being raised by the fees.
But, Mr. Confer said, the $4 million or so that has been collected has come in since the law took effect, because many generators had failed to register during the first year of the law and the bureau was only now beginning to receive payments.
Mr. Confer and Mr. Brubaker added that although it was originally thought that there were 10,000 businesses and institutions that would fall under the state law when it was enacted, it is now believed that the number will be 15,000 to 16,000 or more when the registration is completed.
Of the 1,500 inspections made so far, Mr. Brubaker said, about 300 were charged with civil violations of the law, either by not registering or not following the prescribed procedure for packaging, labeling, storing and transporting.
Christopher Florenz, a spokesman for Robert J. Del Tufo, the State Attorney General, said there had been only two criminal charges filed by the Attorney General's office during the course of the two-year-old law. Three businesses have been referred from the Department of Environmental Protection to the Attorney General's Office of Administrative Hearings, he said, but have not yet been scheduled.
 
'Laws Are Overkill'
 Diana Stager, a vice president of the New Jersey Hospital Association in Princeton, said that she, like other critics, agreed with "the need for careful control of medical waste."
"But these two laws are overkill," she said.
Ms. Stager and the association have been pushing the state environmental agency for changes in the definition of medical waste, she said, "so that things like blood-soaked bandages are included but blood-stained ones are not, and so that things like the diapers of newborns are excluded."
 "These things aren't infectious or dangerous," she said.
Hospitals have borne the brunt of Federal enforcement efforts so far. Earlier this year, five hospitals in Bergen County were charged with violating a total of more than 30 counts of the Federal law. The Federal environmental agency is seeking fines of more than $1 million against them, but administrative hearings have not yet been scheduled on the charges, said Herman Phillips, a spokesman for the agency's regional office in New York.
 
Group Pressing State
 Physicians have been critical of the state agency's implementation and enforcement of the law. Joseph Lucci, director of medical and insurance affairs for the Medical Society of New Jersey, a 10,000-member group based in Lawrenceville, said the organization's environmental health committee voted this month to press the state environmental agency for "more on the educational end and exactly what is expected of our physician members under this law."
The agency, Mr. Lucci said, originally indicated that it would properly educate and notify physicians of the new law in 1989. But, he said, "as far as we know that has not been done, and we've received complaints from our members that they never received a first mailing from the D.E.P."
"Instead of education, the enforcement came first with this law," Mr. Lucci said.
The medical society, he noted, was instrumental in getting the proposed minimum fee registration of $528.50 reduced to $100. Last March, Mr. Lucci said, the society requested and received a three-month amnesty period from the Department of Environmental Protection for physicians who had not registered since 1989. The amnesty period ends June 30.

 
'Strictly for Esthetic Reasons'
 Mr. Confer of the state environmental agency said the amnesty had been extended to all categories of generators, not just physicians.
Daisy Mather, the coordinator of medical waste tracking for the Federal agency's regional office, said, "Doctors and dentists seem to not really want to be interested in this program because they feel it causes them to go out of their way to deal with all these requirements."
But Miss Mather agreed that the Federal law was too hastily promulgated and was primarily written in response to the public and political outcry in 1988 over the medical waste's washing up on beaches.
"Most of the regulations were strictly for esthetic reasons," she said.
She added that the current law "is costing us a lot, is providing us with a lot of information on the kinds of medical waste and who is generating them in what quantities." But, she said, "the law also is showing us that there really is very little health risk to the waste except to workers who are directly and regularly exposed to it."
Her view was supported by Mr. Bennett of the Littoral Society, who said the beach incidents were "few and far between to begin with, and I don't know of any medical waste that has washed up lately." The waste, he said, has "very little environmental impact, but it is an esthetic and economic problem -- look what it did to tourism."
The State Division of Travel and Tourism said that a large decline in tourism revenue in 1988 and 1989 was partly a result of the reports of beach closings attributed to medical waste.
 
Risk Called 'Very Low'
 Mr. Bennett's views on negligible environmental and health risks of medical waste are supported by several Federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which says the risk of contracting blood-borne diseases from discarded medical waste is "very low."
And a report issued last February by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment noted that only 15 percent of all hospital wastes were infectious. Most were sterilized or incubated on the site by hospitals, the report said.
The report further stated that Congress should move "beyond the current approach to medical waste management and define a more comprehensive approach."
 Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of Long Branch, was a sponsor of the original Federal law and is one of the legislators seeking to revise it. Russell McGerk, Mr. Pallone's legislative director, acknowledged that perhaps the 1988 law had been written too hastily in response to the public furor over the beach incidents. There are "discrepancies" between the Federal and state laws, Mr. McGerk said, "and the generator can be in total compliance with one while violating the other."
Also, "we have found that the hospitals are being too strictly regulated," he said. "Beach washups, for instance, don't necessarily have anything to do with hospitals."
James M. Staples, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said it had been found that most syringes, for example, were disposed of in sewer systems by diabetics or drug addicts.
Mr. McGerk said: "Some of the things now regulated under the law may not be considered infectious waste. It has been found to be benign."

HEADLINE: Computerized Ordering Helps Bookstores Thrive

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
While some publishers are singing the blues at the convention of the American Booksellers Association, which ends tomorrow after four days at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, many book retailers are singing an upbeat tune.
At a time when most businesses are tightening their belts, bookstores, especially the independents, are proliferating, and many are prospering -- although many booksellers say they are worried about rising book prices. 
 All across the country, more bookstores are using computers to track sales and keep inventories lean. They are also ordering through an expanding network of national and regional distributors that can deliver books much faster than publishers. This allows bookstores to stock fewer copies of each book and more overall titles. As a result, publishers must rethink the size of their printings, no longer able to rely on bookstores to buy large amounts of popular titles out of fear of running out before they can order again.
"What used to be mom and pop bookstores may still be run by mom and pop, but now they are sophisticated business people," said Bruce Harris, an executive vice president of Random House.
 
 Emphasis on Service
 Seven or eight years ago, independent booksellers feared being run out of business by the chain stores, with their high volume and lower prices. Today, almost no one thinks the chains pose a long-term threat. Some chains are even emulating the independents' emphasis on service and breadth of stock.
For example, the 1,270-store Waldenbooks chain, cheered by the success of its Brentano operation and its Waldenbooks & More superstores, is thinking about devoting less space to non-book products, even in its mall stores -- the high-traffic locations that have stressed low price and rapid turnover, rather than selection. (Book sales in mall stores were sluggish in the first quarter because mall traffic was down generally.)
"A year ago, we changed the mix in our Waldenbooks & More from 40 percent non-books to 10 percent, and sales have increased substantially," said Charles R. Cumello, the president of Waldenbooks Inc., a unit of the K Mart Corporation.
 
More Selection, Higher Sales
 A similar pattern is discernible in the independent stores, including the smaller independents. "It's been their experience that the broader your selection, the more books you sell," said Bernard Rath, the executive director of the American Booksellers Association, whose members operate more than 7,000 stores.
About a quarter of the association's members now order books through one of two dozen computer systems, and the percentage is rising rapidly. Most such systems enable stores to record sales, check inventories and reorder electronically from the wholesalers.
As a result, booksellers do not have to tie up capital by stocking too many copies of the same book. The wholesalers can usually deliver from one to hundreds of books within 48 hours, and sometimes the next day. Booksellers can also quickly return books that are not selling for credit or for different titles. Most booksellers still place their initial orders with publishers, but reorder from wholesalers, who charge only slightly more than the publishers do.
"When I first went on the road as a sales rep in the 1970's," Mr. Rath said, "I'd make a sales call in September and booksellers would buy enough books to last through December because they'd not likely see me again for some time. These days, with the quick turnaround by wholesalers, booksellers only need to order a week's worth of books at a time."
 
An Owner's Personality
 One publisher, speaking on condition of anonymity, lamented that the independent booksellers might soon come to resemble the chains, whose buying decisions rely heavily on authors' past sales performances or on the performances of books with similar themes. But others doubt such a trend, saying independent bookstores still tend to reflect the personalities of their owners: Some specialize in literature, others in mysteries, biographies, or children's books.
Whether independent or part of a chain, bookstores continue to multiply, even though profits average a modest 3-to-5 percent of sales after salaries. Late last year, Audits and Surveys, a marketing concern, reported that the number of bookstores grew by 76 percent in the last decade, to 17,620, trailing only fast-food restaurants, which grew 78 percent, among the fastest-growing specialty stores.
Bookstore sales have increased in each of the last five years, from $4.9 billion in 1986 to an estimated $7.9 billion this year, according to the Commerce Department, and they are expected to continue growing. The American Booksellers Association estimates that retail sales will increase 8.2 percent this year over last.
"Our first quarter of this year is 7.4 percent ahead of the first quarter in 1990," Mr. Rath said. This performance, he added, was achieved in a quarter notable for a weak overall economy and for "people watching the gulf war on television for a couple of weeks, rather than buying books."

HEADLINE: The Media Business: Advertising;
Cigarette Companies Avoid Aggressive Publicity Efforts

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
NOWADAYS, the nation's leading cigarette companies are letting their advertising speak for itself -- though not entirely by choice.
It is increasingly common for marketers like Philip Morris USA, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco and the American Tobacco Company to play down, or forgo, the extensive, expensive publicity and public relations programs that were once key elements of introducing brands or advertising campaigns for existing brands. 
 Seemingly part of the past are such splashy, high-profile programs as the one Reynolds undertook in June 1989 to promote its return to Times Square with a giant billboard for Camel cigarettes. The hoopla included press kits, T-shirts, a press reception and a ceremony at which company executives pretended to turn on the gaudy neon sign for the first time.
The $40 billion industry is now immersed in one of its most intensive advertising pushes ever, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on dozens of brands. Yet publicity and public relations efforts have virtually vanished. That change is significant because it runs counter to a strong trend among most other consumer-product marketers to blitz consumers and the press with publicity and public-relations barrages.
"It's a reflection of the atmosphere we operate in," said Maura Payne, director of external communications for R. J. Reynolds. "The anti-smoking forces have so supercharged the environment, we find there's no positive benefit from us seeking publicity." As Reynolds prepares to introduce Camel Ninety Nines, a longer-length cigarette in a hard pack; continues testing Horizon, a brand that it promotes as having improved-aroma smoke, and readies an image overhaul for its flagship Winston brand, it does so without publicity or public relations campaigns.
"All the pre-launch publicity is nice if you can do it, because you end up getting something almost for free," said Emanuel Goldman, who follows the tobacco industry for Paine Webber Inc. "But today, a company might get not only the launch coverage, but coverage of the attacks launched by the anti-smoking groups."
The last time Philip Morris, the industry's sales leader, undertook a large-scale publicity and public relations campaign was for Virginia Slims Superslims in fall 1989. The debut of the Bucks and Bristol economy brands, as well as new advertising for brands including Benson & Hedges, Cambridge and Merit Ultra Lights, have gone unheralded.
"When there's a story, we do get something out," said John Nelson, vice president of corporate affairs. He said Philip Morris planned publicity and public-relations programs pegged to the introduction of Marlboro Medium, a new variety of America's largest-selling cigarette.
At American Tobacco, where marketing executives are introducing an economy brand called Bull Durham, and changing a long-running advertising campaign for Carlton, they would "rather focus their efforts elsewhere," said Roger Baker, communications director for the parent, American Brands. One reason, he said, is because they believe the media are "deluged with new-product announcements" and theirs might not draw coverage.
Joe S. Epley, president of the Public Relations Society of America and of Epley Associates, a public relations firm in Charlotte, N.C., commented: "Any corporation, whether selling tobacco or anything else, has to look at the reality of the marketplace and adapt. Whether you do more of one technique, or another technique, or just quietly introduce a product, each situation has to be evaluated in its own light."

For Papers, a Way to Deliver Profits

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
In the four months since postal rates jumped sharply, what had been a mild interest among newspapers regarding the door-to-door delivery business has become an industrywide fascination that shows signs of evolving into a passion.
Indeed, the door-to-door delivery business has emerged as one of the most enticing ways for newspapers to generate new revenues while also satisfying the increasing number of advertisers who wish to aim their messages to specific ZIP codes or even specific addresses. 
 "It's spreading from the top metro papers across the board to medium and smaller papers," said Stephen L. Thompson, the publisher of Optimum Delivery, a Dallas-based newsletter about the private postal industry.
 
Two Fierce Rivals
 At the center of this growing interest with the delivery business are Publishers Express Inc. and Alternate Postal Delivery Inc., two fierce rivals that are competing to build national delivery networks to challenge the United States Postal Service in delivering magazines, catalogues, advertising circulars and other second- and third-class mail.
Both companies are scrambling to recruit newspapers that agree to set up delivery systems in designated areas, and both charge catalogue and magazine companies less than postal rates for delivery.
The premise for both companies is that newspapers already have delivery systems, which they could expand to deliver other publications and advertising to every household in their communities.
Just as important, a newspaper creating such a system might also stop someone else from doing so. The newspapers, in turn, make their profits from local retailers by selling ads that are included in the package of material that is delivered.
 
Opening 'a Lot of Doors'
 "If we can do it properly, it will open up a lot of doors for us," said James P. Bustraan, circulation director of The News and The Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The Sun-Sentinel, which is part of the Alternate Postal Delivery network, is in its second month of delivering Good Housekeeping, The Ladies' Home Journal and some other magazines that had been delivered by mail in the Fort Lauderdale area.
The magazines, along with catalogues and advertising circulars, are packaged in plastic bags that a carrier force of about 700 -- mostly housewives -- place on front porches. Though such deliveries are available now only on a limited basis, Mr. Bustraan said the paper should be able to deliver magazines and catalogues to any of the roughly one million addresses in the Fort Lauderdale area in the near future.
Given the newspaper industry's history of making slow, cautious changes, the move to create delivery systems has moved very rapidly.
Because many papers also have supplemental publications that are delivered to nonsubscribers by third-class mail, setting up their own delivery system is a way of cutting postage costs, even if they do not join one of the two delivery networks.
 
Added Piece of Business
 But a number of papers are joining the networks to get a piece of the delivery business.
Alternate Postal Delivery, which is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., has added seven papers to its network in recent months, including The Sacramento Bee in California, The News & Record in Greensboro, N.C., and Newsday on Long Island. The company now has systems in 21 markets, and Phillip D. Miller, its president, said he expected it to be in 31 markets in the coming months, including San Francisco and St. Louis, and in 95 of the top 150 markets by 1995.
Publishers Express, which is owned by nine communications companies, including Time Warner Inc. and The New York Times Company, has concentrated on developing technology to allow each package of magazines, catalogues, samples and advertising circulars to be labeled for a specific household.
The company, which is based in Atlanta, has only recently begun to move aggressively to assemble its newspaper network, which includes The Miami Herald and The Salt Lake Tribune and The Deseret News in Salt Lake City.
 
A Goal of 75 Markets
 Howard Rosen, the president of Publishers Express, said Charleston, S.C., and several towns in Indiana would be added within the next week or so. By 1995, Publishers Express wants to be in the top 75 markets.
To some minds, the concept has not proved to be a viable business. The alternate delivery business has been tried in the past and failed for a variety of reasons, ranging from prohibitive costs of hiring a large delivery staff to an inability to assure mailers a dependability of delivery comparable to that of the Postal Service.
Lon Danielson, general manager of The Palm Beach Post in Florida, said alternate delivery had failed there because "doorsteps were too far apart" to make it economically feasible to place the package on each porch, which advertisers demand. Also, in Palm Beach, Fla., many residential areas are guarded and private delivery companies are not allowed access, while the postman is.
 
'A Lot of Unknowns'
 "There are a lot of unknowns out there yet," said Gary T. Stout, the Gannett Company's president of offset operations, which includes alternate delivery.
Late last year, Mr. Stout signed a one-year agreement with Alternate Postal Delivery, giving the papers in 16 of the largest cities where Gannett operates papers, including Nashville and Honolulu, the right to set up delivery systems.
Mr. Stout said top executives at each paper were evaluating whether to start an alternate delivery operation, and, if so, whether to join Alternate Postal Delivery's network, or that of Publishers Express, which has also courted many of the papers.
"I know a couple of them are very, very warm and have a lot of confidence in the idea," Mr. Stout said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Further Fall Seen in Foreign Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
So far this year, global demand for capital has not forced American interest rates higher, despite concerns to the contrary.
If anything, credit market analysts said, the pressures from overseas will probably ease over the next six to 12 months, as the recession in the United States, Britain and Canada spreads to the rest of the industrial world. Foreign interest rates, off their peaks from a year ago, will fall further, the analysts added. 
 Still, a decline in foreign interest rates will not automatically push down long-term bond yields in the United States, the analysts said.
 
 'A Beneficial Direction'
 "Last year, the surprise was the spike in foreign rates, and the nervousness in our markets that it was pulling up rates here," said Nicholas Sargen, a director in bond market research at Salomon Brothers. "This year, foreign rates will be moving in a beneficial direction. We think that rates in most overseas bond markets are going to be coming down. The real question is whether the American market will benefit from declines in rates abroad."
Meeting hefty needs for capital in countries like Germany and Japan did have an adverse effect on American interest rates in 1990. And as estimates of the probable costs of German reunification and rebuilding Eastern Europe and Kuwait have mounted, it seemed probable that competition for capital would remain intense this year.
 
Problem for Governments
 Another mammoth undertaking -- satisfying the Soviet Union's need for credit -- has always been seen as a problem for government creditors, not the private capital markets.
The needs for capital remain. But the economic slowdown in the United States and abroad has stretched out the period in which they will be met. "We have had such a slowdown that private-sector needs for credit in the large industrial countries has declined," said Lars Peterson, an international economist at the First Boston Corporation. "Market participants should be aware of foreign demand for capital, but it is not an immediate problem."
Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, said growth among the leading industrial countries this year was likely to be half of the 1990 pace. "The fact that there is no capital crunch is more the result of a weakening demand for capital than anything else," he added. "The test will come around the middle of 1992, when demand picks up."
 
Inflation Called Real Issue
 Even as much of Europe and the Far East starts to slow, the American economy is showing signs of a recovery after nearly 11 months of recession. Under those circumstances, "the real issue in front of the bond market is whether the recovery will be inflation-prone or not," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
Fresh information on inflation will not surface until the middle of June. And analysts expect that reports scheduled to be released this week will corroborate the notion that the recession has bottomed out.
The May survey of the nation's purchasing managers, scheduled for release today, is expected to show that while conditions in the nation's manufacturing sector improved for the third straight month, output was still weak.
 
Small Bounce for Auto Sales
 Similarly, auto sales, widely seen by credit market participants as a useful barometer of consumer activity, may show a small bounce when sales figures for the final 10 days of May are released later in the week. But analysts said an improvement would not mean that Detroit was rebounding sharply. "The public is starting to buy a few more cars," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz.
Vehicle sales, which have been running at an annual rate of about 5.5 million units, should move up to about 6 million in coming months, Ms. Keller said. "That is a lot better, but it is not terrific," she added, saying that auto production was not likely to pick up until the fourth quarter.
 
Rise in Jobless Expected
 Most economists do not harbor much hope that the monthly report from the Labor Department on employment conditions, expected on Friday, will show that recent patterns will suddently be reversed. The pace of layoffs probably slowed last month, economists said, but the overall unemployment rate, which dipped to 6.6 percent in April, probably moved up again.
Based on recent forecasts, most analysts were projecting that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 75,000 last month, down from 124,000 in April. Despite the smaller decline, most forecasters project that the unemployment rate probably rose to 6.8 percent.
A rise in the jobless rate would doubtless set off political alarms in Washington, but the Federal Reserve will probably not respond by immediately easing monetary policy. "I think there is still an inclination at the Fed to ease one more time, given the weakness of the economy and the desire to assure the recovery," said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. "But they won't do it until the inflation numbers allow them to do it in a credible way."
Right now, "the bond market is standing in the way of the Fed," said Mr. Kudlow of Bear, Stearns. "I don't expect any more easing moves this year, but they have to wait for a rally before they even think of doing something."

HEADLINE: U.S. Still Seeks Lower Rates Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 2

 BODY:
When the industrial world's finance ministers gather here on Tuesday, the United States will continue to press other countries to lower their interest rates, American officials say.
At the annual ministers' meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will ask the industrial nations to tilt their policies more vigorously toward growth, these officials said. 
 Mr. Brady may not hammer so hard on lowering rates as he has in recent months, however, because some European countries, notably Spain and Britain, have recently cut interest rates. Nonetheless, Germany, with its robust growth and dire fears of inflation, is expected to reject his call for lower rates, just as it rebuffed his pleas at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington in April.
The annual meeting of the O.E.C.D., a Paris-based organization that seeks to foster economic cooperation and growth, brings together finance, trade and foreign ministers from 24 industrial nations.
 
 Concern About Recession
 Explaining why Washington believes more needs to be done to lower rates, Alan P. Larson, the permanent American representative to the organization, said, "There has been a tendency in the past year to overestimate inflationary pressures and underestimate recessionary pressures."
Policy makers in some countries have derided Mr. Brady's campaign to lower rates, accusing him of meddling in their affairs and being too casual about inflationary pressures.
Officials doing preliminary work for this week's meeting said the ministers would strive to resuscitate stalled world trade talks. In addition, in a move that aims to integrate Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia into the West, the ministers have invited officials from those three countries to the session to sign accords that could lead to their membership in the group later in this decade.
At the meeting, which is expected to help define the issues for the Group of Seven summit in London in July, the ministers will also debate whether and how much financial and technical aid the West should give the Soviet Union. The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
 
Upbeat Outlook
 Despite the recessions in the United States and Britain, Jean-Claude Paye, the O.E.C.D.'s secretary general, gave an upbeat economic outlook last week for the industrial world. He said its growth would rebound to 2.5 percent in the second half of this year and 3 percent next year, after being flat in the first half of 1991.
Some officials of the organization acknowledged that these assessments were intentionally buoyant. "There is good reason to intentionally be a little overoptimistic," one official in the organization said. "It's very important for the Group of 24 industrialized countries to give the outside world a hopeful sign."
In recent years the ministerial meetings have emphasized keeping inflation down, liberalizing trade and persuading Washington to reduce its budget deficit. This year there will clearly be more concern about stimulating growth.
"The United States will want everyone to keep their eye on the ball, and growth is an extremely important objective," said one American official, noting that growth will help not only industrial nations, but also Eastern Europe and the third world. This official said that unlike some countries, Washington regards persistent high interest rates "as a problem" and "not a virtue."
 
'Two Schools of Thought'
 The nub of the dispute is that Washington thinks that Germany's powerful central bank might be overzealous in raising rates to fight inflation and that the Bundesbank's high rates are braking growth in Europe and elsewhere. But Germany, enjoying strong growth and seeing its inflation increase, says high rates are warranted.
"There are obviously two schools of thought," said Katsunari Suzuki, Japan's permanent deputy representative to the O.E.C.D. "One is more interested in controlling inflation and the other one is more interested in encouraging economic growth. These two schools of thought naturally reflect the state of the economies in their respective countries."
With its unemployment rising, France backs Washington's call for lower rates, while Japan is in no rush to reduce rates.
In a speech on Thursday in Zurich, Karl Otto Pohl, the departing president of the Bundesbank, gave Washington little hope that Germany's central bankers would bend to pressures to lower rates. "You will understand why interest rates in Germany must be so high," he said. "In real terms, they must be high because we have a crazy demand for capital." 
 
Momentum for Trade Talks
 O.E.C.D. officials see the meeting as an opportunity to put some momentum into the faltering four-and-a-half-year talks to liberalize world trade that are known as the Uruguay Round because they began in that country. Few officials expect major breakthroughs on the issues bogging down the talks, most of all reducing subsidies to farmers, where Washington is at loggerheads with the European Community. Some officials said the ministers would call for reaching an agreement by the end of this year.
The ministers will also debate limiting what is known as tied aid to Eastern Euriope and the Soviet Union. Under these arrangements, industrial nations grant aid on condition that the recipients use the money to buy goods from the donor nations. Washington is pushing for an end to such aid, but some European nations want it continued.

HEADLINE: Rise Seen In Hiring in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Recent graduates and other job seekers may soon find that jobs are not so scarce.
A survey of business hiring plans by Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary-employment agency, forecasts a notable upturn in the third quarter, which begins on July 1. Such a development is eagerly awaited by economists since a recovery cannot take hold as long as people are losing jobs and incomes. 
 "This is the first sign of a positive trend we've seen since the third quarter of 1989, when hiring projections began to slide," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Manpower, based in Milwaukee, which conducted the survey.
 
Expansion by 22 Percent
The quarterly survey, published over the weekend, found that 22 percent of 15,000 businesses intended to expand their work forces during the summer while 10 percent planned to cut employment during the quarter, producing what Manpower called a net hiring strength factor of plus 12.
This is considerably ahead of the first two quarters of 1990, when the strength factors were the lowest since 1982, and exceeded the normal jump for this time of year.
When adjusted for seasonal variation, the latest figure of plus seven compares with plus one in the second quarter and represented what Manpower called the first trend reversal after nine straight quarters in which the strength factor either declined or remained unchanged.
 
A Predictive Indicator
 Although employment itself is considered a coincident indicator of business conditions, shifting about the same time as the economy at large, the Manpower survey is regarded as a leading, or predictive, indicator since it deals with intentions. Mr. Fromstein said in an interview that these were usually carried out. "What was projected usually happens," he emphasized.
Another predictive labor market indicator, published each Thursday by the Labor Department, is the number of people who have filed initial claims for unemployment insurance. This series seems to have peaked in March, when claims soared above 500,000, well above the 450,000 level of recent weeks.
The Government's monthly report on the labor market, covering May, is to be published on Friday. Analysts expect further modest payroll job losses, along with a probable uptick in the unemployment rate, which eased two-tenths of a point in April, to 6.6 percent.
Manpower's hiring-strength figures do appear to have anticipated both the brief 1980 recession and the extended 1981-82 recession, though by far the weakest figures were in 1982.
The survey, based on telephone interviews with public and private employers in 476 cities, has been conducted quarterly since 1976.
The latest data showed improvement in all four geographic regions, including the sharply depressed Northeast, where responses remained at 1982 recession levels.
Seasonally adjusted, the Northeast moved from a strength factor of minus seven to zero for the third quarter, with the Midwest improving from four to ten, the South from three to eight and the West from three to seven, according to supplementary Manpower data.
 
Some Exceptions in Gains
 By types of business, all sectors except transportation, public utilities, education and public administration show strong recovery from the second-quarter lows, Manpower said.
The most notable increases are expected to be in construction, the manufacture of nondurable goods and in wholesale and retail trades and services.
Mr. Fromstein remained cautious, however, about the projected upturn in hiring. "It is difficult at this early stage to predict a sustained recovery," he said. "But the first step toward that result is clearly in evidence."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Trends Expected To Aid Brinker

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
STOCKS of restaurant companies with casual themes and varied moderate-priced menus have lit up Wall Street this year, rising in market value as a group by nearly 50 percent.
The group is prospering despite the recession because of the bulging numbers of aging adults and families with school-age children who often favor more leisurely full-service meals over quick trips to a McDonald's or Burger King. 
 Analysts say Brinker International Inc., operator of the fast-growing Chili's chain, should continue to outpace much of this group, which also includes Cracker Barrel, Sbarro, Buffets and Shoney's. Brinker's shares closed Friday at $39.125, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 69 percent this year.
Michael G. Mueller, restaurant analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said that Brinker, which changed its corporate name last month from Chili's Inc. while retaining the name for the chain, has one of the best-regarded management teams in the restaurant business. "They are good at delivering what they promise and the balance sheet is very strong," he said. "Five years from now, Brinker will be a much bigger company relative to where it is now than a fast-food company like McDonald's."
Demographic trends should help. The number of people in the 45-to-54-year-old age group is expected to increase by 47 percent this decade, with the 35-to-44 age group rising by 18 percent. The 25-to-34 age group will narrow by 15 percent, and the 18-to-24 group by 3 percent.
And big chains controlled just 22 percent of the $75 billion market for moderate-price full-service restaurants last year, compared with 65 percent of the $77 billion fast-food market. That means chains could grow more rapidly by piling up market share in the moderate-price sector, even if a sluggish economy keeps overall sales tepid.
Several analysts expect Brinker's earnings to climb another 50 percent or so by 1993, to about $2.05 a share, compared with an estimated $1.37 for the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30. In the first three months of the year, when the recession and the Persian Gulf war emptied many restaurants, Brinker's sales rose 25 percent, to $107.2 million, and net income rose 71 percent, to $6.4 million, or 34 cents a share.
The company's pretax earnings have soared more than fivefold since 1986, to an estimated $39 million for the 1991 fiscal year. Equity has risen to more than $200 million since the company went public in 1984 with $24 million in equity.
Norman Brinker, the 60-year-old chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that the company calculated a year ago that it should reach $1 billion in sales by 1995, up from $530 million this year, with its total employment increasing to 50,000, from 25,000.
He said the main challenges were internal: developing managers and buying or leasing good locations not only for Chili's but for two new divisions, Regas Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill. The new concepts were added by acquisitions in 1989 as part of Mr. Brinker's goal of keeping yearly sales and profits growing faster than 20 percent. With no long-term debt except for property leases and with $32 million in cash, Mr. Brinker has few worries about financing more expansion.
Analysts say the rapid growth of Chili's is bound to slow. The chain includes 239 restaurants in 37 states, up from seven locations when Mr. Brinker and his partners acquired control of the Dallas-based company in 1983. They plan to add at least 40 Chili's a year, with an eye toward building Regas Grill and Macaroni Grill into faster-growing generators of sales later in the decade.
Patrons pay an average of $7.50 each on a visit to Chili's, but at the handful of Regas and Romano's sites the average cost is higher, at $15 apiece per person. Regas, with steak and seafood, appeals more to adults. Macaroni Grill is following the path of Olive Garden, a family-style chain featuring varied Italian dishes that General Mills has rapidly expanded in recent years. Brinker has 14 locations for Regas and 3 for Macaroni Grill. Chili's was started in Dallas and expanded nationwide.
An old hand at developing menus for shifting consumer tastes, Mr. Brinker founded the Steak & Ale chain and merged it into the restaurant group of the Pillsbury Company, which included Burger King and later Bennigan's and Poppin' Fresh restaurants. After heading the group for a year, he resigned in 1983 and began anew at Chili's.
Burgers contributed 70 percent of the sales of Chili's in 1984, but Mr. Brinker slowly transformed and broadened the menu. New items like fajitas, salads, barbecue ribs and chicken sandwiches now contribute 60 percent of sales, with burgers at 9 percent.
Brinker's shares are priced at a steep 30 times earnings, but John J. Rohs, a managing director and restaurant analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, in New York, said the premium was warranted because of past performance and growth prospects, despite some weakness in recent weeks.
And Steven A. Rockwell of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., in Baltimore, predicted that the shares could reach $54 in a year if earnings estimates proved accurate. "There is no sign of any weakness in the company's fundamentals," he said. But he added that the overall condition of the market must remain favorable if the stock is to remain strong.

HEADLINE: The Talk Of The Book Show;
Hot Books, Cool Town For 10,000 At Meeting

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
After a steamy and nondescript Saturday, the air-conditioning and some hot books appeared yesterday to give an upbeat twist to the plot involving more than 10,000 booksellers and publishers thrown together, like passengers on a giant ocean liner, in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
 It was not that the "R" word had been abruptly conjured away by the fertile literary minds of those attending the four-day American Booksellers Association convention, which ends tomorrow. But nobody had been mugged, and amid the hubbub of publishers imagining great things for their books, the recession did seem to be further away and, with any luck, on the wane. 
 "People came here thinking that having gone through a war and the recession, the worst part of the year was already behind them," said Jack Romanos, the president of Simon & Schuster's mass-market division. "They want to believe that sales will now pick up."
In the first five months of the year, said George Craig, chief executive of HarperCollins, "we have taken a beating on adult fiction, nonfiction and mass-market books."
If there is to be an imminent upturn, an unusually rich array of fall books by best-selling authors should help. Stephen King, Danielle Steel, Len Deighton and Tom Clancy all have new works, and there is even Alexandra Ripley's long-awaited sequel to "Gone With the Wind." But the most talked-about book at the convention was Amy Tan's "The Kitchen God's Wife," her second novel, which is to be published later this year by the Putnam Berkley Group.
"Her impact seems to be so great; we need Amy Tans by the shovelful," said Constance Sayre, a publishing consultant at Market Partners International.
Nothing, however, stirs the imagination of publishers and booksellers like a first novel; the thought of coaxing an undiscovered talent to stardom can send them into paroxysms. Several first novels caused excitement and were being talked about by the hordes of foreign publishers stalking the aisles in pursuit of books that will sell in their markets.
Among them were Donna Tartt's "The God of Illusions" (Alfred A. Knopf), which was being compared to William Golding's "The Lord of the Flies;" J. F. Freedman's thriller "Against the Wind" (Viking Penguin), which some likened to Scott Turow's "Presumed Innocent;" Alan Kuzweil's "A Case of Curiosities" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), which is said to evoke Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose," and Ethan Canin's "Blue River" (Houghton Mifflin), for which no comparison had emerged.
In nonfiction, pickings were much slimmer. "There is suprisingly little good nonfiction about," said Ashbel Green, a vice president of Alfred A. Knopf. Nik Cohn's "The Heart of the World" (Knopf), a study of Broadway, was one of the few nonfiction works to provoke foreign interest.
How soon all the big new books will have a significant impact on sales remained a much-debated question. "The uplift is there," said William W. Rickman, the president of Kroch's & Brentano's, a chain of 19 stores in the Chicago area. "My impression is, we have bottomed out." But Jack Hoeft, the president of Bantam Doubleday Dell, said, "The fall will be difficult and I see a long pull to Christmas."
The booksellers convention is always frenetic, but it is more so this year because it is being held in New York. There are an estimated 15,000 writers living in New York City, and many have decided the convention provides a rare opportunity to exercise their egos and promote themselves. Of course, they expect suitable hospitality from their publishers.
Moreover, unlike the times when conventions are held out of town, New York publishers have to run their offices at the same time; and when they get home, everyday chores await them. "It's such a drag having to feed the cat, open the mail and cook your own meals," said Pat Connolly, a marketing consultant. "God, I yearn for room service."
Foreigners have also complicated matters by arriving in unprecedented numbers. However squalid its residents may find it, New York still has much glamorous appeal overseas. "It's the first, second, third and fourth worlds combined," explained the writer Gloria Steinem.
There were, for example, 2,300 French publishers in town, according to Antoine Audouard, the managing director of the Paris-based Fixot house. The opening of Eastern Europe has also provoked a novelty: neo-capitalists from the Soviet Union and its former satellites hunting for books. More than ever, publishers thus have had to divide their time between discussions with booksellers -- the original aim of the convention -- and negotiations over foreign rights.
"This time, the A.B.A. is so important because the town is New York, and New York, it IS publishing," said Maria Giulia Castagnone of Milan's Sperling & Kupfer publishers. She had snapped up Bob Woodward's "The Commanders" for the Italian market.
The fact that foreign publishers are New Yorkophiles was evident in the appointment book of Marcella Ber
Mr. Audouard of Fixot described the A.B.A. as indispensable. It was a chance, he said, to breathe "l'air." It was also, he hinted, a chance to make some pretty serious francs. Four years ago, for example, he picked up the French rights to Betty Mahmoodi's "Not Without My Daughter" for $5,000 at the A.B.A. Fixot has sold 2.4 million copies of the book in France.
This A.B.A. seemed a little "muted" -- that was the favored word -- compared with the high jinks of the Las Vegas convention last year. So around noon yesterday, word went out that HarperCollins had what one foreign agent called "an incredibly hot and secret book."
Mr. Craig, chief executive of HarperCollins, was dismayed. "As soon as I find out what it is," he said morosely, "I will let you know."
Even in drab reality, the convention offered some encouragement to American industry. People from throughout the world were in the Javits center looking for books, new marketing ideas and other inspiration. "This is one American industry in which there is very little foreign competition," said Peter Jovanovich, the chief executive of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. "We are still the world leader in the field. You go into a store in Tokyo, and it is dominated by American books."
True value and niches are in. Children's books, religious books and scientific books have all held up much better in the recession than general-interest works. Backlists are being successfully revived -- notably by Bantam Doubleday Dell -- with newly aggressive marketing. A book, it is being recalled, is something to keep, not merely an object with which to make a quick publicity splash.
Typical of the trend is Alfred A. Knopf's re-release of J. M. Dent's Everyman's Library -- classics of literature that will be printed on wove paper with full-cloth, sewn bindings and sold for about $20 each. A year after that, the Random House imprint -- Knopf's rival within the Random House empire -- will reissue the classic Modern Library series with similar fanfare.
"The Everyman idea is a great idea -- people are looking for quality," said Mr. Rickman of Kroch's & Brentano's.
But is the A.B.A. worth it? The convention -- between parties, booths and other promotions -- costs major publishers hundreds of thousands of dollars. In a few cases, the figure goes over $1 million. With the difficult times, this spending is under intense scrutiny.
Taking an unprecedented step, Thomas J. McCormack, the chief executive of St. Martin's Press, withdrew from this year's convention. "I just do not think it is useful," he said. "I can spend that money a lot better on other things."
Mr. Hoeft, the president of Bantam Doubleday Dell, said deciding whether the A.B.A. was worth it was "a tough one. We are going to evaluate it every year." The company has cut its participation at the Frankfurt Book Fair this year. Instead of sending 30 people, it will send about half that number, and the company's booth will be half the size.
Other executives, including Charles E. Hayward, the president of Simon & Schuster's trade book division, said the fact that so many foreign rights sales were now made at the A.B.A. convention added to its value.
The real value, however, may lie elsewhere. In an industry that thrives on people's desire to escape reality through books, the A.B.A. is an opportunity to dream a little and dream together. And if you can talk your way out of a recession, you can probably dream your way, too, especially in the irrational world of books.

HEADLINE: Political Alliance Ruling Panama Breaks Up

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 27

 BODY:
The political alliance that fought Panama's military dictatorship for years and led the return to democracy 16 months ago has fallen apart, with the Christian Democratic Party going into opposition to the Government of which it was previously the strongest component.
Both sides say this was a normal step at some point in the democratic transition, although Ricardo Arias Calderon, the Christian Democratic leader, said he thought it was "premature." 
 "But the initiative was not ours," he added.
 A combination of differences over economic changes and animosities over the power exercised by various people appear to have led to the decision of President Guillermo Endara to oust the Christian Democrats in April.
The rupture was preceded by days of venting of political emotions in which Mr. Endara accused Mr. Arias of trying to tap his telephones and the President's wife, Ana Mae de Endara, asserted that the Christian Democrats had used parliamentary tactics amounting to a coup attempt.
Ruben Carles, the Comptroller General, whose influence over economic policy was one thing the Christian Democrats had criticized, said the Christian Democrats "had thought they were in a position to push the President around, but they miscalculated."
Constitutionally, Mr. Arias Calderon remains First Vice President in the Government that was elected in May 1989 and took office after the removal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in the United States' invasion of December 1989. But he has no office and no assigned duties, and his party lost the five Cabinet posts it held, along with other important jobs.
"I now consider myself the chief of the democratic opposition," Mr. Arias said. "We are going to examine rigorously all Government proposals, but with strict respect for democracy."
The Christian Democrats are the largest single force in the National Assembly, with 28 seats; what is now the three-party Government coalition has 27 seats. The Democratic Revolutionary Party, or P.R.D., the political organization created by Omar Torrijos Herrera, who preceded Mr. Noriega as the military strongman, assumes new importance because its 10 seats allow it to form a majority with either side.
"This gives new life to the followers of Torrijos and Noriega," Mr. Arias said. "We think the P.R.D. will ask for some tolerance by the Government for crimes of the past."
Mr. Carles, who like Mr. Arias was exiled by General Torrijos and came back at the beginning of the 1980's to help build the opposition, said the other forces in the Government had no disagreement with the Christian Democrats over the need to maintain democracy and respect for human rights.
"But the Christian Democrats need to define themselves more on economic questions, like repaying the foreign debt and going forward with privatizations," he said.
Mr. Carles argued strongly for recognizing and repaying the debt, which he put at $6 billion, as a means of restoring Panama's credit standing. But he asserted that the Christian Democrats had doubts on that point.
Mr. Arias said he felt that the Government had paid too much attention to restoring credibility in the eyes of foreign creditors and not enough attention to repaying some of the "social debt" that had built up in recent years among the poorest Panamanians.
"This Government has done nothing to help those who will suffer from the economic reorganization," he said. "We want a government oriented more toward the middle and lower-middle classes."
Mr. Carles said that many of the belt-tightening measures being undertaken by the Government at the behest of creditors and would-be creditors, like raising the retirement age for women from 50 to 60, were necessitated by the fact that "during the military dictatorship the Government granted special favors to everybody."
"The holiday is over now," he said. "This Government wants to eliminate special privileges, so everybody is against us." But he added, "A democracy needs an opposition -- an intelligent opposition pursuing issues."

HEADLINE: Americans Complain of Bias By Japanese Bosses in U.S.

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
As more and more Japanese companies open for business in the United States, Americans contend that there is a new kind of discrimination: They say Japanese employers are reserving the best jobs for Japanese managers.
There are no statistics to document the extent of the problem, and it clearly does not apply to every Japanese employer in the United States. Japanese companies employ less than 1 percent of 118 million working Americans. 
 But some mighty names in Japanese industry -- Matsushita, Sumitomo, NEC Electronics -- settled lawsuits charging discrimination against American managers in just the past year.
 
Top-Heavy With Japanese
 Beyond specific complaints of discrimination, critics say Japanese companies in the United States are top-heavy with Japanese managers. Japanese men hold more than half of the top 20 or so management jobs in many Japanese banks and trading companies in America, and sometimes all but one or two.
The proportions are smaller in most manufacturing companies, but they still far exceed the proportions of Europeans in the top ranks of European companies in America, or of Americans in American companies abroad, corporate consultants say. As Japanese companies continue to expand in the United States, these consultants say that the big ones are redoubling their efforts to avoid discrimination but that the arrival of smaller, less sophisticated newcomers presage more skirmishes with American employees.
Some recent cases put the issue in stark relief. In a lawsuit against a Ricoh Corporation plant here, to be heard in September in Federal District Court in San Francisco, Chet Mackentire, a former top marketing executive making about $75,000 a year, says he was dismissed solely because he was American.
Mr. Mackentire asserts that after he paved the way for the company to reach American customers with a new product, optical disks used for storing information in computers, his functions were assigned to a Japanese man. "They keep us long enough to learn what we know," he said. "Americans are disposable commodities for them."
 
'Reasonable Cause' to Sue
 Investigators for the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that Mr. Mackentire had a reasonable cause to sue. The commission investigators wrote that the Japanese man was less qualified for the job, in both experience and education, than Mr. Mackentire, and that the atmosphere at the company was "tainted with national origin bias." Americans, the finding said, would be excluded from meetings of their Japanese bosses and subordinates.
The Japanese do not deny that they rely heavily on Japanese managers, but they attribute that reliance to cultural considerations, not discrimination. Because the Japanese share a common tradition and approach to doing business, they say, it is simply more efficient and comfortable for them to look to themselves for leadership, at least for now.
"We admit that the number of Americans in management is quite limited," said Takii Mitsuo, executive director of the Japanese External Trade Organization in New York, which promotes trade with the United States. "Japanese companies like to keep management the Japanese way. It's due to cultural and language issues. They need the deep human relationships that they have with the parent companies in Tokyo."
Justin L. Camerlengo, a spokesman for the Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation of America, added that Japanese companies were cautious with their American investments. "They like to watch them for a long period of time before turning them over," he said. At a fast-growing Matsushita factory in Georgia with 750 employees, Mr. Camerlengo said, 42 of 100 managers are Japanese, but that is down from 58 a year or two ago. He added the number would continue to slide.
Late last year, a Federal court in Chicago penalized the Quasar television set company, a Matsushita subsidiary in Franklin Park, Ill., $2.5 million in damages for discrimination on grounds of national origin, a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights law. Three managers had complained that the company had dismissed 66 American managers to cut costs five years ago but retained all its Japanese managers. The company is appealing the decision.
The defenders of Japanese companies find additional support, or at least understanding, from some American experts.
In view of Japan's commercial success, Robert E. Cole, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the the Japanese automobile industry in the United States, said "it's easy to think your way is best."
"They tend to be less willing to relinquish control to local units," Mr. Cole said of the Japanese. "The power is really kept in Tokyo."
It is possible, too, that the Japanese are no more discriminatory than Americans -- that they just have not lived in a society that has sensitized people against open displays of discrimination.
"In the United States we have this notion that discrimination is wrong," said Linda Krieger, a former Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawyer who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. "So we're more covert -- even if we have the same attitudes."
But to critics, the heavy reliance on managers of a single nationality -- and, for that matter, on men -- betrays ignorance or open defiance of American law. The law protects people of various nationalities, Americans included, from workplace discrimination in just the same way that it protects women and minority groups.
Job discrimination by the Japanese is a delicate issue, and American and Japanese officials discuss it reluctantly. The Bush Administration, eager to lure Japanese investment to the United States, treats the issue gingerly. And the last thing the Japanese say they need is to be labled as chauvinists, which could taint the rapport they have built with American consumers.
The Standard & Poor's directory of corporations shows 11 Japanese names among 13 officers listed by the Sumitomo Bank of California in San Francisco, and 47 among 72 names at the Bank of Tokyo Trust Company in New York, some of whom are likely to be Americans of Japanese descent. But the Bank of California in San Francisco, owned by Mitsubishi and once a target of a Federal affirmative action investigation, shows just two Japanese names among 48 officers.
Some Japanese companies are clearly trying hard to diversify their work forces, in some cases after skirmishes with the courts and Federal regulators. The automotive giants Toyota, Honda and Nissan have relatively small numbers of Japanese executives in the United States and growing representations of female and minority workers in their American operations.
Still, the records of public agencies that investigate job discrimination show a pattern of complaints against Japanese companies, especially here in California, which has 246 of the 1,433 American manufacturing plants that are owned entirely or partly by the Japanese. In response to a legally enforceable request from The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act, the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs in San Francisco disclosed agreements negotiated with eight Japanese employers to end discriminatory practices, mostly over the last three years.
 
Not Particularly Meaningful
 The number of agreements is not particularly meaningful. The regional office, which covers California, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii, investigated 454 companies last year, mostly in California, and all but 86 were found in violation of antidiscrimination regulations, most of them minor. No record is kept of the national ownership of the companies investigated, and the eight were just those the staff knew to be Japanese. But the number appears roughly in line with the relatively small number of Japanese companies in the United States.
Although none of the eight employers admitted to wrongdoing, all were found with multiple violations of the Presidential order that authorizes the compliance office to investigate companies and audit their affirmative action programs. The violations dealt with the entire work forces, including managers. Several of the companies were found to have minuscule numbers of female, black and Hispanic workers, even though many qualified women and minority members lived nearby. Others had not instituted affirmative action programs, with the attendant hiring plans and records of work-force composition.
At the Ricoh plant in San Jose, officials referred questions about Mr. Mackentire's lawsuit to the company's lawyer, Dov M. Grunschlag. "The company's position is simply that he was laid off as part of a reduction in force in a division that was losing money and where all the middle management positions were eliminated at the same time," Mr. Grunschlag said. "There's nothing unusual in that. In certain economic conditions, that happens."
But no Japanese, either workers or managers, were dismissed. And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in determining that Mr. Mackentire had cause to sue, contended that the Japanese man who replaced him was less qualified for the job in both experience and education.
 
Lawsuits Settled
 Japanese companies are also accused of discrimination against rank-and-file workers, although their record in this regard appears no better or worse than that of American companies. Since the start of the 1980's, at least a score of other companies, including Honda, Hitachi, and several banks, have settled suits by employees or charges by Federal agencies for discriminating against women and minority members.
One case is the first involving a Japanese company that the E.E.O.C. is pursuing in Federal court on its own, rather than leaving it to plaintiffs. It concerns a Los Angeles employment agency affiliated with Recruit Cosmos, the real estate company at the center of the stock and influence-peddling scandal that toppled Prime Minister Takeshita last year.
The commission says workers at the employment agency, Interplace/ Transworld Recruit, which specialized in placing workers for Japanese employers in California, devised their own variations of a practice that the E.E.O.C. has recently found several American-owned employment agencies to be using as well. Interplace agents used code words among themselves to specify potential workers by sex, race and nationality. "Talk to Adam" meant the employer wanted a man. "Talk to Mariko" meant he wanted a Japanese. "Talk to Eve; suite 20-30" meant the client wanted a white woman aged 20 to 30.
The employment agency's lawyer, Walter Cochran-Bond, would not discuss the charges, saying the company was in the midst of negotiations to reach a settlement.

HEADLINE: CASH CRISES FORCE LOCALITIES IN U.S. TO SLASH SERVICES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Weakened by recession and by drastic reductions in state and Federal aid, cities and counties around the country are shedding or slashing many of the services that have helped define their mission for decades.
As mayors and governing bodies try to balance their budgets for the 1992 fiscal year, which begins on July 1 for most, the reductions are epidemic. Honolulu is cutting back on road repairs. Sacramento, Calif., cannot open its new main library. Salt Lake City cannot build a fire station for a growing neighborhood. Houston is eliminating 111 hospital beds for indigent patients. Bridgeport, Conn., plans to stop cleaning its streets on July 1 and may stop guarding its beaches this summer. 
 Urban experts and mayors around the country say that not since the 1930's have so many cities faced such crippling fiscal constraints or lack of Federal, state and taxpayer support. "Cities are facing the toughest times since the Great Depression," said Mayor Sidney J. Barthelemy of New Orleans, president of the National League of Cities.
 
'The Day of Reckoning'
 Urban specialists confirm that bleak assessment and say the new fiscal year will bring a huge shakeout in services. "The day of reckoning cannot be put off any longer," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in Albany.
To be sure, some welcome the day of reckoning. Daniel J. Mitchell, an economist who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research organization that stresses private enterprise, said the end of the boom of the 1980's would "hopefully force these governments to not waste so much money."
The hardest-hit cities and counties are in the Northeast and Middle West, which have lost tax revenue as jobs and businesses fall victim to the recession. But Western and Southern cities with stronger economies are also struggling to meet the service demands of their growing populations.
As cities raise taxes and cut spending, economists fear that the money taken from consumers' pockets could inhibit recovery from the recession.
Researchers may take months to provide a national picture of the changes occurring in city budgets and services, but 50 interviews with professional organizations and municipal officials across the country provide a snapshot report. Whether the cities surveyed were large or small, growing or shrinking, well managed or not, officials in most places said they had already made all of the easy budget reductions and had begun cutting highly visible, direct services.
The service reductions and tax increases are driving out middle-class residents, leaving behind people with a greater share of social problems and needs, further adding to the cities' burdens. This trend makes it harder and harder for cities to muster the kind of broad political support that gave rise to Federal antipoverty programs in the 1960's and revenue sharing in the 1970's. "I'm pretty pessimistic," Mr. Nathan said.
He and other experts say that cities cannot possibly solve their social problems alone, but that no one wants to help them until local officials prove that they know what they are doing and can spend money wisely.
 
The Libraries Suffer
 The decline of public libraries is one barometer of the problems facing local governments across the country. "These are the worst cutbacks that libraries have gone through in this century," said Linda F. Crismond, executive director of the American Library Association.
The library association recently conducted a 50-state survey that found widespread reductions in hours and many branch closings. In Montana, Missoula Public Library was recently closed for three weeks. In Massachusetts, cities closed 20 branch libraries and many bookmobiles. In Pennsylvania, the state plans to reduce library aid by $2.5 million.
Even some libraries in high-growth states like Nevada are, as one librarian put it, "planning for disaster." In New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins has proposed a 33 percent reduction that will, according to his budget statement, "result in many branch closings and reduced days of service in all boroughs."
Sacramento spent $25 million building its new downtown Central Library and had expected to open it in January 1992. But the city, which faces a $26 million gap in its $234 million budget for fiscal year 1992, plans to delay the opening for six months.
"We've never had this much of a budget deficit," said Sacramento's Mayor, Anne Rudin. But she conceded that in searching for ways to save money she had found some surprising inefficiencies. "Every time someone needs medical help and calls 911, they get an ambulance and a fire truck," she said.
In St. Louis, Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. decided that hot-house flowers are expendable. The city is closing its Jewel Box, an Art Deco glass and steel pavilion of greenhouses that is a St. Louis institution. "A tropical rain forest is not part of the central mission of St. Louis," the Mayor said.
The big cities have the big problems, but thousands of counties and small cities are also slashing services. Facing what officials call its worst and most chaotic budget problems in memory, Suffolk County, L.I., has begun furloughing most of its 12,000 employees every Friday. Yet the furloughs, which are reducing street cleaning, nursing home programs, consumer-protection investigations and hundreds of other services, will make up only $4.5 million of the county's $60 million budget gap this fiscal year.
Nearly all of the nation's 425 counties with populations over 100,000 are also looking to reduce services or raise taxes or both, said James D. Golden, director of research for the National Association of Counties. "I would say that we have more counties in a fiscal crunch than ever before," he said, "and it is going to get worse because counties typically lag behind cities by about two years in feeling the effects of reduced Federal and state funding."
And the smaller counties have the most problems. "Rural America has had a tough time for the last five years, what with farm problems and unemployment. The situation is bad and it's getting worse," Mr. Golden said.
If Bangor, Me., cannot raise $50,784 in tax revenue to pay "the world's best children's dentist," in the words of City Manager Edward A. Barrett, Bangor will lose $64,500 in Federal Medicaid grants, and more than 600 indigent children will be at risk of decaying teeth.
The dentist, Dr. John C. Frachella, is so highly prized that his 20-year-old dental clinic for the children of low-income families appears on Mr. Barrett's "end of the world scenario" of service reductions.
In California, where the tax revolt began in 1978 when voters halved their property taxes by passing Proposition 13, many cities are having trouble. In 1989, cities collected 17 percent less tax revenue per person than they did in 1978, according to James R. Harrington, the assistant director of the League of California Cities. Last year, almost a third of California's cities cut services, and a quarter raised taxes.
Los Angeles is facing a $177 million gap in next year's budget, after having just closed a $126 million gap in the current year's budget with service reductions and salary reductions.
 The city is considering cutting the 8,417-member police force by not hiring officers to replace 445 who leave. Mayor Tom Bradley has proposed reductions in library hours, tree trimming, park and recreation programs, traffic signal repairs and street resurfacing, along with new taxes on property transfers and cable television and increases in water and sewer fees.
San Francisco officials say they are still cutting into the fat of government. "We are a shining example of a city that is not slashing services," said Scott Shafer, press secretary to Mayor Art Agnos. The city froze the wages of city workers, laid off 150 people, raised parking taxes and transit fares to rein in a projected $135 million gap in next year's $1.36 billion budget.
Philadelphia has yet to get its finances under control. City Council's budget proposals, considered speculative at best, do not reduce services, but do not provide $26 million for the projected growth in demand for programs for abused children or an $11 million subsidy owed to local mass transit.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Believe Iraq Will Take Years to Rebuild

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Three months after the Persian Gulf war devastated Iraq's military and many of its civilian industries, the country remains seriously incapacitated, facing a potentially catastrophic health crisis this summer and many years of rebuilding its civilian economy, Bush Administration analysts say.
A comprehensive assessment of the damage from the intense 43-day allied bombardment remains classified within the Administration, which has been reluctant to divulge details. But an overview of the damage to key sectors of Iraq's economy emerged in recent days from a series of interviews with Administration analysts, who agreed to discuss it if they were not identified. 
 The assessment indicates that Iraq's electrical power industry may have been damaged well beyond the intentions of allied war planners, who developed a still-secret weapon that dropped thousands of metallic filaments onto the electrical network at key points to create huge short-circuits and blackouts on the night of January 17th, when the war began. This was followed by precision strikes on power plants.
 
Most Power Still Out
 Even now, 80 percent of the the nation's power grid is out of service, and electrical shortages are aggravating the crisis in health care.
In addition, allied warplanes wrecked Iraq's civilian telecommunications system, described as a total loss by one estimate; and the bombing campaign seriously damaged the national network of roads and bridges, crippling commerce in a nation that straddles two major river valleys, those of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Generally, the war damage seems less visible in Baghdad than in many areas of the countryside.
The critical sector of oil production, the dynamo that drives Iraq's economy, requires a major infusion of cash, about $1.5 billion, to get its export pipelines going at prewar levels; and Iraq may not be able to maintain its gasoline production without Western technology, spare parts and expertise in the near term. Because of the international trade sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait, however, Iraq has been unable to import urgently needed equipment and has not sold a cargo of oil, its principal source of income, since last August.
One of the major mysteries remains how many Iraqi soldiers and civilians died. United States intelligence agencies assert that they have not addressed this question and the Bush Administration has not indicated any official interest.
Intelligence officers connected with the United States Central Command conducted what they described as a purely mathematical exercise at the end of the war to estimate Iraqi war dead by subtracting prisoners of war and an assumed percentage of deserters and then assigning a mortality rate to those Iraqis who remained on the battlefield.
By this method, the command derived an unofficial death toll of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, was said to have provided this unofficial tally in private briefings to members of Congress.
Some analysts have questioned this unofficial number, arguing that the United States estimate of 540,000 Iraqi troops in the war zone overstated the size of Iraqi forces and that desertion rates were underestimated. They also argued that such a large number of battle deaths would have been accompanied by at least as many wounded, and that no evidence of this has been detected by foreign relief agencies working with Iraq's medical system.
The Iraqi Government has not come forward with any authoritative estimate of war dead. Other unofficial estimates of Iraqi war dead have put the figure at 25,000 to 50,000.
 
Civilian Death Toll
 Allied war planners sought to minimize civilian deaths in Iraq, though there were notable mistakes, including the attack on an air raid shelter in Baghdad that apparently killed more than 300 civilians.
A report issued this month by the environmental group Greenpeace estimated the number of Iraqi civilians killed during the war at 5,000 to 15,000, based on a review of statements by allied officials and other unofficial sources.
Overall, the American analysts say, the Iraqis are struggling precariously under a patchwork of short-term fixes and remedies that will probably deteriorate in the months ahead if the Bush Administration maintains trade sanctions in an effort to force President Saddam Hussein from power.
 
Similarity to U.N. Report
 The Bush Administration's internal findings parallel those reported by a special United Nations mission to Iraq in March, which concluded that because of the damage inflicted on it, "Iraq has, for some time to come, been relegated to a pre-industrial age, but with all the disabilities of post-industrial dependency on an intensive use of energy and technology."
Some Administration officials had criticized the United Nations report, prepared under the supervision of Under Secretary General Martti Ahtissari, for describing the damage to Iraq with terms like "near apocalyptic." But in their detailed review of each sector of Iraq's economy, the United Nations and United States assessments are not dissimiliar.
The Central Intelligence Agency estimates a national repair bill in Iraq of up to $30 billion, about half of which would have to come from hard currency earnings on resumed shipments of oil to world markets. Add to this the $8 billion Iraq owes this year on its $80 billion in national debt, none of which has been paid, and a yet-to-be-determined bill for war reparations to Kuwait, and the outline of Iraq's post-war economic crisis takes an ominous shape, with or without Mr. Hussein.
 
Risks of U.S. Policy
 Some analysts within the Administration suggested that its policy of maintaining sanctions was a risky course, both because of its impact on the Iraqi people and because it may backfire or fail.
One senior analyst said that as the Bush Administration discovered last fall when sanctions did not dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, there is no direct linkage between economic pain and political change in a police state like Iraq. This makes a sanctions-based strategy "inherently unpredictable," he said.
"To the extent Iraqis are convinced that life will be abnormal and harsh as long as Saddam is around, that is clearly an incentive for change," the senior analyst said. "But in a regime based on fear, the primordial interests of survival suggest that people would rather go hungry than take the risk of being dead."
United States analysts say they do not know how much Mr. Hussein has in the way of hard currency to buy food and medicine in the short term, which he has been permitted to do since the United Nations began allowing humanitarian shipments on March 22. While $4 billion of Iraqi cash is frozen in foreign banks, they say Iraq is close to exhausting its cash reserves.
At the outset of the war, the Bush Administration said its objectives included the elimination of Iraq's offensive war making ability and weapons of mass destruction. But in carrying out a strategy to achieve these goals, the Pentagon appears to have miscalculated the multiplying effects on public health of its large-scale destruction of Iraq's electricial power system, which fed civilian as well as military industries.
The system powered water purification and sewage treatment plants, the loss of which led to a sharp increase in disease during and after the war.
A report issued by a Harvard University study team this month said that "the collapse of electrical generating capacity has been a crucial factor in this public health catastrophe." The team predicted tens of thousands of additional war-related deaths by the end of the year, a finding the Administration has not disputed.
"Without electricity, hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed," the study team's report said.
 
Short-Circuiting Power System
 Many of Iraq's electrical power plants were struck on the first night of the allied air war. Iraqi engineers and technicians later told Western visitors that allied warplanes dropped thousands of metallic filaments onto electrical transformers and power lines, causing a spectacular short-circuiting process.
"It was really metallic threads, like a person's hair, very fine," said Julia Devin, a member of the Harvard team that toured Iraq in late April and early May and who returned with samples of the filaments collected from Iraqi plant technicians.
An Air Force official this week confirmed the description of the attack.
Tomahawk cruise missiles and guided bombs dropped from warplanes thereafter destroyed individual generating units, and these repeated attacks knocked out half of the country's generating capacity and damaged a large part of the other half, according to one Administration analysis.
An Iraqi official last week said engineers had restored 1,580 megawatts of generating capacity out of what Western officials say was a prewar level of about 9,000 megawatts.
The Iraqi Government announced this week that eight-hour daily blackouts will be a continuing feature even where electricity has been restored in major cities. Many smaller towns and villages still are without electricity.
The longer term prospects for repairing the system may deteriorate due to the country's lack of access to Western technology, spare parts and expertise.
 
Communications Badly Hit
 Of equally high priority on the allied target list was Iraq's telecommunications sector. Bombers struck telephone exchanges, microwave relay stations and cable networks, along with dedicated military links.
The multibillion-dollar telecommunications system that Iraq had built with state-of-the-art Western technology is the most severely damaged segment of Iraq's civilian economy, United States analysts say.
"The Iraqis are going to have to completely rebuild the system and they cannot do it without foreign equipment and expertise," said one analyst.
While some telephone and telex circuits to the outside world and among major Iraqi ministries and military complexes have been restored, most Iraqis are likely to be without telephone service for the foreseeable future.
 
Oil Production Resumed
 Iraq resumed oil production in April and, according to a Central Intelligence Agency estimate, could be exporting one million barrels per day -- about a third of its prewar production level -- by summer's end if sanctions are lifted. With a $1.5 billion investment in new pumps for its export pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia, Iraq could be exporting 2.7 million barrels per day by the end of 1992, according to the C.I.A. estimate.
Refining oil for domestic gasoline consumption has been more problematical. Most major refineries suffered serious damage and Iraqi engineers will need foreign assistance and parts to repair them.
Repairs at two large refineries enabled Iraq to lift gasoline rationing this month, but United States analysts say they are not sure the country can maintain gasoline output without access to spare parts and chemical additives produced outside the country.
 
Damage to Transportation
 Iraq's highway and rail system is pocked by bomb craters and downed bridges. About 40 major bridges across the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers will have to be replaced, which can probably be done without foreign assistance, analysts say. Another 10 bridges are seriously damaged.
Perhaps as important as this damage, Iraq's only tire factory, whose output served the whole country until it shutdown last fall, remains idled by lack of access to imported raw materials.
Though Iraqi military engineers have worked around much of the damage with temporary bridges, transportation disruptions and bottlenecks, especially in southern Iraq around Basra, will have a significant impact on traffic and distribution for many months if not years.
 
Public Health Endangered
 The threat to public health in Iraq is of great concern to international relief agencies and health experts. Daily power blackouts are causing re-contamination of some drinking water supplies and threaten the country's ability to operate sanitary hospital wards and operating rooms, where refrigeration of drugs, vaccines and blood is of critical importance.
Some back-up generators have failed for lack of fuel and parts.
United States analysts said the compounding effect of continued poor sanitation in many parts of the country, the onset of summer heat and shortages of doctors and nurses could speed the growth of cholera, typhoid and gastroenteritis that may already have claimed tens of thousands of lives. Many foreign health workers left Iraq before and during the war and have not returned.
Inflation has priced baby formula above the income level of many poor families, and transportation problems along with the closing of many regional health clinics have seriously retarded the level of health care services.Increasing child mortality is the most serious concern, public health experts and relief officials say.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Epic by Moscow and Harvard Gets Skeptical Reviews

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
It resembled a Hollywood deal.
First, a group of Soviet economists with another raw script for Soviet economic reform teamed up with rewrite men from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Then they acquired a catchy working title: "The Grand Bargain." 
 They put out their idea in the form of an op-ed piece in The Washington Post by a Harvard professor, Jeffrey Sachs. All that remained was cajoling one major studio -- the Soviet Union -- into making the film and a major consortium of Western industrialized democracies -- led by the United States -- into bankrolling it.
Whatever the outcome, the process has raised both hopes and hackles in the Bush Administration, which prides itself on having a pretty fair stable of deal makers and scriptwriters of its own. "An economic program written in the Soviet Union and perfected at the Kennedy School?" the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, harrumphed to colleagues in the West Wing of the White House last week. "What could be better? At least they are ideologically compatible."
 
Grumbling in the Capital
 And while President Bush late last week made Western aid for Soviet reform seem to be a possibility -- though no numbers remotely resembling the Grand Bargain's $30 billion annually were mentioned -- grumbling could be heard for days beforehand in the State Department, the Defense Department and the White House. The gist of the discontent: that the Harvard academics may have given the Soviet economists unrealistic expectations, setting them and their political backers up for disappointment.
The essence of the Grand Bargain is a simple quid pro quo: massive infusion of Western aid up to $30 billion annually, with $3 billion or so coming directly from the United States. In return, the Soviets were to undertake fundamental economic reforms, moving their system from a command economy to a market one. Built into the plan are stages, incentives, carrots and sticks.
The $30 billion, which would be tied to continuing reforms in both the economic and political spheres, would help ease inflation caused by making the ruble a convertible currency, shore up transportation and communications, and finance importing consumer goods.
But the appearance of this proposal and the brainstorming sessions between the Harvard group and a team of Soviet economists led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky blurred the lines between those who teach government and those who govern, according to several Administration officials.
 
Grand Design or Grand Mischief?
 Even though the shuttle flights linking Boston, New York and Washington have long been populated with academics bearing policy prescriptions, Administration officials are discomfited and a bit dyspeptic at what they describe as well-meaning but potentially mischievous meddling.
The situation has produced a classic standoff between the styles of the Cambridge classroom and those of the Washington office. What one side calls "vision" the other calls "hubris;" what one group sees as prudence, the other sees as bureaucratic narrowmindedness.
"First of all, what we are trying to do is push back the edge of the envelope," said one of the Cambridge-based architects of the Grand Bargain, retreating, Washington-style, into anonymity. "We can do it because we don't have the pressures of government. The notion that we should curtail our imagination at a truly revolutionary moment doesn't seem right to me."
Commenting on the kind of reception academic prescriptions receive in Washington, one Administration official acknowledged, "You always have the 'not invented here' problem.
"But the difficulty is that there are substantive problems. The mischief here is talking about dollar figures for which these guys bear no responsibility."
 
'Boutique Foreign Policy'
 Referring to another Harvard professor involved in the project, Robert D. Blackwill, the Administration official added: "It's easy for Blackwill or Sachs to say we ought to have $30 billion or $3 billion or $1 billion. But none of them have to persuade Congress to make the cuts that would obviously have to come.
"If these numbers really increased official expectations in the Soviet Union, then it really was mischievous."
Another problem with independent deal-making in diplomacy, he said, is that it is unclear who speaks for whom. "Just as we don't know to what extent Yavlinsky speaks for Gorbachev, the Soviets may have trouble knowing who speaks for the Administration," he said.
Another Administration official expressed some of the same skepticism that once led President Bush to refer scornfully to "foreign policy from the boutique at Harvard Yard."
"It reflects a certain way of thinking about solving political and economic problems," this Administration official said. "Clever, but ultimately technocratic. 'We can tell them what to do with the right combination of carrots and sticks.' It's a little presumptuous."
Mr. Sachs, who is credited as the architect of the painful economic reform under way in Poland, answered: "I'm on leave from Harvard working in the real world. I don't regard this as an academic venture.
"I'm not promising Soviet reform. I'm not reading Gorbachev's mind. What I believe is that there is a moment to make something possible. But I would not give a penny before we have a very clear idea of what they are ready to do."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Primary Offers Outlet for Voter Tax Anger

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 31

 BODY:
After months of anger among taxpayers and fear among Democrats, legislators face the voters in party primaries on Tuesday for the first time since some of the lawmakers voted for Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package.
There is no statewide office on the ballot to heighten voter interest, and there is only a handful of contests in the 40 election district races. As a result, Midge Trainor, director of the state Division of Elections, estimates that only about 11.5 percent of the state's 3.6 million voters will go the polls, which will be open between 7 A. M. and 8 P.M. 
 About 1.7 million registered voters are independents who cannot vote in the party primaries unless they go to the polls and declare themselves a member of the party in whose election they wish to participate. There are about 1.2 million registered Democrats and 774,000 Republicans.
 
Focus on Democratic Party
 Each legislative district, with an average population of 193,000 people, is represented by one senator and two Assembly members. The Democrats hold a 23 to 17 majority in the Senate and a 43 to 37 edge in the General Assembly.
The Republican Party is hoping that a replay of the outrage over taxes that almost unseated Governor Florio's fellow Democrat, United States Senator Bill Bradley, last November will divide the Democratic Party in the primary and help the Republicans capture one or both legislative houses in the fall.
But Steve DeMicco, executive director of the State Democratic Committee, said he was "gratified" by the low number of contests in the Democratic primary and the fact that challenges keyed to the Governor's tax program had been "milder" than he expected.
"We're not encountering the number of angry contests predicted by the Republicans," he said. "We'll have no trouble coming together as a party after the primary.
"There is some anger and some frustration among voters that will surface in November, but I believe it is more bipartisan than the Republicans hope. There will be problems to be faced over economic issues, taxes, auto insurance and health insurance costs, but a larger issue is how we're conducting politics and what people think of government, and that's an issue both parties have to address."
Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, the state Republican chairman, said that despite the comparatively quiet Democratic primary, there was still a reservoir of anger over the Democratic administration's policies that could be tapped in November.
"The edge may be off slightly, because it takes a lot of energy to stay angry," he said, "but the anger and frustration over the administration's failure to deal with people in a real way is still there."
In addition to the party candidates who will be on Tuesday's ballot, more than four dozen independent and minor party candidates have filed for the November legislative election.
Mr. Franks said the Republican Party also was supporting the candidacies of more black and Hispanic candidates, "and we're doing it beyond those districts with large minority populations."
In the Seventh District in Burlington County, now represented by Democrats in the Senate and both Assembly seats, the Republican candidates for the Assembly will be Jose F. Sosa, the deputy mayor of Mount Holly, and Priscilla B. Anderson, the Mayor of Willingboro, who is black. They are unopposed in the Republican primary.
In the 11th District in Monmouth County, Mayor Thomas Smith of Asbury Park, a black, will be one of two Republicans running for Assembly seats now held by Democrats.
The reapportionment of the state's 40 legislative districts after the 1990 census also created more problems for Democrats than it did for the Republicans, since most of the population shift was away from urban areas represented by the majority party. The combination of district changes and voter anger prompted a number of Democratic legislators to pass up the coming election.
One veteran Democrat, former Senate President Carmen A. Orechio of Nutley, saw his 30th Legislative District in suburban Essex County moved to the south to form a new district that extends from Lakewood in Ocean County to Bordentown in Burlington. Mr. Orechio found himself in the 36th District represented by a fellow Democrat, Senator Gabriel M. Ambrosio of Lyndhurst, and decided to call it a career after 18 years.
Other Democrats whose names will be missing from Tuesday's ballot include former Senate President John F. Russo of Toms River; the Senate majority leader, Daniel J. Dalton of Turnersville; Senator Richard Van Wagner of Middletown, and Assemblymen David C. Schwartz of New Brunswick, Frank M. Pelly of North Brunswick, Michael F. Adubato of Newark, Edward H. Salmon of Millville, James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge and Joseph D. Patero of Manville.
 
Key Contest in Middlesex
 By contrast, the only Republican who decided not to seek a new term is former Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick of Westfield.
The most closely watched primary contest is the one for the Democratic Senate nomination in the 18th District in Middlesex County, where the incumbent, Thomas H. Paterniti of Edison, who has been in the Legislature for 12 years, is being challenged by Harry S. Pozycki, a former Metuchen Councilman. Party officials say each man could spend $150,000 before the campaign ends.
In the neighboring 19th District the party is trying to oust one of its former stalwarts, George Otlowski of Perth Amboy, who has been in the General Assembly 18 years. Mr. Otlowski, who recently resigned as Mayor of Perth Amboy, is considered a liability because of city problems he encountered as Mayor.
But Mr. Otlowski is not leaving without a fight. He has filed for a new nomination against the regular Democratic organization slate of Thomas J. Deverin of Carteret, an incumbent, and Jay Ziznewski of Perth Amboy, a newcomer.
In the 15th District in Mercer County, which includes Trenton, the State Capital, G. Dallas Dixon of Trenton, the former Mercer County Democratic chairman, is running for one of the two Assembly nominations against the incumbents he supported in the past, Gerard S. Naples and John S. Watson, both of Trenton.
 
Fight Among Republicans
 The Republicans are not without a potentially divisive fight of their own. In the 16th District in Somerset, Hunterdon and Morris Counties, two incumbent Assemblymen, Walter J. Kavanaugh of Somerville and John S. Penn of Far Hills, are being opposed by Pete Biondi, the Mayor of Hillsborough, and Lois G. Rand of Bernardsville, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 1989.
And in the Second District in Atlantic County, Senator William L. Gormley of Margate, a moderate Republican who also ran in the 1989 gubernatorial primary and is considered a potential candidate in 1993, faces a rocky road to re-election this year.
He is being opposed in the primary by Domenic F. Cappella, the Ventnor City Administrator. If he survives that challenge, he will face two opponents in November.

HEADLINE: White Flight From Schools Leveling Off

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
After two decades in which white families have increasingly spurned New York City's public schools, the number of white families leaving the system appears to have leveled off, an ethnic census of the city's public-school children indicates.
The census also suggests that an influx of immigrants from Central and South America may soon make Hispanic residents the system's dominant ethnic group. 
 Specialists say those trends, which are highlighted in the Board of Education's census of its 955,154 students, will affect who will run the system, who will teach and what kinds of programs will be offered.
Some specialists said they would not be surprised if, for example, there were dramatic curriculum changes to include more of the history and literature of Latin America. Others say that schools will have to improvise ways to educate many immigrant adolescents who do not know English.
 
Reasons Called Complex
 The reasons for the leveling off of flight by non-Hispanic whites are complex, the specialists say. They include a weakened economy in which many middle-class parents cannot afford private schools, an influx of refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and an increase in the white birth rate in the last decade.
Many middle-class non-Hispanic white parents also say they are more eager than their parents were to send their children to racially mixed schools, even if their children are in the minority.
"We and most people we know are basically 60's people," said Elspeth Schell, whose three children attend public schools in lower Manhattan. "The idea of public education comes with the things we grew up with -- democracy and multiculturalism, as we call it now -- and a lot of people are just thrilled to be able to send their children to an integrated and democratic type of school."
Ms. Schell said she and her husband, Jonathan Schell, the writer, had considered several private schools but had heeded a friend's suggestion that they investigate Public School 234 nearby.
"My husband came back with tears in his eyes and said, 'I just found the most wonderful principal and the most wonderful school,' " Ms. Schell said.
According to the board's census, the proportion of whites in public schools has stood at close to 19 percent for the last three years, with declines of a few tenths of a percentage point each year. This year, for example, the system lost only 339 white students.
The proportion of non-Hispanic black children, the largest ethnic group, has remained steady at 38 percent, while Hispanic children now make up 35 percent. And the number of Asian students has doubled to 75,635 in 1990, from 38,197, now making up 7.9 percent of the system's population.
With such a shift in ethnic makeup, only two of the city's 32 school districts have white majorities -- District 26 in Queens and District 31 on Staten Island.
Robin Willner, the board's executive director for strategic planning, said the number of white students in public schools had remained level because "families that were going to leave left and those that are here in specific neighborhoods are using the public schools."
 
Influx From Eastern Europe
 At the same time, she said, about 8,053 Soviet immigrants, 661 Yugoslavs and 498 Romanians have entered New York's public schools.
Even without reading a newspaper, "if you look at these figures, I could tell you what happened in the world," she said. "We never had people coming from Romania before, from Yugoslavia."
Emanuel Tobier, professor of economics and planning at New York University, also noted that the white birth rate rose to 38,992 in 1988 from 35,779 in 1978.
In few places is the leveling off of white flight more apparent than in Public School 84 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Over 20 years the school had seen its white population dwindle to 7 percent from 33.
But three years ago the school started a dual-language program -- subjects are taught in English one day and in Spanish the next -- and it has enticed parents from the heavily middle-class neighborhood who want their children to be fluent in a foreign language. Now, with an infusion of private-school transfers and the addition of Russian immigrants, whites make up 10 percent of the students at P.S. 84.
 
Personal Belief Cited
 "I'm a lawyer, my husband is a doctor, and the circles we travel in are largely circles where people send their children to private school," said Holly Hartstone, whose two children attend P.S. 84. "But I believe in public education, and I believe my children could get a good education in the public-school system."
Ms. Hartstone said she believed that too many people rejected public schools without checking to see whether a specific neighborhood school had an able staff and a robust program. She does not mind that her children may be part of a racial minority.
"It's a life experience that will help them be more understanding and open people than they could be if they always had the comfortable experience of being in the majority," she said.
Barbara Iverson, whose daughter, Dena, is a second grader in a lively class composed of black, white and Hispanic children, said, "My children are uncomfortable when there isn't much variety."
 
New Hispanic Growth
 In analyzing the school census, Louis Winnick, an urban specialist with the Fund for the City of New York, said the growth of Hispanic pupils had outpaced that of blacks because of a high birth rate and rising immigration. A survey in March found there were 17,261 recent immigrants from the Dominican Republic, 3,251 from Colombia, 3,134 from Mexico, 2,711 from Ecuador, 1,363 from El Salvador and 1,516 from Honduras.
While there has been large immigration from black Caribbean countries, Mr. Tobier said, the gain may have been offset by middle-class American blacks who have left for the suburbs or for their family roots in the South.
"Hispanics will be the dominant group or co-equal with blacks," he said, "and it will obviously be a contributory factor in who gets to teach and who gets to run the system."
Mr. Winnick said, however, that he believed a Hispanic plurality might not quickly translate into dominance of the seven-member Board of Education, which has two black, two Hispanic and three white members. Because of the large number of Hispanic nationalities, there is considerable political fragmentation, he said. Moreover, he said, Hispanic people have not registered to vote in sufficient numbers, and many of those that have often do not vote.
The new trends pose challenges to a system that cannot find enough Spanish-speaking teachers and has not seen Hispanic administrators in numbers that reflect those of Hispanic students.
"The school system will have a more complicated task than it's ever had before in its entire history," Mr. Tobier said.

Grand Bargain-Hunters

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After some badgering, an official U.S. source responsible for knowing the extent of Moscow's current subsidy of Communism in Cuba disgorged this figure for 1990: $4.5 billion. That does not include the aid that the folks who gave the world Chernobyl are giving Fidel Castro to install uninspected nuclear reactors a stone's throw from Florida.
 Let's assume that our bailout establishment -- including Kansas Senator Bob Dole, who never met a grain credit he didn't like -- succeeds in pouring $1.5 billion in unsecured credit down the Kremlin drain. President Bush, alternately looking stern and professing much anguish, will soon do that as a "humanitarian gesture" to put bread on Moscow's tables.
 
 That means U.S. taxpayers will be reimbursing the Kremlin for one-third of its current annual subsidy to hard-line Communist Cuba. We will be underwriting Moscow's continuance of the cold war.
 Does that make sense? Are we really ready to increase our deficit, or to raise our taxes, or to crack down on our students to repay loans -- to enable Mikhail Gorbachev to keep a Communist foothold in the Caribbean?
 Here is a proposal stunning in its simplicity: If Kremlin humanitarians want to feed their people next month, let them cut off all aid to Cuba this month. Then they will be able to buy our grain and meet their food crisis.
 The bailout establishment sniffs at such thinking as simplistic. At Harvard, the current management of the Charles River Gang is mapping a giveaway of far greater sophistication: a "Grand Bargain" of a quarter of a trillion dollars or so, over five years, in return for Soviet promises of reform.
 The Grand Bargain-hunters are all nice guys. Graham Allison of the J.F.K. School would have been national security adviser in the Dukakistocracy; Robert Blackwill is a classy scholar afflicted with the fear of "who lost Gorbachev?"; Grigory Yavlinsky is a 39-year-old economist trotted out by Mr. Gorbachev when reform is in season (and who shows a nice understanding of Western ways by reportedly cutting himself in on the bundle he seeks).
 Their notion of capitalist-paid crutches for a bailout of the Communist system seems ludicrous; it is divorced from political reality and economic logic. The "Grand Bargain" is significant, however, because it sets a far-out price on helping keep Mr. Gorbachev in power. This will permit the "sensible" types to move in and settle for a cheaper bailout: a petite bargain.
 Mr. Bush and Secretary Baker, split-the-difference types, will put on a horrified look at the Harvard stalking horse. Then they will insist the ransom put on reform should be less, with more Soviet promises of a loosening of the command economy, perhaps throwing in fewer shootings of Baltic border guards. Maybe, as the sweetener before the limited-modified-bailout, we'll get a small reduction of Soviet arms spending and the Castro subsidy.
 Already, Mr. Bush is giving way gracefully: nice-again Mr. Gorbachev will be invited to the G-7 summit meeting to rattle his tin cup like a menacing beggar and be given quick fixes to help him stay in power.
 That entire approach is a historic mistake. Richard Nixon, writing in The Washington Post, persuasively denounces bailout proposals as "counterproductive Western painkillers" that would postpone the drastic economic and political changes needed to save the Soviet peoples.
 Communism with a reformist face is a fake. Pouring in public money from the West to shore up five more years of half-measures in the Kremlin is a guaranteed loser. The only way for businesses in the Soviet republics to attract private capital in nation-building sums is to take up the money-magnet called capitalism.
 The economic answers are no secret. Reducing the Red Army to the size of our own will avert national bankruptcy; selling houses, apartments, land and factories to the people will absorb the "ruble overhang" and make currency convertible; unleashing the profit motive will put bread on the table. The political climate required for this is called freedom.
 Impossible? Stranger things have happened under the impetus of necessity in the fullness of time. If the writing of Richard Nixon can proudly be featured in The Washington Post, the liberating idea of private property can be embraced in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Enter Senate, Begin Chasing Money

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., May 31

 BODY:
John F. Seymour, the new Senator from California, says he needs to do one thing in the next 30 days to gain credibility as a political heavyweight, and it has nothing to do with legislation.
Mr. Seymour, a moderate Republican, has to raise $1 million by the end of June. And that's only the beginning. 
 To win election in 1992 to the Senate seat he was appointed to fill in January by Gov. Pete Wilson, Mr. Seymour says he needs to collect $15 million to $20 million over the next 17 months. If he meets that goal, and succeeds in hanging on to the seat vacated by Mr. Wilson, Senator Seymour will immediately have to work the money circuit all over again to win a full six-year term in 1994.
Without the money to buy the television commercials that would give him visibility, Mr. Seymour says he will lose. So for Mr. Seymour, the hard part is not getting the job but keeping it. And keeping it means spending less time learning his way around the Capitol and more time campaigning and raising money so he can tell voters just how good a Senator he is -- or could be.
 
A Necessary Money Chase
 "I'm leveraging it for everything it's worth," Mr. Seymour said of his newfound incumbency. "That's how I win the election."
Though Mr. Seymour's predicament is unusual, because California is the most expensive state in which to run a campaign, it nevertheless magnifies what some say is the twisted condition of the American political system.
"It is an outrageous amount of money," Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a bipartisan research group, said of Mr. Seymour's fund-raising targets. "It demonstrates how the system has evolved into one in which a successful money chase becomes the determinant of political opportunity and viability."
Mr. Seymour, a former mayor of Anaheim who was a state senator when Governor Wilson elevated him, acknowledges that his task is nothing less than political torture. "I'm frustrated by the fact that I've got 17 months until November of 1992," Mr. Seymour said as he was driven to a recent fund-raising reception in San Diego. "And I'm sitting here with a name I.D. of 37 or 38 percent and having to raise $15 million and wondering, "Can I do it? Will it happen?' "
 
A Slew of Dinner Speeches
 Barely five months in office, the 53-year-old Mr. Seymour officially began his drive for money this week with the first of what he says will be 20 fund-raising events in the next four weeks.
On Tuesday he courted donors at an oceanside restaurant in La Jolla, on Wednesday at a supporter's home in San Francisco and on Thursday at a gala dinner in his hometown, Anaheim, where the guest of honor, the Senate's Republican leader, Bob Dole, told the high rollers, "John and I are just politicians after your money." Mr. Dole was only half joking.
California citizens are paying a price for the dependence of their elected representatives on huge sums. Mr. Seymour cannot help but be distracted from his legislative duties as he prowls for donations.
While the obsession with raising money by the state's senior Senator, Alan Cranston, got him re-elected in 1986, it also got him into trouble. Once one of the nation's leading Democrats, he has lost influence now that he faces a possible reprimand from his colleagues for his efforts on behalf of a big contributor and former savings and loan operator, Charles H. Keating Jr. Mr. Cranston plans to retire in 1992, guaranteeing a second multimillion-dollar race for a California Senate seat.
 
'Unprofessional,' but Inescapable
 Unlike Mr. Cranston, who relished what he called "raising dough," Mr. Seymour, who made a fortune in the real estate business, professes to detest the process. "It's very unprofessional," he said. "On the other hand, I came to realize a long time ago that it's part of the profession of politics."
Mr. Seymour probably owes his current position as much to his fund-raising prowess as to his long friendship with Governor Wilson. Asked what the rather colorless lawmaker brings to the office, even Mr. Seymour's admirers talk far more about his tenacity and stamina than his legislative skills or his vision for his state, the nation or the world.
Mr. Seymour says he is working the same 18-hour days he toiled to make it as an entrepreneur. He has returned to California virtually every weekend since he took office and often uses the trips to solicit donations. He faces a challenge in the primary from Representative William E. Dannemeyer, a staunch conservative from Orange County. In the general election, Dianne Feinstein, the former San Francisco mayor who spent nearly $20 million in her failed bid for Governor last year, is running as the early favorite.
"The Governor chose him for a very pragmatic reason," said Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat, noting Mr. Seymour's reputation for leaning on his real estate and development contacts for contributions. "I don't think it's indicative of his legislative skills or accomplishment as a public servant. But I don't underestimate his ability to make the race a close one," added Mr. Fazio, who heads the fund-raising apparatus for his party's House candidates.
In a demonstration of how important Mr. Seymour's seat is to Republicans, both Mr. Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the party's chief Senate recruiter, appeared with Mr. Seymour at fund-raising events this week to urge supporters to donate as much as they can before June 30, the next Federal Election Commission deadline for reporting campaign receipts.
 
Using Money to Attract More
 "John has to close his books out on June the 30th," Mr. Gramm told donors snacking on rotini pasta and Caesar salad in La Jolla. "And that's going to be the first time that people are going to start looking to see have we got the ball rolling. So if you haven't written your $1,000 check yet, to go in that first report, please get it in."
Wherever he goes in California, Senator Seymour plays the part of a veteran Washington player, pushing the Republican themes of a balanced budget, line-item veto and a tough anticrime package. At a meeting with editorial officials of a San Diego television station the other day, he boasted, "I've been telling the White House" that the economy is headed for trouble. Referring to Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, as Carla, and to Edward R. Madigan, the Secretary of Agriculture, as Ed, he said they had done favors for California on his behalf.
But Mr. Seymour, who said Queen Elizabeth II of England, on her recent visit, figured out who he was only after he identified himself as "the Senator from Disneyland," which is based in Anaheim, acknowledges that much of what he does will go unrecognized among the state's 30 million people unless he can promote himself on television.
"The reality is, I'm going to have to spend a lot of money on television to tell people who I am and what I stand for," he said. "Just in the media market of Los Angeles, a 30-second sound bite costs you $30,000."

East Europe Latest Lure For M.B.A.'s

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE shifting economies of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia have become magnets for M.B.A.'s and other students wanting a taste of what one dean calls a laboratory for capitalism.
Last spring two dozen students in the middle of their two-year programs at three graduate business schools -- Cornell, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylania -- made arrangements to work in Eastern Europe. Some paid their way and some deans used school funds to help or raised money from donors. Students received allowances for room and board from the companies or government entities for which they worked. 
 This year the programs have increased sharply, with almost every major business school sponsoring at least a few students.
Now there is a formal program with paid administrators, set up last October by the three business schools plus 12 others, including Columbia, New York University, Dartmouth and the University of California at Los Angeles. Its name is the MBA Enterprise Corporation and it has its headquarters at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
Operating a little differently from summer programs, this one sends abroad M.B.A.'s who have just received their degrees and agree to spend 12 to 18 months in the former Communist nations. Seed money of $25,000 an individual has been provided by the United States Government and private donors.
Lynne Gerber, executive director of the corporation, said there were 180 applicants for the 50 places open this year. One sponsor that has provided money for the program, she said, is the Sara Lee Corporation, a diversified food company interested in joint ventures. She said many corporations were interested in hiring the M.B.A.'s after they returned.
Next year, she said, the corporation hopes to send 50 M.B.A's to Southeast Asia after a pilot group of half a dozen goes to Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and the Philippines this fall.
James Schmotter of Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Business and a founder of the MBA Enterprise Corporation, has been busy with the summer group going abroad from Cornell. Students there were among the first to conceive a summer program a year ago, and he said that the 11 chosen had flown abroad for their internships -- nine to Hungary and two to Czechoslovakia. To his surprise there were 42 applicants.
"My role was the selection of the students," he said last week. "They get a stipend before leaving and air fare is paid. The companies where they work supply room and board."
The Cornell group consists of one Japanese student with banking experience who will be accompanied by his wife and child; a Canadian and a student from Iceland. Also making the trip are a West Point graduate and a former naval officer, as well as a woman M.B.A. candidate who served in the Peace Corps and another who is working toward both an M.B.A. degree and a master's degree in natural resources. All received some language training and studied the cultural background of the host country.
"They will be doing things they don't do here -- getting their hands dirty," Dr. Schmotter said, explaining that quite a few will be working in "manufacturing settings."
"Being a generalist in these countries is important," he said. "The students have to be adaptable rather than just function as a marketer, an accountant or as a financial specialist."
The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton graduate business school and the allied Lauder International Institute reported that about 40 of its students would teach business courses this summer in English in Leningrad and in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, concentrating on basics like accounting, management, marketing and finance, the usual required courses for M.B.A.'s.
Herbert S. Levine, professor of economics and co-director of the Lauder Institute, made the arrangements for the unusual teaching experience.
"I placed a little notice in a Wharton newsletter." Dr. Levine said. "It offered room and board and a tiny salary in rubles." He expected only a handful of responses, but soon he had to phone friends in the Soviet Union to "report an embarrassment of riches," he said.
He said the students would teach basic business courses under the auspices of a Russian business school called the Herzen Pedagogical Institute.
One student who will teach accounting obtained 100 copies of the Scott Paper Company's annual report, which he will use as a text. A husband-and-wife team will help the Russian business school students evaluate real estate, an important matter for future private ownership.
"A lot of this help is going on," Dr. Levine said. "It is a matter of flowers rising out of the debris."

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Sees Recovery for U.S. in 2d Half

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 3

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 24-nation group promoting economic growth, forecast today that the United States would lift itself out of recession in the second half of this year and that unemployment would stop climbing during that period.
The Paris-based organization, widely respected for its economic projections, said the American economy would grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the second half, compared with a 1.8 percent drop in output in the first half. 
 The organization's economists also projected that American economic growth would climb to 3.3 percent for all of 1992, compared with an anticipated decline in production of two-tenths of 1 percent for all of this year.
Two reports from Washington today supported the case for recovery. The Commerce Department said spending on new construction in April rose more than it had in 14 months, and the purchasing managers' index of economic activity increased to 45.4 percent in May from 42.1 percent in April. [Page D5.]
The O.E.C.D. released its projections a day before finance, trade and foreign ministers from its member nations gather in Paris for the group's annual ministers meeting, which will assess the world's economic situation. At the meeting, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will again urge other industrial nations to lower interest rates to stimulate growth, American officials say, and Germany, with Europe's largest economy, is once again expected to rebuff his suggestions.
Some economists have suggested that the O.E.C.D., seeking to stimulate consumer confidence and investment, is intentionally making optimistic projections. But at a news conference today, senior O.E.C.D. officials defended their forecast, saying they foresee a rebound because of lower interest rates in the United States, Canada, Britain and some other European countries. In addition, they said the victory of the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf war helped raise consumer confidence.
"From now to 1992, all the countries of the industrial world will be growing," one senior official said.
 
6.7% Unemployment Rate
 The O.E.C.D.'s economists said inflation in the United States would be 4 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 1992, compared with 4.1 percent last year. They project that American unemployment will be 6.7 percent in the second half, the same level as in the first half, and will dip to 6.3 percent next year. That compares with 5.5 percent last year.
The rebound the economists foresee will be weaker than the rebound after the 1981-82 recession, which was followed by growth of 3.6 percent in 1983 and 6.8 percent in 1984.
"We don't expect a vigorous recovery, notably because the slowdown wasn't profound and didn't last very long," said the O.E.C.D.'s Secretary General, Jean-Claude Paye, last week referring to the anticipated second-half rebound.
For the industrialized democracies, the O.E.C.D. projects growth of 2.4 percent in the second half, at an annualized rate, and 2.9 percent next year, compared with growth of just three-tenths of 1 percent in the first half of this year.
The group forecast growth of 3.6 percent for Japan next year, the same rate it sees for Japan this year. It expects Germany's unification boom to fade, projecting growth of 2.2 percent next year in what had been West Germany, down from 2.8 percent this year and 4.5 percent last year.
 
Hills Seeks Progress
 At a separate news conference here today, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that she wanted to make progress in international trade talks a priority of this week's ministers meeting. She said the major snag remained the European Community's refusal to agree to substantial reductions in three areas of protecton for farmers: export subsidies, income supports and import barriers.
Mrs. Hills said the negotiators in the current Uruguay Round of trade talks would have to make major progress in June and July if the talks are to end this year. Officials from many countries say that an agreement in the 108-nation talks needs to be reached this year because 1992 is an American election year, which will make it hard to reach an accord next year.
"It's important to wrap it up as soon as possible," Mrs. Hills said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Modest Price Rises Posted In Dollar and Gold Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved moderately higher yesterday on expectations that United States interest rates would remain firm amid signs that the economy is recovering.
Gold prices also posted modest gains. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold picked up $1.60 to close at $363.00 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $362.00, up 70 cents. 
 Analysts said the dollar rose in response to growing signs that the recession was bottoming out and the economy was regaining strength.
Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said traders reacted to the survey of corporate purchasing executives released yesterday, signaling an improvement in the manufacturing sector, as well as to the Government's report Friday that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the index of leading economic indicators, rose six-tenths of 1 percent in April.
The growing evidence that the economy is recovering sent the dollar higher because of the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would not need to push interest rates lower to stimulate business activity. The dollar, like all currencies, draws support from higher interest rates because higher yields increase foreign demand for United States investments.
The British pound was little changed against the dollar. Sterling was unchanged at $1.6970 in New York, and in earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.6970, from $1.6990 late Friday.
The dollar rose to 139.15 Japanese yen in New York from late Friday's 138.30. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar advanced to 138.37 yen, from 137.97 yen Friday, and in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 139.05 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.7485 German marks, up from 1.7430; 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4855; 5.9220 French francs, up from 5.9090.

HEADLINE: Purchasing Index Shows Sharp Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Spurred by a sharp increase in new orders, the nation's manufacturing economy improved in May, according to a monthly report issued yesterday by corporate purchasing managers.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity increased to 45.4 percent in May, up from 42.1 percent in April. The May reading was the highest since August, when the index stood at 47.6 percent. 
 But the May index still indicates that the nation's economy remains sluggish, economists and the association said. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is declining, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion.
 
Wide-Ranging Survey
 The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers from a wide range of industrial companies. It is the first important indicator each month of how the economy performed in the previous month.
The purchasing managers' report followed a report on Friday that the Government's main economic indicators increased six-tenths of 1 percent in April. The Commerce Department said the increase followed similar gains in March and February.
"The figures indicate that economic activity is picking up," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve and president of Brimmer & Associates, an economic consulting firm in Washington. "These figures can be taken as an indication of strengthening economic activity in the future because they are, for the most part, below 50 percent. The economy is weak but improving."
Mr. Brimmer predicted that the second quarter would represent the "the trough" in the economy and that the third quarter "should show positive growth that should continue in the fourth quarter."
 
Poised for Growth
 Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc., said that the May figures indicated that the economy had begun to expand and that the manufacturing sector should begin showing improvement.
"With inventories at very low levels and inflation in check, if not declining, the manufacturing economy appears posed to grow," he said.
The purchasing managers' index of new orders jumped to 50.6 percent in May from 45.9 percent in April, ending 10 consecutive monthly declines. Mr. Brimmer and other economists said that the increase in new orders was particularly significant because it would affect the level of production in the months to follow.
 
Production Soars
 The production index rose sharply in May, to 48.8 percent from 43.1 percent in April. It was the highest level of producion since August of last year, when the production index reached 49.2 percent.
The purchasing managers' price index rose slightly, to 36.9 percent in May from 36.3 percent in April. The report said that the May level was the second lowest since April 1982. Inventories declined in May, with the inventories index falling to 37.5 percent, from 39 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Bond Rating Is Affirmed for New York City

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Despite continuing uncertainty over its budget, the Dinkins administration won a vote of confidence from a major bond rating agency yesterday as Standard & Poor's affirmed its rating of city bonds, finding the city's challenges manageable and its assumptions realistic.
But in affirming its A- rating, which surprised some city officials who were bracing for a downgrading, Standard & Poor's complicated the already complex effort by Mayor David N. Dinkins to avert the worst of the service cuts called for in his budget. 
 For the city, the good news is that the rating could ease the way for the city to sell $600 million in bonds tomorrow at a favorable interest rate. Mayor Dinkins praised the rating decision and said it showed confidence that he would "take any and all actions" to keep the budget in balance.
The bad news is that to maintain the rating the city may be unable to take advantage of bond refinancings or other fiscal gimmicks to reduce Mr. Dinkins's proposed service cuts, making it more likely they will be made.
The reason is that the Mayor proposed sharp service cuts and thousands of layoffs, and then, in an effort to avert them, began negotiations with the municipal unions, the state and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state body set up during the 1970's to sell bonds for the city.
 
A Refinancing Offer
 The M.A.C. has offered to refinance bonds to provide $350 million to the city next year to avert some service cuts and help the city develop a long-term plan to shrink the size of government. But it said it would not take any steps that would lower the city credit rating.
The unions, in turn, have made their help contingent on some assistance from the M.A.C., saying they would not make "givebacks" without a long-term plan to solve the city's problem.
Standard & Poor's said yesterday that any use of bond refinancing to pay for continuing city operations would be "inconsistent" with the current A- rating, thus making assistance by the corporation less likely. If the rating agency had downgraded the city bonds, this concern would have been swept away, some officals noted.
"We are not going to do anything that involves a city downgrading," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the M.A.C. chairman.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said union leaders could not count on the M.A.C. money anytime soon and would "have to decide whether it is in their interest to deal with the impact of the cuts on their members."

HEADLINE: Hartford Foe Of New Tax On Income Now Backs It

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 3

 BODY:
The majority leader in the State Senate, who only four days ago stood before his colleagues to nail down why Connecticut should reject an income tax, proposed a steep wage tax of his own today.
The leader, Senator Cornelius O'Leary, Democrat of Windsor Locks, said the reality of the state budget crisis was permanently altered when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed the legislature's plan without an income tax on Friday night. The sooner lawmakers start accommodating themselves the better, he said. 
 "They're faced with the reality of the veto," Mr. O'Leary said of his fellow lawmakers. "I've added this to the mix in order to focus the debate."
The legislative plan passed both chambers last week before it died about 20 minutes after reaching Mr. Weicker's desk. The measure, which Mr. Weicker called anti-business and hostile to the poor, would have raised $960 million in new taxes to resolve Connecticut's budget crisis, mostly through an expansion of the sales tax.
 
A Flat Tax on Income
 Mr. O'Leary's new proposal, by contrast, would leave most of the state's current tax structure intact. But to resolve the huge shortage in revenues attributed to the recession, a flat 9 percent tax would be imposed on income over $100,000 for couples filing jointly or $75,000 for an individual.
With the high exemption level, only about 125,000 high-income households would be affected, Mr. O'Leary said. But some of them, he added, would take a much bigger hit than under Mr. Weicker's proposal, which called for a 6 percent tax on income over $25,000 for couples filing jointly or $12,500 for an individual.
The new plan, to balance a budget of about $7.7 billion in the fiscal year starting July 1, drew little enthusiasm from members of either party or either chamber of the General Assembly.
But Mr. O'Leary reported that many people who had seen his plan said they would remain "flexible." Other lawmakers said the symbolism of Mr. O'Leary's announcement would carry greater significance than the substance.
First, they said, by openly proposing a new plan, Mr. O'Leary has formally dashed any notion of trying to override Mr. Weicker's veto, which would have required a two-thirds vote in both chambers. The Senate, which passed the plan without an income tax by 22 to 14 last week, was considered to have best chance of overriding the veto; it needed but two more votes to obtain two-thirds of its 36-member chamber. The House barely passed the plan, 77 to 71.
A second symbolic thunderclap in Mr. O'Leary's announcement is that a leader of the coalition against an income tax has now walked into the opposing camp with full colors flying.
Mr. O'Leary said today that his package was put together over the weekend. And he said it was unquestionably better than the one he endorsed and voted for last week.
"The selling point is fairness and equity," he said.
Other Democrats were noncommittal today about Mr. O'Leary's reversal, but did not pronounce the plan doomed outright. This group included the Senate President pro tem, John B. Larson, who has cultivated a reputation as a firebrand in his opposition to the income tax -- he called it "voodoo economics" in a debate last week in the Senate. Democrats control majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly but have been deeply split over the income tax.
Some lawmakers speculated that Mr. O'Leary was simply setting the example in public for a private decision that other lawmakers may have to make if they, too, conclude that Mr. Weicker's veto is a wall that cannot breached.
"For many people, putting a conventional package together, knowing it would be vetoed, was the first act of a drama that now moves into a second act," said Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat from West Hartford who supports the wage tax. "Some people are open to voting for an income tax, but they did not want to be seen as lusting after it -- they wanted to be pulled into it kicking and screaming, and we're doing that."
 
Ticklish Questions Remain
 Connecticut's regular session concludes Wednesday at midnight, but most lawmakers say the real work on a budget will not begin until next week in a special session. And the questions of that next act are expected to be as ticklish as ever. If a majority of lawmakers do conclude that getting a budget past Mr. Weicker without some kind an income tax is impossible, what kind of income tax might muster majorities in the House and Senate?
A tiny, temporary income tax, perhaps -- even called by another name, as some have suggested -- might gain broader support in the legislature, lawmakers say.
But as Mr. Weicker stressed in his veto message on Friday, the point is not simply to impose an income tax, but rather to lower significantly the taxes paid by business and so stimulate the state's faltering economy.
Cutting those business taxes, however -- given the crushing revenue shortfall, which is projected to affect about 30 percent of the state budget over the next 13 months -- might be impossible with a small income tax.
Another big variable in wooing votes from the minority Republicans for an income tax is a package of controls on state spending. These controls, included in last week's legislative budget proposal, were resurrected today in Mr. O'Leary's plan.
The minority leader in the House, Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol and an architect of the plan without an income tax, said today that he strongly disliked Mr. O'Leary's income tax. But he said his focus would continue to be on the spending package. Taxes are negotiable, Mr. Krawiecki said; spending is not.

Two years ago, when China's hard-liners used troops and tanks to crush the democracy movement here, most Chinese and foreigners predicted that the aging leadership would not last even a couple of years.
Yet it has. Far more than most people expected, Prime Minister Li Peng and those around him have consolidated their hold and imposed a sullen stability on the land. At times, China is still likened to a volcano, but few see an eruption soon. 
 "It'll be like this for another five years, maybe even 10 years," said a senior Chinese official, who has close ties to the change-minded faction that is now hibernating. "Even after the old men die, those who are now in power will remain for awhile, and they think the same way: They were all trained in the Soviet Union in the 1950's, and they really believe in central planning."
Of course, that forecast may be no more accurate than those of two years ago. Perhaps the real lesson of the last few years is that no one can reliably predict what will happen in China.
Yet whatever the future may hold, two contrary trends seem to have emerged in the two years since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square.
The first is that the hard-liners have been successful in defusing economic and political challenges, so they could well remain in power for years to come. The second is that they have managed to do what the democracy movement never really intended to do: turn many Chinese, particularly the young and educated, away from Communism.
"Socialism is rubbish; everybody knows that," said a university senior with relatives at the highest levels of government. "I used to think that socialism was basically good, but that there were specific problems like corruption that needed to be addressed. But now I've gradually come to realize that the problem is socialism itself."
"If you had a secret poll of my classmates, not one of them would say that socialism has a future," the student said. "Not one of them."
 
Many Still Believe in Communism
 This may be beside the point, for it is still easy to find people -- especially older officials and those outside the biggest cities -- who strongly believe in Communism. But it is striking that at the time of the democracy movement in 1989, the aim was not to overthrow the Communist Party but to reform it; now it is becoming increasingly common to hear bitter criticism of the party itself. Often, the harshest appraisals come from party members.
One such party member was recently talking with some army generals and they discussed various strategies for catching up with American military technology. He recalled mischievously, "I was tempted to tell them: 'Yes, there is a way we can catch up -- capitalism!' "
Economic discontent spurs the disenchantment, but still the hard-liners have managed the economy somewhat better than many Chinese and foreigners initially expected. Late in 1989, there were expectations of worker sabotage and wildcat strikes, and doubts about whether the Government would be able to meet factory payrolls or to pay farmers for their grain.
The Chinese economy did indeed suffer its worst slowdown in a decade, but this was largely the result of a tight money policy intended to reduce inflation. This year, the economy is again growing rapidly -- although the growth is also induced by a more generous monetary policy -- with industrial growth up 13.2 percent in the first four months of this year, compared to the same period a year earlier.
Inflation, which was a sensitive political issue in 1989, has been almost extinguished. Exports have soared, and so China's foreign-exchange reserves are rising, improving the nation's ability to repay its foreign debt.
Still, the Government has done almost nothing to restructure the state-owned sector of the economy to make it more efficient, and inflation could resume late this year or next year. In addition, many Chinese seem so fed up with the leadership in Beijing that the Government has failed to get political credit for its economic achievements.
Not only is it becoming more common to hear Chinese speak warmly about capitalism, but a growing number also seem to be questioning the conventional wisdom that the Communist revolution was a good idea that went astray over time. More and more people say that the entire revolution may have been a mistake from the start.
"As far as I can see, the Communist revolution was a bad thing for China," an official with minister-level status said bluntly.
Asked how many other officials of his rank, at the peak of the Chinese political system, still believe in Marxism, he said: "It's hard to say, but probably very few. Many fewer than half."
 
Cities Seem the Most Hostile
 Such anti-Communist views seem most pronounced in Beijing and other major cities; elsewhere, there is indignation at corruption and other problems, but most people seem absorbed by matters of daily life rather than by politics. While there is no reliable measure of Chinese public opinion, some scholars say they believe that the Communist Party could still win a free election in China on the basis of support in the countryside, but that its margin of victory would be less than it would have been a few years ago.
Given the growing disillusionment and resentment, it is all the more remarkable that Prime Minister Li and other hard-liners have maintained power so effectively.
Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar from the University of Washington, noted that huge price increases in rice and other basic foods last month caused no significant public protest. In other developing countries, such price rises have toppled governments.
Mr. Li predicted last month that he would remain in office at least until his term expires in 1993, and most people believe he is right. To be sure, he has shown a measure of flexibility in economic matters, and there are some signs that China is resuming the path of economic restructuring that it followed until a few years ago.
But some Chinese doubt that there will be far-reaching changes until Deng Xiaoping, the nation's supreme leader, and other top leaders die. Mr. Deng, who will turn 87 in August, is frail but appears reasonably healthy, and his older sister is still alive at the age of 90.
 
Uncertainty of Public Opinion
 From a Western viewpoint, it might seem that protests are most likely when people are angriest, but that may not be the case in China. For the last four decades, protests have been linked not only to the amount of steam building up among the public, but also to the Government's tolerance of criticism.
Thus it may be that whether there are new demonstrations may depend less on the level of popular fury than on whether there are splits within the leadership, as in 1989, that allow protests to begin without an immediate crackdown.
For now, dissidents say, the certainty of repression has made the possibility of any uprising remote -- unless a senior leader dies or there is some other shock to the system.
"My generation of students isn't going to take to the streets," said the graduating senior at People's University. "The controls are too great and we're simply too scared."
"But there will be another group that will march," she said, "and when they do, it's hard to say if there's anything they won't say."

HEADLINE: SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP;
Ban Stays on Abortion Funds Abroad

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
The Supreme Court refused today to hear a challenge to a Federal policy cutting off Federal family planning grants to any overseas organization that spends money, from whatever source, on activities related to abortion.
The Court's action, in an unsigned one-line order, came 10 days after a 5-to-4 decision upheld limits on abortion counseling in federally financed family clinics in the United States. 
 The restrictions at issue in the case today were in some ways more sweeping. The regulations upheld last month in Rust v. Sullivan permit the domestic clinics to set up administratively separate offices in which they may provide abortion information with non-Federal money.
The overseas regulations provide that the foreign organizations must forfeit their Federal aid even if they segregate other sources of money for activities like providing information about abortions or lobbying against restrictive abortion laws.
 
Rules Announced in 1984
 The regulations were first announced by the Reagan Administration at an international family planning conference in Mexico City in 1984, and have been continued in effect under the Bush Administration. The Mexico City policy, as it is known, was upheld last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York.
The Federal money is spent through the Agency for International Development, which gives it to organizations here and abroad. The agency is the major source of family planning funds in the world. The $220 million it spent last year accounted for 40 percent of such spending in the third world.
The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which brought the lawsuit in 1987, filed the Supreme Court appeal, Planned Parenthood v. Agency for International Development, No. 90-1169. The Justices deferred action on the appeal until they decided the Rust case, since both cases raised somewhat similar constitutional arguments based on the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
Planned Parenthood's argument was that its own free speech rights had been infringed by the restrictions placed on the overseas organizations to which Planned Parenthood wanted to give money.
It argued that its right to carry out its programs, including providing information about abortion, is necessarily curtailed because the overseas organizations are as a practical matter forced to abide by the Mexico City restrictions, and reject the Planned Parenthood programs. The suit argued that the overseas recipients could not afford to jeopardize their Federal money, on which they are dependent.
 
Rules on Any Funds
 Federal law since 1973 has prohibited Federal money from being used for providing abortions overseas. The Mexico City policy went further, requiring overseas recipients of Federal money to agree not to use funds from any source for activities defined as "actively promoting abortion as a method of family planning."
In the regulations, "abortion as a method of family planning" is defined as any abortion that ends a pregnancy not caused by rape or incest or that is not needed to save a pregnant woman's life. "Actively promoting abortion" is defined as providing factual information, with the exception that the family planning worker may "passively" answer the question of a pregnant woman who "clearly states" that she has already decided to have an abortion, if the "ethics of the medical profession" require a factual response about where a safe, legal abortion may be obtained.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
 
Judicial Elections
 The Court ruled unanimously that elections to fill 12 judicial vacancies in Louisiana should not have taken place last fall because the Justice Department had not approved changes in voting procedures for the districts at issue.
Louisiana, along with other Southern states and portions of some states in the North, are required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to submit for Justice Department approval, in advance, any changes in voting procedures, from the placement of polling places to the creation of new districts.
In this case, Clark v. Roemer, No. 90-952, the Justice Department had refused to clear some changes and had not ruled on others. A special three-judge Federal court permitted elections to take place in districts where it found that the changes had been approved "by implication." The Justice Department joined black plaintiffs in arguing that the elections should have been blocked.
Writing for the Court today, Justice Kennedy agreed that there was no approval "by implication" under the law and that a state must explicitly submit and receive approval for all changes. Justice Kennedy said the lower court should now decide whether the judges who were elected must be removed from office.
The Court is expected to decide later this month, in cases from Louisiana and Texas, the broader question of whether judicial elections are covered by the principal provision of the Voting Rights Act.
 
Environmental Suits
 Accepting an appeal from the Department of Energy, the Court agreed to decide whether Federal agencies can be assessed fines for violating either state laws on water pollution control or the principal Federal toxic waste law.
The case, U.S. v. Ohio, No. 90-1341, is an appeal from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. That court held that Congress had waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, raising the potential of millions of dollars in fines. The case began as a lawsuit by the state to require the Government to clean up and pay for environmental damage at the Energy Department's uranium processing plant in Fernald, Ohio.
 
Libel
 The Court refused, without comment, to hear an appeal in a libel case against a New York-based scientific journal. The case, a lawsuit based on the journal's publication of a letter to the editor, had twice been dismissed by New York's highest court. The plaintiff, Immuno AG, an Austrian-based medical company, argued that the New York Court of Appeals had deliberately misinterpreted a recent Supreme Court ruling on the role of "opinion" in libel suits. The remaining defendant in the eight-year-old lawsuit was Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, editor of the Journal of Medical Primatology. (Immuno AG v. Moor-Jankowski, No. 90-1579).

HEADLINE: Bush Clears Soviet Trade Benefits and Weighs Role in London Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
President Bush today granted an extension of trade benefits for the Soviet Union and was said to be increasingly receptive to inviting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to London at the time of the July summit meeting of seven leading industrial nations.
In a move intended to help Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush took the technical steps necessary to allow $1.5 billion in credits for additional food purchases to be granted to Moscow. In December, the President, for the first time, approved measures allowing the Soviets $1 billion in credits. 
 At the same time, after recent contacts between Mr. Bush and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, officials said the President seemed increasingly inclined toward inviting Mr. Gorbachev to London in conjunction with the economic summit meeting July 15-17.
 
Invitation to Gorbachev
 The current thinking, the officials said, was not to ask Mr. Gorbachev to take part in the discussions of the industrialized nations, known collectively as the Group of Seven, but to be on hand in London either before or after the economic summit meeting. He would then hold talks with the members of the Group of Seven, either separately or in groups, about ways to promote liberalization of the Soviet economy and to make his case for large-scale economic aid from the West.
Although the White House reiterated today that no decision on this matter has been made, Mr. Gorbachev's request, coupled with the wishes of Germany, Canada, Italy and France to satisfy him in some way, have put Mr. Bush in a difficult position -- to flatly reject the Soviet leader's appeal would create problems with both Moscow and the Western allies.
Mr. Major, as host of the summit meeting, would have to issue the invitation, but everyone is waiting for approval from the White House. A British Government spokesman said today that a decision on inviting Mr. Gorbachev to London "would be taken quite soon." Mr. Bush has held similar private contacts on this subject with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, as well as with the leaders of the other members of the Group of Seven -- Italy, Canada, France and Japan.
Both Washington and the industrial nations appear eager to avoid embarrasing Mr. Gorbachev, even though they have serious doubts that he has yet produced a realistic economic-liberalization proposal that they could respond to in London.
American officials remain concerned that even an invitation to Mr. Gorbachev to be indirectly associated with the economic summit meeting is going to raise unrealistic expectations in Moscow. A lot of the dicussions between the allies now are focused on how to satisfy Mr. Gorbachev's request to come to London to present his latest proposals -- without raising expectations for grants that will not be met.
Nevertheless, the President's action today, coming on the heels of Saturday's agreement in Lisbon between American and Soviet negotiators resolving differences on a conventional-arms-reduction treaty for Europe, provided fresh signs that Soviet-American relations are again warming, after a period of coolness last winter prompted by the Kremlin's crackdown in the Baltic republics and Mr. Gorbachev's tilt toward domestic hard-liners.
The warming in American-Soviet relations seems largely a result of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly desperate economic plight, which is pushing him to adopt domestic and foreign policies more in tune with the West in the hope of gaining Western economic aid. The Bush Administration is trying to use its economic leverage over Mr. Gorbachev to wring concessions from him on arms control.
On the Soviet trade benefits, what Mr. Bush technically did today was to notify Congress that he was using his discretionary authority to waive for 12 more months the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment for four countries: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Mongolia. Today was the deadline for extending the waiver, and Congress now has a month to consider it.
The Jackson-Vanik amendment is part of a 1974 law that requires countries to permit free emigration to qualify for American trade concessions.
"Numbers of Soviets emigrating rose from 2,000 in 1986 to over 370,000 in 1990," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said in announcing today's waiver. "The Administration believes that this positive trend will continue."
Waiving the Jackson-Vanik provision does two things. First, it enables American exporters who want to sell goods to the Soviet Union to obtain Government-guaranteed bank credits to finance those exports and lets the Soviets obtain similar bank guarantees to finance imports of American products.
Second, once the President waives the Jackson-Vanik requirement, he can grant most-favored-nation treatment to the Soviet Union, which allows the Soviets to export their products to the United States at the lowest possible tariffs. For such trade to go ahead, though, the White House would have to send the trade agreement signed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev last June to Congress for approval.
The President has refrained from making such a move, and did so again today, because he had tied most-favored-nation status to Soviet adoption of a free emigration law, codifying recent liberal emigration policies.
The law was enacted by the Supreme Soviet on May 20, but it will not be put into effect until January 1993, and even then it has some restrictive clauses that the Administration is still uncertain about. American officials are now in the process of trying to decide whether this law, with all its fine print, really will codify free emigration from the Soviet Union. They appear to be convinced that it will, because the officials say they expect the trade bill to be sent to Congress before the end of June.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Up 0.8% in April

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
Spending on new construction projects rose eight-tenths of a percent in April from March, the largest gain in 14 months, the Commerce Department said today.
Analysts said the strong rise was a sign that some parts of the building industry might be climbing out of the economic doldrums. 
 The spending rise -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $392.6 billion -- followed a revised 2.1 percent drop in March. April's rise was the strongest gain since March 1990, when spending went up by 2.2 percent.
The improvement was concentrated, however, coming in nonresidential building like industrial plants, offices and commercial projects. Residential construction spending was down in the month, as were taxpayer-financed projects like road building.
 
Mixed Signs
 "I don't know whether we can take this as a sign that we've turned the corner on nonresidential spending," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass., "but it's consistent with the view that things cannot get a whole lot worse in that sector."
The building industry led the economy into recession last year and has slumped to severely depressed levels. For instance, while April's spending gain was a clear improvement over recent months, it still reflected a 12 percent decrease from a year earlier, when construction spending was at a $444.7 billion rate.
But housing starts improved in April, as did sales of new and existing homes. Accordingly, a pickup in spending for single-family home projects is anticipated later this year.
The April rise in housing starts was one of a series of recent indications that have bolstered hopes for a summer recovery from the recession. On Friday, the Government said its main forecasting gauge for the future of the economy rose in April for a third straight month, and the nation's purchasing managers today reported an improvement in orders during May.
The construction spending report showed that outlays for single-family building rose to a yearly rate of $86.3 billion in April from $85.3 billion in March. But spending on apartments was down to $14.4 billion from $16.4 billion.
Nonresidential spending was up by 4.4 percent, to a rate of $95.7 billion, the biggest gain in more than two years, since a 5.1 percent rise in December 1988, according to Commerce Department officials.
Within that category, spending on industrial projects rose to a $21.3 billion annual rate, from $20.2 billion in March, while office construction spending rose slightly, to $22.8 billion in April from $22.4 billion.
Dave Seiders, senior economist with the National Association of Home Builders, cautioned that high vacancy rates in office buildings built in the 1980's would prevent any major expansion soon in office building.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed as Dow Rises 7.83, to 3,035.33

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices ended on a mixed note yesterday, with the blue chips extending their gains for the sixth straight day but the broader market moving lower.
Drug shares gave way as investors switched from growth stocks to cylical stocks in anticipation that the recession may soon be over. 
 Advancing to its second record in two sessions, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.83 points, to 3,035.33, with Caterpillar, International Paper and Disney accounting for most of the gain.
Caterpillar climbed 1 3/4, to 53 1/2; International Paper 1 5/8, to 72 1/4,and Disney 2, to 118.
The Dow transportation index, hitting another new high, rose 12.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,241.89, in yet another sign that investors expect the economy to improve from now on.
Trading, though, slid from a strong 232.1 million shares on Friday to 174 million yesterday. Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that waves of computer-driven buying lifted the blue chips almost 14 points, implying that if not for program trading, the Dow might also have declined.
 
Big Board Gains Slightly
 In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 1.77, to 388.06, as investors took some of their profits home. Big Board advances narrowly led declines, 808 to 750. But while only two stocks fell to new lows, 139, including General Electric, rose to new 52-week highs. G.E. rose 1/4, to 77 1/2, on 1.5 million shares after a new high of 77 5/8.
Investors continued to move into the smaller stocks as represented by the Nasdaq composite and the American Stock Exchange's market-value index, both of which edged higher.
Repeating an old market maxim to explain what happens when a handful of stocks tell the whole story, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, remarked, "It's a market of stocks and not a stock market."
The market, she said, "really didn't have a set course -- it was bouncing back and forth and was not indicative of any clear direction." Part of the reason, she said, was the weak bond market.
"What we saw was some individual stocks that did quite well and some that didn't," she added.
Among the first group, she mentioned "the deep cyclical, economically sensive stocks, like Dow Chemical and Caterpillar." Investors in these two, Ms. Cohen said, "are increasingly convinced the recession is just above over and both stocks are considered core holdings of cyclical stocks."
Among the second group, she mentioned individual economically sensitive stocks where there was specific news and some growth issues, like Eli Lilly and Tambrands.
Dow Chemical rose 1 1/4, to 56 3/4, in heavy trading while Caterpillar tacked on 1 3/4, to 53 1/2, again in brisk trading. Lilly fell 2, to 77 1/2, while Tambrands sank 2 3/4, to 51.
Declines of 2 or more points came in Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson & Johnsonb and Pfizer. Medtronic, a pacemaker producer, fell 2 1/8, to 116 3/4, although analysts forecast it would split its stock shortly.
The Pacific Stock Exchange's high-technology index rose a little, with Intel, which introduced a new supercomputer on Friday up 2 3/4, to 58 1/2, on 3.6 million shares. Sun Microsystems, leading the Nasdaq market, fell 3/8, to 36 1/2, on 4.3 million shares after A.T.&T., owner of 19 percent, said it would sell the stake following its takeover of NCR.

Stocks Off in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Tuesday, June 4 (Reuters) -- Stock prices closed lower here today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 355.75 points, or 1.37 percent, to 25,556.86 at the end of the afternoon trading session.

HEADLINE: Sticks and Carrots for the Soviets

 BODY:
Is the prospect of reeling the Soviet Union into the Western economic orbit worth an infusion of Western aid, say $30 billion a year for five years? Many Americans say no. Just let the Soviet economy collapse. Don't prop it up at a time when the Soviets are still spending billions on new armaments and aid to Cuba.
But that shortsighted view misses the point that this is a historic opportunity for the West to change the very character of a nation that has posed a military threat for four decades. 
 The purpose of a Western aid package is to transform, not prop up, the Soviet economy. A ferocious battle now rages in Moscow between forces pushing for radical change and forces clinging to centralized control. President Mikhail Gorbachev is wavering. In this political maelstrom, Western aid could be decisive in tipping the scale toward the reformers.
The gamble is worth taking. If the Soviets renege on reform, U.S. taxpayers would lose perhaps a modest $3 billion a year, the American share of Western outlays. But imagine the other possibility. If the aid turns an archenemy into an archally, or even an innocuous neutral state, it would save the U.S. in defense alone many times $3 billion a year -- a stroke of genius.
A Western aid package need not be a giveaway. The aid, under proposals developed by Soviet and American economists, would be conditioned on three specific radical economic reforms and staged so that backsliding would lead to swift termination.
First, Moscow would have to balance its budget. Only then can it stop flooding the market with new rubles, which threaten to spark hyperinflation. Balancing the budget would inevitably force Soviet leaders to end subsidies of inefficient businesses and cut military expenditures.
The next step would decontrol prices. Markets, not bureaucrats, would then make most economic decisions. Finally, property would have to be taken away from bureaucrats and handed over to ordinary citizens.
Stabilization, price reform and privatization would transform the economy and, if successful, end the frightening disintegration of a nuclear-armed country.
The political impact would be no less radical. Moscow's chokehold over the economy would be irreparably broken; hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens would soon be in control of their lives. The West's demands would decentralize political control along with economic control.
The West might well want to require strong steps toward a free press and competitive elections as a condition for aid. However, it will also be tempted to make Soviet military spending and an end to repression of the Baltics explicit conditions for aid. This would probably be a mistake. Such demands would arm the hard-liners who oppose reform and help them scuttle the deal. These demands are better left as implicit conditions, in expectation that economic and political reform will bring them about.
The pell-mell of markets will threaten Soviet bureaucrats and frighten ordinary citizens. They will be tempted to backslide and delay, to postpone the pain. All the West can do is lend a helping hand, perhaps persuading the fearful. If aid is strictly conditioned and parceled out step by step, it will do no harm. And it just might propel reform, with incalculable benefit.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Soviet Solution

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Look at these people -- politicians, economists, diplomats and journalists in the West. See how hard they work, to ignore the one overriding need of the people of the Soviet Union: the need for a brand new government.
 Everywhere else that Communism has collapsed, the West has understood that the first thing the people wanted, and the starting point for any hope of real change, was to get rid of the collection of bureaucrats, policemen, wardens and propagandists that made up the failed, hated government -- particularly the Communist political leaders who had perched for so many brutal years atop the whole corrupt apparatus. 
 Nobody questioned the urgent need for the Poles to get rid of what remained of the Communist Party and its disgraced leaders. Nobody warned Vaclav Havel against bringing a whole new democratic era to Czechoslovakia. Nobody scolded East Germany for trying to bring to trial some of the men who made death the penalty of climbing over the Berlin wall.
 Yet when it comes to the Soviet Union the West not only agrees that the very men who ruled the empire at the center, who for years preached and enforced the wretched economic doctrine that wrecked the Soviet Union and who ran the whole national landscape of political prisons, should not only remain in control but solemnly considers how to raise a couple of hundred billion dollars to make sure they do.
 Are we mad? Someday historians will write books trying to answer that question. How did it come to be that twice in less than a year, the West looked straight at the possibility of great achievement for civilization, shuddered and walked away?
 In February, the United States walked away from the ouster of Saddam Hussein and allowed him to remain in power. In June the whole West looks at the possibility that the Communist system may disappear from the Soviet Union and scratches its head about how much money to contribute so that the apparatchiks who helped build it can stick around for more years of criminal misrule.
 Maybe we don't need historians. In Iraq, it was failure of moral stamina and political compass by a President and a few of the men around him.
 About the Soviet Union it is more complicated. There are legions of Western specialists and diplomats -- President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker included -- who long ago committed their reputations to the political survival of Mikhail Gorbachev and cannot let go.
 Money is involved, too -- big money, the dreams of European and American businessmen of Western-guaranteed big deals with a Soviet Government they helped save.
 But probably most important is fear: if Mr. Gorbachev goes, who knows what instability may follow in the Soviet Union and its neighbors?
 Nobody knows that. But we do know that ever since World War II, what created instability in Europe has been the existence in the Soviet Union of a Government ruled by a Kremlin few and swallowing within its borders a variety of captive nationalities.
 It is not the West's right to bring down the Gorbachev Kremlin-based Government or to plot against it. But neither do we have the right to intervene by using massive aid to prolong the present Government, which has dug itself deeper into disaster every year and whose rule is clearly sputtering to an end.
 Mr. Gorbachev does not need hundreds of billions of dollars to do what his country requires. All he needs is to recognize that he has failed economically and resign while he has honor, first as head of the party and within three months as head of state.
 During those months, nationalities that want to secede should be allowed to do so -- six to eight would. The rest could prepare for elections that would choose a new president and council. He would preside over a decentralized federation that would wipe out any special status for the Communist Party, and create a new economic and political nation. The West could assist to the best of its ability, without fear of merely prolonging tragedy.
 The Soviet people would not then enter into a promised land of prosperity and guaranteed stability; seven decades of Communism are heavy heritage. But they would at last have the essential base -- a new society, free not only of the gulag but its doctrines, its apparatus and its masters and servants.

HEADLINE: Tough Tests Don't Create More Inner-City Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Education Reform vs. Civil Rights Agenda" by Chester E. Finn Jr. (Op-Ed, May 18) discusses incentives for inner-city kids to excel in, and finish, high school. The author attacks the problem from the other side, by offering tests to evaluate the graduating student. I'm not sure this measure will help the inner-city student though. 
 Mr. Finn, a Reagan Administration Assistant Secretary of Education, says that college admissions remain largely unaffected by the poor performance of our students. Certainly, then, businesses will get the most use out of these standardized tests. Here lies the problem: there simply are not enough jobs for the inner-city students who finish high school. Offering means of ranking students who will not receive jobs seems farcical, if not insulting.
Somehow, inner-city students must be made more desirable to business. The solution may well be in more vocational training (as in Japan and Germany) or simply more directed training (as in Britain). To an inner-city student, the difference between learning engineering instead of grammar may be crucial to getting a job. But moving away from broad liberal arts training is anathema to Americans. While it may be a way to ease our economic woes, we don't see it as an improvement of our educational system.
However, as long as we consider economic realities and educational ideals as separate, I don't think the answer to inner-city schooling can be found. Students drop out of or don't excel in inner-city schools because there are other, more relevant concerns in their lives. Raising the living standards of the inner-city population will let these problems begin to take care of themselves.
Unfortunately, the people debating these issues are hampered by the luxury of financial stability. What Mr. Finn ignores is that if the jobs are not there, and college is out of the question, standardized testing will make no difference to a student. To reach these students, we must effect fundamental change. It just doesn't make business sense now for many inner-city students to continue high school. To change this will present many theoretical and logistical problems. The proposed inequalities between urban and suburban education may well be unconscionable to many. But they may also be the only way out of a bad situation.MARK S. SAUDEK

HEADLINE: Chip Pact Set by U.S. And Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
Negotiators from the United States and Japanese agreed today to extend for at least three years a set of rules covering bilateral trade in computer chips, a participant in the talks and trade experts said.
The new agreement is to be signed Tuesday, if officials in Tokyo approve it tonight. Approval of the pact is considered almost certain because it results partly from negotiations late last week in Tokyo between a senior Commerce Department official and Japanese officials, some officials said. 
 As in most bilateral trade agreements, both sides made compromises. The Japanese Government and industry initially opposed any extension of the rules, which were established in a 1986 agreement that will expire on July 31, and contended that any new agreement should run for no more than two years.
 
Option to Renew
 The American industry had pushed for a five-year agreement. The compromise was a three-year agreement, with a review at the end of that period and an optional two-year renewal.
The most controversial clause concerned American companies' access to the Japanese chip market. The 1986 agreement included a secret letter of understanding between the two Governments calling for the American share of the Japanese market to rise to 20 percent.
In 1987, after the American market share remained well below 20 percent, the Reagan Administration placed import duties of 100 percent on $300 million worth of Japanese power tools and color television sets. The Japanese Government complained frequently that the secret letter did not authorize such unilateral action.
 
Santions Are Suspended
 The new agreement suspends the $155 million in sanctions still in effect and specifies the 20 percent figure as a benchmark, not a basis for further unilateral sanctions.
Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Defense Industry and Technology subcomittee, said that a longer agreement with a sanctions provision sanctions would have been preferable but might not have been feasible, given Japan's reluctance to set any benchmark for American penetration of its semiconductor market.
"I don't know if it's totally adequate, but it may be all we can reasonably expect at this stage," he said. "Three years is not unreasonably short, if that's the best we can do."
The American semiconductor industry praised the pact as the best it could obtain.
"We view the new agreement as a positive step forward in opening the Japanese market and preventing dumping," the selling of products below cost, said Thomas G. Beermann, a spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif.
A Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new semiconductor agreement was an improvement over the 1986 pact because it limited Government intervention in the semiconductor market.
 
Separate Formulas Accepted
 But an American expert on semiconductor trade, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "It's not that radical a departure; it's a continuation of the 1986 agreement."
Negotiators said they agreed to use two different formulas for calculating the American market share in Japan. American officials put this at 13 percent last year, while Japanese officials insisted that it was 19 percent.
The differences are over how to count computer chips made in Japan under the brand names of American companies, how to count chips made in the United States for the Japanese subsidiaries of American companies, and how to count the sales of small producers of chips. The new formulas would still allow each country to continue to claim considerably different market-share percentages from the same facts.
Both countries also agreed that their companies would keep extensive records of the prices and volumes of chips they sell to expedite any legal cases involving charges of dumping.
 
Problems Resolving Cases
 Current cases can last a year or more. In an industry with product cycles of two years or less, this means that anti-dumping cases are often not decided until after the product at issue is obsolete and no longer widely sold.
Negotiations on the chip accord were conducted in Tokyo late last week by J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. The remaining issues were worked out in Washington in the last several days by S. Linn Williams, the deputy trade representative, and Naomichi Suzuki, a top official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Laura D. Tyson, a professor of economics and business administration at the University of California at Berkeley, agreed that a clause authorizing sanctions would have been desirable but said it was not necessarily something the Japanese would ever accept.
"The absence of sanctions should be considered in the context of Japanese-American relations, that the Japanese only move on these things when someone pushes them," she said. "The fact that we've excluded sanctions suggests to me that we need to continue to push them."

HEADLINE: Chip Technology's Friendly Rivals

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
It is one of the computer industry's nastiest rivalries, fraught with name-calling and accusations. The winners could well make the chip that will come to dominate the business.
On one side stands a group of companies led by MIPS Computer Inc. and inspired by John L. Hennessy, a computer scientist at Stanford. On the other side, a band of companies, led by Sun Microsystems Inc., that follow David A. Patterson, a computer scientist at Berkeley. Each group has its own chip, and each denounces the rival design as inadequate. 
 And how are Dr. Hennessy and Dr. Patterson getting along with each other?
Just fine, thank you. Why, last year they joined to write one of the most widely used computer science textbooks, which has brought a new, rigorous philosophy to computer design. They see themselves as allies in promoting a radically simplified approach known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC.
Both researchers say corporate rivalry matters far less to them than the shared thrill of creating new technologies. "I've been delighted that what I thought were good projects and good technical ideas have been commercially accepted," Dr. Hennessy said.
RISC streamlines hardware to significantly speed computer operations. It has "freed the genie from the bottle" said Gordon Bell, one of the nation's leading computer designers, by stripping away time-wasting functions.
In the last five years, RISC's advantages -- higher speeds, lower costs and quicker product development -- have allowed it to sweep the market for work stations, high-powered desktop computers. Now, many industry executives say, RISC is poised to conquer the rest of the industry -- from supercomputers to personal computers.
The simplicity of RISC technology has permitted many new companies to make chips and work stations. "Hennessy and Patterson have led a palace revolt in computer design," said Andrew S. Rapaport, president of the Technology Research Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.
RISC advocates say they realized they had won the intellectual battle over computer design when their opponents' marketing brochures began to boast about the adoption of RISC features.
"First you come up with a crazy idea and people say no," said David Ditzel, a Sun Microsystems computer designer who, as a graduate student, wrote Berkeley's first RISC research paper with Dr. Patterson. "Then you make it work, then they steal your idea, and then they claim it was their idea all along and then the transformation is complete."
First explored by researchers at the International Business Machines Corporation in the mid-1970's, RISC was more fully exploited and promoted by Dr. Patterson and Dr. Hennessy. Dr. Patterson, unaware of the earlier I.B.M. work, came up with the idea of building RISC computers after spending a year on sabbatical at the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1979.
Digital's VAX computer, more like a fully loaded Cadillac than a stripped-down racing car, offered programmers a huge set of instructions capable of meeting every contingency. But it was difficult to speed up the VAX computers with new chip technology.
Dr. Patterson felt that computer architecture had become too complicated for him to assign his students design projects that they could complete in a school year. But, on returning to the University of California at Berkeley, he recognized that RISC projects could quickly yield working computers.
Dr. Hennessy's Stanford University group soon learned about the Berkeley research and decided to start its own project. He left Stanford to found MIPS, but later returned.
Both scientists shuttle comfortably between academic and corporate settings. Dr. Hennessy, 38 years old, is the one more interested in business. The stock he received as a founder of MIPS, which has gone public, has made him moderately wealthy. He still regularly consults there.
 
Happiness Over Wealth
 Dr. Patterson, 43, consults at Sun Microsystems and at Thinking Machines, a maker of supercomputers. He rejected the chance to start a company. "I made the choice between being happy and being wealthy," he said. By the mid-1980's, two competing chips emerged from the Berkeley and Stanford research projects and were adopted by Silicon Valley rivals. Sun Microsystems designed a chip based on Berkeley's model and MIPS Computer, the Stanford one.
Throughout the decade, Dr. Hennessy and Dr. Patterson met frequently at conferences and found they shared the same views on computer design. Year after year, they bemoaned the failings of computer science textbooks. So they decided to produce their own.
They approached the writing process as systematically as they approach computer design. Beginning in 1988, they met twice a week, producing what they called alpha and beta versions of the text, borrowing the labels that software designers attach to their preliminary efforts. Before the book was published last spring, it was tested, used, reviewed and debugged by almost 300 students and by the country's 20 to 30 leading computer designers.
 
Floppy Disk by Fed Ex
 As their textbook developed, so did their mutual dependence. Dr. Hennessy remembers the frequent calls from Dr. Patterson, who would say, "I have to teach a class in two days and I need material for my lecture." Dr. Hennessy would race to finish a chapter in time to dispatch it -- on a floppy disk -- by Federal Express so that copies could be printed at a copy shop in Berkeley in time for Dr. Patterson to hand them out in his class.
Not specifically pro-RISC, Dr. Hennessy and Dr. Patterson's 594-page book, "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach," (Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.) explores trade-offs between cost and performance. Widely read by students, it has also become the primer for a new generation of software and hardware designers. David Cutler, a designer at the Microsoft Corporation who is writing the company's new version of the OS/2 software that controls a personal computer's operations, bought copies for all the members of his design team.
"It's the computer science equivalent of Samuelson's textbook on economics," said Dennis Allison, a designer at Hal Computer Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
Many of the colleagues of the two professors never thought of them as collaborators. "A lot of people are startled to learn that we've written a book together," Dr. Patterson said. "At one computer conference we won an award for being the most unlikely bedfellows."
Some others see them as intellectual bullies. Val Popescu, president of Metaflow Technologies Inc., a San Diego chip design company, said RISC had acquired such devout believers that any who disputed its value were treated as outcasts.
"It's simply a club mentality," he said. "These people go to conferences together and share the same ideas that have nothing to do with what the industry needs. You have a bunch of professors from Stanford and Berkeley saying something, but the market reality is not in favor of the RISC camp." RISC's detractors say that among its drawbacks is the requirement for new software, which can be expensive to develop.
Opposing the RISC proponents is the powerful Intel Corporation, which is investing more than $600 million this year to make sure that its next chip, the i586, is fast enough to preserve Intel's dominance over I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. But recently a coalition of 21 computer and software vendors, including Digital, Compaq and Microsoft, endorsed the MIPS RISC chip for use in desktop computers. In the other RISC group, Sun's allies include the Amdahl Corporation, Fujitsu and Texas Instruments.
And Dr. Hennessy and Dr. Patterson? They are back at work trying to bring about the next computer revolution. At Stanford, Dr. Hennessy is exploring new ways to hook together dozens of RISC chips in tandem. And at Berkeley, Dr. Patterson is trying to reinvent the computer disk drive business, an effort that many industry executives believe will have as big a commercial impact as RISC.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Head of Division Named At Kaufman & Broad

BYLINE: By N.R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation has announced that Roland Osgood, a seasoned figure in the California housing industry, will head a new home building division for the company, the largest builder of single-family housing in California.
Mr. Osgood's unit, Kaufman's ninth, will develop and market single-family homes for entry-level buyers and the trade-up market in the three-county area of Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino. They will carry a still-undecided brand name, and are intended to move Kaufman beyond its popular entry-level housing line known as the California Series. 
 Mr. Osgood, 52, has worked in the California housing business for 23 years. Until last September, he had been president of residential development for the Irvine Company, Orange County's largest land developer. He joined that company in 1979 and built as many as 3,000 housing units a year, ranging in prices from $70,000 to $1.5 million. Several years ago, Irvine left the home building industry, and Mr. Osgood said he yearned to return to it. "I went to Irvine to build homes, and I left Irvine to build homes," he said in a telephone interview.
Bruce Karatz, the chief executive and president of the Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad, which is also the largest builder in metropolitan Paris, said he hoped Mr. Osgood would enable the company to "broaden its product line and increase its penetration within one of the state's largest and most important housing markets." The company said continued population growth and expected economic expansion in Southern California during the 1990's should create adequate demand for more than one Kaufman & Broad brand.
Mr. Osgood said that the California market continued to be soft, but that he thought it would begin to revive in about six months. "I think this is an opportune time to tie up land," he said.
Mr. Osgood said he would initially focus on building housing in key planned communities throughout Orange County, chiefly attached and detached single-family homes priced from less than $200,000 to about $300,000. Most Kaufman & Broad homes sell for between $90,000 and $170,000. Mr. Osgood said that he expects to deliver the first batch of homes in about a year, and to reach annual production of 400 to 500 homes within three years.
After studying at California State University at Long Beach, Mr. Osgood worked for five years as an accountant, not because he liked numbers but because he was murky about what he wished to do. One of his clients, Broadmoor Homes, lured him into real estate. He worked at Broadmoor for 11 years, rising to chief operating officer, before switching to Irvine.
Mr. Osgood lives with his wife, Diane, in Newport Beach in something beyond an entry-level home, and he has four children from a previous marriage.

HEADLINE: A Bold French Insurance Chief

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 3

 BODY:
Claude Bebear, a charismatic silver-haired man who personifies the new aggressiveness of French business, sometimes seems devoted to one goal: proving that insurance executives do not have to be dreadfully dull and cautious.
Mr. Bebear, chairman of Groupe Axa, one of France's largest insurers, once organized an expedition of 80 executives, tents and all, into the Sahara to spur team spirit. He once personally returned a stolen Ferrari to a policyholder -- and got a speeding ticket along the way. 
 But leading an exciting life is not his only goal -- he also wants to lead one of the world's biggest insurance companies. For that goal, he hopes to invest up to $1 billion in the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, the faltering New York-based insurance giant, in exchange for a controlling stake.
 
Weakened by Investments
 Equitable, which has been weakened by investments in "junk bonds" and real estate, is hunting for affluent investors to raise about $1 billion in capital and will relinquish in return up to a 40 percent stake. Equitable said recently that it hoped to have an investor group lined up in the next few weeks.
For Mr. Bebear (pronounced bay-bay-are), Equitable would be his second attempt to enter the United States market. Two years ago, he lost an opportunity to buy Farmers Group Inc., the big California-based insurer, when an attempted takeover of Farmers' parent by a foreign raider was repelled.
To buy into Equitable, Mr. Bebear has "several billion dollars" at the ready thanks to recent sales of an odd collection in Axa's constellation, including stakes in a French cement maker, a large seed company and West Africa's largest brewery. If he needs more, he could sell some of Axa's $10 billion real estate portfolio.
"We hope to double our size in the next decade, which shouldn't be so difficult considering that we have increased our size sixtyfold in the last 15 years," Mr. Bebear said. Groupe Axa had $9.4 billion in premiums and $306 million in profits last year.
Depending on how big a piece of Equitable it gets, Axa could double its size overnight. But winning that prize might not be easy. Among the other potential investors in Equitable are American International Group Inc., the big insurance company based in New York, and two powerful Japanese insurers, Meiji Mutual Life and Nippon Life. Equitable may choose to raise money from an array of investors in which Axa would play only a part, albeit a major one.
None of those factors intimidates Mr. Bebear, who displays eight rifles in his office here and hunts alligators and leopards in his spare time. The office, in a sumptuous former bank building, is in one of Paris's elite districts only a block from the Elysee Palace and a far cry from the Normandy province from which Mr. Bebear moved Axa last year.
Mr. Bebear is often called "the leading visionary" of France's insurance industry. "He is a great insurance man," said Christiane Marcellier, an analyst with DLP James Capel, a Paris brokerage. "He knows the business. He knows its peculiarities."
Mr. Bebear's response is a modest one: "I am not the genius of French insurance," he said. "There are better insurers than I. I have gotten a lot of recognition because I am the person who has shaken up the industry."
"Shaken up" might be an understatement. Since taking the helm of a tiny provincial insurance company in 1974, he has turned it into Europe's eighth-largest insurer by making more than a dozen major and minor acquisitions. Besides the Sahara expedition, he led Axa executives on a whistlestop tour of six European countries, on the fabled Orient Express train.
The Sahara trip came after Mr. Bebear's small mutual insurance company swallowed two large French insurers, including a money-loser twice its size. Confronted with the daunting prospect of meshing all these together, Mr. Bebear organized the African expedition to get top managers to know each other better and think through what had to be done to create a unified group.
"When you're in the desert, you cannot reflect about things in an ordinary way," he said. "You can ponder everything without constraints." On his office coffee table is a 220-page scrapbook stuffed with pictures, of camels, campfires, sand and shrubby oases, from the weeklong trip to Tenere, Niger, in 1986. On the cover, 80 Axa executives are sitting on a sand dune arrayed in an A-X-A spellout.
Two years later, the Orient Express chugged 120 top managers through Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Italy. In each country, local experts spoke to Axa executives, giving them information on the insurance market.
For Mr. Bebear, taking control of Equitable would fulfill a longtime ambition of entering the United States in a big way. "I have long thought that insurance would become international, like manufacturing and banking," he said. "To compete, it is necessary to either find a niche or become very big and very international."
The 55-year-old Frenchman clearly prefers becoming big and international. "Our strategy is to be one of the biggest players in the world," he said.
Mr. Bebear says that as Axa's clients become global companies, Axa must become global, too, so it can provide clients with insurance in not just France, but also in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. If Axa does not grow along with its clients, then they might turn to other global insurers that can provide them with one-stop global packages, he says.
The son of a schoolteacher, rather than the scion of a patrician family, like many top-level French executives, Mr. Bebear is palpably unhappy that two-thirds of Axa's revenues still come from France. He wants France to represent less than half so Axa does not have to rely on France's fickle economy. More than half of Axa's premiums are from auto, property and casualty insurance, with 38 percent from life insurance.
Axa already owns insurers in Britain, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Japan and five other countries. Being international, Mr. Bebear said, enabled Axa to spread out the cost of major investments, like its new computer system.
Two years ago, when Axa offered $4.5 billion to buy Farmers, Axa made its offer as part of a $21 billion hostile bid by Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, for B.A.T. Industries, the London-based conglomerate that owns Farmers. Sir James had promised, if he won the battle, to sell Farmers to Axa, but when he withdrew his bid, Axa gave up its bid for Farmers.
Mr. Bebear already has lots of practice in making acquisitions. In 1982, Mutuelles Unies, the small cash-rich insurer he headed, purchased Groupe Drouot, which was twice the size of Mr. Bebear's company. Drouot lost $40 million in 1983, but after Mr. Bebear streamlined it and invigorated its marketing, it earned $40 million two years later. He said that if he had the same short-term quarterly report mentality that American executives had, he never would have bought a problem-plagued turnaround candidate like Drouot.
 
Bitter Battle Won
 In 1985, Mutuelles Unis renamed itself Axa, and in 1986 acquired another large insurer, Groupe Presence, winning a bitter battle with Compagnie du Midi, a powerful French holding company.
In June 1988, Axa expanded again when Midi agreed to merge its insurance activities with Axa's to help escape hostile overtures from Italy's largest insurer, Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. Midi's chairman, Bernard Pagezy, had to swallow some pride in turning to his longtime rival, Mr. Bebear, to rescue him.
Soon, Mr. Bebear and Mr. Pagezy clashed, and with Generali's help, he took control of Midi and ousted Mr. Pagezy in 1989.
With the merging, melding and restructuring of Axa behind it, many analysts say now is a better time for Axa to make an American acquisition than when it bid for Farmers. Nonetheless, Axa's share price dropped once the company's interest in Equitable became public because many investors questioned the wisdom of Axa's entangling itself with a company with Equitable's problems.
Sounding more like a hunter than an insurer, Mr. Bebear said that success came to those willing to be audacious. "Now is the time to expand into America," he said. "You should expand in a market when it is having problems, not when it is in robust health because then you have to pay too much. You have to have courage, the courage to take calculated risks."

HEADLINE: Chief Plans Big Role for Small Panel

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
By Washington standards, the National Science Foundation is one of many small Government organizations relegated to the back of budget books as "other independent agencies."
Although it is dwarfed in size and budget even by companion technical agencies, like the National Institutes of Health and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation is in a period of extraordinary growth. 
 And to Dr. Walter E. Massey, beginning a six-year term as director of the foundation, its size belies its growing influence.
The foundation, which has a $2.3 billion budget this year, has taken a major role in big interagency programs to study global climate change, to develop high-performance computer technology, and to sponsor research to improve industrial competitiveness to improve science and mathematics education and literacy, he said. And he said the agency is expanding its role as the major Federal sponsor of nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities.
"The N.S.F. is establishing a bigger presence in Washington and will play a significant role in some major undertakings," said Dr. Massey, a physicist who was vice president for research at the University of Chicago until he took his new job on March 4.
 
Seeking to Double Budget
 President Bush has continued an initiative begun by the Reagan Administration in 1987 to double the foundation's budget, then $1.6 billion, over five years. Congress did not appropriate all of the annual money requests. But the foundation, which frequently received budget increases of 15 percent or more while other agencies had to settle for the same money or less, expects to reach the goal of $3.2 billion in 1994.
The political priority given the agency, which annually awards 13,000 to 15,000 research grants in all fields of natural and social science and engineering, stems from the belief that research is the basis of future economic growth.
Dr. Massey, 52 years old, took over after the controversial term of Erich Bloch, an engineer and former International Business Machines Corporation executive who changed the course of the agency. Mr. Bloch, whose frank and sometimes confrontational style alienated some scientists as well as some people at the foundation, pushed to increase the agency's budget. In addition, he gave more emphasis to applied technology research, which would have a more immediate economic payoff for the country than the basic research the foundation had historically sponsored.
Mr. Bloch started an ambitious program of creating research centers that would combine the resources of universities, industry and government to advance key technologies. The centers, collaborative projects in which participants from different institutions share knowledge and equipment, were opposed by some scientists who felt they drained money from existing research.
But Dr. Massey said he supported the centers program, which includes 25 science and technology centers, 19 engineering research centers, 9 materials research laboratories, 5 national supercomputer centers and 41 smaller industry-university cooperative research centers.
The science and technology centers, for instance, are multimillion-dollar projects that have been designed to study things like tiny semiconductors that might be used in future computer circuits, the way microbes affect hazardous waste disposal and better mathematical models for predicting weather.
 
Grants to Individuals
 "We will continue the efforts begun by Erich Bloch," said Dr. Massey, who is known for a more congenial management style than his predecessor. "I think the direction in which the agency is now heading is a proper one." One area that will get more attention, he said, is increasing the size of grants to individual scientists. The average foundation grant is now about $55,000, which critics say is hardly enough to support a researcher and even one graduate student assistant.
Dr. Massey, formerly director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois and professor of physics and dean at Brown University, was no stranger to Washington or the foundation before his appointment as director. Well known in science policy circles, he was a member of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, a group formed to advise President Bush on scientific issues. He had also served on the National Science Board, the science foundation's governing body, and on numerous Federal scientific boards and commissions.
A graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Dr. Massey received his M.S. and Ph.D degrees in physics from Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Massey's personal research has been in methods of calculating the low-temperature properties of strongly interacting fluids.
Dr. Massey has long been a supporter and originator of science education programs designed to get more young pupils, particularly members of minority groups and girls, interested in science careers. While at Brown University, for instance, Dr. Massey founded and directed a program to educate science teachers for inner-city schools. "The N.S.F., which has science education as one of its major goals, has done fairly well lately in this area and this is certainly something I will emphasize," he said.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Court's Ruling Widening Ban on Juror Exclusion by Race

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 6-to-3 decision yesterday holding that jurors may not be excluded on the basis of race from serving in civil cases. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia; Justice Scalia also filed a separate dissent.
 
FROM THE OPINION
 We must decide in the case before us whether a private litigant in a civil case may use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on account of their race. Recognizing the impropriety of racial bias in the courtroom, we hold the race-based exclusion violates the equal protection rights of the challenged jurors. . . . 
 Thaddeus Donald Edmonson, a construction worker, was injured in a job-site accident at Fort Polk, La., a Federal enclave. Edmonson sued Leesville Concrete Company for negligence in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, claiming that a Leesville employee permitted one of the company's trucks to roll backward and pin him against some construction equipment. . . .
 During voir dire, Leesville used two of its three peremptory challenges authorized by statute to remove black persons from the prospective jury. Citing our decision in Batson v. Kentucky, (1986), Edmonson, who is himself black, requested that the District Court require Leesville to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the two jurors. The District Court denied the request on the ground that Batson does not apply in civil proceedings. As impaneled, the jury included 11 white persons and 1 black person. The jury rendered a verdict for Edmonson, assessing his total damages at $90,000. It also attributed 80 percent of the fault to Edmonson's contributory negligence, however, and awarded him the sum of $18,000.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 The full court then ordered rehearing en banc. A divided en banc panel affirmed the judgment of the District Court, holding that a private litigant in a civil case can exercise peremptory challenges without accountability for alleged racial classifications. The court concluded that the use of peremptories by private litigants does not constitute state action and, as a result, does not implicate constitutional guarantees. . . .
 We granted certiorari, 498 U.S. (1990), and now reverse the Court of Appeals.
 In Powers v. Ohio, (1991), we held that a criminal defendant, regardless of his or her race, may object to a prosecutor's race-based exclusion of persons from the petit jury. . . .
 Powers relied upon over a century of jurisprudence dedicated to the elimination of race prejudice within the jury selection process. . . . While these decisions were for the most part directed at discrimination by a prosecutor or other government officials in the context of criminal proceedings, we have not intimated that race discrimination is permissible in civil proceedings. Indeed, discrimination on the basis of race in selecting a jury in a civil proceeding harms the excluded juror no less than discrimination in a criminal trial. In either case, race is the sole reason for denying the excluded venire person the honor and privilege of participating in our system of justice.
 That an act violates the Constitution when committed by a government official, however, does not answer the question whether the same act offends constitutional guarantees if committed by a private litigant or his attorney. The Constitution's protections of individual liberty and equal protection apply in general only to action by the government. Racial discrimination, though invidious in all contexts, violates the Constitution only when it may be attributed to state action. Thus, the legality of the exclusion at issue here turns on the extent to which a litigant in a civil case may be subject to the Constitution's restrictions.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Although the conduct of private parties lies beyond the Constitution's scope in most instances, governmental authority may dominate an activity to such an extent that its participants must be deemed to act with the authority of the government and, as a result, be subject to constitutional constraints. This is the jurisprudence of state action, which explores the "essential dichotomy" between the private sphere and the public sphere, with all its attendant constitutional obligations.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Our cases have found state action when private parties make extensive use of state procedures with "the overt, significant assistance of state officials." It cannot be disputed that, without the overt, significant participation of the government, the peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury trial system of which it is a part, simply could not exist.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 By enforcing a discriminatory peremptory challenge, the court "has not only made itself a party to the (biased act), but has elected to place its power, property and prestige behind the (alleged) discrimination." . . .
 . , . The peremptory challenge is used in selecting an entity that is a quintessential governmental body, having no attributes of a private actor. The jury exercises the power of the court and of the government that confers the court's jurisdiction. . . .
 If a government confers on a private body the power to choose the government's employees or officials, the private body will be bound by the constitutional mandate of race-neutrality. . . .
 Were it not for peremptory challenges, there would be no question that the entire process of determining who will serve on the jury constitutes state action. The fact that the government delegates some portion of this power to private litigants does not change the governmental character of the power exercised. . . .
 Finally, we note that the injury caused by the discrimination is made more severe because the government permits it to occur within the courthouse itself. Few places are a more real expression of the constitutional authority of the government than a courtroom, where the law itself unfolds. . . .
 Race discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there. . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	 Racial discrimination has no place in the courtroom, whether the proceeding is civil or criminal. . . . The Constitution demands nothing less. We conclude that courts must entertain a challenge to a private litigant's racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in a civil trial.
 It may be true that the role of litigants in determining the jury's composition provides one reason for wide acceptance of the jury system and of its verdicts. But if race stereotypes are the price for acceptance of a jury panel as fair, the price is too high to meet the standard of the Constitution. Other means exist for litigants to satisfy themselves of a jury's impartiality without using skin color as a test. . . .
 By the dispassionate analysis which is its special distinction, the law dispels fears and preconceptions respecting racial attitudes. The quiet rationality of the courtroom makes it an appropriate place to confront race-based fears or hostility by means other than the use of offensive stereotypes. Whether the race generality employed by litigants to challenge a potential juror derives from open hostility or from some hidden and unarticulated fear, neither motive entitles the litigant to cause injury to the excused juror. And if a litigant believes that the prospective juror harbors the same biases or instincts, the issue can be explored in a rational way that consists with respect for the dignity of persons, without the use of classifications based on ancestry or skin color.
 
FROM THE DISSENTS
By Justice O'Connor
 The Court concludes that the action of a private attorney exercising a peremptory challenge is attributable to the government and therefore may compose a constitutional violation. This conclusion is based on little more than that the challenge occurs in the course of a trial. Not everything that happens in a courtroom is state action. A trial, particularly a civil trial, is by design largely a stage on which private parties may act; it is a forum through which they can resolve their disputes in a peaceful and ordered manner. The government erects the platform; it does not thereby become responsible for all that occurs upon it. As much as we would like to eliminate completely from the courtroom the specter of racial discrimination, the Constitution does not sweep that broadly. Because I believe that a peremptory strike by a private litigant is fundamentally a matter of private choice and not state action, I dissent.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 The peremptory challenge "allow(s) parties," in this case private parties, to exclude potential jurors. It is the nature of a peremptory that its exercise is left wholly within the discretion of the litigant. . . . By allowing the litigant to strike jurors for even the most subtle of discerned biases, the peremptory challenge fosters both the perception and reality of an impartial jury. In both criminal and civil trials, the peremptory challenge is a mechanism for the exercise of private choice in the pursuit of fairness. The peremptory is, by design, an enclave of private action in a government-managed proceeding.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 The Court errs also when it concludes that the exercise of a peremptory challenge is a traditional government function. . . . Whatever reason a private litigant may have for using a peremptory challenge, it is not the government's reason. . . .
 Racism is a terrible thing. It is irrational, destructive and mean. Arbitrary discrimination based on race is particularly abhorrent when manifest in a courtroom, a forum established by the government for the resolution of disputes through "quiet rationality." See ante, at 16. But not every opprobrious and inequitable act is a constitutional violation. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause prohibits only actions for which the Government can be held responsible. The Government is not responsible for everything that occurs in a courtroom. The Government is not responsible for a peremptory challenge by a private litigant. I respectfully dissent.
 
By Justice Scalia
 We have now added to the duties of already-submerged state and Federal trial courts the obligation to assure that race is not included among the other factors (sex, age, religion, political views, economic status) used by private parties in exercising their peremptory challenges. . . . Thus, yet another complexity is added to an increasingly Byzantine system of justice that devotes more and more of its energy to sideshows and less and less to the merits of the case. Judging by the number of Batson claims that have made their way even as far as this Court under the pre-Powers regime, it is a certainty that the amount of judges' and lawyers' time devoted to implementing today's newly discovered law of the land will be enormous. That time will be diverted from other matters, and the overall system of justice will certainly suffer.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Report on Japan Economy Creates Furor at Institute

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, June 4

 BODY:
A draft report on the Japanese economy prepared for the Central Intelligence Agency, describing the Japan as an "immoral, manipulative and controlling culture," has shaken the Rochester Institute of Technology and has led its president to suspend ties with the agency.
"I think the institution is more important than that tie," M. Richard Rose, the president of the private 13,000-student institute, said last week. 
 Mr. Rose said the R.I.T. Research Corporation, a profit-making entity of the institute that prepared the report and promotes its work, has contracts with the agency worth $1.9 million this year. Mr. Rose recently finished a four-month sabbatical working as a consultant for the agency at its headquarters in Langley, Va.
It was while he was there that the report became public. In response to the resulting controversy, Mr. Rose plans to provide an explanation and announce on Thursday, at a meeting with faculty and students, whether he will stay as president.
 
Panel to Study C.I.A. Ties
 Mr. Rose said last week that he had severed ties between the institute and the agency until at least the fall, when a panel he commissioned will investigate the relationship. The panel will also examine the research conducted on the agency's behalf, including the report on Japan.
The report, which Mr. Rose has described as embarrassing, examines Japan's economic strength. Its disclosure comes as the Japanese are being solicited for funds to expand programs at the institute. The report, which is one of a series commissioned by the agency, maintains that Japan seeks to dominate the world through its economic power.
A small group of students and faculty members has been pushing for Mr. Rose's resignation since it was disclosed in April that he was using his sabbatical to help the intelligence agency develope educational and training strategies. They maintain that his ties to the agency threaten academic freedom, because the nature of much its work is secret.
The protest led to little more than counter-demonstrations on Mr. Rose's behalf until May 24 when The Democrat and Chronicle newspaper here published an article about the report, which is titled "Japan 2000." The report, prepared by Mr. Rose's executive assistant, Andrew Dougherty, included a preface under Mr. Rose's name but was written by Mr. Dougherty.
Mr. Dougherty, the institute's liaison to the intelligence agency, took responsibility for the draft, and released a revised edition that omitted some of the more inflammatory language.
Joan B. Stone, a professor of mathematics who is chairwoman of the institute's faculty council, said, "The 'Japan 2000' report made it clear to people what the difficulty is with secrecy and not having open critique." Professor Stone said she wanted to hear from Mr. Rose on Thursday before taking a position on whether he should remain president.
Mr. Rose, who returned to Rochester a week before his sabbatical was due to end on June 1, said that he had done nothing improper by working for the agency and that the institute had never kept secret its contracts with the agency.

HEADLINE: School Districts Reeling In Weakened Economy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CENTRAL FALLS, R.I., May 30

 BODY:
After years of stretching meager budgets, the Central Falls School Department this school year pinched the last penny it could.
The district, chronically poor because of a limited tax base, had trimmed expenses by using textbooks so long they were falling apart, by turning basements into classrooms and by purchasing $300 used cars. 
 Despite the cost-cutting, the school system of 2,700 students had to get $1 million in emergency state aid this year, and in March it did something no other school system in the United States had ever done: It asked the state to take it over, a request Rhode Island officials are expected to approve in the next few weeks.
 
Control Within Districts
 American communities cherish a centuries-old tradition of ruling their own school districts. Except for heeding certain requirements for educating disadvantaged students, and accepting supplementary funds from state or Federal sources, they have staunchly resisted outside interference in school affairs.
"There is a certain amount of fear over the loss of local control with a state takeover," acknowledged Maureen Chevrette, the school superintendent. "But without the takeover, we couldn't open next year."
As goes Central Falls, so may go many of the nation's school districts because of the current recession and the inability to raise taxes -- compounded in some instances by fiscal mismanagement. From Massachusetts to California, growing numbers of school systems required emergency state aid to finance the closing days of this school year, and many more will need assistance to reopen their doors next fall.
In Ohio, 49 of the state's 612 school systems needed emergency aid this year, and state officials expect the number to at least double next year. California reports 25 school systems with severe budget problems, up from 7 last year.
In some cases, school districts have tapped cash reserves, spending on daily operations money that had been intended for long-term projects like building programs.
"This is clearly the toughest situation for school districts since World War II," said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the National School Boards Association. "The system is out of harmony with the economic realities."
Reasons abound for the fiscal calamity. School systems have been squeezed by laws that limit how much taxes can be increased in a single year. Schools have also hurt themselves through fiscal mismanagement. That was what produced the bankruptcy filing this spring of the Richmond, Calif., Unified School District, according to a scathing report issued Monday by a grand jury investigating the district's failure.
But the biggest factor affecting school districts may well be the current recession. Although the 1981 and 1974 recessions hurt schools, this one has been close to catastrophic, according to education officials in several states.
Thirty-eight states have budget deficits because of sharply diminished revenue from a variety of taxes this fiscal year, which have forced Draconian school budget cuts. And in the hardest-hit areas, like the Northeastern states, the recession has reduced property values, upon which local school taxes are based.
The fiscal fallout has had ripple effects well beyond the classroom. Moody's Investor Service, an organization that rates the creditworthiness of corporations and governments, recently downgraded the credit ratings of four California districts, including Richmond, making it more difficult for these systems to borrow money or issue bonds. Several states have also initiated efforts to merge school systems to save money and improve academic programs.
 
Recession's Impact on District
 Central Falls, a working-class community of 17,637 residents about 5 miles northeast of Providence, is emblematic of the grim fiscal climate for public schools. At the start of this school year, Central Falls school officials said they realized they were fighting a losing battle, despite getting $1 million in state aid to supplement an $11.5 million budget -- already reduced from $13.5 million.
Largely because of the recession, state aid to Rhode Island school systems was cut by $33 million for the 1992 fiscal year beginning July 1. In Central Falls, efforts to make up for that loss by generating other types of revenue have been difficult.
A state law prohibits local jurisdictions from raising taxes more than 5 1/2 percent a year. Even without increases, Central Falls already levies the highest tax rate in the state -- $54.75 for every $1,000 in property value. Yet it remains the poorest of Rhode Island's 37 school systems. The town's tax base is limited and cannot be expanded because the 1.2-square-mile town is bordered by other communities on every side and cannot grow.
Moreover, James R. Martin, the school system's business manager, said, "State aid has not kept pace with the Federal and state mandated programs," like special classes for the handicapped or those who do not speak English. Rhode Island's system of reimbursing local school systems for state-mandated programs has not been amended to keep up with the cost of supporting growing numbers of pupils who need the expensive special programs, Central Falls school officials said.
Like many school systems in the country, Central Falls has had to accommodate growing numbers of handicapped and minority pupils, who represent roughly 25 percent and 44 percent respectively of the system's 2,700 students. Required programs like bilingual education and classes for children with hearing or vision impairments now account for 30 percent of the system's budget, school officials said.
The district has attracted growing numbers of poor and minority families, many of them recent immigrants from Central American counties, in part because of its reputation of accommodating youngsters with special needs. Indeed, state officials said that Central Falls's reputation as a district attuned to its residents was one reason the state responded quickly to the district's call for help.
But the pressures of educating these children, while keeping up academic offerings for most of the students, finally led the system to ask that the state take it over. The district will lose virtually all of its local control in finances and operations. Staffing, already reduced this year through employee contract buyouts and early retirements, is expected to remain about the same.
Although the cost of the takeover to the state is still undetermined, state officials said they would try to allow current programs to continue, like an entire elementary school dedicated to preschool and kindergarten pupils with learning disabilities. The state will manage the system indefinitely.
"We need all the help we can get," said Linda Colvin, an elementary school music teacher.
If demographics and a tax-rate ceiling helped hobble Central Falls, the recession has largely undone the public schools in Holyoke, Mass.
 
Cutbacks in Holyoke
 The school system has laid off teachers and reduced academic offerings, like foreign language classes, and extracurricular activities, including sports at the middle-school level. District officials worry that next year Holyoke might not have the money to comply with special education requirements and desegregation programs mandated by state and Federal law.
The district's $29 million budget is in danger of being reduced next year because the City of Holyoke does not have enough money to maintain its $24 million contribution to it. The district may even have trouble staying open for the 180-day school year next year, said George Counter, the Superintendent of Schools.
"I think it stinks," he said of the potential for more program reductions. "Nobody seems to care. They just say, 'Cut the budget.' "
Harold Raynolds Jr., the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Education, said: "We really are in a kind of catastrophic situation."
But for all the external factors buffeting school budgets, financial problems sometimes simply reflect mismanagement. After the Richmond bankruptcy filing in April, a grand jury investigating the district's finances attributed much of the blame to Walter L. Marks, the former superintendent of schools, who was dismissed last December, and who has refused to comment on the situation.
The Contra Costa County grand jury reported on Monday that the district's failure was the result of "inexperience in fiscal management, inability to evaluate faulty proposals and projections presented to the board by administrators, a reluctance to refuse demands by unions and community groups and a large dose of wishful thinking."
Although the grand jury does not identify Mr. Marks by name, it said he greatly enlarged his staff and overrode cost procedures. The report said: "No legal penalties are provided for such failure, nor are there legal penalties provided for the superintendent and his associates for their mismanagement of the school system. The price is paid largely by the students of the district."

"But without the takeover, we couldn't open next year." (Photographs by Bill Powers for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Down; Gold Prices Little Changed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower yesterday as profit taking eroded recent gains.
Gold prices were little changed from late Monday's levels. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell 50 cents, closing at $362.50 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $362.00, unchanged from Monday. 
 Analysts said the dollar continued to draw support from a spate of positive economic reports in the last week. The reports, which suggest the economy may be gaining strength, have increased the chances that United States interest rates will remain stable and not be lowered to help stimulate growth.
The dollar is generally helped by higher yields, which attract foreign buyers to United States investments.
John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer with Algemene Bank Nederland, said the dollar was strong enough yesterday to shake off disappointing May sales figures from the nation's auto makers.
He attributed the dollar's declines to profit taking by traders who took large positions in response to the favorable economic news. The dollar moved higher on Friday after the Government said its chief economic forecasting gauge registered a strong advance in April, and the currency rose again on Monday.
The markets were looking forward to the Labor Department's report on May employment, scheduled for release on Friday. If the report also points to an end to the recession, the dollar would be expected to climb further.
The British pound gained against the dollar Tuesday, rising to $1.7000 in New York from $1.6970 late Monday. In earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.7035 from $1.6970.
The dollar fell to 138.85 yen in New York, from 139.15 late Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell by 0.43 yen, to a closing 138.80, and in London, it was quoted at 138.75 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, were: 1.7455 German marks, down from 1.7485; 1.4920 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900; 5.9115 French francs, down from 5.9220; 1,292.75 Italian lire, down from 1,294.00, and 1.14445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14415.
In the precious metals market, gold edged up in London to a late bid of $362.70, from $362.60 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $362.20 from $362.60. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at $362.35.
Silver fell 1.5 cents on the Commodity Exchange, to $4.141 an ounce. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $4.20, from $4.17 late Monday.

 BODY:
IT is an article of faith in financial markets that lower interest rates are good for the economy and higher rates are bad.
But goodness and badness depend on the financial condition of the beholder. Households, particularly retired people who are most likely to have large savings, could logically conclude that lower rates are bad and higher rates good. 
 For the country as a whole, household savings have long been greater than debts, even including home mortgages, and households have traditionally earned more interest than they pay. Since the late 1970's, when controls on interest rates were removed from bank deposits, the gap between interest receipts and interest payments has widened. By the first quarter of this year, households earned $680 billion of interest but paid only $320 billion.
The gap means that when rates fall, the decline in income is greater than the decline in savings. What's more, the discomfort from lower rates is heightened because interest rates on savings are quicker to decline than on home mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of consumer debt.
Walter Williams, head of American Business Econometrics of Ridgewood, N.J., recently calculated that by September, the four percentage point decline in short-term rates over the last two years would result in a drop of $34 billion annually in interest receipts of households. At the same time, households' interest payments will have fallen by only $4 billion a year.
"We are now in the first recession since the deregulation of interest rates in the early 1980's," Mr. Williams said, "and that has greatly changed the economy's response to changes in interest rates." With 15 percent of personal income coming from interest receipts, up from 6 percent during the 1960's, Mr. Williams contends that changes in interest income are now significant enough to make lower rates hurt the economy.
The negative effects "are not enough by themselves to push the economy into recession," Mr. Williams said. But the loss of income is enough, he said, "to make things worse" since the increases in employment that result from lower rates provide only $1 additional to the economy for every $2 that has been lost in interest income. "Fed easing of interest rates," he said, "no longer helps the economy and no longer can end the recession."
The problem facing the Fed, and part of the reason why lower rates are not producing the expected benefits, Mr. Williams said, "is due to the increased caution of banks who are not lending as aggressively as in the past."
Mr. Williams's findings, though not his conclusions, are not entirely new. A 1988 study by Richard Cantor, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that a three percentage point rise in interest rates (rates were rising at the time of his article) would supply consumers with about $15 billion of cash after tax. The extra cash would increase consumption by about $10 billion, or by a third of 1 percent.
Paul Bennett, another New York Fed economist, published a 1990 article in the summer issue of the bank's Quarterly Review about the influence of financial market changes on interest rates and monetary policy. He concluded that the changes on household cash flow identified by Mr. Cantor were "comparatively minor" relative to other effects of interest rate changes on spending.
The "other" effects are not so easy to identify, but for many economists they are the fundamental reasons why an easing of monetary policy and lower interest rates stimulate the economy and a tighter policy and higher rates restrain it.
The substitution effect, for example, holds that a rise in interest rates causes consumers and businesses to substitute high interest earning investments for spending on goods and services. Alternatively, lower interest rates stimulate the economy as investments become less attractive relative to the pleasures of consumption.
The wealth effect is another explanation for how changes in monetary policy and interest rates might affect the economy. An easing in policy and lower rates, for example, would increase the value of real estate, bonds and other investments, making businesses and consumers feel wealthier and more willing to increase their spending.
While economists search for ways to unequivocally measure the substitution and wealth effects, Fed officials in charge of monetary policy appear persuaded that the effects of changing interest rates on household interest income is small change. The trend toward lower interest rates in the last two years has been criticized as too little, too late, but it shows that the Fed believes that an easier monetary policy and lower interest rates still provide more stimulus than restraint.

U.S. Securities Are Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed and interest rates were stable in quiet trading yesterday. Barring some big surprise, market participants said activity would remain slow until Friday, when May employment figures are released.
"People seem to be positioned the way they want to be in front of the employment data," one government bond trader said. 
 Prices dipped slightly after reports from the nation's leading automobile manufacturers showed that sales in the last 10 days of May were stronger than Wall Street analysts had anticipated. But the price drop was reversed later in the session.
The reports from Detroit showed that sales reached 6.5 million vehicles at an annual rate, pushing the average for the entire month up to around 6 million units, from the anemic 5.5 million vehicles sold in April.
The gain still brings sales back only to levels of February and March, when the pace of the economic decline was accelerating.
"The numbers were a lot stronger than people were looking for, and yet the market didn't react that much," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "Until we get the employment data out of the way, nothing will really matter."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 23/32 late yesterday, up 3/32, to yield 8.33 percent, unchanged from late Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 6/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.11 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 31/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.76 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched lower.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.56 percent, down a basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.69 percent.
New-issue activity accelerated in the investment-grade corporate bond market, where more than $1 billion worth of securities were priced.
The flurry had little effect on prices in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds. Traders said prices of most issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in slow trading.
Municipal bond traders said today's offering of at least $600 million worth of new New York City securities would probably carry a maximum tax-exempt yield of around 8.60 percent. At that level, demand for the issue is likely to be strong, they said.
"Yields of more than 8.50 percent on the City paper will be high enough to attract a lot of buying from investors who are not usually interested in our market," one municipal bond trader said.
Late Monday Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its A-minus rating on New York City securities.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was very slow, traders said. Prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.

HEADLINE: Congress Is Pressured to Retain the Space Station

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The Bush Administration told Congress today that scuttling the space station Freedom could have serious economic and diplomatic results and could deprive the nation's youth of a major source of inspiration.
The White House message was amplified by Japan, Canada and the European Space Agency, partners in the project, whose officials warned that abandonment by the United States of the multibillion-dollar project would jeopardize future international scientific ventures. 
 The Administration even hinted that it was ready to retaliate against members of Congress who are behind the effort to kill the project, should they prevail. Adm. Richard H. Truly, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said that if the station was eliminated, a related project in the home district of the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Jamie Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, to build a new rocket motor "would have to be re-examined."
Mr. Bush's effort to rescue the space station, scheduled for completion by 1999 at the earliest, came a day after the committee voted to deny all of the $2 billion Mr. Bush and the space agency want for the project next year. Arguing that the money was needed for domestic programs, the panel provided just $100 million to explore less costly alternatives.
Administration officials have said they will urge Mr. Bush to veto the bill killing the station. The overall measure provides $80.9 billion for the space agency and housing, environmental and veterans programs for fiscal 1992, which starts Oct. 1.
The full House will vote on the bill on Thursday. Supporters of the space station said they would try to persuade the House to increase spending for the project to $1.9 billion. The money would come from reducing space agency programs by $1.6 billion and by cutting public housing subsidies by $250 million. The Senate has yet to write its version.
Appearing before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, acknowledged that the Administration may have to settle for less than the full $2 billion.
"We should find a way to win the vote in the House and get a substantial, I hope complete, commitment to the station," Mr. Darman said.
He added that equally damaging would be the loss of a source of inspiration to American youths.
"For them, the next big step in space is space station Freedom," Mr. Darman told the lawmakers. "Does the Congress mean to affirm the next leap forward? Or would it rather content itself with a backward glide?"
Admiral Truly warned the same committee that killing the space station would jeopardize the space agency's entire manned space effort.
Mr. Darman, Admiral Truly and John P. Boright, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, warned that if the United States stopped pursuing the space station, foreign countries would be wary of future projects.
That sentiment was echoed by officials from Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency, which plan to place $8 billion of equipment on the station and have already spent $1 billion.
So far, the United States has spent $5.6 billion on the program, Admiral Truly said. It would cost an estimated $250 million to $500 million to close down the program.

HEADLINE: Gloomier Forecast on Ad Outlays

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Recent economic data may suggest that the worst of the recession is over, but a respected advertising industry forecaster has slashed his predictions of how much advertisers will spend in the United States this year.
Ad spending in 1991 will reach $132.6 billion, up only 3.1 percent from $128.6 billion in 1990, which itself was revised downward, the forecaster, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., said yesterday in New York. 
 In December, the usually optimistic Mr. Coen, who provides estimates twice a year, predicted that 1991 ad spending would total $136 billion, up 4.6 percent from his earlier forecast of $130.1 billion for 1990.
 
'Sobering' to Hear Pessimism
 "It's sort of sobering to hear him being pessimistic," said Laurie Goldberger, advertising industry analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "I felt in December he was overly optimistic. His perception of the world is consistent now with mine."
Even so, Mr. Coen's forecast remains higher than many others. A study by Myers Marketing & Research, in Parsippany, N.J., predicts a scant 1.9 percent gain this year.
The prediction by Mr. Coen, who is director of forecasting for McCann-Erickson and who has been tracking ad trends since 1948, is yet another blow to an industry that has suffered through its own recession for three years in addition to the national economic downturn that began in July. Mr. Coen, who is 67 years old, is perhaps the most widely followed forecaster of advertising spending in the country.
In making his initial ad-spending forecast for 1992, however, Mr. Coen sees sunnier skies, predicting a robust rise of 8.5 percent, to $144 billion, because of the Olympics and the Presidential election.
"I see lots of reasons to be optimistic about the future," Mr. Coen told his audience of investment analysts and reporters at the University Club, "as long as we can forget the present."
Addressing current conditions, "the consensus is that things are beginning to turn around," Mr. Coen said, "but it will probably be the fourth quarter before any real confidence returns and we see any signs of a big pickup in ad spending." Any acceleration will have to struggle to overcome the "lid that was put on just about all spending plans that could be held back in December or January," he said. That was when large national marketers decided to make significant cutbacks in the face of the twin travails of the recession and the Persian Gulf war.
 
Local Newspapers Hit Hard
 The media being hit hardest by the continued sluggishness in ad spending, Mr. Coen said, are local newspapers, in both retail and classified ad linage; the national television networks; local television stations, and magazines. Among the few he identified as enjoying substantial gains are national cable television networks and nationally syndicated television programming.
Over all, Mr. Coen's forecasts national ad spending to increase at a rate more than twice that of local ad spending. Nationally, he predicted a gain of 4 percent, to $75.66 billion, while locally, the gain would be 1.9 percent, to $56.93 billion. Continuing to slow the growth on the local level is the molasses-like movement in newspaper ad spending, which accounts for 50.7 percent of total local ad spending.
Mr. Coen is more sanguine about ad spending outside the United States. His predicts that ad spending overseas this year will climb 6.1 percent, to $153.5 billion, from $144.6 billion in 1990, led by strong gains in countries like Spain, up 10 percent; the Netherlands, up 9.7 percent, and Italy, up 9.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Decline, but Hope Is Seen

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 4

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks dropped 10 percent in May from a year earlier, but on a seasonally adjusted basis car sales alone were slightly stronger than in the previous month, leading to some hope that the automotive recession may have bottomed out.
Car sales, a barometer of economic health, are being closely watched for signs that a recovery may be under way. But statistics from a single 10-day period or just one month are often misleading, as they were in January and February when many analysts thought the bottom of the automotive downturn had been reached. Subsequent sales reports in March and April were weak, squelching the optimism. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales in May was 6 million, compared with 5.5 million in April. For the final 10 days of the month, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was 6.6 million. The rate for May 1990 was 6.7 million.
"With the exception of April and January, last month still was one of the lowest sales months in memory," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York. "We may have hit bottom, but we're a long way from a recovery."
Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said the May results were "consistent with a slow, steady recovery." But he added, "It's a little early to be calling it a trend."
Sales of what are considered domestically built cars -- those made in the United States and Canada -- dropped 9.8 percent in May, to 579,406, compared with 642,304 a year earlier. Light-truck sales, which include pickups, mini-vans and utility vehicles, dropped 10.4 percent, to 338,074, from 377,281 a year ago. Combined vehicle sales were 917,480, a 10 percent drop from the 1,019,585 sold in May 1990.
During the final 10 days of the month, car sales slipped 11.6 percent, to 261,362, from 295,620 in 1990. Light-truck sales dropped 15.3 percent, to 138,436, from 163,489 a year earlier.
 
Statistical Anomaly
 In mid-May, sales of domestically built vehicles rose slightly, but analysts said the increase was a statistical anomaly resulting from unusually weak sales in the period last year.
Sales of domestically built cars dropped 11.6 percent in late May, to 261,362, compared with 295,620 last year. For the month, sales of domestically built cars dropped 9.8 percent, to 579,406, from 642,304 last year.
The General Motors Corporation's domestic car sales declined 11.2 percent, to 263,434, and light-truck sales dropped 11.7 percent, to 136,623 for the month. The Buick division was the only G.M. division to post a sales increase.
James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president, noted that the company's sales decline in May was less steep than the 15.1 percent decline in cars and 19.9 percent decline in trucks for the first five months of the year. G.M. thinks "the present economic cycle has bottomed out" and sales will begin improving, Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
But for the last 10 days of the month, G.M.'s car sales were off 18.7 percent, to 109,058, while truck sales were off 16.8 percent, to 53,854.
Robert L. Rewey, the Ford Motor Company's vice president for sales, said, "The economic recovery anticipated on Wall Street is not yet evident on Main Street." Despite some positive economic signs, Mr. Rewey said that "underlying economic weakness will moderate any near-term sales resurgence."
For the month, Ford's domestic car sales were 142,657, down 11.9 percent. Light-truck sales for the month were 111,359, down 13.4 percent.
For the May 21-31 period, Ford's domestic car sales dropped 20.3 percent, to 56,345; light-truck sales dropped 21.4 percent, to 43,811. The Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable, Lincoln Town Car, Lincoln Continental and Ford Explorer were among the few Ford models that had higher sales.
The Chrysler Corporation's domestic car sales dropped 23 percent in May, to 61,406, while light-truck sales declined 9.3 percent, to 73,942. Of that total, 34,259 -- almost half -- were mini-vans, representing a 4 percent increase over May 1990 for that type of vehicle.
The two top Japanese auto makers in the American market, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company, each registered a smaller drop in sales than their Big Three rivals, helping them gain a bigger share of the market in May. The Nissan Motor Company's market share remained roughly the same.

Booksellers Cheered Up By Convention Crowds

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Record attendance and brisk business at the convention of the American Booksellers Association lifted the mood of a publishing industry made gloomy by recession.
The association said in a statement that 35,869 people attended the four-day meeting at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, compared with 24,650 at the convention in Las Vegas, Nev., last year. 
 The attendance included 7,815 booksellers, 16,511 representatives of American publishing companies and more than 10,000 literary agents, foreign publishers and other visitors. The total exceeded pre-convention estimates by more than 10,000.
Holding the convention in New York, the center of the publishing industry, certainly contributed to its popularity.
 
New Stores Opening
 There were clear signs of the vitality of the book business despite slumping sales in the first half of this year. Laure C. Aubuchon, a vice president of Baker & Taylor Books, said 50 or 60 new stores had made inquiries about acquiring books. Baker & Taylor, with more than 160,000 books in its largest warehouse in Illinois, is one of the country's leading wholesalers.
"An incredible number of people are opening new stores," she said.
Sandor Szatman, the national accounts manager for Little, Brown & Company, said the continuing spread of "superstores" was another indication of the health of the business. Such stores usually stock more than 50,000 titles, compared with 10,000 in the average chain store. They have been opened in recent years both by independents and the big chains, like Barnes & Noble, Waldenbooks and Crown Books.
"People are looking for quality and choice," Mr. Szatman said. Reflecting this, Charles R. Cumello, president of Waldenbooks, said he hoped to expand his average store to about 20,000 titles where possible.
Although the convention went better than most people had expected, concerns persisted over the recession. "What's the issue?" asked Christopher Kerr, the sales manager of Little, Brown. "It's staying in business. People are really, really worried. The war was blamed for poor sales and now the war is over and business has not rebounded as aggressively as had been hoped."
 
'Getting Harder to Collect'
 He added that several publishers were having problems getting paid by bookstores. "It's getting harder to collect," he said.
Another contentious issue between publishers and booksellers is who pays for freight. "Free freight" has become a slogan among stores. But publishers are split, with some, like Random House and Little, Brown, declining to pay, and others, like Bantam Doubleday Dell, covering the cost of shipments.
"Freight is the bitterest single issue," said Donald B. Alper, the president of Bedford Books Inc., a company of 11 bookstores in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. "Our profit margin is small and publishers can factor the freight into the cost of the book. But the bookseller's price is set and paying for freight further erodes our profits."
Jack Hoeft, the chief operating officer of Bantam Doubleday Dell, said he thought free freight would be a stimulus to the industry. "We have free freight and I would encourage all my competition to do the same," he said.
But Mr. Kerr of Little, Brown said he did not think the company would switch its policy. He argued that those publishers that do not pay freight tended to compensate for booksellers' added costs by offering them steeper discounts off list price.

HEADLINE: Recession Puts Summer Job Market in Doldrums, Youths Find

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
Only a few years ago employers were searching desperately for students who would fill the traditional jobs of summer -- at the beach, at amusement parks, at resort hotels.
But seasons change and so do economic cycles. And this year it's the young people who are going begging. 
 Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Department of Labor Statistics, said employers' need for summer help in New York and New Jersey last year resulted in about 700,000 more jobs in June, July and August for young people from 16 to 24 years old. No figures will be available for this year until the end of the summer, but labor analysts expect the recession to shrink the summer job pool, and employers and young job-seekers say they are already seeing the effects.
"It is going to be a very tough job market for them," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
 
More Competition
 No breakdown was available on the number of summer jobs last year in Connecticut, which is part of a different Federal statistical region. But C. Richard Ficks, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Labor, said young people there would also face problems finding jobs this year.
"There have been major layoffs in insurance and banking, and they were targets for young people," he said.
It is true that the baby boom has yielded to the birth dearth, as demographers would say, leaving a smaller pool of people 16 to 24 chasing the jobs that are available. But in tough economic times, it is not just young people who want the seasonal jobs.
Some adults thrown out of work because of weakness in the region's economy will take any jobs available. And retired people -- a pool of labor that employers turned to in the mid-1980's when they could not find enough teen-agers for summer jobs -- are also filling some of the seasonal slots.
At the Water's Edge Inn and Resort in Westbrook, Conn., the personnel manager, Madeleine Flaherty, said that only three years ago, local teen-agers scoffed at low-paying housekeeping jobs, and the resort was forced to hire a dishwasher from New York City, 80 miles away.
But this year she has scores of applications from high school and college students. "We can be choosier now," she said. "And a lot of the kids we had last year are coming back. They're hanging on to whatever they can get."
Ms. Flaherty said that the hourly wage for a dishwasher at the resort, which increases its staff to 130 each summer, from 90, has dropped from $7 to $6.50 since last year, and the minimum-age requirement for housekeepers has been raised from 15 to 16.
"It is incredible -- I've watched a whole cycle," she said. "Kids wouldn't take a dishwasher job five years ago, but now they come in and beg for dishwasher jobs -- and I tell them there are no dishwasher jobs. Now we have men doing the dishwashing and just one or two kids."
At the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, N.J., 25 percent of the 3,500 employees are adults, up from 20 percent last year.
Brian E. Simmons, a personnel supervisor at the theme park, said that nonstudent labor offers an advantage because adults do not have to wait for classes to end before they can work. "We've seen a big increase in the adult population that has taken slots," he said. "Now for the youths, there is a little bit less here."
 
Cutting Back Advertising
 Six Flags Great Adventure expects to receive 9,000 summer job applications this season, compared with 7,000 last year. And the park, the largest private summer employer in the state, has been able to do its hiring earlier than in the past: on May 20, a week before Memorial Day weekend and the unofficial kickoff of summer, 94 percent of its jobs were filled this year, compared with 88 percent a year ago.
In response to the glut of applications, Six Flags Great Adventure has cut back on its job advertising and recruitment in local schools.
"The word has gotten out in the schools that we're not hiring like we were," said Melissa J. Tanney, 17 years old, of Freehold, N.J., who works in the summer as a personnel assistant at the park. "So a lot of people probably aren't even coming in to apply."
Amy Carroll of Colt's Neck, N.J., a 19-year-old University of Miami student, recently applied for a job at the theme park after failing to find anything at several restaurants, a bakery and a video store. "It's been pretty difficult," she said. "There are usually signs up everywhere advertising for people, but this year there aren't any."
State budget cuts are also hurting young people's chances for summer jobs this year. In Connecticut, part of one of the state's most popular beaches, at Hammonasset State Park, will be closed this year because the state did not have money to hire enough lifeguards. The beach will have 18 lifeguards this year, one fewer than last year and a big drop from the 33 lifeguards employed in the mid-1980's.
"This year we have more applicants but fewer jobs for them," said Gus Constantine, water-safety program coordinator in the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
 
'Outlook Is Very Dim'
 Employment counselors at local high schools agreed that there were fewer jobs available for students than in past years. In the 1980's, students wanted jobs that were career-oriented or in fields that interested them academically. But now, counselors say, they will take whatever they can get.
"The outlook is very dim," said Iris L. Burroughs, the employment counselor at Julia Richmond High School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "Most of the students are trying to get into the city's job program."
New York City can employ more young people this summer because Federal money for its jobs programs increases when the unemployment rate goes up. That will mean part-time public-sector jobs for 39,500 youths in summer programs this year compared with 24,000 last year.
But a weakened employment situation also means more people seeking work. Josephine Nieves, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Employment, said that more than 1,000 young people a day had been applying for positions.
"We're already turning people away," she said.

HEADLINE: New York Feels Pinch of Slump In U.S. Tourists

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Although foreign visitors continue to find New York City an attractive destination, a steady decline in the number of Americans coming to the city is limiting tourism's ability to help lift New York out of its economic doldrums this summer.
Reservation clerks at several Manhattan hotels say bookings have picked up since the end of the Persian Gulf war in February but are still 5 to 10 percent below the level of last summer, which was also down from the year before. 
 With the national recession, New York has become too expensive a destination for many Americans despite a decline to $134.01 in the average price of hotel rooms in the first three months of this year. The average price for rooms was $138.96 for the corresponding period in 1990.
"The group business and international tourists seem to be coming back, but not the domestic commercial business yet, because of the recession," said John A. Fox, a senior principal at Pannell Kerr Forster, the New York accounting firm that tracks hotel occupancy rates. "I think the summer will be lower than last year, but it depends on the economic recovery."
 
It's Big Business
 The number of visitors to New York City is of far greater import than whether New Yorkers can hope to get a table at a fancy restaurant at the last minute or a ticket to a hot Broadway show. Tourism in New York is big business.
The estimated 25 million tourists who came to New York City in 1989, the most recent year for which figures are available, spent about $9 billion, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
By the time that $9 billion wound its way through the local economy, causing other people to earn and spend more, the total economic impact of tourism was an estimated $12 billion. To put that in perspective, combined Wall Street salaries at their peak in the late 1980's were about $11 billion.
"It's one of the largest industries in the city," Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said of tourism. "It's extremely important."
Of the estimated 25 million tourists who come to New York City annually, domestic tourists outnumber foreign visitors four to one. So the 7 percent decline in domestic airport arrivals and the 5 percent decline in Amtrak arrivals from 1988 to 1990 -- many of whom are presumed to be domestic travelers -- have hurt New York's travel-related industries badly.
 
Softening the Blow
 The continued influx of foreign tourists is all that is softening that blow. That is especially so because although overseas visitors make up only 20 percent of the total in numbers, they account for almost 40 percent of all spending.
Lufthansa German Airlines, for example, reported that since the end of February it has seen a 20 percent increase in passengers on its flights to New York from Frankfurt, compared with the same period last year.
International arrivals at La Guardia, Kennedy International Airport and Newark International Airport, were 5 percent higher in 1990 -- at 11.3 million -- than in 1988 -- at 10.8 million.
These two sides of tourism -- the enthusiastic foreigner and the reluctant American -- were reflected in the attitudes of two sets of tourists who were visiting Manhattan recently. Several teachers from the Midwest who were in town for a national debate competition said they found New York City crowded, dirty and expensive.
 
Not the 'Cheapest Town'
 They did not intend to spend much while in New York, they said, and the advice from their hotel not to go out after 6 P.M. did little to ally their fears of crime.
New York is not "a place that people would put high on their list for a vacation," said Tom Clementi, a humanities teacher from Appleton, Wis.
"And the expense, too -- this isn't the world's cheapest town," he added.
The feeling appears to be different for foreign travelers.
Two Spanish visitors to Manhattan who had decided to stay in New York for a week after completing a business trip said they found New York inexpensive compared with their hometown of Madrid. And that seemed to outweigh any fleeting concerns about coming to personal harm.
"We've spent a lot of money," said Jose Luis Pastor, flashing a somewhat embarrassed smile.
The strength of foreign tourism is "strongly due to the favorable dollar -- more than anything else," said Kerstin Sabene, an assistant manager of public relations in Lufthansa's New York office, referring to the favorable exchange rates most foreign currencies receive in the United States. As for concerns about crime, "our German managers don't think it's a deterrent," she said.
A manager at Mamma Leone's, that mid-Manhattan bastion of pasta that draws so many visitors, reported that "foreign people are kicking back in now that the war is over." Conrad Bennett, the restaurant's director of operations, said, "It's equal to last year, though not better yet."
And Alfred J. Pettanati, the manager of the observation deck at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan is optimistic about attracting steady business from international tour groups this summer. When he was in Berlin in March, local tour operators began telling him that their telephones were finally beginning to ring again. About 50 percent of those who buy tickets to the deck are visitors from abroad, he said.
The growing importance of foreign tourists to New York has led some to call for the city to do more to make itself hospitable and "user-friendly" to visitors from abroad.
Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, says his research shows that the city is too expensive for most Americans and that they find many features of New York alien to their culture, preferring attractions like Disney World or the national parks instead.
Foreign visitors, by contrast, often come from large cities themselves and seem to be more tolerant of dirt and congestion and to take greater pleasure in dabbling in New York's activities, like eating, shopping and taking in cultural events.
New York City already draws about half of all Italians visiting the United States, more than 40 percent of all Spaniards visiting this country and more than a third of all French visitors, Convention and Visitors Bureau figures show.
 
'Enormous' Potential
 Mr. Moss will urge in a forthcoming study on tourism that New York make itself easier for foreign visitors to consume, by making information more readily available in foreign languages, making it easier to change currencies and putting together special shopping or cultural tour packages, like baseball or golfing excursions for enthusiasts from Japan.
"The potential is enormous," said Mr. Moss.
The president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, Marshall E. Murdaugh, could not agree more. Because it now receives a portion of the recently increased hotel tax, the bureau has been able to increase its sales force, open a Washington office and hire sales representatives in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London.
The fruits of that expansion can already be seen. New conventions booked through April of this year are expected to bring 186,980 delegates to the city in future years, compared with 89,945 delegates who were booked during that same period last year for future visits, Mr. Murdaugh said. While that will not have any impact on this summer's business, it is certainly good news for the future.

Shearson Gives Itself a Face Lift

BYLINE: Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
ALMOST a year after it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Express Company, Shearson Lehman Brothers is prettying itself up.
The brokerage house -- the nation's second largest, after Merrill Lynch -- is negotiating deals to shrink its exposure to potential loan losses, Wall Street executives said yesterday. The moves are intended in large part to reassure the bond market, upon which Shearson depends for billions of dollars in financing, that the firm is moving toward better financial health. 
 The effort mainly involves moving troubled assets off of Shearson's balance sheet and on to those of sister companies within American Express or to outside parties, through sales.
In the deals being considered, Shearson would unload at least $3.3 billion of its exposure. An additional deal, in a more preliminary stage, would remove $500 million in capital the firm has at risk.
The deals under consideration include transferring the firm's Balcor real estate subsidiary into a newly created American Express subsidiary, selling the firm's British mortgage portfolio, selling a mortgage company owned by the brokerage and possibly transferring a huge bridge loan to Prime Computer Inc. off of Shearson's books -- even though Prime's interest payments are current.
The various moves to improve the firm's capital base come as Shearson is trying to reduce its borrowing costs. On Monday, the firm registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue $1 billion in debt for general operations.
Shearson executives said yesterday that the new borrowings would be used, in part, to replace some outstanding debt issued when the market was skittish about the firm's credit exposure. As a result, executives expect a drop in the interest rate the firm pays on its debts.
In recent weeks, executives with Shearson and American Express said action would have to be taken to shore up the capital base of the firm. It has been struggling to deal with a number of troubles brought on by investments made in the 1980's.
For American Express shareholders, those statements raised the specter that new stock could be issued by the company to raise money for a capital injection into Shearson -- which would dilute the shares of current stockholders. But analysts said yesterday that the actions taken by Shearson to deal with its credit problems decreased the chance that American Express would have to turn to the equity markets.
"If they are able to remove this possible overhang to their capital, it just makes it that much less likely that American Express will have to recapitalize Shearson," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Indeed, senior Shearson executives said yesterday that they thought the moves to reduce the exposure of the firm would solve its capital problems. "I don't think it's necessary," Howard Clark Jr., Shearson's chairman and chief executive, said of a possible capital injection by American Express.
The reduction of the firm's capital exposure, company executives and other industry officials said, would be accomplished through a series of complex transations.transactions.
For example, the firm's troubled Balcor real estate subsidiary would be transferred at book value to a new American Express subsidiary to be established for the sole purpose of holding it.
The transfer would have no effect on American Express's balance sheet, since it would be a deal between two subsidiaries. But it would remove Balcor from Shearson's balance sheet.
Shearson executives also said yesterday that the firm was seeking a buyer for its mortgage-banking unit, the Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corporation. The unit, based in Irvine, Calif., services about $18 billion in mortgages, and its sale is expected to remove about $1 billion in credit exposure from the firm's balance sheet. While there have been some expressions of interest, it could not be immediately determined which what companies were considering the purchase of were looking at the mortgage unit.
 At the same time, Shearson is seeking a buyr for the British mortgage portfolio of its Boston Company subsidiary. Mr. Clark said yesterday that the firm had found "interested parties who would pay at least what we have in the books," taking an additional $800 million in exposure off the balance sheet.
Although some Wall Street executives and analysts said they expected the firm to transfer to American Express some of the Boston Company's troubled loans -- including one to Donald J. Trump -- Mr. Clark said sufficient reserves had already been set aside to cover the unit's potential problem loans. "What the Boston Company has in loans is going to stay at the Boston Company," he said. "We feel that the reserves are adequate."

HEADLINE: Iraqi Plea on Exports Rejected at OPEC Talks

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 4

 BODY:
OPEC today rejected a request by Iraq for a letter addressed to the United Nations asking for an end to sanctions barring Iraqi oil exports.
The request was made by the Iraqi Oil Minister in what turned out to be the shortest meeting in more than a decade of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 At the one-day meeting, the group decided to retain the current overall production ceiling for its 13 members at the current level of 22.3 million barrels a day, an outcome that was widely expected by the oil industry.
The Iraqi plea for help with the United Nations was firmly rejected by the Arab oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf. The Saudi Oil Minister, Hisham Nazer, told his Iraqi counterpart, Ussama Abdul Razzaq, that four countries present at the meeting, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, had fought a war against Iraq to expel its troops from Kuwait. Mr. Nazer said these countries were not about to plead with the United Nations to lift sanctions that resulted from the Iraqi aggression, according to several Arab delegates here.
 
Demand Will Be Met
 OPEC officials said the quick decision to freeze the present level of production, which is estimated at above the ceiling, averaging a daily output of 22.8 million barrels a day, is enough to match anticipated demand for OPEC oil in the third quarter.
The OPEC ministers agreed to meet again in September to review the supply and demand balance for world oil markets.
That meeting could accomplish little more, however, since both Iraq and Kuwait have been out of the oil-exporting business altogether since Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Because of heavy damage done to the Kuwaiti oil industry and sanctions imposed on Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis, neither country can export oil for at least another six months, OPEC officials estimate.
This would allow Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and the United Arab Emirates to continue to pump as much oil as they can to make up for the shortage from Iraq and Kuwait and reap additional benefits from surpassing their normal quotas.
In its communique today, OPEC reaffirmed, however, that it still regards $21 as the ideal price for oil, even though the current price for OPEC crudes hovers near $17.
The average price of a basket of crude oil monitored by the group stood at $17.68 last week. The price often quoted in the United States, for a premium light sweet grade of crude, is several dollars higher.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange today, crude oil futures settled 11 cents to 15 cents lower, with the July contract at $21.02 a barrel.
The organization's Secretary General, Dr. Subroto, who was elected to a new three-year term, said prices would be rising gradually throughout the year as demand for oil increases, which is what he anticipated. Also, Venezuela's oil minister, Celestino Armas, was elected the new president.

HEADLINE: Industrial Nations Agree To Push for Trade Accord

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 4

 BODY:
The industrial world's finance and trade ministers have resolved to give stalled trade talks a big push forward this summer as they agreed today to try to complete the four-and-a-half-year round of negotiations late this year.
At the annual meeting of ministers of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American, European and Japanese officials said they would seek to make substantial progress this summer in narrowing differences in numerous trade areas, including financial services and subsidies to farmers. 
 At today's meeting, American and European Community officials were not clashing angrily, as they often had in the past, over their differences on how much to slash trade-distorting aid to farmers. Instead, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, and Frans Andriessen, the community's commissioner for external affairs, vowed to step up negotiations in the belief that the plan of the community to change its farm subsidy program could help bridge its differences with Washington.
In the hope of rescuing the talks, the ministers are seeking to put the clashes about the farm aid behind them, but they still acknowledge that it will be difficult to reach an overall agreement. "We have a very narrow time frame and we have to finish the round successfully by the end of this year," Mr. Andriessen said.
Also today, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady urged other industrial nations to increase their growth to help end the economic slowdown in the West and create a favorable economic climate that would spur the reconstruction of Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
After having called for lower interest rates at a Group of Seven meeting in Washington in April, Mr. Brady said he was happy that several European nations, including Britain and Italy, had recently lowered their rates. But he indicated, in a more conciliatory tone than in April, that there was room for further rate cuts, although German officials again said today that they would not lower rates because of their inflation concerns.
Officials here said that the decision by several European countries to lower rates and the sense that the West's economic slowdown was ending had helped temper Mr. Brady's remarks on interest rates. In addition, European officials said that Washington was showing greater understanding that Germany, whose powerful central bank has kept rates high, was in a far different position from the United States since Germany was enjoying strong growth and its inflation was rising.
Nonetheless, Mr. Brady repeatedly suggested that nations that had high interest rates had adopted a defensive strategy that provided little impetus or inspiration for Eastern Europe and the third world. "You cannot produce something that will excite the world with some backward, negative philosphy," he said. "We have to do that with a positive, energy-laden, hopeful philosophy, a strategy of how that's going to be done, and that's growth."
Mr. Andriessen, the community's top trade official, said he regretted that the trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round because they began in that country, had focused so much on agriculture. The talks collapsed last December in Brussels when the community, which said it would reduce subsidies to farmers by 30 percent, refused to move closer to Washington's demand that it cut domestic support to farmers by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent.
Mr. Andriessen said that in exchange for any concession the community made on agriculture, it wanted new rules for trade in financial services and intellectual property as well as new rules for resolving trade disputes.
 
July 31 Goal Urged
 In a speech today to the O.E.C.D. ministers, Mrs. Hills said that by July 31 the 108 nations negotiating in the Uruguay Round should seek to agree to the range of annual reductions in farm subsidies and the base period for which the reductions would begin. She also called for a framework text to liberalize trade in services.
The one area where tensions remained high today involved tied-aid credits, whereby the industrial countries give aid to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union while requiring that the money be used to buy goods from the donor country. Washington is pushing to prohibit such tied aid, which the Eastern Europeans complain is unfair to them because it makes it harder for them to sell goods to each other or the Soviet Union.
But several officials interviewed said Italy, France and several other European nations were opposing such a ban, and that this was blocking an agreement at the meeting.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Ease Rules Affecting Foreign Stocks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed to make it easier for foreign companies to raise money in the United States by exempting them from many Federal securities regulations. The companies instead would need to comply only with the securities rules of their home countries.
The proposed changes, which have widespread support at the commission and are expected to be adopted by the end of the year, mark the third regulatory move by the agency in the last two weeks to attract more trading to the major American markets as global investing increases. 
 "These proposals represent a major step in the evolution of the U.S. securities regulatory system to adapt to the realities of an international marketplace," said Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the S.E.C.
Commission officials said today that the proposed changes would give Americans holding foreign stock the same opportunities as foreign-based shareholders of the same company when the company offered new stock or was in the midst of a takeover contest.
Reducing the barriers would thus allow for greater shareholder activity, they said, and enable foreign businesses to more easily raise capital by selling stock in the United States.
Mr. Breeden said that in 1990 there were more than 600 mergers and takeovers abroad, most of which had some American stockholders who "were excluded from participation in such transactions due to the costs of complying with the full U.S. regulatory scheme."
He said the proposals were intended to make it less burdensome for foreign companies to extend stock offerings to shareholders in the United States.
The S.E.C. currently requires foreign companies to comply with the American regulations on disclosure, timing and accounting, as well as those of the home country. But officials believe those regulations have generally discouraged foreign companies with American stockholders from including them in new offerings and takeover contests.
For instance, during the 1989 attempt by Minorco, the Luxembourg-controlled South African mining giant to take over Consolidated Gold Fields of Britain, Minorco said it would not make its offer available to American shareholders in large part because it said it was too expensive to comply with the Williams Act. The overall bid ultimately failed, however, after it was blocked by a Federal judge who said it would have been in violation of antitrust laws.
The agency estimated that in 1990 Americans holding foreign stocks, which generally trade on the major exchanges in the form of American depository receipts, were excluded from more than 85 offerings.
Since the S.E.C. was established during the Depression, the foundation of American securities laws has been a requirement for disclosure, based on the idea that investors can make their own decisions once they have adequate information. But many other countries require far less disclosure, and companies based in those countries have faced the choice of either making the additional disclosures or being limited in their ability to sell securities to the American public.
Still, largely through American depository receipts, many such companies have been able to attract American shareholders. By allowing those American shareholders to participate in takeovers, the S.E.C.'s proposal could make A.D.R.'s more popular, and thus make it easier for the companies to raise capital in the American market without complying with American disclosure rules.
Some securities scholars said the proposed changes were part of an evolution that would lead to a substantial reduction in the disclosure requirements for American companies.
"These developments ultimately will mean the watering down of the domestic requirements," said James D. Cox, a professor of securities law at Duke University. "You can't live long in as politically attuned an environment as the S.E.C. and impose lighter requirements on a company from Japan than one from Peoria."
The changes proposed today follow two moves late last month aimed at building the nation's securities business in the face of global competition.
On May 20 the agency gave the New York Stock Exchange permission to extend its hours in an attempt to capture growing amounts of institutional trading that have moved abroad. And last week the commission adopted a rule that permits Canadian companies to submit Canadian disclosure documents and prospectuses to the S.E.C. and avoid the higher costs of making different filings under United States requirements.
Today's proposal would exempt foreign companies that have up to 10 percent of their stock held in the United States from the disclosure requirements and time periods for keeping the offers open under the Williams Act. The exemptions would apply to situations in which the foreign companies issue new securities or rights to purchase securities or offer to buy or exchange stock in a foreign company as part of a takeover contest.
The foreign company would instead be required to submit to the S.E.C. any prospectuses and other documents involving the transaction that it filed in its own country. Unlike domestic filings, the foreign submissions would not be reviewed for compliance by the S.E.C. but would be available for public inspection.
A British company making a tender offer for the shares of another British company, for example, could extend the offer to the target company's American stockholders by simply furnishing to the S.E.C. and the stockholders the same documents it files with British authorities.
With the changes proposed today, securities experts said the S.E.C. was reacting in large part to the integration of the economies of 12 nations in Europe next year.
"The S.E.C. is in many respects between a rock and a hard place," said Ronald J. Gilson, a professor of corporate law and securities regulation at Stanford University. "It is in an awkward role as it tries to protect investors at the same time that it is trying to assure that they have the same opportunities as their foreign counterparts."
Mr. Breeden acknowledged that the changes "involve a trade-off," waiving certain investor protections for greater access to foreign markets. But he added that "the practical reality is that such protections would not be available to U.S. shareholders, and U.S. shareholders would not be able to even participate in most of these transactions under any set of regulatory protections."
 
Anti-Fraud Provisions Intact
 The changes would not exempt the foreign companies from the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which have been interpreted to prohibit insider trading.
At a hearing today to disclose the proposed rule changes, Edward H. Fleischman, a commissioner at the agency who formerly worked as a securities lawyer on Wall Street, raised the question of whether foreign companies had actually avoided offerings in the United States to avert lawsuits from shareholders.
Mr. Fleischman was assured by Linda C. Quinn, director of the S.E.C.'s division of corporate finance, that "the rights and liabilities of the foreign companies are the same as if they were in the United States."
The proposals to waive the American requirements would be limited to instances where the American shareholders represent 10 percent or less of the total ownership. In the case of an offer to exchange stock -- a common way of structuring takeovers and raising money by foreign companies -- the proposed waivers would apply only to an offering in which the total value of American stockholdings does not exceed $5 million.

HEADLINE: Shunning Bush Alternative, House Set to Pass Rights Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The House of Representatives tonight defeated President Bush's civil rights bill and set the stage for approval of the Democratic leadership's version, a measure Mr. Bush calls "a quota bill."
The Bush proposal was defeated, largely on party lines, by a vote of 266 to 162. Only 19 Republicans abandoned their President while just 16 Democrats voted with him. 
 Tonight's margin offered no certain guidance on the strength of support that the Democratic leadership's bill would find on Wednesday. Some representatives who voted for the Bush bill tonight have said they would turn around and vote for the leadership's bill Wednesday.
But their total is not expected to approach the 33 representatives who did that last year, voting first for the Administration proposal and then for the civil rights bill.
Earlier today, Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he did not believe the support for the leadership's bill would reach the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override Mr. Bush's threatened veto. That would be 290 votes if the full House voted. Last year's similar bill got 273 votes.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican minority leader, said tonight that Mr. Bush's bill stressed "fairness over quotas, conciliation over litigation, unity over divisiveness." But Representative Don Edwards, the California Democrat who heads the Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, said that bill would make it "very easy for an employer to justify discriminatory practices."
Before that debate, the House swept aside another substitute for the Democartic leadership measure by a vote of 277 to 152.
That alternative was termed "the pure bill" by one backer, Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, because it included none of the compromises the leadership made in the hope of getting a two-thirds majority for its plan.
 
Changes in Court Rulings
 In particular, she and others urged support for their substitute because it did not include any limit on the damages that could be won by women in sex discrimination suits. The leadership's bill limits punitive damages; the Bush bill bars punitive damages altogether.
That is one of many differences among the competing proposals. All would undo some Supreme Court decisions of 1989 and make it easier to sue and collect damages in job discrimination cases, but the Bush bill would make the smallest changes.
Much of today's debate was devoted not to Mr. Bush's proposal but to whether the Democratic leadership's bill would lead to quotas in hiring and promotion.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said it would because "the bill's presumption of guilt and high hurdle of proof will force employers to hire by the numbers." If the bill passed, he said, employers would stop using the term "equal opportunity employer" but prefer "statistically proportonal employer."
 
Putting Intent on the Record
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the majority leader, insisted the bill not only did not promote quotas but "clearly and unequivocally bans all forms of quotas." He said Republicans were speading concerns about quotas so that people laid off in a "Republican recession" would blame blacks or women for their troubles. "Black or white, you get the same pink slip in a Republican recession," he said.
Then he and Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, engaged in a scripted question-and-answer routine intended to establish a political point: that their bill was anti-quota and the President's bill was not, because Mr. Bush's lacked any specific provision declaring quotas unlawful and theirs did.
They also tried to make an important legislative point. "Some have claimed that the quota langauge would forbid quotas in terms of hiring unqualified persons, but would not forbid them with respect to hiring qualified workers," Mr. Gephardt said in their colloquy. "Is this distinction valid?" he asked.
Mr. Brooks read this reply: "The distinction is not valid. The language forbids quotas' being applied to any employment situation -- whether it would involve qualified or unqualified persons. That is why the bill clearly states that quotas are forbidden 'regardless of whether such persons meet necessary qualifications to perform the job.' The adverb 'regardless' is purposely used to eliminate any distinction between setting quotas as between qualified and unqualified workers, or as between different qualified employees."
The full language of bill that includes that passage says, "The term 'quota' means a fixed number or percentage of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded, regardless of whether such persons meet necessary qualifications to perform the job."
The Bush Administration has charged that the Democrats' anti-quota language would in fact legitimize quotas in which employees who barely met job qualifications would be preferred because of race or sex over more-qualified employees.
The colloquy today was intended to establish a legislative history that could be considered by courts on how the measure should be construed if it became law.
 
A Senate Rights Package
 In the Senate, meanwhile, nine moderate Republicans introduced a package of bills intended as a compromise between the Administration and the civil rights groups backing the Democratic bill. Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said he knew Mr. Bush wanted a bill enacted. Asked if he thought one was desired by the White House staff, with whom long and fruitless negotiations were held over the bill Mr. Bush vetoed last year, he replied "I don't know the answer; you'd better ask them."
He said the angry debate accompanying the bill was bad for the country. "Civil rights should not be fodder for partisan cannons," he said. "If there is an issue where political consultants should get lost," he said, "this is it."
One of his colleagues, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, said the bills were "an effort to make clear to the American public that some Republicans are interested in using their electoral margins to improve race relations and not the reverse."
The Danforth package of bills is generally closer to the Democratic proposal than to the White House measure. But when it comes to providing damages for victims of sex or religious discrimination, Mr. Danforth's measures would not allow any punitive damages, as the Democrats' would. But the measure would allow compensatory damages, as Mr. Bush's would not.
Mr. Danforth said that when civil rights legislation comes before the Senate, the support of moderate Republicans will be necessary to pass it in veto-proof strength, or to enable Mr. Bush to have his veto sustained. Therefore, he said, he and his allies were an important swing group.

HEADLINE: CABINET RESIGNS IN ALBANIA STRIKE

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Bowing to the pressure of a general strike and renewed street demonstrations, the Communist Cabinet of Albania resigned today.
The departing Prime Minister, Fatos Nano, said a nonpartisan caretaker cabinet would be appointed to prepare for new elections. The leader of the opposition Democratic Party, Sali Berisha, hailed the action as "a very important step toward real democracy." 
 Mr. Berisha's minority party, which refused to join a coalition with the Communists last month, agreed to support what Mr. Nano called a "government of national salvation."
In effect, today's action represents the end of more than 46 years of Communist rule. President Ramiz Alia, who had been head of the Communist Party since 1985, is to continue as head of state, but in assuming the presidency after elections in March, he quit his party posts.
 
Nonpolitical Caretakers Seen
 Kastriot Islami, President of Parliament, emerged from consultations with opposition leaders to say an interim government would be made up of people who had withdrawn from political parties. He said Mr. Alia would choose a new prime minister and was expected to schedule elections roughly 12 months from now.
Opposition leaders said they expected the voting to take place sooner.
The recently formed Union of Free and Independent Trade Unions, which mobilized half of Albania's 700,000 workers to join in a national strike 20 days ago, said it would recommend going back to work as soon as a nonpartisan government was formed. Their strike demands had included a 50 percent wage increase, better conditions for working women and an assignment of blame for the violent suppression of an anti-Communist demonstration in the northern city of Shkoder on April 2.
About 50,000 Albanians rallied in support of the strikers in the capital, Tirana, last Wednesday, and 6,000 defied police charges and water cannon there on Monday.
The Communists had gained the two-thirds majority required to control Parliament in elections on March 31, which foreign observers judged to be a reasonably accurate reflection of voter sentiment. But their seeming strength was undermined by the severe losses they suffered in almost all of Albania's cities and by a widening split between reformers and hard-liners.
The Communists, with more than 100,000 members still the strongest political group in the country, have scheduled a national congress for Monday. They are expected to disavow some but not all of their Marxist-Leninist tenets at that time.
Albania, a country of 3.5 million people, has been swept by political and economic turbulence ever since the Communist Party began a cautious democratization program 13 months ago under President Alia.
That program lifted the lid from a caldron of problems in a country deliberately sealed off from most of the world by Mr. Alia's predecessor, Enver Hoxha, for four decades. Last spring and summer, strikes broke out in Shkoder and Kavaje, and demonstrators were killed by policemen. Thousands of citizens sought to escape the country. The gross national product fell 10 percent. Unemployment surpassed 14 percent.
In December, university students organized anti-Communist protests in Tirana, and with swelling numbers of demonstrators paralyzing the life of the capital, Mr. Alia agreed to permit the establishment of independent political parties.

HEADLINE: BUSH NOMINATES A TOP DEMOCRAT AS SOVIET ENVOY

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
President Bush named Robert S. Strauss, a close friend, Democratic doyen and master of the political and business deal, as Ambassador to Moscow today, moving to cement his ties to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and foster business contacts at a pivotal moment in Soviet-American relations.
The announcement came as the United States and the Soviet Union were completing plans for a summit meeting in Moscow, probably late in June. 
 Mr. Bush telephoned Prime Minister John Major of Britain today to say he would no longer object if Mr. Gorbachev were invited to London to meet with the leaders of seven industrial democracies after their annual conference, which is to be held in mid-July. Mr. Gorbachev is expected to present the seven leaders with a request for Western financial aid.
 
Bush Seen as Eager
 The announcement of the Strauss appointment, which was made by Mr. Bush in a hastily arranged appearance in the White House Rose Garden and stunned diplomatic ranks here, signaled the President's personal stake in relations with Mr. Gorbachev and his eagerness to "do business" with Moscow, officials said.
It was also an attempt to find a bridge to Democratic lawmakers at a time when Mr. Bush is moving to extend new financial aid to Moscow, the officials continued.
Mr. Bush hoped that naming a hard-boiled capitalist as Ambassador would help draw Soviet-American relations into a more predictable phase, in which business deals and economic issues are becoming as important as the military and diplomatic dimensions of the superpower relationship, the officials said.
 
A Rare Non-Career Appointment
 The 72-year-old Mr. Strauss, whose nomination was made final only this morning, after Mr. Bush received the assent of Mr. Gorbachev, would be only the second envoy to Moscow since World War II who was not a career diplomat or a high-ranking military officer.
In 1979, another time when the United States hoped to foster business ties to Moscow, President Jimmy Carter named Thomas J. Watson Jr., the former chairman of I.B.M., as Ambassador to the Kremlin. The invasion of Afghanistan that December soured those efforts.
In picking Mr. Strauss to replace Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr., who is retiring, Mr. Bush passed over the diplomat initially favored by the State Department, Edward P. Djerejian, now Ambassador to Syria.
Officials said Mr. Bush wanted to break the long string of professionals with limited political connections who served in Moscow during the tense years of the cold war and choose a consummate insider who can act in a personal way as the United States's link to the Soviet Union during much warmer times in the relationship.
"When Gorbachev talks to Strauss, he'll be talking to Bush," one official said.
Mr. Bush made it clear that Mr. Strauss's personal connections and experience in politics outweighed his lack of experience in Soviet relations.
"I frankly can think of nobody, no one more qualified or more talented, to bring to this representation what we need: contacts with high officials, a knowledge of America, a guarantee that two ships -- big ships, important ships -- won't pass in the night for lack of understanding," the President said.
At a brief, almost jocular news conference given by three Texas comrades, Mr. Bush, Mr. Strauss and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Baker said the selection was "a big plus" for "the emerging and continually, positively forward-moving relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union."
Reflecting the swiftness of the appointment, Mr. Strauss said, "I have no statement to make other than a week ago, if anyone had told me I would standing here, I would have thought they were crazy."
Noting that he was a member of the opposition party, he added: "I certainly will come out as a Democrat. And in the meantime, I'll do my damnedest, Mr. President, to represent this nation as you and the Secretary would want me to."
But critics of Mr. Strauss seized on his political background and connections with international business as a Washington lawyer to question the appointment at a time when there is concern here about Soviet policy toward the Baltic republics.
"This is the wrong appointment at the wrong time," said John P. Cregan, President of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council, a conservative group. "Now more than ever, we need someone who is well-versed in U.S.-Soviet relations and instead we've got a guy who is well versed in the art of the deal."
Although Mr. Strauss has long been an important figure in the Democratic Party, and the White House was counting on that to help weather future squalls over its Soviet policy, it remains to be seen how helpful he will be in this respect. His primary function will be to serve as liaison to the Kremlin and as an adviser to the President and to American businesses interested in dealing with the Soviet Union, not as a lobbyist for Administration policy on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman and a man with decades of deep involvement in Presidential campaigns, will be in the unfamiliar and perhaps uncomfortable position of sitting out the 1992 election -- thousands of miles from the political action and silenced by a pledge to promote Bush Administration policy.
The selection of Mr. Strauss, a longtime friend of both Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, came as the United States and the Soviet Union moved rapidly on a broad array of issues.
 
Bush's Soviet Agenda
 These issues will play an important role in shaping Soviet-American relations. Each of them is dependent on decisions that Mr. Bush will be making in the coming days and weeks.
Officials said Mr. Bush was poised to recommend the extension of $1.5 billion in agricultural credits to Moscow, but was awaiting a legally required bureaucratic ruling that the Soviets are capable of repaying the loans.
He was also preparing to send to Congress before the end of the month a trade agreement he and Mr. Gorbachev signed last year, which would give the Soviet Union the best available tariff rates, known as most-favored-nation status.
Mr. Strauss said today that he had turned Mr. Bush "down flat" a week ago when offered the Moscow post, but that Mr. Baker had approached him again -- five times -- and Mr. Bush "really, really squeezed me" to take the job.
A senior Administration official said that last Wednesday, the President telephoned Mr. Baker from Air Force One while he was flying to Colorado Springs to deliver a commencement speech to the Air Force Academy and asked him to talk to Mr. Strauss again.
The Secretary of State met with Mr. Strauss over lunch in his private dining room that day and offered the ambassadorship to Mr. Strauss, who was "flattered and intrigued" but did not jump at it.
 
'95 Percent Ego'
 On Saturday, while Mr. Baker was returning from a trip overseas, Mr. Bush called him to say that Mr. Strauss had finally accepted. "It was 95 percent ego and 5 percent patriotism, I guess," Mr. Strauss said today.
The next day, Sunday, Mr. Baker called the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, and asked him to get formal assent to the appointment on a "fast-track" basis.
Mr. Bessmertnykh called Mr. Baker this morning to say that he had spoken with Mr. Gorbachev and that the Soviet leader was "very enthusiastic" about the idea, the senior official said.
"The President," the official added, "wants to send one of his best friends, a Democrat, and someone who is known as a can-do businessman as a signal to the reformers in the Soviet Union of where we want to go in this relationship."
The President was calculating, the official said, that American businessmen would feel comfortable calling Mr. Strauss and getting his advice on offers of joint ventures and other investments in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: For 700 Students, French Cuisine 101

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
MOST of the 11 New York City high school students dining at L'Ecole restaurant yesterday had never eaten in a French restaurant before, and until three months ago, they had certainly never cooked a French meal.
But since February, they have been part of a new program that has initiated 700 home economics students into the mysteries and near-surgical skills of French cooking. And they were reaping their rewards, only partly in the form of escalopes of codfish and pommes dauphine prepared for them by a kitchen supervised by a former chef to Charles de Gaulle and a former chef at Le Cirque. 
 Under a Board of Education program organized by Richard Grausman, a cookbook author, at 12 high schools, students who have never prepared anything more elaborate than hamburgers and rice and beans were taught to cook poached salmon, crepes, chicken piccata, profiteroles and tricolor pasta made from scratch.
They have been trained in the proper handling of the knife and the omelet pan and in measurement, cleanliness and order. They can talk about presentation and garnishing, frontiers that are new for some home economics classes.
"You curl your fingers when you chop," said Egbert Gibbs, an 18-year-old senior at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn who said he until the program began, he had been most comfortable helping his Trinidadian mother make curried goat. "That way the knife can't cut you."
The students have also learned that there are different worlds and different tastes beyond the mean streets where many of them grew up, though a visitor probably could not have detected that, observing the poise with which the six girls and five boys handled L'Ecole.
"I never tried French cooking," said Aisha Sanjurjo, an 18-year-old senior at Adlai Stevenson High School in the Bronx. "I'm Puerto Rican and I eat Puerto Rican food -- rice and beans, chicken and a lot of pork. French food is a lighter meal for me."
Miss Sanjurjo and Mr. Gibbs were the top winners in a competition that was the icing on the program, a contest in which they were judged on their ability to chop, slice and dice, make an omelet and prepare dishes like crepes sucrees filled with creme patissiere and topped with sauce au chocolat.
Mr. Gibbs, whom one cook described as having particulartly deft hands, won a full $12,750 scholarship for a six-month course at the French Culinary Institute on lower Broadway which operates L'Ecole. And Miss Sanjurjo, along with her teacher, Christina Lyles, won an all-expenses-paid weeklong trip to Le Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris.
Mr. Grausman said he conceived the program as a reaction to a food-industry convention at which manufacturers were envisioning microwave ovens for the car and cookless kitchens. He wondered if home economics classes might be willing "to upgrade their instruction" and challenge students. He disregarded warnings from friends that he ought to try his program in more affluent areas with more sophisticated palates.
"I figured if I could do it here I could it anywhere," he said. "People said, 'These New York kids won't know the difference between one dish and another.' But instead of an apple pie, they made an apple tart and just the appearance of that makes them feel they've been able to accomplish something their friends never have."
Remarking on the skill of the students, Dorothy Cann, the institute's president, said: "What we saw in the kitchen was discipline, maturity, purpose and seriousness. Cuisine is a very civilizing thing."
Still, Alair Sailhac, a former chef at Le Cirque and one of the judges, said the students had a long way to go to develop the speed, organization, economy of motion and grace under pressure that distinguishes a restaurant chef from a fine home cook.
"If you are too slow, you cannot be a chef," he said.
To start the program, Mr. Grausman held a one-day training session for home economics teachers to lessen the intimidation some of them felt about haute cuisine. They used his book "At Home With French Classics" (Workman, 1989) as their textbook, but he conceded that in the coming school year the teachers would need regular Saturday classes.
The program's teachers said that even if their students never became chefs, they have learned how to meet deadlines, to handle delicate equipment and to understand a foreign menu. The students agreed.
"They taught us the basic knowledge," said Harrison Okine, a 20-year-old junior at Stevenson who finished third in the competition. "So when you step out, you step out with confidence."

HEADLINE: Broadway Attendance Is Off, But Happy Face Is Still On

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
Broadway ended its 1990-91 season with a decline of nearly 6 percent in ticket sales and 9 percent in attendance but with statements that looked on the bright side.
"We find it remarkable that the season was as strong as it was in the context of the economy," Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said yesterday. 
 "The seasons fluctuate," Mr. Sabinson said. "This business is cyclical. We had fewer productions so there were fewer work weeks. But we felt that with the new productions that opened, the types of stars and directors and playwrights, it was a very representative season."
Figures made public by the league yesterday showed that ticket sales through May 31 had declined to $267 million from a record $283 million last season -- or, in the league's way of characterizing it, "the second highest total in Broadway history."
Reporting that attendance declined to 7.36 million from 8.03 million, the league noted that attendance over the previous five seasons ranged from 6.56 million to 8.14 million. Variety, the show business weekly, reported in its June 3 issue that attendance was over 10.6 million in 1980-81. But that was Broadway's best season ever, said George Wachtel, the league's director of research, adding that its worst was 1973-74, when attendance was 5.4 million.
Anyway, he said, this season not only suffered from the Persian Gulf war and the recession but also was one week shorter than last season, which had 53 weeks because of the vagaries of the calendar.
The total number of playing weeks for all productions this season was 970, compared with 1,061 last year. And there were 28 new productions, down from 30 last year and 35 the year before. Of the 10 this year that were musicals, 3 were revivals, while only 1 of the 13 plays was a revival.
Broadway tours throughout North America had ticket sales of $449 million, a 22 percent increase from the $367 million in 1989-90.

HEADLINE: Get the Right Grip on Foreign Aid

 BODY:
Can there be a stable and just new world order in the wake of the cold war? Not unless social conditions and economic prospects improve markedly in the third world, where most of the planet's people live. That will take money, but not in unthinkable amounts. What is needed is a sharp shift in priorities, among donor and recipient countries alike.
Major givers like Japan, Germany and the World Bank press for sensible changes. But there's little sign of that spirit in Washington, where Congress is now considering the new foreign aid budget. It and the Bush Administration act oblivious to the momentous changes that have swept the world. 
 People everywhere now recognize private investment as the main engine of development. Policies that merely clear away bureaucratic obstacles to enterprise can accomplish miracles, especially if accompanied by modest investments in health, education and infrastructure.
In an impressively researched new report, the United Nations Development Program estimates that it would take only about $20 billion a year to eliminate serious malnutrition and provide universal primary education, primary health care, family planning and safe water by the year 2000.
About $50 billion could be found within third world countries themselves, mainly by reducing excessive military spending. The developed world, meanwhile, could match that contribution simply by living up to its promises.
If each donor met the internationally endorsed target of 0.7 percent of gross national product, development aid would rise by $50 billion a year. Industrial countries now contribute an average of 0.32 percent of G.N.P.; the U.S. contributes only 0.15 percent, or $7.5 billion.
But even if outsiders greatly increase their assistance, it will be wasted if beneficiary countries keep spending excessively on arms. In recent years, Iraq has spent more than seven times as much on its military as on education and health combined. Pakistan spends three times as much on arms as on education and health. Syria has three times as many soldiers as teachers. By welcome contrast, Ghana spends five times as much on education and health as on its military.
Military spending is a politically sensitive issue anywhere. Former colonies see their militaries as emblems and defenders of sovereignty. And in many poor nations, the army is a pillar of politics. Yet sovereignty and stability would both be better served if arms money could be reclaimed.
Some leading donors have now proposed linking development aid to curbs on military spending. Germany would condition aid on that basis. Japan speaks of withholding aid from countries that spend too much on arms. The Development Committee, which advises the World Bank, and the U.N. Development Program also propose linkage.
Meanwhile, Washington still favors security spending for a handful of allies. There's far more interest in preserving sacred arms ratios between Israel and Egypt and between Greece and Turkey than in addressing the needs of the billion-plus poor people of the third world. A new world cannot be built by playing old politics with foreign aid.

HEADLINE: A Political Pro for Moscow

 BODY:
President Bush's nomination of Robert Strauss as U.S. Ambassador in Moscow is an inspired choice. By turning to a formidable Texas Democrat, Mr. Bush gives bipartisan resonance to U.S. diplomacy at a critical moment in Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Strauss is a superb negotiator with sensitive political radar. Those talents could be extremely useful as the Administration seeks to reconcile sensitive differences with Moscow over nuclear arms and economic aid. 
 If Mr. Bush's choice is unconventional, so are the opportunities. The world will be the winner if a historic rivalry yields to collaboration, beginning with a successful summit meeting this summer. And by conditioning economic aid to fundamental reforms, Washington can crucially assist the stable transformation of a failed Soviet economy and floundering authoritarian system.
Mr. Strauss has shown his bargaining skills as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and as Jimmy Carter's Special Trade Representative. He has close personal ties with his fellow Texans George Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, assuring him direct access and more than compensating for his lack of extensive knowledge of Soviet affairs. As a successful capitalist bred in Dallas, he may even have some useful advice for the Soviets on how market economies operate.
Since establishing relations with the Soviet Union in 1933, Washington has usually chosen career diplomats like the highly skilled incumbent, Jack Matlock, for the Moscow post. But as a graduate of hardball Texas politics, Mr. Strauss seems just as well suited to judge the struggle for power in Mikhail Gorbachev's Moscow. At 72, Mr. Straussnow has a chance to help make as well as witness history.

Retaking Tompkins Square

 BODY:
Thanks to strong action by the Dinkins administration, Tompkins Square Park in New York City's East Village may once again be a park. It hasn't been that for many years, not since drug dealers, self-styled anarchists and the homeless took it over and turned it into a dangerous encampment that scared away neighborhood residents.
The Koch administration failed to reclaim the park, and until now so had Mayor David Dinkins's City Hall. Finally, yet another disturbance meant that even the patient Mr. Dinkins had had enough. The park was cleared and closed on Monday for renovation. 
 It is not a perfect solution. The $2.3 million renovation is a costly excuse to close the park, especially during a recession. Moreover, problems are likely to return when it reopens a year hence. It might have been wiser to clear but not close the park, and then impose and firmly enforce a curfew.
But mayoral aides insist that dramatic action was required to change destructive patterns in the park, and perhaps it was. In any case, the move gives neighborhood residents a chance for calm. And it gives all New Yorkers a chance to reflect on why decisive action is so rare that it takes several years, two administrations and the extreme action of barricading a public park to save it.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
A Not-So-New Order

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
The "new world order" projected by President Bush to grow out of the Persian Gulf war is looked upon by third-world spokesmen with skepticism, suspicion and doubt that it will really bring anything new to their relations with the developed world.
 That's a conclusion that seemed warranted after an international conference sponsored here by the International Press Service Council on Information and Communication.
 
 Most participants either represented or seemed to be influenced by the views of third-world nations. And that's where more than 80 percent of the world's population lives, as pointed out by Kofi N. Awoonor, Ghana's United Nations representative.
 What, ideally, would a new world order be like? asked Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania's Minister of Information, in a panel discussion. In his view, it would "herald more equal political, economic and cultural relations between states. It would promote a greater access to and sharing of productive technology [and] provide for more evenhanded competition. And it would open opportunities for all states and peoples, not just the developed ones, to express and enjoy a greater cultural freedom."
 Neither he nor other speakers expressed much hope for such a revolution in international relations. Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, in the keynote speech, added the further requirement that "a new agenda for the next century" should go beyond traditional concerns to "the survival issues -- global warming, the loss of species, reversing deforestation, the question of future water supplies for a planet of 10 billion."
 In a speech read by Hasan abu Nimah, Jordan's envoy to Italy, the Crown Prince said "that using oil as an environmental weapon is something that desperate warmongers are quite willing to do," as shown by the gulf war. "If the oil wars have begun," he added, "the water wars may not be far behind -- and then conflicts stemming from the consequences of soil loss, forest loss, high global temperatures and rising sea levels."
In the Crown Prince's view, however, "the United States seems to have virtually given up all claims to international leadership on these issues." It was generally accepted by the conferees that the U.S. now was the world's only superpower -- hence the necessary leader in a changing world.
 One Western voice, that of George Gerbner of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, cited television as an obstacle to a truly new order. Its enormous power and reach, he said, were controlled by "a handful of global conglomerates with something to sell"; and its daily content left the world "drench[ed] . . . in expertly choreographed brutality."
 TV, according to Professor Gerbner, teaches that violence, like the gulf war, is an effective solution to problems. He said it also encouraged support for anything that enhanced people's sense of security in what they saw as a "mean world." Hence the worldwide "tidal wave of television" produced support for political decisions leading to wars, from populations conditioned to believe that violence could improve their security.
 Mr. Mkapa also thought it "not implausible that if a new world order emerges" from the gulf war and the collapse of Communism, "it will be based on respect for the force of might rather than the force of argument."
 For one thing, he said, the U.N. has been remarkably firm in pursuing a military course against Iraq, possibly signaling more such collective action in the future. For another, third-world nations can no longer play off one superpower against another. Now there is no rival to temper the power of the one remaining superpower.
 In Mr. Mkapa's view, moreover, "even the most vainglorious and irredentist of third-world leaders cannot but have been shocked and unnerved by the awesome destruction poured over Iraq by the war machines of the coalition forces" -- mostly those of the industrial world.
 These developments, he said, might mean less instability and adventurism in the third world; but they would tend also "to work for increased dominance" by the developed nations rather than for "more respectful, more naturally beneficial relations."
 In the U.S. too, the conference was told, though there's much hope for a new world order, widespread questions also exist. That conflict will be detailed in another article.

HEADLINE: Education Cannot Become Casualty of New York's Budget Ax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The School Administrators Association of New York State is deeply concerned about the budget crisis. The impact is devastating to our schools and the programs offered to our children. Notwithstanding, another, more serious issue is now emerging. In an attempt to balance the budget, the Regents Scholarship Program has been suspended.
The Regents Scholarship Program, with its $250 award, is not about money, but about rewarding achievement and encouraging high standards. Even to allow the program to become part of the economic political debate demonstrates a lack of understanding by our elected leaders relative to the only symbolic statewide recognition of excellence. 
 There exists between the generations a covenant that cannot and must not be broken.
We call upon the State Legislature and upon Gov. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to restore the Regents Scholarship Program immediately so that those students in the class of 1991 will not be deprived of the chance to be recognized for their exceptional academic achievement.

HEADLINE: The Cake Box From Heaven (Brooklyn, of Course) Is Back

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
The Box is back. Pale green with brown crosshatching, the Ebinger's cake box is stacked on the shelves of New York City supermarkets. Shoppers have gasped and paled at its resurrection. For them, after nearly two decades in an Ebingerless desert, The Box is manna. The good old days are back! Maybe. . . . 
 For those who grew up in Brooklyn, when Brooklyn was the world, there is no sweeter sound than the Ebinger's brand name. No other word can pull such heartstrings, signal such salivation.
Blackout cake! Othello! Lemon cupcakes! Crumb buns! Proust can keep his madeleine. Give Brooklynites anything Ebinger's. The family bakery opened on Flatbush Avenue in 1898 and eventually became a string of 54. Anybody who lived in Brooklyn lived close to an Ebinger's. The unstinting quality and consistency of its 200 German-style pastries made them shrines.
When Ebinger's went bankrupt in 1972 it wasn't just the end of an era, it was also the end of a certain kind of innocence.
Then in 1982 Lou Guerra, a Brooklyn baker, tried to revive the label (and, he said, the original recipes) in a storefront bakery on Fort Hamilton Parkway. But his efforts sputtered financially until 1989, when John Edwards, who grew up near the Snyder Avenue Ebinger's, bought the business and mounted his own campaign to stoke the the Ebinger's flame. He quietly began to manufacture commercial versions of Ebinger's pastries, packing them into The Boxes and shipping them to supermarkets.
Recent sightings of The Box have kindled a certain kind of hope.
"Ahhh," moaned Marion Lindner, 62 years old, who grew up near the Flatbush Avenue Ebinger's. "My youth."
"Now this, this is cake," said David Frischt, 53, who grew up near the Bedford Avenue Ebinger's. "At least, God willing, it is still cake."
But can the cakes, once handmade for a 24-hour shelf life, be adapted to the realities of mass production, stay fresh for a week and still be Ebinger's cakes?
This may seem a simple epicurean conundrum. But those of the Ebinger's faith know that it is more. The second (or, some say, third) coming of the Brooklyn brand name may be a triumph of quality. Or it could be another victory for that old pair of tricksters, denial and desire.
People who once believed in the contents of The Box still want to believe. It doesn't matter what the current baker says. "These are not, I repeat not, the Ebinger's cakes I grew up on," Mr. Edwards asserted. "I intend to establish a commercial line that is close to the old-time flavor. Then I can establish an all-natural gourmet line and make the real old-time cakes."
But locally the box response is impervious to his disclaimer, untouched by his rational business plans.
"It's embryonic recall," explained Dan Kaplan, 63, a Manhattan lawyer who grew up near the Avenue M Ebinger's. "You have to put a cage around me to keep me away from The Boxes."
He is not alone. "They come in and and start pointing and jumping up and down," said Louis Colon, manager of the Sloan's supermarket at 225 Ninth Avenue (24th Street) in Manhattan. "At first we couldn't keep enough of that cake on the shelves."
"It isn't just cake!" wailed Mr. Kaplan. "Ebinger's was a way of life. The Boxes! The stores! You could eat off the floors! The Ebinger's girls!"
Dr. Annie Hauck-Lawson, 35, an assistant professor of nutrition sciences at Brooklyn College who grew up near the Seventh Avenue Ebinger's in Park Slope, said the median age of the Ebinger's girls seemed to be about 80, but they could slice and box a cake faster than women a quarter their age. And that was just one facet of the Ebinger's mystique. ("The Boxes!" she said. "Perfectly tied with this red-and-white striped string!")
Having studied Brooklyn's eating patterns for her Ph.D. dissertation, Dr. Hauck-Lawson concluded: "The borough is such an ethnic mix and Ebinger's was one commonality. Everybody could walk to an Ebinger's and what could be wrong with fabulous cake?"
The combination of accessibility and unstinting quality created a "legendary bakery," said Lyn Stallworth, co-author of "The Brooklyn Cookbook," to be published in August by Alfred A. Knopf.
Her book details the Ebinger's initiation of one Elizabeth White: "From the way they were talking, in a mixture of awe and greed, I knew this was not just a cake -- it was almost like Percival describing the Holy Grail," Ms. White recalled in the book. "Later, when I had my first taste of blackout cake, I understood."
"The Brooklyn Cookbook" also records reverberations from the fall of Ebinger's. It quotes another Brooklynite, Leonard S. Elman, as saying, "Brooklynites are united in the belief that their lives were impoverished when Ebinger's closed its doors for the last time." Like many Ebingerists, he kept a cake in his freezer for nearly a year after the closing. Eating it, he said, made him feel as if he were drinking his last bottle of 1926 Lafite.
For others, eating the last crumbs of a long-frozen Ebinger's was like losing a foul ball caught at Ebbets Field. On Aug. 27, 1972, The New York Times noted that Ebinger's had closed the previous day, going "the way of the Navy Yard, the Dodgers and Luna Park." An ill-timed overexpansion was cited as the cause of death.
Ebingerists, however, say the bakery was a martyr. "The victim of supermarkets and calorie counting," Mr. Elman says in "The Brooklyn Cookbook."
It was like losing God. "My life ended when Ebinger's closed," said Dick Forman, a 52-year-old physicist with the Mitre Corporation in McLean, Va., who grew up near the Avenue U Ebinger's.
He and scores of other Ebingerists undertook personal projects to resurrect their favorite cakes. Like scholars dissecting ancient holy texts, they scraped the minutiae of their taste memories and tried to render scriptures -- recipes, rather -- true to the Ebinger's spirit.
Blackout cake -- three layers of devil's-food cake sandwiching a dark chocolate pudding, with chocolate frosting and sprinkled with chocolate cake crumbs -- was the holiest quest. "Catholics have a pope," said Mr. Kaplan. Ebingerists, it seems, had blackout cake and they wanted it back.
Mr. Forman compiled what he knew to be true of the cake and bedeviled food magazines and baking experts for advice. "No one could help. They said it was a commercial recipe. What do they know?"
The closest he came to an authentic Ebinger's blackout cake, he said, was by using "Betty Crocker brownie mix, the one with the little can of Hershey's chocolate."
"You replace the Hershey's with Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup and decrease the eggs from two to one and you hit that point between brownie and blackout," he said. Still, something was missing.
Mr. Forman tracked down one of the Ebinger scions, who told him that her father had a special cocoa formulated for the cake. Feeling that he lacked the expertise to move into cocoa formulations, Mr. Forman gave his blackout file -- the archive, he calls it -- to Rose Levy Beranbaum, author of "The Cake Bible" (William Morrow, 1988).
"Dozens of people have asked for help with blackout cake," Ms. Beranbaum said. "They think I will be the answer to their prayers, but I don't think so." The cake itself is not impossible to re-create, she said, but the memories may be. "I have the definite feeling that in the case of blackout cake the memories are better than the cake ever was," she said.
Blasphemy! Ebingerists have an almost theological belief that the original bakery's line of pastries responded perfectly to the New York sweet tooth: they were huge, inexpensive and not cloying.
Certain market research backs the assertion. When test-marketing David's Cookies in 1978, David Liederman found that unlike most Americans, "New Yorkers like bittersweet chocolate; most won't touch milk chocolate." Richard Marisco, vice president of sales and marketing at the Schrafft's Ice Cream Company in Staten Island, said the bittersweet component of the company's fudge sauce is higher than most, and speculates that that flavor could account for its legendary status in its hometown.
In addition, Mr. Kaplan said, the cake was synonymous with "a time, a quality, a connection."
In the long years since the fall of Ebinger's, there has been intermittent hope for the searchers. In 1982 Mr. Guerra, a baker, revived the name and opened an Ebinger's at Fort Hamilton Parkway and 63d Street in the Bay Ridge secton of Brooklyn. He had discovered that "the Ebinger's name was in the public domain," he told a reporter at the time. Moreover, his father, Guy Guerra, also a baker, claimed to have been given the Ebinger's recipes by Arthur Ebinger, son of the founding Ebinger.
Whatever their origin, the recipes yielded cakes that made Ebingerists weak at the knees. "Authenticity Not in Doubt," The New York Times said in 1982. Customers started lining up at the bakery at 7:30 in the morning, Lou Guerra told a reporter. "The way people are buying cake, you'd think they'd all been on diets for the past 10 years," he said.
Nevertheless, the 24-hour shelf life of an Ebinger's cake couldn't be reconciled with the economic realities of modern life. When he took over, Mr. Edwards adjusted the recipes and moved into supermarkets. "I repeat, the recipes have been adjusted for a longer shelf life," Mr. Edwards said. "These are not, I repeat, not the cakes I grew up on."
"The Boxes! At A.&P.!" Mr. Kaplan said. "Are they trying to commercialize my childhood?" Still, as surely as a man given a chance to live life's best moments over would, he is drawn to The Boxes. So far, he hasn't dared to taste.
Manny Krantz, on the other hand, couldn't wait. A 74-year-old retired tailor who grew up near the Avenue U Ebinger's in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, Mr. Krantz fidgeted recently in the checkout line of the Sloan's on Ninth Avenue. Although a courtly gentleman, he finally succumbed to the contents of The Box in his shopping cart. He even used his fingers.
"It's not quite the same," said Mr. Krantz. But his memory was immediately overwhelmed by an intense desire to believe. He was more willing to doubt himself than the contents of The Box, and he quickly amended his response. "Of course," he said, "I am not quite the same any more either."
 
LET THEM EAT THIS!

 
Blackout Cake
Total time: 1 hour, 20 minutes

For the cake:
 
 1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa
2 tablespoons boiling water
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
 3/4 cup milk
2 cups sugar
2 sticks butter, slightly softened, plus 2 tablespoons for the cake pans
4 eggs, separated
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 cups flour, plus 1 tablespoon for the cake pans
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
 
For the filling:
1 tablespoon plus
1 3/4 teaspoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa
 2 cups boiling water
 3/4 cup plus 3 1/2 teaspoons sugar
 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped
 2 tablespoons cornstarch
 1 tablespoon cold water
 1/4tablespoon salt
 1 teaspoon vanilla
 2 tablespoons butter
 
For the frosting:
 
 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
 3/4 cup sweet butter
 1/2cup hot water
 1 tablespoon corn syrup
 1 tablespoon vanilla.
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. To make the cake, place the cocoa in a small bowl and whisk in the boiling water to form a paste. Combine the chocolate and milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir frequently as the mixture warms and the chocolate melts, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk a small amount of the heated chocolate milk into the cocoa paste and then whisk the cocoa mixture into the milk mixture. Return to heat, stir for one minute, remove and cool until tepid.
3. In the bowl of a mixer, cream the sugar and butter together. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time and add the vanilla. Slowly stir in the chocolate mixture.
4. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Using a spatula or a wooden spoon, slowly add the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture. In another bowl, whip the egg whites to form soft peaks and, using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the batter.
5. Butter and lightly flour two 8-inch round cake pans and divide the batter between the two pans. Bake for 45 minutes and cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Gently remove the cakes from the pans and continue to cool.
6. While the cake is baking, make the filling. Put the cocoa into a saucepan and pour in the boiling water and place over low heat. Add the sugar and chocolate. Dissolve the cornstarch in the cold water to make a smooth paste. Whisk the cornstarch into the water and chocolate, add the salt and bring it to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for one minute.
7. Remove the pan from the heat, whisk in the vanilla and the butter, and transfer the mixture to a bowl and refrigerate until cool.
8. Make the frosting. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter, one tablespoon at a time, returning to heat if necessary to melt the butter.
9. Whisk in the hot water all at once and stir until smooth. Whisk in the corn syrup and the vanilla. Refrigerate for up to 15 minutes before using.
10. Assemble the cake. Use a sharp knife to slice each cake into two disks to form four layers. Set one layer aside. Place one layer on a cake round or plate. Generously swath the layer with filling. Add the second layer and repeat. Add the third layer. Quickly apply a layer of frosting to the top and the sides of the cake and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the remaining cake layer. Apply a second layer of frosting to the cake, sprinkle liberally with crumbs and serve within 24 hours. Store in a cool place.
Yield: 1 cake.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS;
'The Ultimate Capitalist': Robert Schwarz Strauss

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
After he graduated from the University of Texas Law School in 1941, Robert S. Strauss took a job as an F.B.I. agent "watching out for Communists," as he puts it.
 "I would catch a spy nearly every other day," he jokingly recalled today about his F.B.I. postings in Washington, Ohio, Iowa and Texas. "I would come home at night and my wife, Helen, would say, 'Did you catch any spies today, dear?' " 
 Half a century later, after many cycles of conflict and entente in the United States-Soviet relationship, Mr. Strauss may soon be selling the charms of capitalism and the American way to the Russians.
 
'The Ultimate Capitalist'
 President Bush passed over the Sovietologists in the Foreign Service and tapped his old friend from Texas, Bob Strauss, to be the new Ambassador to Moscow. The surprise appointment of Mr. Strauss, a Washington lawyer and Democratic Party mandarin who is fluent in Texas barbershop humor but not Russian, will have to be confirmed by the Senate.
"This is where American capitalism meets Soviet Communism," said Mr. Strauss's old friend John White, a lawyer who is, like Mr. Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman. "Strauss is the ultimate capitalist if there ever was one. Just look at his client list, a page and a half of Fortune 500 companies. He'll teach 'em about making money."
Mr. Strauss, a senior partner in the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, is one of the capital's experts at the art of the deal in politics and business, so successful that he has not billed by the hour for 20 years. He garnered an $8 million fee over Thanksgiving dinner at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York last year for helping Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company buy M.C.A., the Hollywood company for whom Mr. Strauss served as a director.
 
Some Cherished Habits
 Mr. Strauss was wondering today how he would survive without his cherished habits: his Dallas poker games, his trips to the track in Maryland and California and his frequent lunches with pals at Duke Zeibert's, a Washington eatery better known for its clientele than its food.
"It ain't an easy job and it's not comfortable surroundings, but the President and Jim Baker talked me into it and I'm going to give it the best shot I got," Mr. Strauss said. "If they want a Soviet expert, they made a mistake picking me. I'm as poor an example of a Soviet expert as they could find. But if they want a winner who's been successful at a lot of different things and understands relationships and how to help the Soviets with their terrible economic problems, then I was the right choice."
Mr. Strauss is not only an old friend of the President's, but also an old friend of the Secretary of State. Mr. Strauss and Mr. Baker, both known as expert back-room deal makers, knew each other from their days in Texas law and politics, and both once owned stock in a beer distributorship owned by a mutual friend in California, Richard Herman.
In 1976, when Mr. Strauss was chairman of the Democratic Party, Jimmy Carter defeated President Gerald Ford, whose campaign manager was Mr. Baker. In 1980, Mr. Baker took his revenge by running Ronald Reagan's successful campaign against Mr. Carter, when Mr. Strauss was running the Democratic campaign.
 
Good Friends Still
 "We managed to bridge that and remain pretty good friends," Mr. Strauss said today. "So I guess we can handle it in the Soviet Union when we're on the same side of the table."
Democrats and Republicans still recall, with some awe and amusement, the time during a crowded 1980 negotiating session on the Presidential debate between Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan when Mr. Strauss proposed that they break a deadlock of several hours by allowing him and Mr. Baker to step into a back room alone. In a quarter of an hour they were back with a complete deal on format, number of debates and all other details.
Although some conservatives complained that Mr. Strauss is too closely connected to businesses that trade with the Soviet Union and too much of a Democratic Party "fixer," it was partly his business connections that made him attractive to Mr. Bush at a time when fostering commercial relations with the Soviet Union is high on the President's agenda.
By naming a friend, Mr. Bush wanted to send the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a signal that he wants to nurture the blossoming ties between the two countries. By naming a Democrat, officials said, Mr. Bush shows that American support for broadening the Soviet-American relationship goes beyond party affiliation.
"It's a signal to Gorbachev now if we start talking to Boris Yeltsin that this is how our system works: we're not always in total agreement and we have two parties," said Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader.
One of the issues that Mr. Strauss will face as Ambassador is the large number of Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to the West. Mr. Strauss himself is Jewish.
 
Four Years in the F.B.I.
 Robert Schwarz Strauss was born in Lockhart, Tex., on Oct. 19, 1918, and after college wasted little time before launching his business career, spending four years -- 1941 to 1945 -- in the F.B.I. and then joining his law firm in Dallas.
He married Helen Jacobs in 1941 and they have three grown children, Robert, Richard and Susan.
Mr. Strauss began his Democratic Party career in 1968 as a National Committee member and then worked his way up as a member of the executive committee, treasurer and then party chairman from 1972 to 1977. Under Mr. Carter, he served as special representative for trade negotiations and then as the President's personal representative in the Middle East for a brief period in the summer and fall of 1979, leaving to head Mr. Carter's re-election campaign.
At this year's Gridiron Club dinner, the annual gathering of politicians and journalists who think of themselves as Washington's elite, Mr. Baker joked about Mr. Strauss, a fellow speaker: "Bob's had an illustrious career as Jimmy Carter's envoy to the Middle East. He made possible the peace and stability we have enjoyed in that region ever since."
While Mr. Strauss is sometimes referred to as Mr. Democrat, his ability to stay close to whoever is in power has prompted some jokes and some harsh criticism. At the Gridiron, Mr. Baker joked that the Democratic Presidential field was so weak that Mr. Strauss himself would have a chance. "Of course," Mr. Baker told Mr. Strauss, "you'd have to become a Democrat."
 
A More Critical Tone
 The New Republic struck a far more critical tone in 1988, when one of its columnists, Michael Kinsley, wrote, "It's a little too convenient for conservatives and Republicans that 'Mr. Democrat' should be a man so obviously more interested in being seen as a friend of the President than in who the President happens to be."
After Mr. Carter's defeat in 1980, the departing President joked with staff members and Mr. Strauss that "Bob is a very loyal friend -- he waited a whole week after the election before he had dinner with Ronald Reagan."
When George Bush moved into the White House, Mr. Strauss was one of the first to call and congratulate him there, and Mr. Bush had Mr. Strauss over among his initial dinner guests.
Mr. Strauss is extremely proud of his work as special trade representative, when he negotiated a trade agreement with the Japanese for Mr. Carter.
But as a Middle East envoy in the period after the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979, Mr. Strauss was dealing with unfamiliar terrain and a hopeless issue as he tried to work out an agreement on Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank. Those who traveled with him noted that he did not behave as a striped-pants diplomat in the sense of keeping things close to his vest. He was very talkative and enjoyed courting the press.
He gladly gave up the job to take over as Mr. Carter's campaign manager.
Mr. Strauss was asked if he would import any of his hobbies -- his poker game or his annual Texas chili dinner -- to the Soviet Union and said he was not yet sure.
He said his only plan was to surround himself with good people and try to learn quickly. "I'm sort of like a computer -- garbage in, garbage out," he said. "Who knows how much good I can do?"

HEADLINE: Striking Gold and Fear in S. Carolina

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGEWAY, S.C., May 31

 BODY:
People laughed a decade ago when geologists started poking holes in the pine forest at the edges of the South Carolina Piedmont looking for gold.
 But they stopped laughing when mining companies started buying up huge chunks of land, when a mining giant began gouging out cavernous pits for one of the nation's largest gold-processing operations, and when South Carolina suddenly became the only non-Western state among the 10 largest gold producers. 
Now the question is how far South Carolina's gold rush will go, and whether the state fully understands the environmental aspects of a mining revolution that allowed the United States to increase gold production more than ninefold in the 1980's.
 At issue are mining operations that use tons of cyanide to leach gold out of vast quantities of rock -- up to 30 tons of ore to get one ounce of gold in South Carolina. The new technologies, which allow mining of less-rich ores than were commonly mined in the past, are part of a little-noticed explosion in gold mining that could soon put other states in the same unexpected situation as South Carolina.
 
'It Can't Happen Here'
 "Communities that are concerned about the impact that mineral development might have on other things they care about, like water quality, need to be aware this is something that could happen to them, even if it has not in the past," said Philip M. Hocker, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a nonprofit organization concerned with environmental issues in mining. "Many places have thought, 'Well, it can't happen here,' and they found out it could."
 The mining industry says mines have stringent safety standards and an estimable safety record. But for now, the economic boom in gold mining is more certain than the environmental costs.
 In the 1980's, the United States went from an importer of gold to an exporter, passing the Soviet Union to become second only to South Africa in production. United States gold production grew from one million ounces in 1980 to nearly 10 million ounces a year now.
 "I don't know of another industry that's gone from a $6.7 billion deficit to an $8 billion surplus in that short a time," said John Lutley, president of the Gold Institute, a trade assocation in Washington.
 
A Question of Control
 But many residents here, 15 miles north of the state capital in Columbia, worry whether mining technology widely used in the remote and arid West is appropriate in South Carolina. And they wonder how aggressively a state with a reputation for lax environmental standards will monitor a process that uses tons of cyanide and produces other dangerous metals as a byproduct of mining.
 "We have a little chemical company near here the state has never been able to control," said Daisy Hollis, an outspoken critic of the mining who lives on 10 acres near the largest mine. "When I heard the people who couldn't control that were going to control these mines, it sent chills up my spine."
 South Carolina is hardly synonymous with gold mining, but it does have a long mining history. Gold was a part of Indian lore, and the first official discovery was at the Haile Mine in 1827. Before gold was discovered in California in 1848, South Carolina was the nation's largest gold-mining state.
 After many lean decades, mining resumed in 1985. Now, thanks largely to the Kennecott Ridgeway mine that opened here in 1989, South Carolina is the eigth-largest gold-mining state, producing 220,000 ounces in 1990. The mine, run by the Kennecott Corporation, which is owned by Standard Oil of Ohio, cost $100 million to start up. It is expected to produce 1.4 million ounces over its 10-to-12-year life span.
 
Local 'Mountains' Are Born
 The mine, spread out over 2,400 acres, consists of two pits, which will both be 400 feet deep and stretch over 85 acres. Its "carbon-in-pulp" technology allows the gold to be extracted from the ore using sodium cyanide in large leach tanks. The residue and cyanide solution is then deposited in a huge 381-acre tailing pond. The discarded ore is deposited in two vast heaps the locals call Mount Cyanide and Mount Overburden.
 To many people, the mine, which employs 200 people, is a valuable economic asset in the depressed north-central part of the state.
 "They said they wanted to be a good neighbor, and I think they are," said Ronnie Murphy, who sold four acres now at the center of a mining pit. "I really don't see where the mine has done any damage. There's two things Fairfield County needs: more jobs and more tax money."
 And plant officials say the mine has taken extensive steps to make sure that no chemicals leach into the ground, and that air and water quality are carefully monitored. Industry officials say that while cyanide is deadly, it breaks down quickly when exposed to sunlight, does not build up in animal tissues and is not believed to cause birth defects or cancer.
 
Lessons in the West
 Even industry critics say the new cyanide processes are more economical and more environmentally sound than older processes, which used chemicals like mercury. But environmental concerns persist, intensified by indications that the mine's success is likely to breed others.
 Questions have been raised elsewhere about the long-term effects of cyanide in mining. Cyanide residue from mining has occasionally killed migratory birds and caused foul-smelling tap water in the West, raising concerns in Montana, Nevada and California and leading to new precautions by mining companies.
 But the questions are magnified here because of South Carolina's rainy climate, which could enhance the chances of leaks of cyanide and other poisons into the underground water supply; its temperature inversions, which could trap gases in the atmosphere; and its attention-getting location, near the state capital.
 Glenn Miller, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Nevada who is an expert on cyanide in mining, said a key difference was that solutions which tend to evaporate in arid Nevada can overflow in rainy South Carolina.
 "The risks to surface water and ground water, I think, is substantially greater in South Carolina than they are in Nevada," he said.
 Residents' fears were heightened last November when a serious leak at the Brewer Gold Mine in Jefferson, S.C., occurred after a dam broke, causing 10 million gallons of cyanide-containing storm water to spill into nearby creeks and rivers.
 Nor are environmental groups satisfied with the company's system -- primarily fireworks and sound effects -- for keeping birds out of the lethal water of the tailing pond at the mine here. A legal challenge to the mine led to the formation of a citizens' monitoring group, some of whose members remain convinced that the mine is a bad idea.
 "We don't want this kind of industry that's ruining what we do love about South Carolina, the wildlife and the beautiful countryside and the clean air and the good drinking water," said Joyce Brown, chairman of the citizens' panel.
 Others say their problem is with the degree of supervision and regulation.
 "I think mining is a necessary thing," said Carl Schulz, a committee member who is a professor of environmental health at the University of South Carolina School of Public Health. "I would just feel a lot more comfortable if I felt there was a less permissive regulatory atmosphere than exists in the state of South Carolina."
 Gold booms have a history of going bust, but mining opponents worry that the current operations are just the start. Dr. Schulz said he could foresee seven mines operating near here by 1993.
 To some, the real worry is that the effects of the mine may not be clear for years. "The thing we're wary about is we've got a major program in place, moving very, very large quantities of material and creating a very new physical condition, which has only been going on for six years," said Mr. Hocker. "It's well known in mining that the environmental problems from a mine frequently won't show up for 20 or 30 years after the mining is under way."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about gold mining in South Carolina misidentified the owner of the Kennecott Corporation, which operates the Kennecott Ridgeway mine. Kennecott -- formerly owned by Standard Oil of Ohio, which is now part British Petroleum -- was sold in 1989 to the RTZ Corporation of London.

HEADLINE: New Delhi Journal;
Some in India Grieve For Their Country, Too

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 5

 BODY:
The black-bordered poster of Rajiv Gandhi was hastily pasted on trees and telephone polls the other night with the inscription in Hindi, "I have a dream of a strong India, free of the poison of communalism and casteism."
The crowds around the Gandhi family compound at 10 Janpath have thinned, partly because the former Prime Minister's widow, Sonia, and children remain in seclusion and partly because the temperature at midday reaches 105, even higher. The city's residents are coping with some of the worst power shortages and breakdowns in years. 
 As the nation prepares to resume the interrupted elections, the withering heat, the sense of political torpor, the violence that has left hundreds dead, the confusion and anxiety since Mr. Gandhi's assassination two weeks ago have left the city dazed. The Congress Party, while seeking to tap a sympathy vote after the killing of its leader, seems equally dazed.
At a lavish, heavily guarded wedding party the other night, the first major festivity since the assassination, more than 400 of the city's elite -- politicians, Cabinet members, Supreme Court judges, diplomats, businessmen -- showed up with flowers and gifts for the daughter of the Law and Justice Minister, Subramaniam Swamy. Characteristically, the newlyweds, as well as other college students at the ceremony, are studying in the United States and will probably remain there.
 
'Too Many Funerals'
 Despite the occasion, the mood was bleak. "I have been to too many funerals," said R. K. Dhawan, a powerful associate of Rajiv Gandhi. Mr. Dhawan has a hard-edged reputation as a political "fixer" for Mr. Gandhi for his brother, Sanjay, who died in an air crash in 1980, and for his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1984. His eyes turned wet. "Too many funerals. Nehru's funeral. Sanjay. Indira. Rajiv."
Nearby, a veteran European Ambassador, who has spent his career until now in Europe and the United States, acknowledged his confusion. "Even the poorest of the poor, the ones who carry cow dung, even they have such dignity," he said.
"But the country itself is in some kind of time warp. They send brilliant scientists and mathemeticians abroad but cannot manage their industry, their economy. It's a disaster. And foreign policy, the end of the cold war, has totally befuddled them. They don't know what to make of Gorbachev and the West. They know they've been left behind, but don't quite know what to do about it."
Even Mr. Gandhi's funeral, which was attended by foreign dignitaries, left some in the dominant Congress Party angry and bewildered because, party officials said, several nations that were considered close allies failed to send high-ranking representatives. But the Indians were pleased that the United States, whose relationship with India is inevitably tinged with some delicacy, sent an official as high as Vice President Dan Quayle.
But, Congress leaders asked behind the scenes, where were India's "friends" in the socialist, Western and third worlds that Indira and Rajiv Gandhi sought to nurture? Specifically, Indians were disappointed that allies like Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia, Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania, Willy Brandt of Germany, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and some Scandinavian leaders did not attend.
 
'There Are No Goals Now'
 "If we can't define ourselves nationally, if we lack a direction within the country, how can we define ourselves internationally?" asked Arun Kumar, an economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University. "Talk to the average person in the street. Where are we going? they ask. The leaders of business and agriculture and Government ask the same thing.
"In the 1950's there were goals in terms of agricultural policy, foreign policy, economic. There are no goals now. And there are tensions and violence everywhere. And Rajiv's death is only an indicator of the rising tensions in our society."
The rising tensions are evident in the contrast -- always palpable in India, but more so now -- betweem rich and poor. Although up to 80 percent of Indians are socially deprived and living in horrific poverty, the new rich of property developers, importers and business people pile into glitzy hotel dining rooms.
"The restaurants are full, the jewelry shops are full," said Tavleen Singh, a political columnist. "It's no longer necessary to hide one's wealth. And the reason is Rajiv. He represented the aspirations of the middle classes and upper middle classes. Mrs. Gandhi was different. There was a deliberate lack of ostentation. With Rajiv came the arrival of the Gucci Gandhians. Underneath their simple khadis they wore Gucci shoes."
"For the poor, it's changed too," Ms. Singh added. "You go to poor villages and they have a TV set. They see, for the first time, how people live in Delhi. They see the shampoo ads. They see how people decorate their homes. They suddenly realize they have no business living this way."
What has not changed in Delhi is the bureaucracy and Government stagnation. The lack of direction and, most recently, the assassination, have virtually crippled the Government. Beyond this, the Government staggers along. There are about 20 million court cases facing the judiciary, a backlog of years.
 
The Counterfeit Clerk
 The Indian bureaucracy can be a source of humor, for foreigners as well as Indians. Recently, John Cleese, the British satirist and comedian, showed up at the Taj Mahal Hotel and was asked by the Indian management to pose as a clerk.
Mr. Cleese moved behind the desk and fit the task perfectly. A customer appeared and said he had a reservation. Mr. Cleese, acting the officious Indian hotel clerk, said with a smile: "First give me your maternal and paternal grandfather's address, astrological sign and footprints, as well as the addresses of all the houses they lived in. Do the same for your parents and then I'll consider giving you a room."
The customer failed the test but got the room anyway.

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
As Yugoslavia continues to muddle through one crisis after another, the republic of Slovenia is coolly preparing to declare its independence. In so doing, the tiny Alpine republic of two million people will force a question that few inside or outside the crumbling federation are prepared to face: If Yugoslavia falls apart, what will take its place?
Piece by piece, the Slovenes have erected a structure that they say will give them the political and economic autonomy they need to break loose from Yugoslavia. The republic has already established control over its foreign trade, custom levies and sales taxes, introduced compulsory military service for its own forces, and come June 26, is expected to start issuing its own money and passports. 
 [The Yugoslav press reported on Tuesday that Slovenia had formally notified the federal Parliament that it would secede within three weeks.]
It is one thing for a country to declare independence, and another for that independence to be recognized -- in this case by Slovenia's partners in the bad marriage that Yugoslavia has become, and by a world made nervous by Balkan volatility.
 
U.S. Opposes Separation
 "The United States is strongly opposed to the separation of Slovenia from Yugoslavia," Warren Zimmermann, the American Ambassador to Yugoslavia, said at a recent press conference. "I am not sure Slovenia will or can secede. I doubt that it can unless it has reached some kind of negotiated settlement with the Federal Government, including with the Yugoslav National Army."
Other foreign capitals are also taking a cautious approach to Slovenia's bid for independence, just as they have done with the Baltic republics' attempt to break from the Soviet Union. One fear is that any endorsement of the first split in the Yugoslav federation would only lead to further, more violent ruptures, particularly between the republics of Serbia and Croatia.
Such arguments are dismissed here in Slovenia as irrelevant to the main point, which is that Slovenes, a Slavic group with a distinct language and a culture that bears the mark of centuries of Austrian domination, want out of Yugoslavia.
This was true in December, when 90 percent of the electorate endorsed "disassociation" in a republic-wide referendum. After watching Yugoslavia slip further into disarray over the last five months, dragging Slovenia's economy with it, republic officials say it is even more true today.
Ready or not, virtually everyone here says they will take the plunge. "There is a slogan you hear a lot these days," said Josip Skoberne, of the Chamber of the Economy of Slovenia, "which is that first we will jump in the water, and then we will learn to swim."
 
Foreign Reaction Gauged
 The word here is that some foreign nations will be willing to help the new country, although no one is prepared to be specific. Some say it would be enough if foreign capitals initially did nothing to block existing credit lines and Slovenia's other economic links to the outside world. But even more vital is some form of acceptance by the rest of Yugoslavia, which now buys 24 percent of the goods Slovenia produces.
Still, many fear that independence is bound to carry economic risk.
Dusan Sesok, Slovenia's Minister of Finance, predicts an initial drop in the standard of living of 20 to 30 percent. "Our biggest problem will be how to survive the first three to six months in good condition," he said.
Since the December plebiscite, Slovenia has made several attempts to negotiate its departure. It has offered to pay what it calculates as its share, $1.4 billion, of Yugoslavia's debts and to negotiate the division of federal buildings and other property.
 
Issue of National Army
 On the key issue of the Yugoslav National Army, which now has 20,000 troops stationed in Slovenia, the republic recently offered a three-year phased withdrawal, during which time Slovenia would continue to pay a share of the army's costs.
But this proposal, like others, has fallen on stony ground. By blocking the normal succession in the presidency, Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, has successfully resisted any real debate on the future of the country.
A nagging question now is how the army will react. A bizarre incident recently outside a Slovenian training camp, which resulted in the overnight kidnapping of a Slovenian commander by army forces, was seen here as a provocation, perhaps the first of several to test Slovenian will.
"We would not like to leave and break all the bridges that were built in the past," said Milan Kucan, President of the republic. "But we know that it will not be simple. It now looks as though Slovenia will have to fulfill its obligation by taking a unilateral step."

HEADLINE: Albania Picks a Caretaker Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
After the resignation of the Communist Prime Minister, the President of Albania designated a 42-year-old former economist today to head a nonpartisan caretaker government until new national elections are held.
Members of the opposition Democratic Party said the appointment by President Rami Alia of the economist, Ylli Bufi, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the hitherto governing Communist Party, was acceptable to them. 
 Mr. Bufi served as Minister of Nutrition under Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who resigned on Tuesday. He is expected during the next few days to appoint a cabinet of 22 members, drawn in roughly equal parts from the Communist Party and the main opposition parties.
Under an agreement between the Communists, who won a two-thirds majority in parliamentary elections two months ago, and the new opposition, Mr. Bufi and the other members of his cabinet will withdraw from their political affiliations.
Mr. Bufi, from the southern industrial city of Fier, was described by Krenar Loloci, a Social Democrat who is a law professor in Tirana, as "very honest" and "a man who works tenaciously." An American diplomat who met Mr. Bufi this spring described him as non-ideological and "highly critical of the system" created during 46 years of uninterrupted Communist rule.
The collapse of the Albanian Communists, who had ruled as a monolithic party a year ago and gave way to sharing Parliament with opposition parties only last month, has attracted strong attention in the Bush Administration.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has tentatively scheduled a visit to Albania for next month, in the company of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who is an old Balkan hand.

S.& P. Drops Debt Ratings For Chrysler

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 5

 BODY:
In a move reflecting the deteriorating financial condition of the Chrysler Corporation, the Standard & Poors Corporation further lowered its ratings today on more than $21 billion worth of Chrysler debt securities.
Chrysler has been squeezed out of the public debt markets since S.& P. lowered its ratings on commercial paper to below investment grade last year and then lowered ratings on its notes and bonds to below investment grade in February. 
 The lastest action, which included a warning that ratings may go lower still, is sure to weaken the confidence of Chrysler's bankers, creditors and suppliers, whose forbearance will play a key role in the No. 3 auto maker's efforts to return to financial stability.
 
Worried About Reserves
 Specifically, S.& P. said it was concerned "about the rapid depletion of Chrysler's cash reserves resulting from depressed automotive conditions." Without enough cash, the company may not have the money to develop future products. Moreover, Chrysler could be forced to sell assets to generate funds when some of its debt matures in the next 18 months, S.& P. said.
A Chrysler spokesman said the S.& P. rating equated with a lower rating already given by Moody's Investors Service Inc. Chrysler's stock gained 12.5 cents today, closing at $14.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
In a statement, Chrysler said the rating drop to BB-, from BB+, on the debt of Chrysler, its Chrysler Financial unit and the Auburn Hills Trust notes were "extremely disappointing," adding that "the timing is surprising." The company said the "economy appears to be on the rebound, and Chrysler's car and truck sales are finally beginning to show some signs of improvement." Furthermore, the company said, "we remain confident that we have the financial resources necessary to continue to support our aggressive new product programs."
Debt that is rated BB+ is considered the least risky of the speculative-grade securites; debt rated BB- is not considered to be significantly more speculative.
S.& P. said if Chrysler Financial succeeded in improving its access to credit markets or finding a buyer for some of its equity, S.& P. might raise the ratings of that unit. Otherwise, it said, further downgradings are likely.
 
Technology Center
 Any further downgrading of the Auburn Hills Trust notes, which were sold to investors to finance the construction of Chrysler's new $1.1 billion technology center, could mean a further increase in the interest rate to 16.875 percent, from the current 15.875 percent. Since the notes were issued in February 1990 at 12.375 percent, the rate has been raised twice because of lower ratings, as allowed for in the prospectus.
Scott Sprinzen, an S.& P. vice president, said Chrysler's current weakness could keep the company from passing certain financial tests specified under its $1.7 billion revolving loan agreement with 38 banks, which was signed in March. If that happens, Chrysler may be forced to renegotiate the loan.
Chrysler executives said they were counting on the introduction next year of two new models -- a new Jeep utility vehicle called the Grand Cherokee and a series of midsize sedans code-named L/H -- to return the company to stability.

HEADLINE: 200 Ethiopians Trapped in West Bank

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QIRYAT ARBA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank, June 4

 BODY:
While Israel has promised not to settle any of its new Ethiopian immigrants in the occupied territories, nearly 200 Ethiopians from the last airlift, in 1984, say they have been trapped against their will for seven years here in the West Bank's most militant Jewish settlement.
As soon as the 14,100 new immigrants stepped off the planes late last month, Simcha Dinitz, the nation's most senior immigration official, said all of them "are going to be housed in our 100 absorption centers, and none of them are in the territories." 
 Mr. Dinitz's promise seemed to satisfy the United States and other governments that had expressed concern. But here in the West Bank's oldest settlement, in the heart of Hebron, Erez Mekerit, a 22-year-old soldier, and his friends are asking: What about us?
Mr. Mekerit was a part of Operation Moses, the secret airlift in 1984 that brought 10,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel. A few months after they arrived, before any of them had got their bearings, "they brought us out here," said Avraham Kasu, 20, another soldier.
 
'Won't Let Us' Leave
 "And for seven years we've been requesting to leave," Mr. Mekerit said. "But they won't let us. We don't have any options."
His friend Rutti Kasa, 18, a high school student, nodded at that and said: "Everybody here wants to leave. Lots of people are afraid. There's no place to work out here. Our relatives are afraid to visit us. We've been crying and complaining the whole time we've been here. But they won't let us go."
With hardly an exception, nearly all of their Ethiopian neighbors agree.
It is not that these people are prisoners of the West Bank. In theory every one of them could pack up and leave Qiryat Arba tomorrow. Some of them have.
But the Ethiopians cannot move without significant Government assistance, and that has not been forthcoming.
 
Spreading Them Across Country
 In 1984, as now, the Ethiopian immigrants arrived in Israel with few possessions, no money, little education and not much idea of how or where they should live in Israel. For the first year, the Government made almost all of their decisions for them -- fed them, clothed them, found them jobs and assigned them places to live.
Late in 1984, after the immigrants had been in the country for about six months, the Government moved them out of absorption centers and into permanent homes they had been assigned. The policy then, as now, was to spread them all over the country. As Gad Ben Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency, puts it now, "there was much less sensitivity about these things then."
So about 60 families, more than 300 people, were assigned homes in Qiryat Arba.
The mayors of some small towns in Israel were complaining that they had too few apartments for their own residents' children. But Qiryat Arba welcomed the Ethiopians with open arms; like all settlements, it was always eager to expand,
"Other places don't want them," the settlement's leader, Elyakim Haetzni, said at the time. "We'll take all they can send."
 
U.S. Protested in 1985
 When the United States learned of that early in 1985, the Reagan Administration delivered an official protest to Israel. But Yaacov Tzur, the Absorption Minister then, assured Washington that Qiryat Arba would not be the immigrants' final home. Soon the matter was forgotten. And now, six years later, the Ethiopians say they have been forgotten, too.
Most of these people are not ideological; few of them seem to care much about the debate over the West Bank. They want only to be near places of employment, close to their families. One after another of them complained that their parents, brothers, sisters and others would not even visit them here.
"They think it's like Lebanon out here," Mr. Kasu said.
Time and time again they have put in requests to move. But many are unemployed, for there is little work in the West Bank. And for most of those who do have jobs, the work is menial.
"I don't have any work; I can't find any work out here," said Eli Noga, who is 34. "It's pretty here; the people are nice. But like everyone else, I've asked to leave. I want to live with other Ethiopians."
 
Needs Government Subsidy
 But Mr. Noga, like the others, lives in a Government-subsidized apartments. He would need another wherever he lived.
"I remember that many of them didn't want to be there even in 1984," Mr. Ben Ari said. But then, he added, the division of the Jewish agency involved in settling immigrants was controlled by a Likud Party official, a strong advocate of West Bank settlement. There was also a Likud Government of the time.
With Mr. Dinitz at the head, the Jewish Agency is under Labor Party control today. But now, with all the new Soviet immigrants, there is a drastic housing shortage nationwide.
The Jewish Agency is a quasi-governmental organization. But the Government would have the largest role in trying to resettle Qiryat Arba's Ethiopians. Still, the right-wing administration of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, struggling to catch up with the drastic housing shortages while also eager to see the West Bank's population grow, has shown no inclination to help them.
 
Priority to the Homeless
 "We know they are unhappy," Mr. Ben Ari said. "But they already live in their housing solutions. For new homes, we need to give priority to those people who are still in absorption centers and don't have any permanent homes at all."
So the Ethiopians say they are trapped.
"Maybe they aren't trying to keep us against our will," Miss Kasa said. "But nobody's giving us any place to go. And you definitely see that they want new immigrants out here."
With that, she gestured behind her to a large shipping crate that had held the belongings of new neighbors, a family that had just arrived in Israel. The stenciled letters on the side of the box were in Russian. Others like it are scattered among several buildings.
In the last two years, some of the Ethiopian families with independent means have managed to move out of Qiryat Arba on their own. And in almost every case that an apartment is vacated, Miss Kasa says now, "Russian immigrants are moving in."

Miss Kasa joked with friends at the settlement. (Micha Bar-Am/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Productivity Rise Revised Downward

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Businesses outside the farming sector were less productive in the first quarter than originally estimated, the Government said today. The report was evidence that the recession's drag on manufacturers was more severe than previously feared.
The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity rose at only a three-tenths of 1 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, instead of the 1 percent increase previously reported. Non-farm productivity had fallen at a seven-tenths of 1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1990. 
 On May 6, in one of the most embarrassing mistakes in recent memory, the Labor Department first announced that first-quarter productivity had dropped at an annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent. But in the afternoon, citing a statistical error, the department said first-quarter productivity had actually risen at a 1 percent annual rate.
Economists said today's downward revision confirmed that the economy was in the grip of recession in the first quarter, with the manufacturing sector extremely weak.
"Over all, the first quarter was extremely anemic and this shows that," said Jean Sundrla, vice president at Evans Economics Inc.
 
Measure at Vitality
 Productivity -- a key measure of economic vitality -- measures the output per hour of all workers, from regular staff to unpaid family workers. It shows how much companies can produce and at what cost.
Economists found little in the report to provide fresh economic insights, but suggested that the report was consistent with the view that the worst of the recession may be over.
"We're in a troughing stage right now," said Ms. Sundrla, who predicted an improvement in manufacturing output in the third quarter.
Overall productivity, which includes the farming sector, rose at a one-tenth of 1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less than the seven-tenths of 1 percent rise the department reported last month.
In the manufacturing sector, first-quarter productivity fell at a 1.2 percent annual rate, instead of the nine-tenths of 1 percent decline reported previously. The department attributed the revision to steep declines in output and hours worked.
 
Big Drop in Factory Output
 It said manufacturing output fell a sharp 10.9 percent in the quarter, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 1981, when it fell 12.7 percent. The department previously reported that manufacturing output fell at a 10.5 percent annual rate.
Productivity for makers of durable goods, items made to last three years or longer, fell 1.3 percent, instead of the nine-tenths of 1 percent the department reported in its preliminary report on first-quarter productivity, published a month ago.
The department said the revisions to the productivity data mainly reflected changes in measures of output growth during the quarter.
The implicit price deflator for nonfarm business, a measure of inflation, rose 4.6 percent in the quarter, slightly less than the increase of 4.9 percent reported previously.
An analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last month's error occurred when a Commerce Department unit gave the bureau one wrong basic statistic that poisoned much of the data in a 20-page statistical release.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pressure Angers Panama Banks

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
Bankers and some Government officials here are angered by what they see as the Bush Administration's efforts to make Panamanian banks practice a higher level of scrutiny than is required of banks in the United States to prevent the laundering of illegal-drug profits.
At issue is the interpretation of a new law-enforcement agreement between the United States and Panama, signed recently after the Bush Administration threatened to withhold some economic aid. 
 Panamanian bankers and banking officials contend that the accord substantially broadens the interpretation of what constitutes money laundering and increases their obligation to detect it.
 
Defining Dirty Money
 "In a conventional sense, money laundering is bringing in cash to deposit, and, in that way, clean it," said Ruben Carles, the Comptroller General in the Government of President Guillermo Endara and a former private banker.
But he said the United States now wanted Panamanian banks and authorities to investigate the source and legitimacy of cable transfers and bank checks drawn on banks in the United States -- money that is used here to buy goods in the Colon free-trade zone and for similar purposes.
"How can this be dirty money in Panama, but not in New York or Miami?" he asked.
Edgardo Lasso Valdes, president of the Banking Association of Panama, said: "In banking, it has always been assumed that a transfer from another bank could be considered clean money. Now they are telling us that transfers from the United States can be dirty.
"No one who washes money does it for free. To me, money laundering means the banker knows he is doing it, and he helps divide up the money and pass it along. If I don't know the money comes from drugs, to me it's not a crime."
Panama's status as an international banking center -- the country has 110 banks from all over the world -- was severely damaged before and after United States troops invaded Panama in December 1989 to overthrow and arrest the nation's ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, on drug charges.
But banking here is now making a rapid recovery. Deposits now total $18.5 billion, up from $15 billion at the beginning of the year, and bankers and officials contend that most of the deposits are not related to drugs.
"In a place like Panama," Mr. Carles said, "where you have absolute freedom to move capital in and out, where the dollar is the basis of the monetary system, and where there is almost no inflation, it is logical that people from many countries bring money. Drug dollars are, undoubtedly, one of those components.
"During the dictatorship, trafficking and laundering were protected by Noriega and his friends. I can't say that money laundering has now disappeared. But if there is any, it is not protected by the Government."
International financial services are among Panama's most important sources of income and jobs, and Government and banking officials were determined that the negotiations with the United States not undermine Panama's tradition of bank secrecy. The Panamanians finally agreed to open accounts for drug investigations, but not for cases involving tax evasion in the United States.
Mr. Lasso Valdes said bankers particularly resented comments from some members of Congress and in some American newspapers that there is as much money laundering in Panama now as there was during the Noriega era. He said the assertions had not been backed by solid information or identifiable sources.
American officials here said they had no measurement of how much drug money might be laundered in Panama and did not know whether the amount had risen. They said that there was ample anecdotal evidence of money laundering but that they thought only a handful of banks were involved.
Bob Martinez, President Bush's senior adviser on drug policy, said during a recent visit to Panama that his office "does not have any figure in terms of what money laundering existed previously, nor do we know exactly now what it is, nor do we know exactly how much cocaine traffic came through Panama then, nor what it may be now."
 
Rules on Origin of Deposit
 The Endara Government has adopted rules requiring banks to learn the origin of any deposit of more than $10,000 in cash and inform the Government.
Mr. Lasso Valdes said the members of his association were already gathering such information on deposits of more than $50,000 and had always found a reasonable explanation for such deposits; such large sums often come from legitimate businesses that take in a lot of cash, he said.
American diplomats here acknowledged that cash deposits in Panama were not the main concern in money laundering. One diplomat said that of the estimated $300 billion in drug money laundered annually, about $200 billion originated in the United States. Much of that, he said, is transferred to banks in Panama, Hong Kong, Zurich and elsewhere.
"They used to bring drug money to Panama in suitcases," he added. "Now, they are very sophisticated."

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS OFFER WIDE HEALTH PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Senate Democratic leaders today offered legislation to guarantee basic health insurance coverage for all Americans, and they vowed to push it through Congress by the end of next year.
The Democrats' timetable is ambitious because the legislation is immensely complicated and is opposed by many Republicans, in Congress and in the Bush Administration. 
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, introduced the bill after nearly two years of work on it. The measure would extend health insurance coverage to 34 million uninsured Americans and would vastly expand the role of Government in economic regulation of hospitals, doctors and other parts of the health-care industry.
Senator Mitchell insisted that today's announcement was not the opening salvo of the 1992 Presidential election campaign, and he said, "It is our intention to make law, not make a political statement."
Democrats say they believe that health care is an issue with broad bipartisan appeal to the middle class. Mr. Mitchell said that 70 percent of the uninsured are above the poverty level, which was $13,360 for a family of four last year.
"It is my hope, my expectation and my intention that we will enact meaningful health-care reform in this Congress," said Mr. Mitchell. The 102d Congress convened this year on Jan. 3 and will run till late next year.
A Bush Administration official, insisting on anonymity, said the Administration would not be rushed into action. "When to move is at our discretion," the official said.
The Administration opposes the core of the Democratic proposal, which would eventually require all employers to provide health insurance for their employees or to pay an extra payroll tax to the Federal Government to finance a new public health-care program for the uninsured.
The Democrats were unable to say how much their new package would eventually cost or how it would be financed. But an extraordinary provision of the bill would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fix the payroll tax rate. If lawmakers approve that proposal, they would surrender authority zealously guarded by Congress for more than two centuries: the constitutional power to levy taxes.

HEADLINE: Laid-Off Employee Kills 2 at Workplace

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, June 5

 BODY:
A laid-off computer technician shot his way into his old workplace here Tuesday, hunted for his former superiors and killed one of them and another man, the authorities said.
The gunman, identified as Larry Thomas Hansel, 41 years old, then fled on a bicycle and later drove his pickup truck 135 miles northeast to Palm Desert, where he surrendered to deputies of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. He was returned to San Diego, where he is being held in the county jail. 
 Lieut. Dan Berglund of the San Diego police said today that Mr. Hansel had admitted the killings.
Mr. Hansel was among a dozen workers laid off about three months ago by the Elgar Corporation, an electronics manufacturing concern. "He had a bit of a history," said Drummond Murdoch, chairman of the company's industrial electronics division. "He was a bit religious, and he kept preaching the Gospel on the floor." Mr. Hansel's neighbors and co-workers also said that he had claimed to have seen flying saucers in his yard and that he believed the Persian Gulf war signaled the end of the world.
Employees at the company's headquarters here said that when he burst into the building on Tuesday, Mr. Hansel was looking for three of his former supervisors. He killed one of them, John Jones, 48, the vice president and general manager, as well as Mike Krowitz, 46, a regional sales manager who happened to be present when Mr. Hansel confronted Mr. Jones. The gunman's two other intended victims were unharmed.

Money Market Funds Drop Despite Short-Term Trend

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the week ended yesterday.
The decline occurred despite a general rise in short-term interest rates, IBC/Donoghue's analysts noted. 
 This slight increase in short-term interest rates may indicate that the fixed-income market believes that Federal Reserve may not be interested in further easing of credit. For instance, Walter S. Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's, said, "It would take a true reversal in the economy to get the central bank to begin easing again."
Tax-exempt money fund yields declined for the week, with the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios up a day, to 44. Analysts report a slight decline in the total assets of tax-exempt funds, falling $295 million, to $88.8 billion.
For the seven-day period ended yesterday the average tax-exempt compounded yield fell 10 basis points, to 3.97 percent, and simple yield fell by 7 basis points, to 3.90 percent.
The average 30-day compounded yield fell 12 basis points, to 4.11 percent, and the simple was down 11 basis points, to 4.03 percent.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 5.51 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.75 percent.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million, that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, Strong Municipal Money Market fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee, had the best return for the fourth consecutive week at 5.15 percent.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $4.5 billion, to $454.3 billion, with the assets of institutional funds down by $2.4 billion, to $114.5 billion. The remainder of the decline came from consumer assets which fell $2.1 billion, to a total $339.8 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield was 5.66 percent, down 2 basis points, while the seven-day simple yield fell by an equal amount, to 5.51 percent. The 30-day compounded yield declined by 5 basis points, to 5.71 percent, and the seven-day simple fell 4 basis points to 5.56 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds, were down only slightly, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index. The average yield on a bank money account slipped by 1 basis point, to 5.32 percent.

HEADLINE: Symposium Tallies Cost of Quebec Separation

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: MONTREAL, May 31

 BODY:
Quebec, which by itself ranks as the ninth largest trading partner of the United States, could survive economically as an independent country, but the economic costs imposed on 6.5 million Quebecers would be heavy.
That was the conclusion of a symposium on federalism in North America at McGill University, which challenged assumptions of the separatist Parti Quebecois that a unilateral declaration of independence would bring little change in the economic life of the province.It was the first time that any institution here has addressed in a substantive way the economic implications of the threatened spinoff of most of French-speaking Canada, should constitutional reform efforts collapse again, as they did last June. 
 The costs of independence for Quebec include loss of income from the federal Government, which provides 12 cents of every dollar that the provincial government spends, and economic uncertainty arising from what could be difficult negotiations of territorial questions, contracts and treaties and the division of the federal debt.
The Parti Quebecois leader, Jacques Parizeau, argues that there would be a relatively smooth, rapid divorce based on the premise that economic rationality would prevail and that it would be in everyone's interest to avoid conflict.
Mr. Parizeau has been making this point both here and in Washington. To allay fears of economic dislocation, he recently told the National Economists Club in Washington that a free flow of goods, services, capital and, perhaps, labor, was likely to be maintained between a separatist Quebec and Canada.
He also said there would be no desire in Quebec to reopen the two-and-a-half-year-old free trade agreement with the United States, which looks forward to elimination of Canadian-American trade barriers by the year 2000.
But these assumptions were subjected to rigorous analysis at the two-day McGill symposium, which drew a score of economists from Quebec and as far away as Vancouver.
Stephen A. Scott, a law professor at McGill and a practicing Montreal lawyer, said the territorial issue was bound to stir bitter controversy.
While lower Quebec, once known as New France, has been settled by the French since the 18th century, the Canadian Parliament in 1898 and 1912 gave the province immense northern territories that had no historical connection to New France. From this region, Hydro Quebec, the provincial power company, draws electricity that it exports to New York and the New England states."It is sheer effrontery to demand that the 1898 and 1912 territories should form part of an independent Quebec," Professor Scott said. "Without these territories, it is highly doubtful that Quebec would be economically viable as a sovereign state."
Professor Scott surprised the conference when he suggested that "the use of the limited amount of force needed to retain the sparsely inhabitated territories of Northern Quebec would probably be effective to frustrate any attempt by Quebec to secede."
It was one of the rare times in the constitutional debate that any allusion to military force or coercion has been heard.
Prof. Charles Doran, head of North American Studies at Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said Professor Scott's statement "changes the terms of the debate here" and "raises the stakes enormously."
Yet perhaps because of recognition of the costs of separation, there is a growing feeling here that some solution will be found to keep Canada together. Polls show the number of Quebecers demanding independence has fallen from 70 percent to 45 percent.
The crisis has arisen because of the collapse of an accord a year ago that would have recognized Quebec as a "distinct society" and given it more of the powers now residing in Ottawa.
The province's governing Liberal Party has formally adopted a program that puts the rest of Canada on notice that Quebec will move to independence by the end of next year unless it is given sweeping new constitutional authority.

The Big Contrasts In 2 Japan Pacts

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TRADE experts and American and Japanese negotiators say differences between two recently concluded trade negotiations reflect disputes within the bureaucracies of both countries, the very different styles of the American negotiators and the character of the industries involved.
Several hours before Saturday's agreement on American access to Japanese public works projects, a senior Commerce Department official publicly announced in Tokyo that the talks were at "a complete impasse" and that the United States would draw up sanctions against Japanese companies. 
 But the final negotiations for Tuesday's bilateral agreement on trade in semiconductors were conducted in Washington without public comments on their progress or announcements of threats.
The semiconductor dispute was handled by S. Linn Williams, deputy United States trade representative, and Naomichi Suzuki, the vice minister for international trade at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan. Both are elite agencies that deal with each other on many different issues and must work to keep relations cordial.
President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, which includes many passionately free-market economists, also played a role in the negotiations.
The semiconductor industries in both countries also depend heavily on exports to each other, so they had stakes in a friendly outcome. And the executives and workers in that industry tend to be young, highly educated and global minded.
In the semiconductor dispute, the United States wanted the Japanese ministry to continue to put pressure on Japanese manufacturers to buy American computer chips. Japan wanted the United States to lift sanctions imposed in 1987 on imports of hand power tools and color television sets in retaliation for the low market share that American chip companies had captured in Japan.
The semiconductor talks ended with an agreement nearly two months before the deadline, and with little acrimony. The final deal relied heavily on private companies, with a minimum of direct government oversight.
The construction negotiations, by contrast, ended a month after their deadline and after the United States trade representative published in the Federal Register a request for public comments on how best to ban Japanese companies from American public works projects. J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, the official who declared the talks in Tokyo at an impasse, demanded repeatedly that the Japanese Government make major changes.
Japan eventually agreed to offer preferential bidding procedures for foreign companies on at least 17 public works contracts.
Japan had little to gain in the construction talks because it already had access to the American market, although Japanese companies have won few public works contracts in this country. "There was nothing really hanging out there that they wanted fixed, and therefore their energy level and desire to get things done were different," said an American negotiator who insisted on anonymity.
The threat of a sanction against Japanese companies in the United States created an incentive to an agreement comparable to lifting the sanctions imposed in 1987, the official said.
But a Japanese negotiator, who also insisted on anonymity, said Mr. Farren's and the Commerce Department's aggressive tactics put a strain on bilateral relations. Negotiations were more relaxed with Mr. Williams, he said.
But American officials say the difference between the approaches to negotiations may be exaggerated by the Japanese. While the Commerce Department may have had jurisdiction over the construction negotiations and the trade representative oversaw the semiconductor talks, the two agencies also assigned officials to each other's negotiating teams.
"Commerce is close to business; there's no doubt about it," said another American negotiator who also insisted on anonymity. But he added that this made little difference in negotiations.
The Japanese official also acknowledged that bureaucratic considerations in Japan made a construction agreement more difficult. The construction, tranportation and foreign ministries were all directly involved in the talks and accepted a need for concessions. But other agencies with no stake in the outcome were reluctant to open their public works contracts to foreign companies.
"Those other agencies have been a little difficult to extract from bureaucratic resistance, and we had to have some help from the Prime Minister's office," he said.

HEADLINE: Strife Cripples Yugoslavia's Big Tourist Industry

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPLIT, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
The boutiques beneath the soaring arches of this city's Roman palace stood deserted on a brisk spring afternoon, their jewelery and folk art gathering dust. The hotels were all but empty. Those in the tourism business here concede that the 1991 season is the worst in their memory.
"Last summer, there were many people here; now, there is nobody," said Jadranka Durdov, a 25-year-old saleswoman. "It's obvious the political situation has scared people, and I can understand why." 
 Up and down the picturesque Adriatic coast, the story is much the same for what has been one of Yugoslavia's leading industries. Visitors from Europe and the United States are staying away, apparently frightened by this nation's ethnic violence. Local tourism agents estimate that this year they are seeing only 10 percent as many visitors as last year.
 
Destination for Westerners
 With tourism booming in Eastern Europe since the fall of Communist governments, Yugoslavia had expected business to improve. For the last decade, Yugoslavia has carved out a singular niche among Eastern European nations. While Bulgaria, Romania and even Hungary catered largely to visitors from other Communist countries, Yugoslavia successfully marketed itself as a cheap, sunny destination for Westerners.
The collapse of the nation's tourism, a $2.7 billion business last year, is one of the worst economic consequences of the conflicts that threaten to tear this country apart. Ljubica Milojevic, chief of the research department at the Tourism Association of Yugoslavia, said that bookings nationwide were off 60 to 80 percent from last year.
Tourism has been one of Yugoslavia's leading sources of Western currencies, she said, employing 400,000 and accounting for about 3 percent of gross national product. More than 9 million foreigners visited Yugoslavia in 1990, about 40 percent from Germany.
In better times, Split, a city of 280,000, was one of the nation's chief attractions. Its walled old city, built by the Roman Emperor Diocletian in the years 300 to 304, is one of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Europe. Local legend has it that the emperor settled here because of the waters, the beautiful women and the absence of earthquakes.
 
Near Empty Restaurant
 But on a recent Saturday evening in Split, the Adrijana Restaurant, known for its seafood, served its first and only customers at 10 P.M. They were foreign journalists covering Yugoslavia's latest crisis.
On the sidewalk out front, several people lurked in the shadows, approaching anyone who could possibly be a tourist with their forlorn, multi-lingual pleas: "Room? Zimmer? Camara? Sobe?"
At the Bellevue Hotel nearby, Vjenceslav Perkov, a manager there, lamented the lack of traffic. "Yugoslavia is a beautiful country with the most beautiful sea in the world," he said. "This political situation has had a terrible influence on tourism. If events do not calm down, many hotels here will have to close down."
Yugoslavia's tourism has long added to the disputes among the nation's six republics. More than 80 percent of tourist dollars and Deutsche marks are spent in Split, Dubrovnik and other coastal communities in the republic of Croatia. The republics have bickered for years over how much the federal Government should invest in projects like constructing new roads to the seashore, which some argue would mainly benefit Croatia.
 
Serbians Block Road
 Recently, the tourist business has become a target for Croatia's restive Serbian minority. Last year, Serbs challenging the newly elected nationalist government in Croatia blocked the main road from Western Europe to the coast, causing a sharp decline in late-season bookings. About half of the coast's tourists come from Germany, and the main auto route crosses the republic's Serbian areas.
This year, tourism prospects dimmed when Yugoslav Army tanks rolled through the streets of Belgrade in February to quell rioting. Croatian officials said that events this spring then destroyed their last hopes of salvaging the season.
Rebel Serbs seized the Plitvice national park in Croatia, whose water falls and forests form the backdrop for many of the country's tourism posters. When paramilitary policemen stormed the park on Easter Sunday, a bus filled with Italian tourists was caught in the crossfire. Their quick-witted driver ordered passengers to crouch on the floor, averting any injuries.
The violence has intensified. First, clashes between Serbs and Croatians left at least 18 dead. Then, an anti-Army protest in Split turned into a riot that led to the fatal shooting of a 19-year old conscript.
 
Airlift on Standby
 Even before these troubles, travel agents in Split had received little more than cancellations and unusual requests. Some Belgian tourists said they would come to the region only with a guarantee that if ethnic strife broke out, they would immediately be airlifted out. A plane was reserved, but not needed.
Ana Manzoni, director of the foreign travel division at Dalmacijaturist, a worker-owned agency with annual revenues of $150 million, said she foresaw layoffs if business did not pick up.
"The damage has already been done," she said, after hearing Prime Minister Ante Markovic address reporters at the nation's annual tourism convention. "At best, we may end up with 40 percent of last year, which was not a good year. It is really a disaster."

Dollar Gains on Optimism About Improved Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened yesterday on optimism over improvement in the United States economy.
Earl Johnson, vice president for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said economic reports and remarks by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, led to some firming. Mr. Greenspan said the economy seemed to be stabilizing. 
 But traders remained cautious in advance of the May unemployment report, to be issued tomorrow. The report will contain the latest evidence of the economy's health.
A stronger United States economy would tend to bolster the dollar's value because it implies that domestic interest rates will stabilize or rise, which makes dollar-denominated investments worth more.
 
Rises Against Yen
 Jeff Mondschein, manager of foreign exchange for the Continential Illinois Bank and Trust Company, said some of the demand for dollars was constrained as traders cashed in on the currency's strength.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.17 Japanese yen, up from 138.80 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 139.20 yen. It was quoted at 139.30 yen at closing in New York, up from 138.85 the day before.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6945, from $1.7035 late Tuesday. At closing in New York, it cost $1.6935 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.7000.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.7490 German marks, up from 1.7455; 1.4960 Swiss francs, up from 1.4920; 5.9220 French francs, up from 5.9115; 1,294.50 Italian lire, up from 1,292.75, and 1.14555 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14445.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.7480 German marks, up from 1.7385; 1.4955 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 5.9175 French francs, up from 5.9105; 1.9685 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9633; 1,293.75 Italian lire, up from 1,292.00, and 1.1454 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1445.
Gold for current delivery gained 10 cents on the New York Commodity Exchange to close at $362.60 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late price of $362.20, up 20 cents.
Earlier, gold rose in London to a late bid of $362.75 a troy ounce, up from $362.70 late Tuesday. In Zurich,gold fell to a closing bid of $362 an ounce, from $362.20 late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 41 cents an ounce to close at $361.94.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $4.16 a troy ounce, from $4.20 late Tuesday. In New York, silver for current delivery gained 2.6 cents to close at $4.167 a troy ounce on the Comex.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Greenspan Sees Growth; Bonds Drop

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sent a chill through the credit markets yesterday, where prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates rose.
Attending an international monetary conference in Japan, Mr. Greenspan told reporters that the economy seemed to be bottoming out in the second quarter, and that as a result of rapid inventory liquidation, a stronger-than-expected recovery was increasingly likely. 
 Mr. Greenspan also said recent reports suggested that inflation in the United States would be at a lower level coming out of the recession than when it began. For the most part, however, this comment was lost on the bond market.
 
'Market Sure Took It Badly'
 "Greenspan didn't say anything radical," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "It shouldn't be much news that the recession is coming to an end. But the market sure took it badly."
Some analysts and traders said Mr. Greenspan's remarks on the employment rate eliminated virtually any possibility that the Fed might ease its monetary policy again any time soon.
The Fed chairman said that while the unemployment rate might show a further rise, turns in the labor markets would lag developments in the overall economy.
"I don't see how the employment number can help us now," a government bond trader said.
Mr. Greenspan made his remarks in the context of recent statistics that suggest the economy may have troughed. But some analysts said they remained unconvinced.
"The improvement that has been made is from such low levels that it is hard to label it a recovery," said Alan Leslie, chief economist at the Discount Corporation. "To my mind, that does not make a recovery until we see it for a longer period of time."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks had little effect on bond prices in Tokyo. The slide began when trading shifted to London and became more pronounced once American dealers reached their desks.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 97 5/32, down more than half a point, to yield 8.38 percent, up from 8.33 percent late Tuesday.
Among notes, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 26/32, down 3/8, to yield 8.17 percent. The 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 5/32, down 1/4 point, to yield 7.83 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 29/32, down 2/32, to yield 6.80 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.60 percent, up four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.70 percent.
 
New York City's Offering
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a negotiated sale of $675 million worth of tax-exempt and taxable securities for the City of New York was well received by investors.
The maximum yield on the tax-exempt portion of the offering was 8.55 percent on bonds maturing in 2020. The rate was slightly lower what had been expected.
Officials at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the firm that acted as lead manager for the underwriting, said that as of late yesterday, all but 25 percent of the New York City issue had been sold.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Southwestern Bell offered a total of $400 million worth of new securities in a two-part offering through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs.
Three-year notes maturing on June 1, 1994, made up half the offering. The 7.70 percent notes were priced at $99.90 to yield 7.736 percent, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $200 million of the issue consisted of 8.30 percent five-year notes. The notes were priced at $99.85 to yield 8.336 percent, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 5/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Both parts of the issue are noncallable for life. All securities are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues dipped by about 1/4 point, traders said.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in slow trading.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gasoline Off More Than 2 To Lowest Level Since War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gasoline futures plunged more than 2 cents a gallon yesterday to their lowest level since the Persian Gulf war, dragging down the rest of the energy market.
The sharp drop was taken as a sign that the nation's refineries were producing more gasoline than needed, considering the bite that the recession has taken out of demand. 
 But experts said motorists should not expect any sudden relief at the gas pump, where prices have risen during 12 of the last 13 weeks. The energy futures market is volatile and does not necessarily foretell the direction of retail prices, they said.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery in July settled at 64.12 cents a gallon, down 2.13 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gasoline for next-month delivery had not closed that low since Feb. 26, when the settlement price was 63.95 cents, two days after American-led forces began the ground war with Iraq.
If gasoline falls an additional 4 cents, "I think we'd have some relief at the pump," said Rita Beale, a petroleum products analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "If we were to stay the same, pump prices would probably stay flat. It might inch down a little bit. There's a lag effect, meaning as prices go down on the screen, it takes a longer time for prices to go down at the pump."
Yesterday's drop in gasoline prices followed Tuesday night's report by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed sharp increases in the nation's supply of oil and petroleum products last week. It also came in the wake of Tuesday's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, where oil ministers decided to maintain current production quotas.
Concerns that OPEC might cut production or come up with some unexpected move had kept prices propped up for about two or three weeks.
The combination of the petroleum institute report and the OPEC meeting "gave the market the momentum and the reason to sell off," said Victor Yu, an oil broker at Refco Inc.
Crude oil for delivery in July settled at $20.47, down 55 cents. Home heating oil for July settled at 54.28 cents a gallon, down 1.71 cents.
Traders said the market had been focused on gasoline for weeks, as the nation's supply shrank this spring. Refiners apparently all moved to erase the shortfall at once, said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
Then, the sharp rise in the gasoline supply for the week after Memorial Day "confirmed earlier fears of a weak driving season," Mr. Yu said.

U.S. Grants 3 Airlines Routes to Soviet Union

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The Transportation Department yesterday selected two established airlines and a new one to serve the Soviet Union from New York and Chicago.
The awards would mean a large increase in service between North America and the Soviet Union, which are now served by Pan American World Airways Inc. and Aeroflot, the state-owned Soviet carrier. 
The department gave authority for Trans World Airlines to provide service between New York and Moscow beginning this year and next, with two more round trips being added in 1992-93.
The department also authorized American Airlines to provide service between Chicago and Moscow beginning in 1992-93.
The new carrier, Baltia Air Lines Inc., which has had no experience in flying, also received approval to provide service from New York to Leningrad, as well as between New York and Riga, Latvia. From there, Baltia would provide service to Kiev, Minsk, and Tbilisi. Both services would start this year and next.
In granting the authority to Baltia, Patrick V. Murphy, a Deputy Assistant Secretary, reversed the decision of a Federal administrative law judge, Robert Barton, in Washington.
Judge Barton found in February that the time was not ripe to allow a fledgling carrier to begin service "in a risky developmental market characterized by political and economic turmoil."
He added that Baltia had "no operating experience, no name recognition and no marketing organization."
Instead, the judge had chosen American Trans Air, a leading charter airline that has long served the Soviet Union, to fly from Philadelphia to Riga three times a week.
Mr. Murphy said yesterday that he had reversed Judge Barton's decision, since Baltia had proposed a high level of service for the markets.
He added that Baltia's proposal to serve Leningrad was far superior to that of T.W.A.
The Transportation Department also gave Pan American World Airways Inc. authority to provide service that had been authorized previously to Moscow and Leningrad.
Yesterday's actions were based on a June 1990 aviation agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which expanded opportunities for the carriers of the countries.

HEADLINE: Budget Impasse Forces Legislature Into a Special Session in Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 5

 BODY:
With no state budget and no immediate hope of passing one, legislative leaders adjourned their regular session tonight and called themselves back immediately into special session to try to break the fiscal stalemate.
The lawmakers' decision to declare a special session themselves, while not unprecedented, was a break with the tradition that has allowed governors that privilege. It provided further evidence of the distancing -- if not outright alienation -- that has developed between the General Assembly and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. 
 Mr. Weicker, a third-party Governor with no allies in either the House or Senate, vetoed the legislature's budget Friday night, in effect forcing the special session. The Govermor, who had proposed a sweeping budget overhaul and income-tax plan in February, said in his veto message that the legislature's budget, which avoided the income tax through a huge increase in sales and business taxes, would hurt the economy and punish the poor.
 
Governor Calls for Action
 In his brief remarks to the joint House and Senate after the adjournment, Mr. Weicker said he believed that the battles of the regular session were best left behind and forgotten.
"You've had your votes, I've had my veto," he said. "The public now deserves their budget. See you in the morning."
A final budget is supposed to be in place when Connecticut's fiscal year begins July 1. With a preliminary budget of $8.6 billion, the state faces a revenue shortage of $2.7 billion, caused mainly by declines in sales-tax and corporate-tax revenues.
Legislative historians and veterans in the Capitol say that to their knowledge, Connecticut has never failed to pass a budget in time to start its fiscal year -- unlike some other states, including New York.

HEADLINE: Voters End Tradition of 98 Years In Sending Democrat to Congress

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 5

 BODY:
For almost a century, voters in the hills of western Massachusetts have defied this state's Democratic tradition and sent a Republican to Washington to represent them in Congress.
But this year, despite campaign appearances by President Bush and his wife, Barbara, and by the newly elected Republican Governor, William F. Weld, voters in the 1st Congressional District have had a change of heart. 
 In a special election held Tuesday that some saw as a referendum on the conservative fiscal policies of the state's new Republican administration, John Olver, a liberal Democrat, squeezed out Steven Pierce, a conservative Republican, by a margin of two percentage points. Analysts said the campaign turned on issues of abortion, crime and taxes.
 
An Emblematic Switch?
 Mr. Olver, a state senator and former chemistry professor, will now become the first Democrat to hold the western Massachusetts seat in 98 years, after three long-serving Republican congressmen. His victory, which fills the vacancy created by the death of the state's only Republican representative, Silvio O. Conte, makes the state's entire delegation Democratic. Mr. Conte died in February after serving 32 years in Congress.
A liberal Republican, Mr. Conte had tremendous cross-party appeal in the independent-minded district, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-to-1. But recent moves by Governor Weld have discouraged voters in the district, one of the poorest in the state.
Mr. Weld, the first Republican Governor in almost two decades, has supported large cuts in funding for social services and higher education and major reductions in money that the state gives to cities and towns to support education and some municipal services. Those policies have come as a staggering blow to the district, where some towns have unemployment levels as high as 14 percent.
In the voting, Mr. Olver won 70,022 votes, or 50 percent, and Mr. Pierce had 68,052, or 48 percent. Three independent candidates won the remaining votes.
"Steve Pierce is very much in the Reagan mold, and that is not where the district is," George Bachrach, a lawyer and former State Senator, said of the result. "John Olver might be too far to the left for them, but Steve Pierce is too far to the right."
During his campaign, Mr. Pierce tried to portray his Democratic opponent as the kind of tax-and-spend liberal who helped drag the state into fiscal turmoil. He also said Mr. Olver was soft on crime.
Mr. Olver's campaign was aided by the National Abortion Rights Action League, which spent heavily on television and radio advertisements criticizing Mr. Pierce's long-standing opposition to abortion-rights measures.
In the final days of the campaign, Mr. Pierce tried to ease his stance, objecting to a recent United States Supreme Court decision that upheld a Federal ban on abortion counseling at health clinics that receive Federal money. But that move, analysts and political watchers here say, came too late.

New Midsize Stock Index: Will It Fly?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
DOES America really need a new stock index in addition to the Standard & Poor's 500, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Wilshire 5,000, the Russell 2,000 and countless others?
Standard & Poor's, a McGraw-Hill subsidiary, is betting that the answer is yes. Yesterday, it introduced the S.& P. Mid-Cap 400, which is supposed to do for smaller companies what the S.& P. 500 does for larger ones. The companies in it are supposed to be bigger than the small ones, but smaller than the large ones. 
 If it succeeds, the new index will turn into a profit center for S.& P., as money managers and the futures and options exchanges pay royalties on investment products tied to the index. If it fails, as many indexes have, Standard & Poor's will lose the initial investment involved in creating the index -- put by Elliott Shurgin, S.& P.'s vice president for index products, in the "low six figures" -- and the cost of maintaining it.
 The introduction yesterday produced few surprises, showing that in most recent years, stocks with middle-sized market capitalization have tended to perform somewhere between the large stocks and the small ones.
For most of the last decade, large stocks performed better, but this year the situation has turned around. Through the end of May, the S.& P. 500, which is usually viewed as being representative of large stocks, was up 19.8 percent, including reinvested dividends. The new Mid-Cap 400 was up 27.9 percent, and the Russell 2,000, the leading index of small stocks, was up 35.6 percent.
This has stirred speculation that a new era of high-performing small stocks has begun and may increase the chances of the 400-stock index gaining acceptance.
The need for a new index, if there is one, is related to the failings of the S.& P. 500 as a proxy for the stock market. Although it includes 500 stocks, the index is dominated by the largest companies and reflects their performance, because it is weighted by market capitalization.
For many years, ending in the summer of 1983, the small stocks tended to outperform their larger brethren. As a result, most money managers, owning at least some smaller stocks, outperformed the S.& P. 500 and loved to be compared with it. But for the next seven years, smaller stocks tended to be laggards, and most money managers did not do as well as the index.
There are indexes of small-capitalization stocks, most notably the Russell 2,000, but futures contracts on them never caught on, in part because many such stocks are so illiquid that is is difficult for institutions to trade them.
The stocks in the new S.& P. index were chosen in part for their liquidity, with companies dropped if most of their shares were not publicly held or if there was not sufficient volume.
In addition, a number of financial and utility stocks that would otherwise qualify were eliminated. Even so, the index ends up with a representation of about 17.5 percent utility stocks and 15.5 percent financial stocks, in contrast to 15.5 percent utilities and 8 percent financials in the S.& P. 500.
That is a bit unfortunate, said Richard Bernstein, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "Most Mid-Cap managers tend to be growth oriented," he said, noting that such managers would normally not have many utilities. But he still thinks the index will succeed, because he sees a large need for it.
Standard & Poor's hopes the 400 index will catch on to the extent that money managers put together index funds based on it. If they do, S.& P. will get a small royalty on the funds. But the real money would come from licensing the index to the futures and options exchanges and from selling data on the index performance. S.& P. hopes there will be contracts traded on the index, but that is not certain.
Even if they do begin trading, such contracts could fail for lack of interest. Contracts on the S.& P. 500 have been big successes, and options on the S.& P. 100, a subset of the larger index, have also done well. But most others have not.
Any new contract must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem. Money managers will buy and sell the contract only if there is sufficient trading volume to provide liquidity. But that volume will arrive only if the managers use it.
If it does succeed, an "inclusion premium" might come into play: Any stock that is put in the index could then be bought by index-fund managers and therefore tend to rise more than a similar stock not included in the index.
The new Mid-Cap 400 index shows just how difficult it can be to put together a new index. Because the S.& P. considers factors other than capitalization, there are some anomalies. For example, the 400 companies have market values that range from $203 million for American Waste Services Inc. to $5.2 billion, for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, popularly known as Freddie Mac.
The S.&tP. 500, usually considered a large stock index, has 13 companies that are smaller than the smallest one in the new Mid-Cap index. And Freddie Mac would rank No. 130 in the S.& P. 500 if it were included.

HEADLINE: Review/Music;
Once a Cult, Early Music Approaches Mainstream

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 5

 BODY:
In 1981, when the Boston Early Music Festival opened its doors, early music was still early. It appealed to a fervent but confined cult of devotees of the Baroque and before, especially before. The stereotype was of earnest young men in rimless glasses and earnest young women in long dresses playing lutes and recorders and acting like highbrow folkies.
 As anyone who pays the most cursory attention to classical music knows by now, all that has radically changed. The cult isn't quite yet the mainstream, but it's getting there, faster than the old mainstream would like to see from an uppity tributary. Public interest in the concerts and especially the recordings of early music has grown enormously, and early music itself isn't so early anymore. "Historically informed" performances have plunged deep into the 19th century, affecting the way even the most hidebound modern-instrument orchestras must do business. 
 For the spread of this movement in the United States, the biannual Boston event can take a good deal of credit. So its 10th anniversary, at the festival that began Saturday and continues through this Sunday, is worthy of more than passing attention.
 Actually, it is both a festival and an exhibition, with more than 100 stalls and rooms given over to the artisans and business people who service the movement, from instrument makers to record companies to artists' representatives. In addition, the Early Music Association, the movement's support group, is holding its annual meeting here this week.
 Boston may lead the American early-music movement, but it still looks to England for inspiration. As in 1989, the Boston festival's two big conducting stars this year are Roger Norrington, who has dominated the opening days, and Andrew Parrott, who will bring things to a close with performances of the Mozart Mass in C minor and other choral works Saturday night and Sunday afternoon.
Mr. Norrington's most overt contribution was a concert on Tuesday night in the Tremont Temple Baptist Church, which lies right off the Boston Common and used to call itself "the pulpit of America." Like most of the halls this festival employs, it is antiquated, un-air-conditioned and quite wonderful acoustically and visually. The Tremont Temple's main hall resembles a reduced version of classic central European concert halls like the pre-World War II Gewandhaus in Leipzig and the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna.
 Entitled "Haydn in London, Mozart in Vienna," the concert was basically (and refreshingly, in this year of Mozartean overkill) devoted to Haydn's late works composed for the English -- the Symphonies No. 96 ("Miracle") and 92 ("Oxford") and an aria from the opera "La Fedelta Premiata."
 Mr. Norrington came to fame as an original-instruments conductor with a weekend round of Haydn concerts and lectures several years ago in London, but oddly he hasn't yet released any Haydn symphony recordings. This is odd because of all composers, Haydn might seem the most suited to Mr. Norrington's gifts of buoyant rhythmic elasticity, phrasing subtlety and all-purpose wit. With the Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra (an all-star assemblage containing many New Yorkers) playing as well as any large-scale original-instruments band has managed in this country, the performances were delicious. Lorraine Hunt, whose movement up from mezzo-soprano to soprano does not yet mean confidently secure, blooming high notes, was the otherwise appealing soloist.
 Mozart did creep into this occasion, however, in the charming form of 11 dances, most composed for the Viennese Carnivals between 1788 and 1791, the year of his death. This is irresistibly winning music, especially when heard with the silvery flutes, wispy strings and woodsy horns of an original-instruments band. Mr. Norrington presided over the affair like some latter-day Johann Strauss Jr., whose own waltzes Mozart's minuets and contradances directly preceded.
 But the bonus of this concert was eight dancers in period dress and wigs re-creating the social dances this music was meant to accompany. This was more Norringtoniana, in that the English dancers were part of the Early Dance Project, which is run by Kay Lawrence, who is also married to the conductor.
 Earlier in the day, she had given a preview of the evening's dance entertainment with a program of her own, running through some of the Mozart numbers (choreographed by Alison Pooley) and providing demonstrations of court dancing back to the Renaissance. It was all as historically informed as one might wish and lovely in the timeless abstract, as well.
 The other highlight of Tuesday's offerings, and a reaffirmation of the staying power of truly early early music, also came from England. Fretwork is a viol ensemble that appeared late in the afternoon at the Tsai Performance Center of Boston University. The program was built around what seems to be the new cult favorite of early music, a sort of Pachelbel Canon by way of Arvo Part for neo-Elizabethan intellectuals (there are already four compact-disk recordings).
 That is John Dowland's "Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares," a sequence of seven mournful pavans for groaning, sighing viols and virtuoso lute accompaniment composed in 1604. This is grand, consoling music, and Fretwork chose to intersperse the doleful mood with more cheerful music by Dowland and his contemporary William Byrd. Paul O'Dette, perhaps the world's leading lutanist, played both the lute continuo part in the "Lachrimae" and several solos, as well.
 Partly for reasons of cost and partly to assuage complaints on the home front, the Boston festival gives a forum to all levels of local early-music groups. Most of these, along with often worthy but less well-known out-of-towners, are sequestered into a "Concurrent Events" category, and can sometimes yield deeply pleasurable results. A late-night, hourlong concert on Monday at the First and Second Church by Gwendolyn Toth's Artek Ensemble from New York, featuring music by Ortiz, Storace, Frescobaldi, Rosenmuller and Bach, proved as competent and imaginative as many of the offerings on the main schedule.
 But sometimes appeasing local feelings can backfire. The concert performances of Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" by the Boston-based Banchetto Musicale, to judge from the first two acts on Monday evening, were a case in point. The performance at Jordan Hall was freighted with bits of acting that got in the way of the singing more than they compensated for the lack of a proper staging.
 The singing at its best was plausible, with nice work from Miss Hunt, Patrice Michaels Bedi, Matthew Lau and Frank Kelley. But some of the others were distinctly underpowered, and the performance as a whole seemed redundant at a time when Mozart operas with original instruments are no longer exotic. Worse, the conducting lacked any distinctive musical point. Martin Pearlman led a rough and workaday realization of the score, with vocal ornaments applied intermittently and stiffly.
 But any festival, especially in grim economic times, must be judged as a whole, not on the basis of its occasional failings. The Boston Early Music Festival would seem, after a two-day exposure, to be fulfilling its mandate to measure the movement's growth, fan the early-music flames and to offer its audiences musical sustenance of uncommon excellence.

The ------ Word

 BODY:
The Cute Alphabet is filling up fast. "R" has fallen, as in "the 'R' word," the nervous euphemism for recession heard at the American Booksellers Association's convention in New York this week. Last week President Bush swept up the "Q" word, applying it to supposed quotas in employment.
A locution that probably was invented to protect innocent young ears from the "F" word is metastasizing, like the dread disease that some people still describe as the "C" word. Republicans sprinkled the 1988 campaign liberally with the "L" word, and an analyst worried about the dread "E" word, referring to the supposed Republican lock on the Electoral College. 
 "B" has been taken, as in the overused word "brilliant." So have "D" as in "death," "M" as in "meltdown," "T" as in "taxes," "V" as in "vision" and "W" as in the women's vote. That leaves only A, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, S, U and XYZ, at least according to this quick inventory.
The ------ Word usage prompts two objections. One concerns clarity. Consider Bush Administration use of "Q." This month it refers to quotas. Last month, The Times reported, officials were "so worried that American troops may get bogged down in Iraq that they refer to the 'Q' word. The 'Q' stands for 'quagmire.' " The other objection to all this initializing, which was not objectionable initially, is repetition. Even cliches were once fresh. But overuse makes eyes glaze and invites another alphabetarian usage, the one cartoonists spell ZZZZZ.

HEADLINE: Sue the Doctor? There's a Better Way

BYLINE: By Pete V. Domenici and C. Everett Koop; Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico is ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. C. Everett Koop was Surgeon General.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Under America's medical malpractice system, everyone pays grossly inflated health care bills. President Bush has offered sound remedies for the problem, but more fundamental change is required. Instead, we want to overhaul the system by removing virtually all malpractice claims from courts and resolving them in binding arbitration.
Medical liability insurance was the fastest growing part of patients' bills in the 1980's, increasing by more than 18 percent annually from 1982 through 1988. Today, every $100 paid to a doctor includes $11 for such insurance. In Chicago, neurosurgeons and obstetricians are charged more than $150,000 in premiums, and, like their colleagues elsewhere, pass the costs along to patients. 
 To protect themselves against potential malpractice suits, physicians order countless unnecessary tests and perform valueless procedures so that they might tell a jury they tried to provide the best care possible.
By many accounts, unnecessary care constitutes 20 percent to 25 percent of the nation's health expenditures.
The cost of premiums and outrageously high jury awards have forced physicians in high-risk specialties to quit their practices. The number of obstetricians in non-metropolitan areas fell by 20 percent between 1984 and 1989, denying many pregnant women the services they need.
President Bush, in a bill sent to Congress, is encouraging states to place limits on court awards for non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and to set up a mediation system for resolving disputes. Non-complying states would find their Federal Medicare and Medicaid aid reduced.
If insurance costs are reduced and defensive medicine is curtailed, health care costs can come down and more of the 34 million uninsured Americans will be able to gain access to health care.
We think far-reaching changes, proposed in legislation to be submitted to the Senate today, are necessary.
First, participants in all Federal health programs must resolve medical injury claims in binding arbitration instead of in court. These participants include beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid, Federal employees' health plans, and public health and veterans' programs. Second, employees of all companies that get a tax break by offering health plans must resolve medical liability disputes in binding arbitration as well.
This legislation would take about 80 percent of all medical injury claims out of court. (It would not apply to the uninsured and self-employed.)
Mr. Bush wants the following worthy restrictions imposed on state courts: a $250,000 cap on awards for non-economic damages; reduced awards if the injured person is compensated by other insurance coverage, and periodic payments, rather than lump sums, for awards intended to compensate a person for anticipated losses. We think these limits should apply in binding arbitration, bypassing the courts entirely.
Under today's litigation system, 15 out of 16 people victimized by a doctor are never compensated.
Sixty percent of the cost of malpractice insurance pays lawyers' fees and administrative costs, leaving 40 percent for patients. Even worse, patients wait years for compensation. In Michigan, court litigation takes nearly three years; voluntary arbitration, about half that time.
The Senate bill would encourage Federal and state governments, medical societies and other organizations to develop guidelines that arbitrators could use to define standards of medical treatment.
Under mandatory nationwide arbitration, patients and physicians would get more consistent, more expert, more reasonable and more timely decisions. This would not only be good for health care, but also the money Americans save from reduced health care bills could be used to benefit the economy.

HEADLINE: Profession of Rabbi Still Doesn't Lure Cream of the Candidates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was gratifying to read your upbeat article "More and More Young Jews Are Picking Careers as Rabbis" (front page, May 24). The phenomenon of many young people who have numerous career options selecting the rabbinate fills us with hope. 
 We have come a long way since the days when Jewish "ministers" (properly ordained rabbis settled in the New World only after 1840) were paid in firewood or tobacco. The various rabbinical organizations can take much credit for raising the prestige of the rabbinical profession, improving salaries and assuring medical and health benefits and pensions.
But that is only one side of the story. While some entry salaries are competitive with other professions, ultimate expectations cannot match incomes earned in medicine, law or business. Only a handful of rabbis approach the $200,000 salary package you mention, and most rabbis are hard pressed to make ends meet, educate children in yeshivas and universities, and enjoy a modicum of pleasure.
Moreover, job satisfaction is notoriously low in the clergy in general as the demands are great, with rabbis on call 24 hours daily, seven days a week. Stress takes a heavy toll of rabbis and their families, and many abandon their chosen profession.
The current recession has had a deleterious impact as well. We see more and more rabbis in economic difficulty because congregations are pinched and as a result are curtailing services and even closing their doors or merging with other synagogues. We at the New York Board of Rabbis are receiving 10 times as many calls as in the past from colleagues seeking help in finding positions or part-time chaplaincies to supplement inadequate incomes. Clearly, the American rabbinate is a more secure and stable profession than before. But it still has a long way to go to attract the cream of our men and women.
 
(Rabbi) MYRON M. FENSTER, (Rabbi) GILBERT S. ROSENTHAL
New York, May 28, 1991
 
The writers are, respectively, president and executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis.

HEADLINE: We're All Better Off for Reagan's Tax Reforms

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Richer Rich, Poorer Poor and a Fatter Green Book" (The Week in Review, May 26) reports on statistics compiled by the House Ways and Means Committee that show the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer since 1977. The Republican complaints that the numbers distort reality may be right to a small degree, in that the numbers magnify reality. But the phenomenon is exactly what one should have expected from the Reagan tax reforms. It is a good thing, too, for the most part. 
 Marginal tax rates that had been threatening confiscation of higher incomes have been sharply reduced. Incentives to earn and report higher incomes were sharply increased, with the result that the higher incomes shouldered a bigger tax burden.
The poor haven't really become poorer. A 20-year-old with a job in 1981 is now 30 years old and much better off. The numbers indicate that a working 20-year-old today is in about the same position as a working 20-year-old a decade ago. Of course, there are now 17 million more jobs, and working 20-year-olds are much, much better off than jobless 20-year-olds a decade ago. The economy is one-third bigger now because of the Reagan reforms, and everyone is better off than if the economy were one-third smaller.
One should not expect a dynamic system of entrepreneurial capitalism to produce income equality. A tax system designed to maximize economic growth will distribute rewards according to experience, effort and risk taking.
The one problem resulting from the Reagan tax reforms is that real per capita incomes have lagged in the lower income classes during the last decade because the reforms favored labor over capital. That is, in the last decade, labor income-tax rates were cut and labor incomes protected against inflation by indexation. This is why so many jobs were created. Taxes on capital formation increased in 1987, though, as the capital gains tax was raised to 28 percent from 20 percent. Also, investment income has not been protected against inflation.
If capital growth had kept pace with labor growth, real incomes would have risen in the lower income classes. The quickest way to increase the real incomes of the lower income classes would be to eliminate the tax on capital gains, which would encourage capital formation faster than new jobs are supplied.
Republicans cannot argue that the rich now pay more taxes than they did in 1980 and at the same time complain when Democrats point out that the incomes of the rich have risen faster than the poor. Likewise, Democrats can't continue to deny that the higher incomes of the rich mean the rich are carrying a larger tax burden.

Business Helps Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 22 front-page article on educators' complaints that business tax breaks are hurting schools distorts the contributions corporate taxes make to state and local government activities, including education. 
 Corporate taxes have increased dramatically in the last decade. Total corporate taxes rose 60 percent while profits rose 19 percent. For example, business taxes increased in New York State by $1.4 billion, or 76 percent, and in the State of Washington by $632 million, or 169 percent.
Property tax abatements are an effective incentive offered by states and communities to encourage business development and expansion. New business in a community brings added corporate income taxes and new jobs, which add to individual income tax, sales and property tax receipts. A growing business base increases the value of real estate and brings in new support services, further adding to tax revenues.
Communities without a growing business segment face stagnation, a lack of jobs for their citizens and a contracting tax base. One result is a declining school system, and everyone loses.

HEADLINE: Street Scene in Prague: Drugs and Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The New Prague Spring" (Editorial Notebook, May 13), Jack Rosenthal describes scenes in Prague and Bratislava, an area to which I have traveled recently, focusing on the economic optimism of Czechoslovaks since the fall of the Communists in 1989. He mentions that a darker side of capitalism has also evolved, and that crime and pornography have increased in Czechoslovakia. The rising crime rate can be partly attributed to increasing drug consumption and addiction. The latest entrepreneurs are the drug dealers. 
 The relaxation of travel restrictions since the Soviet departure from Eastern Europe has allowed Latin American drug dealers to operate freely. They have arrived without difficulty in President Vaclav Havel's free and democratic state, where they have found a new market to conquer and exploit.
The dealers do not face much difficulty smuggling the drugs into Czechoslovakia or finding buyers for their goods. The growing drug trade is extremely profitable for the dealers, but their wealth cannot be exported since the Czechoslovak crown is not convertible and is almost worthless outside the country. Thus the only difficulty faced by the dealers is changing their millions of crowns to hard currency.
A street scene in Prague: A young couple waits outside a currency exchange office. A tourist is about to enter the office when the couple offers the traveler a more favorable rate of exchange for hard currency. The tourist finds the exchange rate offered by the couple more favorable than the official rate.
Drug dealers exchange currency throughout Eastern Europe in this manner. By offering a slightly higher exchange rate to tourists, they can readily exchange crowns, Polish zlotys or Russian rubles for hard currency. Their operatives are often attractive women or young people who need money for one heartbreaking reason or another. Many visitors unwittingly assist the drug traders by exchanging their hard currency for the Eastern European currencies.
Everyone is pleased: the tourist gets more crowns to the dollar; the addict gets drugs; the dealer changes crowns to hard currency, and Eastern Europe's drug trade continues to thrive.

President Is Quitting At Santa Fe Railway

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Two years after his promotion to president and chief operating officer of the railway unit of the Sante Fe Pacific Corporation, Michael R. Haverty said yesterday that he planned to resign and "pursue new challenges."
Santa Fe's corporate staff of more than 400 was reduced to fewer than 100 late last year after the company transferred ownership of its real estate and energy operations to shareholders, with railroad staff taking over most functions. 
 Burton M. Strauss Jr., railroad analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said Mr. Haverty's decision resulted from that change and not from any clash with Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chairman and chief executive.
"They have gone from a major conglomerate to a railroad company with a minerals division that they expect to spin off," Mr. Strauss said.
In a statement, Mr. Haverty, 46 years old, cited an "increasing amount of overlap" between his work and that of Mr. Krebs, 49. The company said Mr. Krebs, who in a statement complimented Mr. Haverty's work, would add the duties of the railroad president to his current job.
Born in Atchison, Kan., Mr. Haverty climbed the executive ladder at Santa Fe first as a trainmaster in Santa Barbara, Calif., and then in bigger jobs in Emporia, Kan., Temple, Tex., and Chicago. He obtained an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1981. His total earnings last year exceeded $500,000.
Mr. Haverty completed a 20 percent cut in the railroad's employees to 14,300 at the end of March, from 17,800 a year earlier, enabling the company to pare expenses further than the recession crimped revenue.
Santa Fe Pacific, based in Chicago, spun off its energy unit, Santa Fe Energy Resources, and its real estate operation, Catellus Development Corporation, to its stockholders last Dec. 4. In addition to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, which has 11,266 miles of track spanning 13 states in the West and Midwest, the parent company owns two pipelines operating in the same regions and a minerals company.

HEADLINE: Curtis Brewer, 65, Lawyer Known For Work on Rights of the Disabled

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Curtis Brewer, a lawyer who was a quadriplegic for much of his life and who founded Untapped Resources, a nonprofit legal-services agency for the handicapped, died yesterday at Tisch Hospital in the New York University Medical Center. He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.
Mr. Brewer was stricken with a viral infection of the spine in 1955, when he was 30 years old, and was left paralyzed from the neck down. He died of complications from stomach surgery necessitated by a progressive weakening of his lungs that stemmed from the initial paralysis, his family said. 
 From his wheelchair Mr. Brewer fought for the rights of handicapped people. In 1964, he started Untapped Resources, for which he served as executive director and general counsel, to study the effects of social and economic conditions on the disabled.
Discovering that many of the disabled were unaware of their rights or prevented by bureaucratic red tape and other barriers from receiving services and benefits to which they were entitled, he set out to help them through legal action.
He graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1974 with a grade-point average of 3.5 and was admitted to the New York State bar without an examination, which would have been difficult for him to take because of his disability.
He was an early campaigner for easier access for the handicapped. Unable to get his wheelchair into Carnegie Hall some years ago to attend a performance by his friend Itzhak Perlman, the violinist, who himself uses crutches, Mr. Brewer began a campaign to secure wheelchair access to public auditoriums. A lift was subsequently installed on the Seventh Avenue side of Carnegie Hall, and when it was remodeled in the mid-1980's, elevators were put in for the first time.
He is survived by his wife, the former Bettie Foster, a New York University administrator; a son, Scott, of Washington, a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court; two daughters from a previous marriage, Zakia Al-Ghuiyy, director of a geriatric treatment center in Atlanta, and Geraldine Hailstolk, a family therapist in Maryland; two brothers, Garland, of Medford, Mass., and Raymond, of Boston; a sister, Jean, of Roxbury, Mass., and four granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Taxpayer Ire Not Evident in New Jersey's Primary

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVANSpecial to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 5

 BODY:
New Jersey's two major parties got through Tuesday's primary elections without rebuke from an angry electorate that many political leaders had feared was bent on making changes.
 Only two incumbent legislators, both Democrats, were denied nominations for new terms. But the losses by Senator Thomas H. Paterniti of Edison and Assemblyman George J. Otlowski of Perth Amboy were ascribed to local issues and not to broad voter unrest over taxes. 
Party leaders today were already turning their attention toward the November election, with Republican leaders saying they intended to make it a referendum on Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax program.
 
Incompetence vs. Credibility
 Jeffrey T. Michaels, executive director of the Republican State Committee, said, "Voters will have an opportunity to pass judgment on the incompetence of the Florio Democrats and the largest tax increase in the history of New Jersey."
 But Steve DeMicco, executive director of the State Democratic Committee, said his party was not afraid to talk about taxes, especially property taxes, which the increased state revenue is intended to hold in check while increasing aid to local school districts.
 "The issue in November will be credibility," Mr. DeMicco said. "And that goes to whether the voters really believe Republicans will repeal the tax program in the middle of a national recession."
 Senator Paterniti and Assemblyman Otlowski ran into political problems because of their service as mayors, not as members of the Legislature. Mr. Paterniti stepped down this year after a year as mayor of Edison Township, during which he proposed raising local property taxes to resolve a long-standing budget problem. His spot on the ballot as a Senate candidate was won by Harry S. Pozycki, a Metuchen lawyer and former municipal official.
 
8 Incumbents Retire
 Mr. Otlowski, an Assemblyman for 18 years, was mayor of Perth Amboy from 1976 until last year, when he resigned in the face of a petition drive aimed at recalling him from office. Opposition to Mr. Otlowski by the city's growing Hispanic population prompted Democratic Party leaders to ask him not to run again for the Assembly, and then to deny him the party line on the ballot in Tuesday's election when he refused to step aside.
 Jay Zisnewski of Perth Amboy, a lawyer and political newcomer, won the Assembly nomination with party backing.
 The Democratic Party will also lose eight incumbents -- four Senators and four Assembly members -- to retirement. They decided not to run for re-election after the recent realignment of election districts in the wake of the 1990 census.
 Only one Republican member of the Assembly decided against seeking a new term. Another was denied party support and is running for the Senate as an independent in November.
 A handful of other incumbents survived strong challenges in Tuesday's election. In Mercer County, two Democratic Assemblymen, Gerard S. Naples and John S. Watson, won nominations over the strong opposition of G. Dallas Dixon of Trenton, a former Mercer County Democratic chairman, who criticized the incumbents for their support of Mr. Florio's tax program.
 In one of the most closely watched contests, William L. Gormley, a Republican Senator from Margate, won a new nomination against a strong challenge by Domenic F. Cappella, the Ventnor City Administrator, by capturing 56 percent of the vote.
 Mr. Gormley, a moderate and the only Republican Senator to support Mr. Florio's bill banning assault rifles, became the target of conservative Republicans who helped finance his opponent's campaign.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Better Feeling On Trade Talks

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE tension between the United States and the European Community over trade, especially in agriculture, was eased by this week's meeting in Paris of financial and trade officials of the wealthy countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But a lot of tough bargaining is ahead if the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is to be brought to a successful conclusion.
Interviewed by telephone at the end of the Paris talks, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said, "The outcome was positive, the atmospherics were better -- there was a much better feeling in the air." Indeed, the meeting's communique declared, "The Uruguay Round has the highest priority on the international economic agenda." It said success in the talks, which started in 1986 in Uruguay, remained crucial to continued growth of the world economy, and it called for "a substantial and comprehensive conclusion as early as possible, preferably before the end of the year." 
 To achieve that goal, the ministers recognized that "political decisions to overcome major existing differences are needed by all participants without delay." A key player in that political process will be France's new Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, who is regarded as even tougher on trade issues than her predecessor, Michel Rocard. Mrs. Hills, for example, said Mrs. Cresson was "more protectionist" than her predecessor and said it was "very difficult" to guess how flexible she would be in trying to avert a failure of the Uruguay Round.
The United States is not weakening its own drive for opening up trade in agriculture. It is striving to get rid of export subsidies, barriers to farm imports and internal subsidies linked to trade protection. The Europeans, for their part, say the United States has a good way to go in getting rid of its own barriers.
Little or no progress has been made on agricultural reform. The Paris communique noted that agriculture supports had increased in 1990, after declining in 1988 and 1989, and cost taxpayers $300 billion last year.
"Unless policies are improved," the ministers said, "the budgetary and economic costs, as well as trade tensions, are likely to rise and the economic progress of countries dependent on agricultural exports are likely to be seriously affected, including developing countries."
Such language is encouraging. But more than recognition of the problem is needed, Mrs. Hills said. "You need an action plan," she said. "And the bad news is that quota restrictions remain in some areas, and agriculture is still a fortress." She also stressed the importance of opening world trade in services, manufacturing, intellectual property and investment. The total volume of world trade, she said, is now $4 trillion, of which only about two-thirds is open.
She expects a "bumpy road," a "sawtooth pattern," "two steps forward, one backward." Her overall assessment of the talks in Paris was: "We made constructive progress, and have a lot more work to do. It's important for countries to translate their very good words into action."
The other big issue in Paris was how to deal with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pitch for much greater economic aid from the West. The general view of the Western ministers was that until Mr. Gorbachev and his aides fixed on a single plan for rebuilding the Soviet economy, there would be no aid package.
One American official, speaking off the record, said: "There is not enough money in the West to finance a non-plan. Until they decide what they are doing, it would be pouring money down the proverbial rat hole."
Countries differ on the aid issue, depending, as one minister put it, "on their proximity to the Soviet Union." Thus, the United States is less willing than Germany to work on an aid package. With the United States deep in deficit and Germany preoccupied with the big bills related to unification, talk of negotiating an aid package for the Soviet Union looks premature.
The meeting of ministers in Paris reaffirmed their view that "fundamental reform" was the only answer to the structural problems of the Soviet economy, and urged the Soviet Union and its republics to introduce the "broad range of macro and microeconomic reforms necessary to move to a market economy."
In friendly fashin, they told Mr. Gorbachev that "policy dialogue, technical assistance and humanitarian aid can support Soviet reform," and that "whenever appropriate, existing multilateral institutions should be used to channel assistance" to the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gorbachev does not need to attend the London meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations next month to hear that. Nevertheless, it appears that he will be invited and will go, for whatever good the West can do him as he struggles to save his sinking economy.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Asks Talks on Atom Spread

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan, June 6

 BODY:
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, intent on asserting civilian government control over strategic policies in a country long dominated by the military, asked the United States, the Soviet Union and China today to sponsor urgent talks on nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, where both Pakistan and India have the ability to make nuclear weapons.
Speaking to high-ranking military officers at Pakistan's National Defense College in Rawalpindi, Mr. Sharif, who has been in power for barely eight months, said a regional conference on nuclear weapons should be held "as quickly as possible." 
 A team of Pakistani Foreign Ministry officials will be in Washington next week to discuss this and other issues with the Bush Administration and members of Congress. Mr. Sharif said the team would not be begging for American aid.
Fears about Pakistan's nuclear program have led Washington to ban all military aid to Islamabad and new economic aid. India, which set off a nuclear explosion in 1974 and has never agreed to inspections, has escaped United States sanctions, to the distress of Pakistanis, who believe that they are being victimized unfairly.
 
India's Program Cited

"The fact is that India exploded a nuclear device in 1974," Mr. Sharif said in his speech. "It has a number of nuclear enrichment and reprocessing facilties outside the framework of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. It is also reported to have unsafeguarded plutonium sufficient for producing over 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs. We cannot, therefore, ignore India's fast growing nuclear program and jeopardize our national security."
In a breakfast meeting with three American reporters in Lahore today, Mr. Sharif left the impression that he had been prepared nonetheless to agree to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards without waiting for India, but that "pressures at home" were one reason that this step could not be taken.
Officials and diplomats interpreted this as a veto by the military, which controls Pakistan's nuclear program. But Mr. Sharif asserted that he made the decisions.
"It is the Government of Pakistan and its Foreign Ministry that make policies," Mr. Sharif said when asked about differences of opinion between civilian and military power centers. "The army follows."
"In two or three months you will not ask these questions, I hope," he added. He described the choice of today's venue for his nuclear policy speech as "very significant."
Pakistan is awash in rumors about military opposition to Mr. Sharif. He and the army Chief of Staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, first clashed over Pakistani policy during the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Sharif broadly backed Saudi Arabia and the United States, and General Beg talked about "strategic defiance" and an independent policy line.
 
New Inquiry Into Zia's Death
 Recently, Mr. Sharif ordered a new investigation into the mysterious crash that killed President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in August 1988. The military investigation, he told reporters today, "was not getting anywhere."
Last week, when an army ammunition depot blew up in Nowshera, in the North West Frontier Province, Mr. Sharif publicly chided the military for having learned nothing from an earlier, more destructive blast near Rawalpindi four years ago.
Today, Mr. Sharif praised General Beg for his part in insuring a peaceful and democratic change in government after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed the Government of Benazir Bhutto in August 1990, but he went on to say that the army chief would step down when his term ends in two months.
Since 1974, Pakistan has made a number of proposals on limiting nuclear development in this region. The Islamabad Government is on record as saying it would agree to safeguards and sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty if and when India did. But India has always insisted that it would not join such international agreements until they were signed by all nuclear nations. India fears the nuclear intentions of China, which has not signed, just as Pakistan fears those of India.

Silver Hits an 8-Month High On Hope of Strong Demand

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver soared to an eight-month high yesterday amid speculative buying prompted in part by an industry report that demand for the metal was exceeding production.
Gold futures also rose and oil futures were mixed. 
 Silver futures settled 24.7 cents to 26.9 cents higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in June at $4.414 an ounce, the highest daily settlement for a near-term silver contract since Oct. 9.
Silver's surge followed a leap of more than 12 cents on May 28. Some analysts said the moves confirmed the market's recovery from the 17-year low of $3.505 an ounce reached in February.
"The recent lows below $3.60 will prove to be the bottom for quite a long period of time," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch Futures.
But he would not rule out a retreat to $4, the price around which silver had hovered for three months.
 
Demand Exceeding Supply
 Speculative interest in silver has been gradually building, a reflection of rising hopes for an economic recovery. The catalyst for yesterday's move may have been the Silver Institute's 1991 survey, which said industrial demand exceeded silver production last year for the first time since 1978.
The report, released Wednesday, projected that 1991 demand would exceed new supplies by 32 million ounces.
"Certainly, the Silver Institute figures were a constructive influence," said Stephen Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. But Mr. Platt and Mr. O'Neill said the rally was already in the making before the report came out.
Oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange but gasoline staged a modest afternoon rally on perceptions of strong summer demand.
Light sweet crude oil was 4 cents to 16 cents lower, with July at $20.33 a barrel; heating oil was 0.08 cent to 0.57 cent lower, with July at 54.2 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.06 cent to 0.32 cent higher, with July at 64.44 cents a gallon, and natural gas was 0.8 cent to 3.4 cents lower, with July at $1.297 for 1,000 cubic feet.

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher After Jobless-Claims Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher in quiet trading yesterday, helped by an improvement in United States unemployment.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $365.10 an ounce, up $2.50 from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $2.05 an ounce, to a late bid of $364.25. 
 Analysts said the dollar advanced following a Labor Department report that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell for the third straight week in May, the first such streak in more than a year.
The decline suggested the recession might be ending and gave traders reason to believe the Government's jobless report for the full month of May, due today, might be better than expected.
"The consensus is for the best number of the year," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the financial advisory firm IDEA, referring to the non-farm payroll component of the report.
Economists expect non-farm payrolls to post a decline of about 70,000, the smallest so far this year, which could push the dollar higher.
The dollar held to a relatively narrow trading range throughout the session. But Mr. Chandler noted thatthe United States currency hit a high for the year against the Swiss franc, a move some traders view as a precursor to a similar advance against the German mark in the coming days.
 
Dollar Up in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 139.25 Japanese yen, from 139.17 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it fell to 139.15 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 139.28 yen, down from 139.30 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6865, from $1.6945 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6870 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.6935.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7535 German marks, up from 1.7490; 1.5040 Swiss francs, up from 1.4960; 5.9400 French francs, up from 5.9220; 1,299.75 Italian lire, up from 1,294.50, and 1.1465 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1456.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $364.25 a troy ounce, up from $362.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $364, up from $362. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 95 cents, to $362.89.

HEADLINE: Plan for Boat People Cheers Hong Kong

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 6

 BODY:
When the boat people from Vietnam started pouring in again in recent months, the prospects for resolving a problem that had haunted this territory for years seemed grim. But a more accommodating attitude by the United States has now given Hong Kong hope that it will not always be burdened by unwanted refugees.
The United States Government agreed on Wednesday to back the "non-voluntary" return of boat people to special camps in Vietnam, as long as the camps were managed by an international organization like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That was a breakthrough because the United States has always opposed forcible repatriation of the boat people. 
 Partly because of the United States view, Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong normally have not been sent back to Vietnam against their will. The number of refugees is rising daily, and many have no realistic hope of resettlement in the West. Many people in Hong Kong favor forcing the boat people to go home just as illegal immigrants in China are forced to go back.
American officials still say the proposal does not violate their position, mainly because they contend the centers in Vietnam, as envisioned, would be distinct from the Vietnam Government. Nonetheless, the new backing could mean that Hong Kong's more than 50,000 asylum seekers, who are unlikely to be given refugee status, could be returned to Vietnam.
 
'A Positive Step'

"We welcome this as a positive step toward resolving this very difficult problem we've faced for 16 years," said Clinton E. Leeks, refugee coordinator for the Hong Kong government. "It's not a solution in itself, but it is a step toward achieving one."
The proposal, jointly sponsored by the United States, Britain and Hong Kong, must be presented to the Vietnam Government, and it is not clear what the reaction will be. Vietnam has consistently maintained that it will not accept Vietnamese people who are returned against their will. But it has also hinted it might be responsive to the idea of being host to internationally run camps, a refugee official said.
So far this year, 9,345 Vietnamese have sailed illegally into Hong Kong, nearly a third more than the number that arrived in all of last year. In May, 5,116 Vietnamese escaped to Hong Kong, and so far 748 new asylum seekers have arrived in June. At that rate, this year may see more than 20,000 Vietnamese fleeing to Hong Kong.
All asylum seekers arriving here are taken to camps where they are interviewed and screened for refugee status. The process is long, and in the meantime the Hong Kong government spends millions of dollars housing, feeding and caring for them. More than 58,000 Vietnamese -- fewer than 7,000 of whom have been accepted as legitimate political refugees -- now live in crowded, makeshift, often squalid camps.
 
Extent of Force Is Unclear
 But the majority of escapees from Vietnam appear not to be eluding persecution, but simply to be searching for a better life, say refugee officials from Hong Kong and the United States. But they have refused to go back under the existing voluntary repatriation scheme, and that suggests they will resist the new proposal.
"Why would they go back to a holding center in Vietnam instead of being detained in Hong Kong?" Kingsley H. Y. Sit, a Hong Kong legislator, said.
Officials always speak of "voluntary" or "non-voluntary" repatriation, and it is unclear to what extent force will now be used. One official said it remained to be discussed whether the Vietnamese people would be dragged onto planes or boats to go home.
One reason for the inflow cited by refugee officials is a proposal by Representative Robert K. Dornan, a California Republican. He suggested in a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in mid-March that Vietnamese refugees be resettled in Kuwait to help rebuild the country.
Although American officials immediately rejected the suggestion, Mr. Dornan's plan was carried over Vietnamese-language Voice of America, and the prospects of being resettled in Kuwait spread like fire through Vietnam.

Prices Fall on Strong Jobs Report

DATELINE: KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell again yesterday and interest rates moved higher as dealers sold notes and bonds after a report from the Labor Department suggested that May employment data scheduled to be released today might be stronger than had been anticipated.
Figures from the Labor Department showed that initial unemployment claims in the week that ended May 25 fell by 6,000, to 439,000, from the previous week's mark of 445,000. It was the third straight weekly decline. Most economists had expected the number to be unchanged. 
 But the big surprise to bond traders was the very large declines in the number of people the Labor Department said were receiving unemployment benefits.
The drop "makes some economists believe that the employment numbers will show strength rather than weakness," one government bond trader said. Strong employment figures are an indication that the economy might be regaining vigor, raising the prospects for inflation. Higher inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, prompting bondholders to sell.
 
Weakness Still Seen
 Nevertheless, most Wall Street economists were forecasting that today's labor report would show that conditions deteriorated further in May, with non-farm payroll employment declining by anywhere from 75,000 to 100,000 jobs and the unemployment rate rising to 6.8 percent from the 6.6 percent rate recorded for April.
Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montague Economics, pointed out that the claims data released yesterday were for a period after that covered by today's Labor Department's employment survey, which generally takes place during the first two weeks of each month.
Still, yesterday's report "has to change the confidence you may have had in your forecast," he said.
In addition to the initial claims figures, reports yesterday that sales were strong last month at major retail department store chains reinforced growing concern among credit market participants that economic recovery was coming sooner and would be more vigorous than had been expected.
"The bond market won't improve until it sees how weak the recovery really is," Mr. Fabbri said. "It will take a few months of data at least showing that the recovery is weak and inflation is not going to shoot up before long-term interest rates can improve. But I believe that is going to happen."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 25/32 late yesterday, down 11/32, to yield 8.42 percent, up from 8.38 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 17/32, down 9/32, to yield 8.21 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, down 3/32, to yield 6.85 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.54 percent late yesterday, down a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.69 percent.
 
Slow Trading in Corporates
 In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants said that prices of most issues dipped by about 1/8 point in lethargic trading.
Activity was equally slow in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds. Prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 1/2 point, dealers said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended May 27.
The declines were in line with expectations, and the report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Hanging On in Textile Country

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDEN, N.C., May 31

 BODY:
Economists and free trade proponents have generally assumed that when a domestic industry shrinks, workers will do what they must to survive: pack up and seek suitable work elsewhere in a process akin to natural selection in the capitalist system.
Here in Eden, where a local blanket factory is struggling to compete with less expensive imports in a slumping economy, the mill, owned by Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., has repeatedly furloughed John M. Biggs and given only four hours of work over the last five weeks to his wife, Alma Jean. But the Biggses are not budging. 
 In fact, they're digging in. They have planted an extra row of corn, an extra row of beets and three extra rows of beans in their garden this spring to save money at the grocery store. The vegetable garden is one way the Biggses hope to avoid having to leave this small town in northwestern North Carolina near the Virginia border, where they and three of their parents have lived their entire lives.
The Bush Administration's campaign to loosen trade restrictions on a range of services and products from investment banking to blankets threatens to open American borders to a flood of imports from low-cost foreign manufacturers. That means that the Biggses may lose their livelihood. Congress has cleared the way for the Administration to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and to try to finish an international round of trade talks that is likely to accelerate sharply the growth of textile imports.
The effort to lower or eliminate tariffs and other import restrictions is designed to spur exports in the United States and elsewhere. But that could lead to job losses here and in other factory towns. That has happened before. Yet the uncertainty in Eden is the latest example of the human toll of free trade.
Thousands of workers lost their jobs in the steel towns of Ohio and Pennsylvania in the 80's, as well as the auto and factory cities of the Midwest. Many swarmed to the Sun Belt a decade ago when the Texas oil boom offered jobs and a fresh start.
But thousands of others were left behind because they did not want to pack up and move. When the consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment and textile industries moved from the Midwest, New York and New England to the South in the 1950's and 1960's, many families left behind in small, dying towns could not afford to move to more prosperous places, said Robert B. Reich, a professor of political economy at Harvard University.
"Moving from a high-unemployment area to a low-unemployment area, selling an old home and buying a new one has plagued relocations for generations as the American economy has undergone changes," Mr. Reich said.
To economists, further growth in textile and apparel imports -- and the corresponding loss of jobs -- may be good. By some estimates, import restrictions force the average American household to spend as much as $200 extra each year for clothing and textile products like rugs and blankets.
"It's a real question -- should consumers be subsidizing someone's unwillingness to move?" asked Alfred J. Field, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
 
A Mobile Society
 The South, and North Carolina especially, is often heralded as a mobile work environment where workers can easily move to jobs in urban areas and still maintain their way of life in country towns not far away.
Commuting might be difficult for the Biggses because 12-hour shifts are common in the textile and apparel industries during seasonal surges in demand. The Biggses are concerned that they may be forced to leave Eden, population 15,000, to seek new jobs in Greensboro, a city of 184,000 an hour's drive to the south.
Mrs. Biggs is alarmed at the prospect of leaving her home. She has taken only two trips in her life: to Florida 25 years ago and to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville a few years ago.
"I don't really care for driving in heavy traffic," she said. "And if you talk about moving to a big city, you've got drugs -- not to say we've not got drugs here -- and you've got crime."
Moving to Greensboro would also mean a substantial financial setback for the Biggs family, which paid $38,000 last year for a four-bedroom house with a large lawn. The price was a bargain, Mrs. Biggs explained, because it also included living room furniture, a refrigerator, a stove, a microwave oven and even a full set of china.
 
Housing Market Slumps
 Mrs. Biggs said that with young people leaving Eden for jobs elsewhere and with few people moving into town, the family's current home might not be salable. The median price of a home in Greensboro is $78,500, twice as much as in Eden, according to the Census Bureau. The median rent in Greensboro is $358; $229 in Eden.
Outside the textile industry, jobs are few and far between in Eden. A local brewery has halved its employment. The furniture factories in nearby towns pay a little more than half the $8.07 hourly wage that Mrs. Biggs now earns. One of the last family restaurants on the back roads of Eden had a fire late last year and has not reopened. That leaves minimum-wage jobs mostly in the fast-food franchise restaurants that line the four-lane highway that has increasingly become Eden's Main Street.
Sometimes communities can create new jobs by persuading new industries to set up local factories that require similar skills to the dying textile and apparel plants, said Carol A. Conway, the deputy director of the Southern Growth Policies Board, based in Durham, N.C., a joint research program supported by state governments in the Southeast.
Yet many employers in North Carolina, including in Eden, have been hostile to high-paying industries that may hire away the low-wage labor they need to remain competitive, said William P. Meade, a consultant in Chapel Hill who advises companies that are expanding existing operations in North Carolina.
 
Automation Not Enough
 The automation of textile and apparel factories is eliminating many jobs but it may still not be enough to counter the advantage of foreign countries paying workers as little as a dollar a day. The blanket mill that employs Mr. and Mrs. Biggs and both her parents was built a decade ago to replace a mill next door that used obsolete equipment and employed twice as many people. The mill declined to comment for this article.
The fairly automated textile industry, which relies extensively on American-made synthetic fibers, is so nearly competitive in world markets that the United States trade deficit in textiles has narrowed in the last several years as the dollar has weakened, making American exports cheaper overseas.
Economists say the apparel industry has a so-called absolute disadvantage because it has higher costs than its foreign competitors. This need not prevent an industry from thriving. But the true cost of producing textiles and apparel is measured by economists in terms of what could have been produced by the same workers and other resources if they were used in other industries. The forgone production is greater in the United States than in other countries.
"In a less extreme form, it's like trying to grow coffee in the United States -- it can be done, but it's difficult," said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 
What Children Plan
 What remains unclear is whether Mrs. Biggs's children will avoid their parents' predicament. Laura Biggs, 23, took a six-week medical training course after her graduation from high school. She now lives at home and works as a nurse's assistant at a local nursing home.
Jeffrey L. Biggs, 16, just finished the 10th grade. His favorite subject was industrial shop. Asked what he wanted to do after graduation from high school, he replied, "Maybe custom-paint cars."
When prodded by his mother, Jeffrey allowed unenthusiastically that he might go to college for two years.
Finding work outside Eden is an unattractive but likely step, he added. But any job will have to be within an hour's or an hour and a half's drive of Eden, he said, adding, "I'd like to live somewhere I don't have to plan trips home."

HEADLINE: Businesses Plan a Slim 3% Rise in Spending

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Businesses in the United States plan to increase their investment spending by just 3 percent this year, the smallest rise in five years, the Government reported today.
Analysts said the recession, in trimming consumer demand, had reduced available cash as well as any immediate need for new plants and equipment. 
 The Commerce Department said that a survey conducted in April and May found businesses planning to spend $540.1 billion for expansion and modernization, up from a record $524.2 billion in 1990.
Many analysts had expected capital spending to slow this year because of the recession.
The Commerce Department said its survey showed that capital spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter after increasing six-tenths of 1 percent in the previous three months. It is expected to rise 1.7 percent in the second quarter, 1.8 percent in the third and five-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth.
As the effects of the recession fade, plant and equipment spending "will show pretty good growth in 1992," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting organization.
Still, any increase this year would help stimulate the economy. In addition, spending to replace aging plants and equipment and expand operations helps to increase productivity, an important factor in view of increasingly strong competition from abroad. Productivity is defined as output per hours worked.
Productivity is also considered vital to improving the nation's standard of living without increasing inflation. Productivity rose just three-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1991, well below the average growth of 1.6 percent a year between 1982 and 1989.
Capital investment has risen during each of the last four years, although growth slowed to just 4.5 percent in 1990 as the economy began its downturn.
Spending had surged by 10.4 percent in 1989 and 9.5 percent in 1988 after rebounding by 3.1 percent in 1987 from a decline of 4.1 percent in 1986.
Before adjusting for inflation, the survey projected a 2.7 percent rise in business investment, to $547.2 billion, after gains of 5 percent in 1990 and 11.4 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Britain Is Proposing to Invite Gorbachev to London Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 6

 BODY:
British officials proposed today that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, be invited to London next month to meet with the leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies, immediately after their mid-summer economic summit.
As the host of the summit, the British Prime Minister, John Major, sent a letter to other members of the Group of Seven nations, asking for their permission to invite Mr. Gorbachev, who has been pressing to come to London to plead for more Western economic support for his domestic reform package. 
 But in Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, jumped the gun, telling a session of the German Parliament that Mr. Gorbachev would be in London to meet with Western leaders.
"I welcome the fact that Gorbachev will attend the world economic summit," Mr. Kohl said. German officials later acknowledged that an official invitation had not yet been sent to the Soviet leader, but said they expected one within the next day or two.
Mr. Kohl has been urging that Mr. Gorbachev be invited to London during the Group of Seven meeting, although he said he was not asking that the Soviet leader take part in the summit meeting itself.
 
Not to Be Part of Summit
 That was also the basis for Mr. Major's proposal today. "We will be asking Mr. Gorbachev to come immediately after the summit, and not during the summit itself," said a spokesman at 10 Downing Street. "It is not going to be the G8. It will still be the G7."
Britain will tender the official invitation on behalf of the Group of Seven, after it receives affirmative replies from the other nations.
The announcements in London and Bonn appeared to end nearly two weeks of hestitation and uncertainty about whether Mr. Gorbachev would get a chance to plead for Western help before the leaders of the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Canada and Japan, when they meet in London from July 15 to 17.
Pressure to invite Mr. Gorbachev had come mainly from the Continent, where France, Germany and Italy have made insistent public appeals that he should be invited to London at the time of the conference, although not necessarily as a participant.
European officials said it was symbolically important that the West demonstrate support for Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to bring economic and democratic reform to the Soviet Union.
The United States and Britain have been more wary, in part out of concern that Western nations will be unable to come up with the huge amount of aid Mr. Gorbachev will need to bail out the battered Soviet economy.
 
Bush Softens Position
 But President Bush softened his position in recent days, and he told Mr. Major by telephone this week that the United States would not object if Mr. Gorbachev were invited to London.
On Wednesday, in Oslo, Mr. Gorbachev repeated his plea for Western help to keep his economic reforms alive, warning that unless perestrokia surives, the world will lose its best chance yet for peace.
British officials said the logistics of the meeting between the summit participants and Mr. Gorbachev were yet to be sorted out.
In his speech, Mr. Kohl expressed reservations about just how much the West could do for Mr. Gorbachev. "We are not in a position to finance a bottomless barrel," he said, adding that Moscow "needs help to help itself."
"The rebuilding of the Soviet Union must be decided there," he said.
 
Aid to Be Tied to Reforms
 In London, British officials said there was an emerging consensus among the Group of Seven that any significant financial aid should be granted in stages and tied to the Soviet Union's progress in adopting a market economy. The assistance should also be given to the private sector and not to the Soviet Government, they added.
"I don't think anyone has the desire to put money in on a state-to-state level, with the possibile exception of Germany," said a top aide to Mr. Major.
In Copenhagen today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d stepped up the Bush Administration's efforts to dampen Soviet expectations about how much economic aid they might get.
In particular, Mr. Baker for the first time publicly signaled that the United States would not support any of the current suggestions for a "grand bargain," under which the West would make a large, long-term commitment of financial aid to the Soviet Union in return for firm commitments from Moscow to move to a free-market democracy.
"The Soviets," Mr. Baker told his NATO allies, "must start with self-help. If they do, we will support them. Indeed, we are developing a package of supportive measures, which we hope we can coordinate with you and others. But I don't honestly think we can catalyze Soviet reform through a big bang approach. Our effort is more likely to be a step by step process -- certainly one with a grand goal -- but ever a realistic and workable approach."
The Japanese have taken one of the toughest positions among the Group of Seven toward the Soviets' appeals for aid, arguing like many in the United States and Britain that it would unwise to consider large-scale aid before Moscow has put basic reforms into place.
"Japan wants to see reform implemented, not a promise of reform," said an official with the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo. "There have been many promises in the past."
The Japanese have also been leery about the meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, although officials say they will go along with the consensus of the Group of Seven.
"We are afraid that Mr. Gorbachev will expect some kind of gift package when he comes to London, but this expectation will not be realized," the official said. "We're not shutting the door, but we're concerned about what he thinks he can get."
Japan's hard line toward the Soviet Union is a result in part of a territorial dispute over four groups of islands off the northern tip of Hokkaido, which the Soviets occupied in the waning days of World War II. Japan says the islands must be returned before it can consider boosting trade, investment or aid.

HEADLINE: Sales in May Up for Many Big Retailers

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Many of the nation's biggest retailers reported yesterday that sales in May had improved sharply from the same month a year earlier. While sales were helped by good weather, some analysts see the gains as another indication that the recession may be ending.
Thirteen of 20 top retail companies said that in the four weeks ended June 1, same-store sales -- results at stores that have been in business for at least a year -- rose. The more favorable weather helped sell summer clothes, air-conditioners and garden equipment. 
 Among the gainers were Wal-Mart Stores, with a same-store rise of 13 percent over the year before; the K Mart Corporation, which was up 8.5 percent, and the Limited, up 10 percent. The Gap, reported a 15 percent gain in same-store sales, and Charming Shoppes rose 30 percent.
 
Declines at Sears and Penney
 But Sears, Roebuck & Company and J. C. Penney reported lower sales for the second consecutive month, both in total and same-store sales. Sears said total sales at its merchandising group fell four-tenths of 1 percent, to $2.49 billion, and that same-store sales fell 1.3 percent. Total sales for 17 weeks were down 1.8 percent, to $10.1 billion. Penney said its overall sales dropped 1.2 percent, to $1.01 billion, while same-store sales fell 2.5 percent. Penney's four-month sales fell 3.1 percent, to $4.2 billion.
But over all, "sales were up very nicely in May," said Edward F. Johnson, director of the Johnson Redbook Service of Lynch, Jones & Ryan in New York. "Our computation for total sales is that the May average gain of reporting companies was up 14 percent against a year-to-date gain of 11.5 percent."
He said the same-store average in May was up 6.5 percent from the period a year earlier, against a yearlong gain of 2.8 percent. "It's obvious that while warmer weather helped, the consumer is feeling better about things, which may mean that the recession is waning."
 
Apparel Chains Up in Month
 As a group, the apparel shop chains showed the best total-sales results for the month. The Gap reported a 33 percent jump, to $165 million; the Limited was up 22 percent, to $440 million; Charming Shoppes, which operates Fashion Bug stores, had a 38 percent sales gain, to $94.2 million; Merry-Go-Round Stores was up 28 percent, to $50.1 million; Edison Brothers Stores, whose chains include Jeans West, had a 20.8 percent rise, to $101.2 million, and the Melville Corporation, which owns Marshall's and the Thom McAn shoe stores, had 19.7 percent higher sales, at $697.8 million.
"There are certainly some positive signs in the economy, but I would prefer to see at least two more months of good figures," said Jeffrey S. Stein, retail analyst at McDonald & Company Securities in Cleveland.
The big change in the ranks of the largest retailers continued in May for the fourth straight month, as Wal-Mart widened its lead over its two largest competitors, Sears and K Mart. Wal-Mart recorded a 38 percent rise in total May sales, to $3.5 billion, and 37 percent higher sales in the year to date, to $12.7 billion. K Mart also continued its recent thrust with a 12.5 percent gain in total sales in May, to $12.5 billion, and a 9.5 percent advance in year-to-date sales to $10.4 billion.
Sears's merchandising sales again fell under those of the other two companies by dollars. Nonetheless, Edward A. Brennan, the chairman of Sears, said that the company was encouraged by double-digit gains in apparel, home computers, air-conditioners and lawn mowers, although furniture and appliances were depressed.
Ann Taylor Stores, which reported its monthly results for the first time since it went public, said its May sales were 11.8 percent higher, at $37.3 million, but its same-store sales were down six-tenths of 1 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	By The Associated Press -- Following are the domestic sales for May and for the fiscal year to date reported yesterday by some of the nation's largest retailers. Some top retailers do not report their sales monthly, including R. H. Macy & Company and Montgomery Ward & Company. Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. suspended its monthly report after it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in February.
Wal-Mart Stores: For May, same-store sales up 13 percent; overall sales totaled $3.49 billion, up 38 percent. For first four months, same-store sales up 12 percent. Total sales were $12.77 billion, up 37 percent.
K Mart: For four weeks ended May 29, same- store sales rose 8.5 percent; overall sales totaled $2.74 billion, up 12.5 percent. For first four months, same-store sales rose 5.4 percent. Total sales were $10.38 billion, up 9.5 percent.
Dayton Hudson: For four weeks ended June 1, same-store sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent; overall sales totaled $1.06 billion, up 10.8 percent. For first four months, same-store sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent. Total sales were $4.35 billion, up 11.3 percent.
May Department Stores: For four weeks ended June 1, same-store sales rose 2.9 percent; overall sales totaled $802.8 million, up 11.5 percent. For first four months, same- store sales fell six-tenths of 1 percent; overall sales totaled $3.11 billion, up 7.7 percent.
Melville: For four weeks ended June 1, same- store sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent; overall sales totaled $697.9 million, up 19.7 percent. For first five months, same-store sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent; total sales were $3.59 billion, up 21.6 percent.
Woolworth: For four weeks ended June 1, same-store domestic sales rose seven- tenths of 1 percent; Overall domestic sales totaled $388 million, up 4.6 percent. Total sales, including foreign, totaled $691 million, up 3.1 percent. For first four months, same-store domestic sales fell 1.4 percent; overall domestic sales totaled $1.67 billion, up 3.1 percent. Total sales, including foreign, totaled $2.85 billion, up 2 percent.
Limited: For four weeks ended June 1, same- store sales rose 10 percent; overall sales totaled $439.8 million, up 22 percent. For first four months, same-store sales rose 3 percent; total sales were $1.72 billion, up 18 percent.
Gap: For four weeks ended June 1, same- store sales rose 15 percent; overall sales totaled $165 million, up 33 percent. For first four months, same-store sales rose 8 percent; total sales were totaled $655 million, up 25 percent.

HEADLINE: A Japanese-Style 'Old Boy' Network

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 6

 BODY:
When Japan's banks and securities houses began battling several years ago to break into each other's business, policy makers at the formidable Finance Ministry were deadlocked over what to do. It finally took an even greater power to break the stalemate: the "Old Boys."
Occasionally, an issue arises in this seemingly harmonious society that lifts the facade of orderliness and illuminates both the intensity of the business rivalries and the real lines of power for resolving disputes. The five-year tug-of-war over financial deregulation has done just that. 
 It is particularly interesting to observe this process at the Finance Ministry, which is widely seen as the most powerful arm of the Government. The ministry combines what in the United States would be all the bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Management and Budget and a few lesser agencies.
The Old Boys, who are widely referred to, even by themselves, by this English phrase and often in shorthand as "O.B.'s," are dozens of retired senior Finance Ministry officials who form a club-like elite. At the top of the heap are the former vice ministers, the highest career post. They might hold the job for only a year or two but then move on to lucrative jobs in industry and O.B. status, from which they continue to hold sway over policy and personnel moves at the ministry. (The finance minister's post is a political appointment and thus the former ministers generally do not continue to have as much say over financial policy.)
The momentous battle between the banks and securities houses over eliminating the barriers in Japan's version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the United States law that separates commercial banking from investment banking, is no ordinary struggle. Put simply, commercial banks want to get into the highly protected securities business, and the securities brokers want to keep them out.
The banks, which enjoy a decidedly higher status in Japan as the partners of industry, had prevailed initially by offering to build "firewalls" between their banking and securities operations to protect against conflicts of interest and other abuses.
At the ministry, the securities and banking bureaus usually reflect the thinking of the industries they regulate. The bureaus thus found themselves at odds over how to lower the barriers separating the businesses. So a small group of O.B's quietly decided how to break the impasse. There were no weekend hunting trips, no intensive lobbying efforts.
Instead, the Old Boys merely passed the word to the bureaucrats through advisory panels on which they sat that the securites industry should give up only a little to Japan's huge banking institutions.
The result: Perhaps in 1993, banks will get modest powers to engage in the securities business. Through separate subsidiaries they will be allowed to do bond underwriting. They will be shut out of the more lucrative equity underwriting and brokerage operations, however. The banks will be able to deal in some new kinds of securities and private placements, but they will have very limited ability to trade securities.
In return, securities houses will be permitted to trade foreign currencies and to engage in some kinds of trust banking.
"The banks were too optimistic; they thought it would go too easily," said Hiroshi Tanimura, 75 years old, a pleasant man who as an O.B. occupies a large corner office at the Finance Ministry.
"They thought they could build the firewalls rather easily," he added in an interview, breaking into one of his broad smiles. "But I thought that would be rather difficult."
Although he insisted that he had been essentially neutral, Mr. Tanimura did hint that it had been sort of fun taking the banks down a few pegs.
"The banks were in a sort of go-go mood," he explained. "They don't need a strong cheerleader. So the Old Boys' voices are not so strong on their side." Coming from such an influential person, the importance of such hints is not lost on Japan's policy makers.
Besides Mr. Tanimura, the ruling O.B.'s in this case were Minoru Nagaoka, 67, and Michio Takeuchi, 70, collectively known as "N.T.T." (Mr. Takeuchi and Mr. Nagaoka declined to be interviewed.)
 
The 'Godfathers'
 "Really, those three are not known just as O.B.'s, but as godfathers," explained Yukio Noguchi, a former bureaucrat who is now a professor at Hitotsubashi University and an expert on financial policy. "We call them 'Don.' It's very difficult to explain this process, though, because it's all informal."
He added: "They are all former vice ministers, but not all vice ministers can be godfathers. It is hard to explain how they obtain this."
The affiliations of these three give some indication of where their interests lie. Mr. Nagaoka is currently the president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a friend to the securities industry. Mr. Takeuchi and Mr. Tanimura are former presidents of the exchange and currently head Government-affiliated research centers connected to the securities markets. They deny favoring either side, of course, but their innate conservatism has worked to the unmistakable advantage of the securities houses, whose aim is to preserve much of the status quo and stanch competition from the banks.
Perhaps the surest sign of the power of these three Old Boys is the fact that they deny having any. If a Japanese official is asked to explain how the Old Boys do it, the answer is usually a shrug of the shoulders. But that informality lends the Old Boys even more influence, because they are not constrained by any transparent process that could be examined and criticized.
The Old Boys "have to be seen as independent of the political world, as politically neutral," Mr. Noguchi explained. "There is a real fear within the ministry that personnel decisions will be influenced by politicians. And the bureaucrats respect the Old Boys' judgment as intelligent and objective."
In fact, that is what most acknowledge in their candid moments to be the real source of the power of the O.B.'s -- their ability to influence personnel decisions. The process of determining promotions and work assignments is one of the most opaque and secretive at the Finance Ministry. Those decisions cannot be questioned and affect a bureaucrat's entire career.
Privately, several bureaucrats acknowledged that some of the more powerful Old Boys had been consulted on these assignments. Thus, no bureaucrat is willing to ignore the Old Boys' advice and risk angering them.
 
Extended Impact
 The issue now is that any changes in Article 65, as the law separating banking and the securities businesses is known, will have a bigger impact on the international realm than most of the matters on which the Old Boys are usually consulted. Permitting Japan's banks into the securities markets could make them more competitive in garnering the business of Japan's largest industrial corporations; the securities houses fear that greater competition at home could shrink their profits and make it tougher for them to build their businesses globally.
The clash over Article 65 has raged in the dim hallways of the rundown Finance Ministry building here for nearly six years. Advisory panels of outside experts, including many of the O.B.'s, have met to hammer out compromises. But in the end, accoding to many of those involved in the process, the Old Boys were able to tip the balance slightly in favor of less change.
"Yes, I would have to say that behind the scenes the Old Boys have influenced this to some degree," said Shoichi Royama, an economics professor at Osaka University and chairman of a Finance Ministry advisory panel making recommendations on financial deregulation. "The current bureaucrats always pay their respects to the Old Boys, although that does not mean the Old Boys dominate them."
The Old Boys are consulted on a range of policy questions, of which the battle over Article 65 is just the most visible. For instance, Mr. Noguchi said that in the recent battle over raising taxes on land holdings, several Old Boys had weighed in by trying to shift the power to collect property taxes to the central Government rather than local governments.
 
Sneer and Fear
 The single greatest threat to the Old Boys and the bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry are the politicians. The politicians are the only independent force that can influence bureaucratic debates, an enormous threat to the Finance Ministry. The bureaucrats both sneer at and fear the politicians.
That concern was evident recently when Tetsuo Kondo, a former bureaucrat and now a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, publicly suggested that the consumer was being forgotten in the debate on financial deregulation. Finance Ministry officials did little to hide their resentment of this intrusion into their field, all but ignoring the substance of Mr. Kondo's remarks.
But Mr. Tanimura made it clear that, as powerful as Mr. Kondo might be, there was still a higher power to be reckoned with in Japan.
"Yes, he's an Old Boy," Mr. Tanimura said, "but not as much an Old Boy as me!"

HEADLINE: Dow Drops by 10.51 to Close Below 3,000

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices gave way yesterday for the second straight day, as trading turned sluggish. Investors appeared increasingly worried that the stock market could be losing ground. Concern also grew that bond market yields, already very strong, could soon begin pulling money out of stocks and into bonds.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 22.58 on Wednesday, lost 10.51 points yesterday to close at 2,994.86 -- the first time the blue-chip index had moved below the 3,000 mark since May 29. 
 Big Board trading slid to 168.3 million shares, from 186.6 million the day before. Declines led advances, 870 to 673. Birinyi Associates said that five heavy waves of program selling, some of them around 2:19 P.M., clipped 13 points off the Dow. More than a hour of yesterday's activity, the research house said, was program trading.
"The stock market's struggling," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist for County NatWest Securities, "and obviously bonds are the key. Bonds are pushing up to the 8.4 percent yield level."
Peter DaPuzzo, co-director of worldwide equities at Lehman Brothers, expressed concern over what he called "the new leadership in cyclicals and transportation stocks."
"Many people," Mr. DaPuzzo argued, "doubt that these cyclicals -- the smokestack stocks -- can truly lead us much higher on the Dow. Furthermore, when the rails lead the transportation index, as they're doing now, that's a concern because it usually foreshadows a decline."
While the Dow transportation index edged lower yesterday, Conrail moved ahead 3/8, to 57 3/4; Santa Fe Pacific gained 1/4, to 9 5/8; Union Pacific tacked on 3/4, to 89 3/4, and Burlington Northern ended unchanged at 33 3/8. By contrast, Delta Air Lines dropped 1 3/8, to 73 1/8; UAL 1 5/8, to 154, and AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost 1, to 65 7/8.
Other leading market indexes also weakened, including the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, and the Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange measures.
Wall Street, though, seemed divided on how far along the nation's economic recovery might be.
"There's a lot of apprehension," Mr. DaPuzzo said, "that the recovery is not so clear as people thought it'd be."
Noting that Wall Street was worried about bond yields climbing, Mr. Canelo argued that the latest economic signposts suggested that "the recession is probably over."
 
Difference in Yields
 Speaking of bonds, Mr. Canelo argued that the difference between a stock dividend yield of 3.2 percent and a bond yield of 8.4 percent was "not quite at the point where it would take money away from stocks." He added that he would not become worried until the spread widened to 5.5 percentage points or more.
That would presuppose bond yields of 8 3/4 "and if we were to get to 8 3/4," he said, "it'd be a very serious restraint -- and halt the bull market."
Among yesterday's movers, Time Warner, which slid 6 1/4 on Wednesday, plunged 11 1/4, to 99 1/2, with 1.5 million shares changing hands. The company announced plans to sell stock to shareholders at a discount, split the stock and possibly buy back preferred stock. Traders thought the plan could dilute the value of the stock.
Paramount Communications, the film company, jumped 4 1/4, to 45, with 1.6 million shares changing hands on rumors that Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buyout firm, would team with David Geffen, the entertainment executive, to bid for Paramount. Mr. Geffen denied any involvement with Kohlberg, Kravis and people close to Kohlberg, Kravis also denied the rumor.

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENT;
Harvard President Urges Social Commitment

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 6

 BODY:
In his final address after 20 years as president of Harvard University, Derek C. Bok delivered a pointed rebuke today to the country's leaders who "stand by idly" in the face of rising poverty, crime and homelessness.
Charging that "an eerie indifference hangs over the land," Mr. Bok said, "Instead of a popular outcry to end the urban violence, the poverty, the homelessness, the hunger of children, the loudest clamor we hear from the public today is 'no new taxes.' " 
 Mr. Bok, who will step down at the end of this month, spoke in Harvard Yard this afternoon after the university's 340th commencement exercises. Seated on the dais near him was Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican who has pushed through a series of severe budget cuts to make good on a campaign pledge of no new taxes.
Mr. Weld has been widely criticized for cutting back on spending for education and social services.
 
Adorned in Top Hat
 A graduate of the Harvard class of 1966 who was celebrating his 25th reunion today, Mr. Weld was dressed in a top hat, morning coat and striped pants, befitting his status as chief marshal of his Harvard reunion class.
A descendant of one of the founders of Harvard in 1636, Mr. Weld looked on attentively as Mr. Bok decried what he said was a loss of sense of purpose by American universities over the past two decades. Where universities long believed they existed to train the nation's leaders and develop its science, Mr. Bok said, there is now "a buzzing confusion of complaints."
Universities are under attack by the public and the government for rising tuitions, for their financial aid practices, for affirmative action programs and for expanding beyond a traditional curriculum of Western studies, Mr. Bok said.
Mr. Bok told an audience of more than 20,000 students, family members, professors and alumni that the criticism of universities should instead be that their "research on school reform, poverty, crime and many other social afflictions lags far behind the urgency of these problems for our society."
Harvard and other universities must redefine their "social mission," Mr. Bok said. This is especially true, he said, at a time when "education for humane citizenship is a stunted enterprise, and preparation for teaching and most of the other helping professions suffers from benign neglect."
Mr. Bok shared the platform this afternoon with the former Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who delivered a short speech calling for a global ban on nuclear weapons tests. Mr. Shevardnadze, who was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard today, said he had become concerned that with the euphoria over the ending of the cold war, "we have become too complacent about the danger of nuclear catastrophe."
At a press conference later, Mr. Shevardnadze said he welcomed President Bush's decision to let Mr. Gorbachev attend a meeting of the Group of Seven Industrialized Nations in London in July to appeal for Western aid to help the ailing Soviet economy. But he said he did not expect any substantive decisions there on Western aid.
Instead, Mr. Shevardnadze said, the Soviet Union must work harder to reform its own economy to make it more attractive for foreign investment.
Mr. Shevardnadze said he was "green with envy" as he listened to a report on fund raising by Harvard alumni this afternoon, particularly that the 25th reunion class alone had contributed more than $5 million this year.
Among the other honorary degree recipients were the novelist Andrei Sinyavsky, a Russian dissident; the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, and Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund.
Harvard awarded 1,550 undergraduate degrees and 3,646 graduate degrees.
 
School of Visual Arts
In T-shirts and sneakers, in glittering dresses -- in just about anything but cap and gown -- the 500 graduates of the School of Visual Arts went through the school's 41st commencement exercises yesterday at Avery Fisher Hall.
A school tradition dictates mufti or evening wear as the fashion for commencement. A slide show of all the graduates, some dressed in even odder outfits, is also shown before the ceremony.
The speaker at the commencement was the actor Eli Wallach.

HEADLINE: A Bull Market for Fraud Emerges in Hard Times

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
In New Jersey this spring, thousands of people signed up for high-paying jobs rebuilding Kuwait. Many of the jobs did not exist. But hefty application fees did.
In Connecticut, hucksters appealed to the public to donate money to buy water filters for troops growing thirsty and sick in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
 Around the nation, law-enforcement officials say, this is a banner year for con artists who have exploited anxieties about recession and war to separate an unwary public from its money. In times of economic uncertainty, they say, the public is more susceptible to ploys that promise quick fortunes or instant relief to their worries.
"Right now it is a prime market for swindlers," said James Allen Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. "When times are good there are many ways to strike it rich legitimately. When the times go sour, people from the shady side come out and offer opportunities."
 
Postal Service Tracks Fraud
 One of the few government agencies that keeps statistics on consumer fraud, the United States Postal Inspection Service, which investigates mail frauds, says it has investigated 1,659 cases in the first eight months of this fiscal year, up from 1,299 for all of the fiscal year 1987, when the agency began keeping track.
Law-enforcement officials in many states say they have seen a sharp rise in complaints about false promises of jobs or access to credit cards or loans.
In New Jersey, officials said they were struck with a wave of complaints this spring about offers of high-paying jobs in Kuwait from companies that advertised in local newspapers. Many of the companies, they say, had no connection with construction projects.
Patricia A. Royer, director of the state's Division of Consumer Affairs, said several charged $19.95 or $29.95 for the telephone numbers of government offices offering free information.
Another company took no money, exacting a toll only in promises it could not keep. Ms. Royer said Omne Maintenance Engineers in Union, N.J., took 4,000 applications for jobs in Kuwait that it said would pay up to $57.50 an hour. On one day alone more than 1,000 job hunters lined up outside the company's offices.
"The prospect of lucrative employment rebuilding Kuwait seemed like a dream come true," Ms. Royer said. "It was the talk of union halls. People took days off to apply and made plans to quit their jobs."
The company, she said, apparently planned to use the names of the electricians, carpenters and plumbers it gathered to start an employment service that would approach construction companies and offer them lists of workers. The company signed a consent order agreeing to send postcards to the applicants saying that it had no contracts for work in Kuwait. Omne was also fined $3,500.
 
Water Filters for Soldiers
 In Connecticut, the Department of Consumer Protection reported that consumer fraud complaints rose to more than 3,000 in the first five months of 1991 from about 2,000 in the first five months of 1990.
The department is investigating complaints about phone pitches describing troops sick from bad water in Saudi Arabia and offering to send soldiers a $49.95 water purifier in exchange for a $10 contribution.
A spokesman for the New York Attorney General, Robert Abrams, said his office estimated that consumer fraud complaints had risen more than 50 percent since last summer. The spokesman, Edward Barbini, said that in one case, a Manhattan company advertised that loans and grants were available to people who had bad credit ratings if they telephoned (900) USA-LOAN.
 
Alchemic Fraud
 Callers "only got the list of Federal agencies that offer housing loans and project grants," he said. "Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the calls cost each consumer $50 or more."
Many cases being investigated by the Postal Inspection Service involve imaginative get-rich quick schemes, said Paul Griffo, a spokesman for the service. For example, a California company offered to sell consumers tons of dirt from an abandoned gold mine in the Nevada hills for $16,000. The company promised that a new technology could extract gold ore that had been left behind by miners of the Comstock Lode in 1876.
But the mine never produced any gold, said Kacy McClelland, the postal inspector who investigated the case. The ads did not mention that the Comstock Lode was actually a famous silver strike. The president of the company, Murray Brooks of Westminster, Calif., was arrested in March and charged with mail and securities fraud.

HEADLINE: No Needy Mother, Just a Con Artist, Brooklyn Police Say

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
From house to house the woman went with a heart-wrenching tale. Her little boy, 7-year-old Joey Lupa, had died of leukemia and there was no money for a proper burial. She cried and shared her sorrows with the people who came to the doors. "Would you give, please?" she asked. And people all over Brooklyn and Queens did, donating at least $25,000 -- money now locked in a police evidence room.
Yesterday, Rose Pannizzo was arrested and charged with scheming to defraud, grand larceny and criminal impersonation, the police said. 
 There is no 7-year-old named Joey Lupa who died of leukemia, said Sgt. Tadgh McNamee, supervisor of the Community Policing Unit at the 63d Precinct. There is only a woman who over the last two and a half months did a despicable thing, he said. She traveled from her home in East New York to tap the hearts and wallets of her good neighbors in the Mill Basin, Marine Park, Bay Ridge, Canarsie and Bensonhurst sections of Brooklyn and Howard Beach, Queens, he said.
The officer who arrested her, Gregory Bacalles, had heard about Ms. Pannizzo from residents who said, "Isn't it a shame about that little Joey Lupa boy?" said Sgt. McNamee. The officer, eager to demonstrate the Police Department's community spirit, sought out the woman, called Rose by residents along his beat in Bergen Beach.
He wanted to ask if the police could help. But compassion turned to suspicion when residents gave different accounts of where she lived.
When she was arrested at 71st Street and Avenue W in Bergen Beach, Ms. Pannizzo was carrying a stenographer's notebook with 297 entries listing addresses and contributions ranging from $10 to $100.
The police found her 1982 Lincoln Continental parked nearby. In the front seat were ledgers listing an additional 1,014 cash donations and a few checks, including some from churches.
Ms. Pannizzo admitted the crime, Sergeant McNamee said, saying she needed the money for her unemployed husband and several children, which could not be immediately confirmed.
Asked how she swayed so many people, the sergeant said: "She has the gift of gab. She's been at the station house for two hours and she already has all the officers buying her candy and soda. They feel sorry for her."
