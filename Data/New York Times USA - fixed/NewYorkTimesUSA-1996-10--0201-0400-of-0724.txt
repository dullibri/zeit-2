HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Rumor That Yeltsin Had Died Briefly Lifts Dollar vs. the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies yesterday, despite a brief rally on rumors circulating in the market that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia may have died, currency traders said.
The dollar surged at midmorning in New York when stories circulated that Mr. Yeltsin's health had sharply deteriorated and even that he had died. The rumor, quickly denied by the Kremlin, briefly lifted the dollar and the Swiss franc while hurting the German mark. 
 Traders bought dollars and Swiss francs as currencies of refuge. Signs of political turmoil in Russia typically weaken the mark because of the close economic ties between Russia and Germany.
The dollar made two pushes to shatter the ceiling of this week's narrow trading range against the mark. But when Russian authorities denied the rumors, it fell back to previous levels.
"It took hold for about 10 minutes," said Ben Strauss, trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company. "The impact was very limited. I blinked, and we were back to where we started."
Late in New York yesterday afternoon, the dollar settled at 1.5287 marks, down slightly from 1.5290 marks on Tuesday.
John Nelson, a dealer at the ABN-Amro Bank in New York, said such rumors typically had more effect on quiet trading days like yesterday.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar remained in a narrow trading range, closing slightly lower at 111.55, compared with 111.65 yen on Tuesday.
The denial of yet another rumor -- which had caused a dollar rally against the yen late Tuesday -- sent the dollar back down to its previous level, dealers said.
The director general of the International Finance Bureau of the Japanese Finance Ministry, Eisuke Sakakibara, said yesterday that a rumor American officials had told him they could tolerate the dollar at an exchange rate of 120 yen was groundless. If that account were true, it would have strengthened the dollar.
Also in early trading, a spate of institutional buying buoyed the dollar above critical exchange levels with the mark, but the move was short-lived and the dollar quickly gave up its gains, dealers said.
They noted that the dollar held relatively firm against the mark despite heavy buying of marks against other European currencies. "It does still look like the dollar will continue to trade up," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign exchange dealer at Credit Agricole.

HEADLINE: Christopher Drops In, But Africa Is Unmoved

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BAMAKO, Mali, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Since Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in this West African country two days ago, he has seemingly struggled at each public appearance to erase the impression that this continent matters little to a Clinton Administration preoccupied with problems elsewhere.
Over and over, Mr. Christopher, the first American Secretary of State to visit sub-Saharan Africa in more than six years, spoke of his joy at being in the region, and of his admiration for Mali, a crushingly poor country that in recent years has improbably pulled off a peaceful transition to democracy. 
 But as he moved from stops like a courtesy call on the President, Alpha Oumar Konare, to a visit with Peace Corps volunteers in a dusty village just outside the capital, Mr. Christopher has instead been a reminder that an Administration that pledged to pay greater attention to Africa has arguably let the continent slip even farther off the radar screen of major foreign policy concerns.
The issues Mr. Christopher took up here, and will discuss on stops in Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola, range from a recent United States proposal to create an all-African crisis response force to African attempts to isolate the military leadership of Burundi in an effort to avert a full-blown ethnic war there.
But Mr. Christopher, with his slight but regular mispronunciations of President Konare's name and his deferral of journalists' questions on the African peace force to aides, may only have reinforced the impression of Washington's distant and even casual attention to this continent's affairs.
"The French are constantly worrying that Washington wants to horn in on Africa, which they virtually consider their property," said an African diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But Paris will not have anything to worry about for a long time. Say what you like about their policies, but French leaders know their African counterparts' names, and they sustain a dialogue with the continent."
Across this continent, African officials had been cheered by what was billed as a major trade initiative earlier this year. But the project, introduced by the Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, shortly before he was killed in a plane crash in April, seems to have passed with Mr. Brown's death, like Washington's attention to the continent generally, the diplomat said.
Given perceptions like these, officials traveling with Mr. Christopher have been at pains to say that the United States has not lessened its commitment to Africa, and have attributed minor missteps to the scarce time that Mr. Christopher had to prepare for his African visit because of a last-minute trip to the Middle East.
Aides noted that Africa had also been visited recently by Mr. Christopher's deputy, Strobe Talbott, by Vice President Al Gore, and by Mr. Cinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake.
Africans, who are accustomed to far more regular high-level contacts with European governments, are not the only ones unmoved by explanations like these, however.
By appointing Mr. Lake, an Africa specialist, as national security adviser, and by organizing a White House conference on the continent in 1994, Mr. Clinton fed high expectations among African policy experts that his Administration would work hard to engage a continent that has seen a wave of democratization and widespread reforms aimed at economic liberalization since the end of the cold war.
"With the exception of Ron Brown, and his kind of advocacy work, they just seem to wander in from time to time and do these kind of ad hoc trips and efforts," said Walter Kansteiner, a former National Security Council director for Africa under the Bush Administration. "I think this is partially a result of the Clinton Administration's lack of strategic policies toward the continent, especially in the economic area. They have had very little success in fostering policies that would help African countries enter the free-market world."
What is more, many Africa experts say, the apparent political disengagement of Washington from African affairs under Mr. Clinton, and recent declines in United States economic assistance to the continent, have worked in the favor of a resurgence of undemocratic governments across the continent whose leaders have felt less pressure to respect human rights or allow fair elections.
"The political openings that we had after 1989 in Africa were very much connected to the end of the cold war and to the fact that external powers, in the U.S. and in Europe, were willing to encourage positive change," said Richard Joseph, an Africa specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Since then, France has been playing a very negative role, supporting the return of authoritarianism, while the United States has just dropped out of the picture."

HEADLINE: Stock Drop Is Worst in Over a Month as Dow Falls 36.15

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks suffered their worst drop in more than a month yesterday as profit taking on the market's recent exploits intensified, muffling enthusiasm over new signs of strength in the semiconductor industry.
The Dow Jones industrial average showed a decline of 36.15 points, to 5,930.62 -- its worst one-day point loss since a nearly 50-point drop on Sept. 5 -- halting a three-day assault on the 6,000 mark. On Monday and Tuesday, the Dow made its first forays past 6,000, but quickly slipped below again. 
 Broader measures of blue-chip and other large companies also retreated sharply, with analysts attributing the selling pressure to another weak day in the bond market and continuing worries over whether coming reports on third-quarter earnings will support the market's lofty heights.
"The buy side is not going to commit until they have confirmation that the numbers for the quarter are O.K.," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company.
"That will carry on until we start hearing from Intel, I.B.M., Microsoft and the big industrials. Once those numbers start coming in, the market will get its footing back and start its assault on 6,000."
The technology-dominated Nasdaq market's decline was cushioned by a report late on Tuesday that showed an increase of 9 percent in new orders of computer chips during September.
The increase buoyed the Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio -- a widely watched comparison of the flow of chip orders compared with shipments -- to its highest level since December.
Investors were also moving to the sidelines just in case the current tame inflation and interest rate outlook is thrown off track by any surprises in tomorrow and Tuesday's reports on the direction of producer and consumer prices.
"I would think the market is going to focus on every report over the coming weeks because the jury is still out over whether the economy is slowing" enough to keep inflation under control, said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst with Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 408.5 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.90 points, to 696.74, its worst point loss since early September and its first drop below 700 since breaking that level for the first time on Friday.
The Nasdaq composite index fell just 2.17, to 1,237.98, with the prospect of improving demand for semiconductors and computers turning the technology sector into one of the session's best performers.
"The book-to-bill is decent and chip prices are firming, so there's got to be better margins," Mr. Battipaglia of Gruntal said.
The most active Nasdaq issue was Intel, down 3/4 at 100 7/8. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Micron Technology was unchanged at 32 3/8 as the most active issue; LSI Logic rose 1 3/4, to 25 7/8, and Texas Instruments rose 2, to 57 1/8.
Tellabs surged 6, to 79, after posting strong third-quarter earnings.
 U.S. Surgical added 2 1/8, to 45 3/4, on news that it was introducing the first set of instruments for minimally invasive coronary bypass graft surgery and the chairman's forecast that 1997 sales would accelerate.
Shares of Santa Anita Companies, were up 2 1/4 at 20 1/2. Santa Anita, operator of the Santa Anita race track, received a buyout offer from Apollo Real Estate Advisers. The company had already agreed to sell a controlling interest to Colony Capital and other investors. The new bid, valued at $19 a share, offers a $14-a-share cash dividend for a 55 percent stake and calls for possible future investment of up to $150 million.
In an initial public offering, Lason Holdings rose 2 3/4, to 19 3/4.

HEADLINE: British Prudential Fund to Invest in Troubled U.S. Companies

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
PPM America, the Chicago subsidiary of the Prudential Corporation of Britain, is raising $300 million to invest in the securities of financially troubled companies.
Prudential, Britain's largest institutional investor, is not related to the American insurer of the same name. In the style of such "vulture" investors, PPM America's Special Investments Fund will seek to influence the outcome of financial restructurings for the benefit of its investors. 
 PPM's new fund, which started up in late June, has so far taken in $154 million. That includes $25 million from Prudential, PPM's parent company and Britain's largest life insurer, $75 million from the Jackson National Life Insurance Company, a Prudential subsidiary based in Lansing, Mich., and $50 million of debt from two American institutional investors, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and the Transamerica Insurance Company.
Prudential set up PPM in 1990 to help unwind a $674 million troubled loan portfolio for Jackson Life. That portfolio, PPM says, has been reduced to $100 million with PPM getting an annualized return of 33 percent on the underlying securities. By starting the new fund, PPM is seeking to capitalize on its experience from such work.
F. John Stark 3d, a PPM senior vice president and the firm's general counsel, said this was a particularly opportune time to start such a fund. "The issuance of high-yield securities has continued to rise the last several years," he said, adding that only around 5 percent of such securities rated single B default. Also, Mr. Stark said, "we have been riding a tremendous wave in terms of the economy." He added, "If there is any lessening of that wave, or a downturn, it would tend to make for more opportunities" for investing in distressed securities.
Some in the investment business agree with Mr. Stark, citing the current mature economic expansion and the likelihood of more bankruptcies, particularly among highly leveraged companies. "I think the prospects are much better," said T. K. Duggan, chief executive of the Delaware Bay Company. "I think we're going to see a lot more of those situations." Morrison Knudsen, for example, is "a blue-chip situation with a bad balance sheet," he said, adding, "If there is an economic downturn, you'll see a lot of things fall out of bed."
But some bankruptcy experts disagree. "Bankruptcies are nowhere near where they were in the 80's," said Christopher M. McHugh, director of research at New Generation Research, a bankruptcy research and investing boutique. "There are a lot of high-yield securities out there, but today the coupons are 8 percent or 9 percent, and they don't croak a company at that level."
As for the volume of bankruptcies, Mr. McHugh said, "Since the end of the great era of leveraged buyout bankruptcies between 1987 and 1992, volume has been moderate with no real trend."
Through September, 60 public companies with assets of $10.8 billion had filed for bankruptcy this year, according to New Generation, compared with 85 bankruptcy filings in all of 1995 with collective assets of $23.5 billion. That is up substantially from 70 bankruptcies with collective assets of $8.3 billion in 1994, but down notably from the big bankruptcy years of 1989 to 1992, when companies with collective assets of more than $50 billion went into bankruptcy each year.
The new fund will be run by three managers, a PPM spokesman said: Brian Schinderle, 35, who previously managed a $75 million distressed securities fund for the Sanwa Business Credit Corporation's special situations group; Brad Scher, 36, who was director of distressed loans for T.I.A.A., and Levoid Robinson, 30, who previously managed a $250 million fund for the First Chicago Capital Corporation.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Hints About a 'Surprise' For Clinton at the Next Debate

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WHEATON, Ill., Oct. 9

 BODY:
Bob Dole said today that he might have some "surprises" for President Clinton when the two meet in their second and last debate next Wednesday in San Diego.
Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, was speaking to a small gathering of women, most of whom own businesses, at a forum here at the Acme Screw Company to help him get his message out to female voters. 
 His statement came in response to a question from Carol Higgins, 55, of nearby Palos Park, who described herself as a concerned parent.
"You're such a nice guy, and you walk around with the kid gloves on, and you've got Clinton to deal with, 'Slick Willie,' " she said. "When are you going to put the boxing gloves on and give him what he deserves?"
Mr. Dole said: "I've had a lot of people tell me that the last few days. It's a very fine line, because there's a myth out there that Bob Dole is mean. I never thought I was mean. The people who work in the Capitol voted me the nicest Senator two times in a row. These are people who work there. Not the media, but the people who work there. So, we may have a few surprises next Wednesday."
The statement came a day after Mr. Dole toured New Jersey and delivered some of his harshest words yet against Mr. Clinton. He indicated then that at next week's debate he would be raising questions about Whitewater and the White House misuse of confidential F.B.I. files.
Mr. Dole's aides were besieged today with questions about whether the candidate's comments on Tuesday prefigured a shift in strategy toward a more aggressive phase of the campaign.
Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's campaign spokesman, said: "Throughout the campaign, he has avoided personal attacks about the President's private life; as he has said repeatedly, that's not his bag. He's not going to do it."
In an interview on Tuesday on the Don Imus radio program, Mr. Dole said he was reluctant to be too harsh because women did not like it.
"We found that in our surveys, if you go on the attack with Clinton -- maybe it's the same if he attacks me, but we haven't seen it -- that the first people who jump overboard are women," he said. "They want the issues, they want us to talk about the issues. That's why we've been trying to talk about the economic package and the child credit and things that we can do to help women in the work force, women who stay at home."
Mr. Dole practiced that philosophy here before an audience of a couple of hundred people, answering a dozen friendly questions.
He was introduced by Loleta Didrickson, the state comptroller, who raised the subject of the sexual harassment suit brought against Mr. Clinton by Paula C. Jones.
She started off speaking about the phenomenon of female voters preferring President Clinton to Mr. Dole. "Why is there a gender gap?" she asked. "As women, isn't character a strong issue for us? Character is the core of who we are."
Noting that the President has asked the courts to defer the sexual harassment case until after he leaves office, she said: "Why not get it behind him? Why not have it out in front? I think it speaks to the heart of the matter of the character issue."
Mr. Dole did not take up the matter. Among the things he said were that as President, he would speak out "at least once a month" against drugs. And, on the issue of taxes, he promised to reinstate the home-office deduction.
One of the questions came in the form of a testimonial from Lisa Gengler, 56, a sculptor who lived in Coburg, Germany, in World War II.
"Because of you, Senator, and men like you, my life was saved when I was 5 years old," she told Mr. Dole, who was wounded in Italy during the war. "It's an honor to support you, and I will sleep much safer when you're President."
Earlier, Mr. Dole was interviewed by G. Gordon Liddy on his conservative radio program. According to the digest "Talk Daily," Mr. Dole told Mr. Liddy he was making progress in California, Illinois and other states, adding: "Your listeners are beginning to focus, and they're the active ones. And if they'll just go out and activate one other person, it will be a big, big help."

HEADLINE: High Court Case Raises Issue of Stripping Charities of Tax Exemptions

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
A case that began as a minor tax dispute between a Christian Science summer camp and a small town in Maine had the eyes of much of the nonprofit sector focused on the Supreme Court today.
The Justices heard arguments on whether state and local governments can strip a charity of its exemption from property tax if most of the people it serves are not state residents. 
 The camp, Newfound/Owatonna, is appealing its $22,000-a-year property tax bill from the town of Harrison and challenging the law as an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. Ninety-five percent of its campers are from outside Maine. The camp would pay no property taxes if most of its campers were from Maine, a development that is unlikely "without a massive conversion to Christian Science in the state," the camp's lawyer, William H. Dempsey, told the Court.
Supreme Court precedent, which has interpreted the Constitution's commerce clause as barring state economic protectionism in a variety of contexts, would seem to support the camp's challenge. In its most recent such ruling, earlier this year, the Court unanimously struck down a North Carolina tax law that gave proportional discounts on a stock tax based on the proportion of the issuing company's income that was earned in North Carolina.
But Maine's Supreme Judicial Court took a different approach, upholding the 39-year-old property tax law last year in a ruling that alarmed religious groups and other nonprofit organizations around the country.
In friend-of-the-court briefs, organizations including the United Way, the Y.M.C.A., the American Council on Education and a variety of religious groups warned the Court that if other states took the same approach, many organizations that served an out-of-state population -- colleges, for example -- could find themselves suddenly liable for taxes on valuable real estate.
Although he later modulated his tone, Justice Antonin Scalia got the argument off to a rather aggressive start, asking the camp's lawyer: "Why should the taxpayers of Maine subsidize people from outside Maine? I don't know why they should be required to do that."
Mr. Dempsey replied that while the state had a legitimate interest in making sure that local residents got the benefit of tax policies, the question for the Court was whether the state's approach was permitted by the commerce clause. The Court could only uphold the law, he said, by reinterpreting the commerce clause to make it somehow not apply to nonprofit organizations.
"It shouldn't make a difference whether you're dealing with profits or nonprofits," Mr. Dempsey said, adding, "Nonprofits in this country are big business in every sense of the word, except they don't make a profit."
By the end of the argument, the Justices appeared to agree that the question did, indeed, come down to whether the Court should take the drastic step of carving out a new commerce clause doctrine for charities. Whatever their concerns about the camp's position, the Justices seemed unlikely to go that far, in part because the town's defense of the law raised even more concerns.
The state itself did not appeal a state trial judge's original ruling, in 1994, that the law was unconstitutional, and it did not appear in defense of the law in the Supreme Court. That left the job to the town of Harrison, which is about 40 miles northwest of Portland and has a population of 2,200.
The town's lawyer, William L. Plouffe, managed to startle, rather than persuade, the Justices with his casual dismissal of the analysis behind the Court's leading commerce clause precedents.
At one point, Mr. Plouffe suggested that the commerce clause should not apply to real estate taxes, because real estate stayed in one place and did not move across state lines. Justice David H. Souter objected that the question was not whether the camp moved, but whether people traveled to Maine to attend the camp.
"Interstate commerce is the movement of people back and forth across state lines," Justice Souter said to Mr. Plouffe as if addressing a beginning law student. "Are you challenging that?"
"I certainly am," Mr. Plouffe replied. For a moment, no Justice had anything to say.
Throughout his argument, Mr. Plouffe stressed that the law's rationale was to make sure that the taxpayers got some benefit from organizations that enjoyed a tax exemption. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg offered the hypothetical example of two nonprofit camps in Maine, each serving blind children. The smaller camp had 50 campers, all from Maine. The larger camp also had 50 campers from Maine, as well as 60 campers from outside the state.
Observing that both camps would be "rendering exactly the same benefits to the state of Maine," Justice Ginsburg asked whether the larger camp would lose its tax exemption. Yes, Mr. Plouffe replied. But he also indicated that an otherwise ineligible camp might earn a tax exemption in return for offering a public benefit like access to its beach.
Justice Scalia eventually became exasperated. "How long has this law been in effect?" he asked. "It seems to me more trouble than it's worth. Maybe we should strike it down for foolishness."
Nonprofit organizations have property tax concerns beyond this case, Camps Newfound.Owatonna v. Town of Harrison, No. 94-1988. They are watching a voter referendum on the ballot in Colorado next month, which would extend property taxes to most charitable, religious, and nonprofit social service organizations in the state. Sponsored by a talk show host, John Murphy, who argues that "God is not broke" but that Colorado cities are, the proposed state constitutional amendment gained a place on the ballot after receiving 88,104 signatures.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A 'Net Surfer' Puts a Republican Spin on Torricelli's Record

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:

This is a 30-second commercial that Representative Richard A. Zimmer, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in New Jersey, began broadcasting on Sunday. Mr. Zimmer's Democratic opponent is Representative Robert G. Torricelli.
 
PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates, Princeton
 
ON THE SCREEN -- Seated in front of a computer screen, a man, identified as "net surfer," clicks his mouse on the word "liberal. Mr. Torricelli appears on the computer screen, saying that he supports a "variety of positions that are liberal." The man clicks three icons, "crime," "welfare" and "taxes." Each time, text appears describing Mr. Torricelli's "too liberal" positions. The ad closes with the words "Foolishly Liberal" flashing on the computer screen.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Net Surfer: "O.K., let's see, liberal . . . liberal . . . Torricelli."
Mr. Torricelli: "I certainly have a variety of positions that are liberal."
Net Surfer: "All right, let's see what your liberal positions are. Torricelli voted to let violent criminals go free on technicalities. . . . That's too liberal. Torricelli doesn't want people to work for their welfare benefits. He is a liberal. Torricelli voted for the biggest tax increase ever. . . . Now that's very liberal. No doubt about it. Torricelli is foolishly liberal."
 
ACCURACY -- Mr. Torricelli was more liberal than 72 percent of House members last year on economics, 78 percent on social issues and 70 percent on foreign policy, the National Journal's Almanac of American Politics said. Mr. Zimmer was more liberal than 49 percent of his colleagues on economics, 54 percent on social issues and 51 percent on foreign policy.
Mr. Torricelli voted against allowing the police to bypass the constitutional protections involving unlawful seizures if the police can show they made a "good faith" effort to comply. He voted in favor of the final version of the welfare bill, which places a five-year limit on cash benefits. He voted for President Clinton's 1993 budget, which increased taxes by $241 billion over five years, which was the largest tax increase in American history -- by one measure. But an increase signed in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan was actually larger, $286 billion, when adjusted for inflation.
 
SCORECARD -- The word "liberal" is used eight times in 30 seconds. To be cast as a liberal is not such a terrible thing in New Jersey, particularly on social issues. Taxes and government spending are another issue, however, and the ad succeeds in artfully misrepresenting Mr. Torricelli's voting record on welfare spending and taxes.

Bill Be Limbo

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has given us the Limbo Presidency. (Bill be limbo, Bill be quick, Bill go under the limbo stick.)
Slowly, inch by inch, he lowers the bar and we bend to accommodate his failings. We decided we would rather change our attitude toward the Presidency than change the President. We would rather have a smiling, shape-shifting Democrat we don't trust than a frowning, laconic Republican we trust more. 
 Mr. Clinton has worn us down with so many messy eruptions from his improvident life that we have come to think of the President more as C.E.O. than role model. That may be his legacy. A new poll shows that most Americans no longer want their kids to grow up to be President. They would prefer just about anything else -- carpenter, cop, mayor, minister, athlete, even lawyer. The only profession rated lower than President was movie star.
Given this disregard for the Presidency, deepened by our knowledge of other Presidents' great flaws, it's hard to imagine that Bob Dole's sad, desperate tactic of slashing at Mr. Clinton's character will work.
Everyone has a clear understanding now of Bill Clinton's good points and bad. We pretty much know that the Clintons did something wrong in Whitewater. We pretty much know that they obfuscated about the search of Vincent Foster's office and the disappearing Rose Law Firm billing papers and the travel office and the F.B.I. files on Republicans and the matter of who hired Craig Livingstone. We've gotten used to sleazy aides, special prosecutors and Clinton loyalists racking up legal bills protecting their bosses.
We understand Bill Clinton's serial sincerity and constant expediency, his childish compulsion to tell tales, even on small things.
Now it turns out that the President who promised campaign reform let his Democratic National Committee rake in some big (and some illegal) bucks from foreign individuals and companies, some of whose executives have enjoyed unusual access to top Clinton officials.
This latest tawdriness won't help the clueless Dole campaign. If Bill Clinton has the Limbo Presidency, Bob Dole has, to borrow his latest appellation for the President, the Bozo Candidacy.
As Mr. Clinton glides through sunny economic climes, Mr. Dole wanders a blighted landscape. His New Jersey bus tour attracted paltry crowds before getting washed out by driving rain.
Mr. Dole should be running in France, where they like bleak. The '96 race has a Henry James Old-World-versus-New-World feel -- the jaded, resentful Europeans against the brash, hopeful Americans.
The Dole campaign says it needs to fix Bob Dole's dark, sour image. But it's not an image. It's him. Mr. Dole's experiences in life have left him with a bitter, fatalistic outlook, and he continually makes sardonic, self-sabotaging asides about how ridiculous his pursuit is.
He weeps a lot and tries to be touchy-feely. He even begged to get on Oprah. But this isn't the real Bob Dole. The real Dole, biting and candid, was vividly on display in '88, when he said Jack Kemp must have forgotten to wear his helmet if he believed in supply-side economics and when he called George Bush a pampered preppy making reckless no-tax pledges. In '88, he snarled but was truthful. Now he makes nice, but he's as dissembling as the man he's trying to defeat. He's promising tax cuts he doesn't believe in and proposing anti-affirmative-action legislation that belies his record.
Mr. Dole has no overarching idea where he wants to take the country. No strategy for unseating a popular President. No agenda on the Republican social and cultural issues.
His campaign is not really about voters. It's about Bob Dole, and what Bob Dole thinks he's owed because he had it hard growing up, hard in the war and hard in politics, where he kept getting passed over for people who always took the easy way in life, people like Bill Clinton.
We may not revere the President anymore but we still want him to reflect qualities that conjure up a romantic image of America -- optimism, charm, humor, magnanimity, a little swagger. That's what Bill Clinton is selling. That's why we forgive the Limbo President.
Bob Dole is selling the opposite. And maybe what he's selling is just as much America. But we don't elect the twilight of our souls.

Absence of Outrage

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In our last episode about the penetration of the White House by Asian interests, we saw how the President of the United States had been personally involved in the solicitation of an illegal campaign contribution of $250,000 by a foreign national.
That was pretty scandalous, I thought, especially since the facts are not in dispute: (1) John Huang, the Indonesian Riady family's man here, left his foreign economic post at Commerce to resume fund-raising for the Clinton campaign. (2) That phantom fund-raiser introduced the President to a wealthy South Korean businessman in April of this year. (3) The alien shelled out. (4) When caught by The Los Angeles Times, his hot money was returned -- and no crime is charged. 
 Evidently the Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn R. Simpson and Jill Abramson were also working on this story. Under the headline "Asian Interests Are Providing Huge Campaign Gifts, Gaining Political Clout," they added rich detail this week to the sale of access to Clinton by favor-hungry foreigners.
I had been wondering why the Secret Service was hanging out so often in the lobby of the Hay-Adams Hotel, across the street from the White House. It turns out that Mr. Huang (who will not speak to reporters, and has not been asked to speak to Craig Donsanto's Elections Crimes branch of the Department of Justice) has been holding posh Presidential dinners there with a $25,000 price tag.
Many of the "donors" may be front men with green cards, resident aliens of modest means passing along huge gifts of soft money supplied them by the Asian connection. One $425,000 gift came from the son-in-law of a big shot in the Lippo Group, the Indonesian conglomerate that came to Webster Hubbell's financial rescue after looming prosecution forced that tight-lipped Clinton confederate to quit the Justice Department.
Such unprecedented largess to American politicians from aliens, and their private access to the President and his top aides at a Jakarta conference of Asian leaders, used to be called a scandal. Though TV investigation lags, several newspapers in addition to The Journal are digging after the sleazy sale of influence to foreigners.
But what is lacking -- in the press and in the public -- is an outdated emotion called outrage. Even when caught red-handed, the White House can be expected to dismiss the latest revelations -- as Mr. Clinton did with the F.B.I. files of 900 Republicans -- as an "honest bureaucratic snafu." And even as it reeks of wrongdoing, the Clinton Asian connection will get a shrug from the public: "Too complicated." Or "Everybody does it." Or "All a bunch of politics." Or "Old stuff."
Ennui is in; outrage is out. Why?
One reason is that the Department of Justice has shoveled all corruption over to the Independent Counsel, a part-time prosecutor who won't bring indictments until after the election -- after the President has thoroughly blackened the prosecutor's reputation, and after Mr. Clinton hopes to claim pre-emptive vindication at the polls.
Another reason is scandal overload. The ripoff of taxpayers in Whitewater as shown by the convictions in Little Rock; the Travel Office abuse of police power; the Vincent Foster mystery; the obstructing of justice in long-concealed billing records; the abuse of executive privilege to conceal political embarrassment; the refusal of a lawyer, Randy Turk, to show Congress the contributors to Craig Livingstone's defense fund; the missing six months of records protecting the political operatives who looked into the F.B.I. files -- never have so few concealed so much from so many.
Another reason the voters' gorge has not risen is that the opponent has been too eager to become likable to make his case. Bob Dole raised the pardon issue in the first debate and then backed away. At his final face-to-face chance, Dole should say: "I pledge to you never to abuse the Presidential pardon power by using it to protect myself from criminal prosecution, and I call on Mr. Clinton right here and now to promise the same."
Will anything so old-fashioned as moral outrage ever make a comeback? The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our investigative stars but in ourselves, that we are benumbed.

HEADLINE: For Landlords, Hard Numbers and Obligations

SERIES: BARELY FOUR WALLS: Housing's Hidden Crisis -- Fifth of Six Articles.

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
In a tenement in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, tenants lay out a daily offering of rice and beans on hard hallway tiles. The food is given in thanks to Susie, a dog, who has taken over responsibility for killing rats from a landlord who has not been seen in years.
In the part of Queens known as the Rockaways, a landlord charges $575 a month for an illegal basement apartment. The air is close, the toilet settles slowly into rotting floorboards, and the scuttling of mice inside the walls creates a subterranean equivalent of the patter of raindrops on a roof. 
 And in a generally well-kept building in the Tremont section of the Bronx, the elevator keeps malfunctioning because people urinate down the shaft, short-circuiting the wiring. Vandals repeatedly shatter the plate-glass front door, so the landlord is forever installing new panes. It is shattered; he replaces it; it is shattered, again.
New York City is a metropolis of renters; more than two-thirds of its seven million residents pay someone else to provide them with shelter. But in the poorest neighborhoods of the city, the uneasy contract between landlord and tenant is strained to the breaking point.
Traditional adversaries, the two are yoked together at the bottom of the housing market, in buildings that few want to inhabit or own. Tens of thousands of poor tenants spend half their small incomes and more for shelter that is substandard, dangerous or illegal. And many landlords -- the well meaning and venal, the shrewd and hapless -- find it increasingly difficult to provide decent homes and still make a profit.
Tabloid "10 worst" lists, along with tenement horror stories that occasionally come to light, have shaped public perceptions about these landlords. The images that endure are of the likes of Jack Ferranti, convicted of planning a fatal arson fire in Queens, or Andonis Morfesis, whose style of managing buildings in Harlem earned him the nickname Dracula Landlord.
But experts say the anecdotes tend to obscure the root problems of housing the city's very poor.
"I think we have a problem that goes beyond a few unscrupulous and predatory elements," said David R. Jones, director of the Community Services Society, a nonprofit social-service agency. "I don't care how ethical a landlord is -- if he's depending in large part on his revenue stream from people on public assistance, he's in desperate trouble."
The economic equation is simple and stark. The tenants can afford to pay very little, while low-income landlords struggle to do business in the notoriously difficult New York housing market. The aged buildings need constant repair; some properties still carry heavy debt from the speculation frenzy of the 1980's; taxes and water charges are rising, and expenses must factor in vandalism, security problems and unpaid rents.
In pursuit of profits, the landlords take different routes. Some fit the classic "slumlord" mold -- collecting rent without providing services as basic as heat. Some rent illegal spaces to people who cannot afford legal quarters. Some find the business so difficult that they simply abandon their buildings, leaving tenants to fend for themselves.
Even the best of the low-income landlords -- those with efficient operations and well-tended buildings -- struggle to preserve thin profit margins.
Meanwhile, government is fading from this grim scene. Waiting lists for space in public housing projects, which many tenants consider a step up from most privately owned tenements, can be years long. The city has stopped seizing buildings from tax-delinquent landlords, partly because its maintenance record often rivaled those of the worst slumlords. Budget cuts have gutted code enforcement efforts, emboldening the more willfully negligent owners.
The harsh economics of low-income housing are not measured only in a ledger's debit column. A landlord's business problems often hurt tenants already living in barely acceptable conditions. If the owner of a distressed building is struggling to pay the mortgage or the tax bill -- or if he simply pockets the rent money -- maintenance is likely to suffer. That leak from the bathroom ceiling will continue to foul the air; that radiator will remain cold to the touch.
 
The Bottom Line
Struggling to Solve A Ruthless Equation
In the risky business of low-income housing, David T. Diamond and Robert C. Rosenberg are counted among the landlords who have figured it out: their buildings are generally well kept, and they make a profit. Mr. Diamond lives on the North Shore of Long Island and drives a late-model Mercedes. Mr. Rosenberg lives on the East Side of Manhattan and has an eye for works of art. And they make no apologies for living well.
"We're entitled to a profit," Mr. Rosenberg said. "We work damned hard. I have pride in ownership."
Together they own and operate about 3,000 apartments in buildings scattered throughout the Bronx. They have more than 100 employees, including 50 building superintendents, and a computer system that tracks both the company's response to code violations and the heat levels in its buildings. They also retain two "tenant relations specialists" who work out rent-payment plans, help fill out forms for government subsidies and even provide rides to doctors' offices.
The partners adhere to a credo of enlightened self-interest. For example, they offer to pay college application fees for tenants, figuring that education can lead to better jobs that will make paying the rent easier. They give out T-shirts that say "Junior Tenant Patrol," hoping to instill children with pride in their homes. They plant trees and shrubbery in their concrete courtyards.
But even the Rosenberg-Diamond model is showing cracks. It is getting harder and harder, they say, to make the numbers work.
For the first time in their 20-year partnership, the two men have fallen significantly behind in their taxes -- as much as $1 million -- and are refinancing some buildings to pay off those taxes. They suddenly face unpalatable choices, Mr. Rosenberg said: "Do we pay our fuel, or do we pay our taxes?"
A ruthless arithmetic is at the root of the problem. The city estimates that the average cost of operating a rent-stabilized apartment in a building built before World War II is about $386 a month, not including mortgage payments or profit. But the state's shelter allowance for welfare, that inefficient yet indispensable element of the low-income housing equation, has remained static for almost a decade, at $286 for a family of three.
To make an investment worthwhile, explains Dan Margulies, an advocate for landlords, "the owner has to beat that $386 every month." But with low-income housing, that can prove almost impossible.
"There are whole neighborhoods in the city where the household income is nowhere near enough to pay a $386 monthly rent," said Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.
The prospect of further cuts in welfare and other subsidies has forged an unusual alliance between landlords and tenants; both say they rely on that money.
"It is an anomaly to think of private landlords providing low-income people with decent and affordable housing," said Michael McKee, a longtime tenant advocate. "It's very difficult. And without some kind of government subsidy, it's almost undoable."
Over all, as the city has enjoyed an economic upswing in the last couple of years, so too has the housing market. Indeed, the Rent Guidelines Board, which sets rates for rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments, heralds the improvement in an upcoming report.
But that optimism does not trickle down to the very low end of the housing market. Board officials and housing experts alike say the income is still too low, the expenses too high.
Officials often use the number of tax-delinquent buildings as a measure of the city's distressed housing, and that measure suggests a disturbing trend.
In 1989, the city counted 2,069 multiple-dwelling buildings in serious tax arrears; 245, or 12 percent, were at least three years behind in taxes. By 1994, the numbers were 4,306 buildings tax delinquent, with 1,384, or 32 percent, at least three years behind. Then, last year, the overall number dropped to 3,874, but the most seriously delinquent rose to 1,633 buildings -- or 42 percent.
Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Diamond readily acknowledge that, so far, their salvation stems from experience and volume; operating 3,000 apartments allows them to buy in bulk and to economize. But they say the realities of low-income housing inflate their cost-per-apartment well above the citywide estimate of $386.
They have as many as 300 rent-nonpayment cases pending in Housing Court at any given time, which translates into tens of thousands of dollars in lost income a year. Even if they succeed in having a tenant evicted -- which occurs about six times a month -- their expenses, from moving and storage costs to the $65 fee for the services of a marshal, continue. In recent years, they have also paid more than $50,000 in fines for not having window guards, which they say tenants constantly remove.
Some of their buildings are in areas where crime is common and drug dealing a way of life. That is why, they say, they go door-to-door collecting rent with "PPD's" -- personal protection devices -- or guns.
Responding to tenant complaints about drug dealing on the roof of a building in the Fordham section, the landlords put up a chain-link fence; the dealers hacksawed through. The landlords countered with bars; the dealers hacksawed through. Now the roof is secured with reinforced iron bars, a chain-link fence and razor wire.
At another building, in Tremont, someone keeps smashing the glass front doors. And Mr. Rosenberg, who refuses to use Plexiglas because, he says, it looks cheap, keeps replacing the panes. "You break a window, I'll have it replaced in an hour," he said, his voice raised. "You will tire before I do."
The partners lobby constantly for the elimination of rent regulations, which they and other landlords say skew the housing market and prevent them from collecting fair rents. Tenant advocates counter that regulations are needed to protect the poor.
At the same time, the precarious Rosenberg-Diamond empire relies heavily on government subsidies; more than two-thirds of their tenants receive welfare payments, vouchers or some other government assistance. If there are significant cuts in those subsidies, Mr. Diamond said, "I don't know what would happen."
Although they say some of their buildings are losing money, the partners say they have no intention of selling their properties. "We buy for long-term investment," Mr. Diamond said. "We have a vested interest in the Bronx."
 
Studies in Disrepair
Lured by 80's Market, Soured by 90's Reality
There are many landlords whose outlook is decidedly narrower than that of Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Diamond. Chasing the elusive profits of low-income housing, they routinely flout the laws designed to insure habitable conditions for the poor.
The notices arrive at Mark Seidenfeld's Brooklyn address with disturbing regularity. The return address for the certified mail is always the housing code office of the City of New York. And the letters are always written in that awkward language reserved for landlords in trouble.
"Abate the nuisance consisting of vermin mice and roaches thru out 3rd sty southeast apt 7c . . . Provide hot water at all hot water fixtures 3rd sty north apt 3c kitchen & bathroom north section . . . Repair the broken or defective plastered surfaces and paint in a uniform color ceiling and walls 4th story front apt thru out."
Most of the six buildings that Mr. Seidenfeld owns in the Bronx are studies in despair. At 2265 Morris Avenue, hallway haggling over drugs replaces the cup-of-sugar requests of past decades; at 735 Bryant Avenue, the front doors are broken, the intercom is smashed, the elevators are sealed shut; at 1220 College Avenue, all that brightens the dreary fifth-floor corridor are the empty crack vials, red, green and blue.
Perhaps out of fear for his safety, his tenants say, Mr. Seidenfeld rarely enters his own buildings. That is why Catherine Olivencia sometimes begins the month by walking around the corner from her apartment, on College Avenue in Morrisania, to a green 1995 Lincoln Continental parked near a bakery. She hands her rent check to the man behind the wheel, Mr. Seidenfeld.
City records show that Mr. Seidenfeld has been fined time and again for housing code violations; in several of his buildings, the infractions count into the hundreds. In the last year alone, he has been ordered to pay $13,000 for falsely certifying that violations had been corrected in three of his buildings, and another $2,100 for not providing tenants with adequate heat.
Mr. Seidenfeld and his lawyer declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article. But the landlord is by no means alone in owning buildings where the poor live in substandard conditions. There are hundreds.
In a Bronx building across Morris Avenue from one of Mr. Seidenfeld's properties, a family of six lives in a rear apartment facing an alley, struggling to keep rats at bay. The rodents squeeze through the rotting floorboards and gaping holes that riddle the apartment. Janet Carcano said she sometimes stays up at night to make sure the rats do not go near the children. She is not always successful; rats have chewed the nipples off baby bottles left on a dresser. And early one recent morning, there were drops of blood on the sheets in the crib where her infant grandchild lay crying. He had been bitten on the toe.
The owner, Robert Heimann, calls the Carcano apartment -- for which he collects $800 a month in rent, mostly from a Federal subsidy -- the worst in the building. "It's not an apartment I'm satisfied with at all," he said. Although he accepted responsibility for the collapsing floor, he blamed the rats on the tenants' poor housekeeping.
The landlord added that he had frequently provided Ms. Carcano with blocks of rat poison.
Housing experts say that much of the current landscape of low-income housing was shaped by a frenzy of speculation that swept over the city's real estate market in the mid-1980's. Banks dangled tantalizing loans before eager investors, while housing values skyrocketed. Mr. Heimann and Mr. Seidenfeld were among the many who bought their properties during this overheated period. But the giddiness turned to panic after the stock market crash of 1987.
Many buyers "got caught up in the euphoria and are now caught in an impossible situation," said Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Housing at Rutgers University. "You don't see how they can work themselves out, with the debt load and the rent rolls. There's a huge gap there, unless you can really raise rents and get those rent hikes to stick."
One businessman lured by the prospect of getting in on a good thing and diversifying his portfolio was Lawrence G. Chan, owner of garment companies and a restaurant. In 1986, Mr. Chan and his Chan Brothers Realty Corporation paid $218,000 for 210 Humboldt Street, a five-story walk-up that looms over a street corner in Bushwick. But the gambit proved to be a loser.
Within a few years, Mr. Chan had used the increasingly squalid property as collateral for two mortgages. As far as his tenants could tell, Mr. Chan himself had disappeared. The building superintendent collected the rent for a while, tenants say, but he did little maintenance in return. And then he, too, vanished.
As conditions deteriorated, visitors to the building were greeted by the stench of dead rats inside the walls. Indeed, at times it seemed that a battle for dominion was being waged between residents and rats. Tenants used BB guns and sharpened sticks to kill the rodents and brought in dogs, including the mongrel Susie, to patrol the floors.
Last spring, the tenants learned that a court-appointed receiver had taken over the building and was demanding $950 in back rent from each of them. They formed an association instead, reasoning that the only way to improve the building's condition was to do it themselves, said Diana Acevedo, a housing advocate for the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation. A spokesman for the receiver declined to comment.
Mr. Chan, of Forest Hills, Queens, eventually resurfaced. Last summer, he began serving a one-year prison sentence for trying to bribe a Federal official as part of a plan to smuggle undocumented immigrants and tainted food into the country.
At his sentencing, Mr. Chan's lawyer explained that the landlord had become involved in illegal activity "at a time when he was failing as a businessman."
 
Defining a Landlord
Game of Square Feet And Few Square Deals
Some landlords have found profit in housing the poor illegally by carving up their buildings and renting out space that is too small and dangerous for those who can afford better, but passable for those with no choice. With the supply of affordable housing shrinking, these illegal conversions have become increasingly common, particularly in Queens.
This shadowy market, which thrives on the commodity of space, has created many permutations of what is generally meant by the term landlord. Building superintendents make extra money by quietly squeezing bodies into space next to the boiler; tenants sublease rooms in their own apartments; "fixers" try to match up desperate tenants with dismal quarters.
Some landlords, though, break the law so overtly that illegally converted apartments have become their trademark.
Michael Andrews rents to the poor of the Rockaways, a section of southeastern Queens that long ago lost much of its appeal as a summer resort. He and his real estate company, Sue Me Inc., have been cited repeatedly for code violations, and this year he has amassed more than $50,000 in fines. When the community board compiled a list of the 12 worst single-room-occupancy hotels in the Rockaways, seven of the properties were either owned or managed by Mr. Andrews.
"His name is mud in the Rockaways," says Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager for Community Board 14 in Queens. "He's certainly one of the biggest violators of the public trust in this community."
Typical, officials say, is a 90-year-old house Mr. Andrews owns at 96-18 Rockaway Beach Boulevard.
One day in January, a gust of wind snapped off the Atlantic Ocean and blew out the window of the third-floor apartment. Glass fell to the floor, rain covered the bed, and Donna Russo began to scream.
Her wails carried past the bucket her elderly father used for a toilet, down a dark stairwell to the second floor -- where five other people, living in three separate units, all shared the same filthy bathroom -- and then to the first floor, which had been split into two apartments.
In the back apartment, which rented for $500 a month, fetid water from the second-floor toilet leaked through the ceiling of the room where Elisa Rodriguez and her asthmatic grandson slept. The dripping water was caught in a strategically placed bucket, which she sprayed several times a day with a can of room freshener called "Spring Garden."
The wails settled in the $575-a-month basement home of Margaret O'Connor, her husband, Dominick, and their two children. The building's boiler sat behind the couch. Stained wastepipes crisscrossed the room. Water dripped from the bathroom ceiling. And there were mice within the walls. "At nighttime, when you're in bed, you can hear them running," Mr. O'Connor said.
If the tenants in all seven units paid their rent in full, Mr. Andrews would collect more than $30,000 a year for a house he and his partners bought in 1991 for $87,500. But the full amount is rarely paid. The rent for the squalid basement, for example, was $575 a month, but the tenants paid only the $286 provided by the mother's public-assistance housing allocation.
Mr. Andrews, of Manalapan, N.J., disputes the city's contention that the house is zoned for single-family use, but he does not deny having illegally rented the basement in this building and in others.
"God, everybody's been doing that for years," he said. "This is not a new story, it's an old story. If you don't know that, you don't know anything about real estate."
Mr. Andrews, who acknowledges that he is making a profit in the Rockaways, blames the poor conditions in some of his buildings on the tenants. "They're alcoholics," he said. "They're crack addicts. They're everything. They're all on public assistance."
"I feel I'm really doing a service" by housing the less fortunate, he said. "Not that I want to. I'm forced into it."
Several of the tenants at 96-18 Rockaway Beach Boulevard have since moved on, and Mr. Andrews has put the building up for sale. But his troubles continue; in a house he owns nearby, city officials found two families being charged $600 a month each for illegal basement apartments.
Another variation on the theme of illegal housing played out last winter in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where seven Russian immigrants were living in five cubicles carved out of a one-bedroom apartment. Each room was no wider than a man's outstretched arms, and each had a door with a padlock. Other Russians lived in similarly divided apartments elsewhere in the well-kept building at 39 Turner Place -- until the owner, Star Realty Inc., found out and evicted them.
The illegal tenants were paying rent -- $250 a month for a cubicle of one's own, $150 to share -- to Mark Ruditsky, a "fixer" who had no legal claim to the property but who held keys to several apartments. He said he was merely watching the apartments for friends who had returned to Russia, and had decided to make practical use of the empty space by renting it at bargain rates.
"One hundred fifty dollars a month for a room!" he exclaimed. "It's free, nearly. Where else can you find living in New York like that? Who can complain?"
 
The Small Landlord
Easier to Get In Than to Succeed
In low-income housing, the most vulnerable landlord is the small landlord. She might be a retiree who thinks she cannot go wrong with a real estate investment. Or he might be an immigrant building superintendent who believes that to own a 20-unit complex is to own a piece of America.
City housing studies show that small owners tend to pay slightly higher real estate taxes and have higher vacancy rates and more collection losses, accounting for three-quarters of all residential buildings in tax arrears. Their tenants, meanwhile, are poorer and move more frequently.
Mr. Margulies, director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an owners' advocacy group, said that immigrants have traditionally gravitated toward becoming small landlords. "But the requirements have changed," he said. "You need to be computer literate, you need to be able to correspond with city agencies and state agencies to straighten out mistakes, you need to be able to hire lawyers and accountants.
"There is money to be made there -- in volume -- but, in my estimation, almost no money to be made in small buildings."
Ivan Matetic knows this better than most. He owns one building, a turn-of-the-century tenement in the South Bronx that he bought in 1986. And it has all but wiped him out.
He sleeps in the basement, in a makeshift supply room crammed with broken sinks, copper pipes, and jugs of grease remover. His shower, little more than a faucet connected to a garden hose, is next to the building's boiler. Down the narrow corridor, there is a low roar from a broken water pipe.
Mr. Matetic, an immigrant from Yugoslavia, is also a porter, making $33,000 a year mopping the floors of a luxurious apartment complex in Brooklyn Heights. Virtually every dime he earns is invested in his property, he said, and to prove his point, he pulled out a plastic bag from inside his shirt. The bag, which he calls his "office," contains income-tax statements, correspondence with the city and other documents related to his building.
But Mr. Matetic's humble life style has not been enough to make his investment profitable; he is awash in debt and violations. He owes $66,000 in taxes, is behind on mortgage payments and has a $6,000 bill from an oil company. As for the thousands of dollars he owes in fines, he raises his hands in surrender and says, "Come and get me."
There are several reasons the 35-unit walk-up at 555 Southern Boulevard has been a losing proposition. It is in a poor neighborhood with a history of drug-related violence. Eleven of its units are vacant because Mr. Matetic does not have enough money to finish much-needed renovations. Seven tenants have not paid rent in years, but Mr. Matetic cannot try to evict them because he distrusts bureaucracy, and has never properly registered his building with the state as a multiple-dwelling residence.
He collects about $375 a month for each of the other units, although he allows a few to pay much less. "It's so poor here," he explained. "If they have little money, it's hard to pull it out."
A local community organization, convinced of Mr. Matetic's good intentions, is trying to help him improve the building and make it more profitable. "This is a good man here," said Blanca Ramirez, the director of the group, the Citizens Advice Bureau. "He knows what people go through here. We need more landlords like him."
Meanwhile, Mr. Matetic continues to sleep in the basement, dreaming of what could be. "If I can get $400 each from every apartment," he said, "then I have no problem anymore."
 
In Search of Solutions
Salvaging Buildings Before It's Too Late
There is a pair of buildings in Washington Heights that embodies the desperation in low-income housing: crumbling interiors, rampant drug dealing, insufficient rent income and the struggles of a series of landlords. A high-ranking housing official describes the buildings at 548-552 West 163d Street as the worst in the city.
But they may soon serve as a testing ground for one possible solution to those problems: a joint effort between government and nonprofit organizations to salvage the worst buildings.
"There's an inherent conflict between low-income housing and the profit motive," said Dr. Elizabeth A. Roistacher, a professor of economics at Queens College. "There's just not enough of a margin to make it economically viable. That's why the nonprofits are so important: they don't need the rate of return."
On West 163d Street, a stranger's appearance elicits whistles and shouts, the urban birdsong of lookouts for drug dealers at work. For years, much of their work has been conducted inside the five-story walk-ups at 548-552 West 163d.
There, in the rank hallways and decrepit bathrooms, that uneasy contract between landlord and tenant has been broken. At one point, there were no front doors. The Postal Service refused to deliver because the mailboxes had been ripped away. Ceilings neared collapse, leaking pipes flooded the basement, and shoddy wiring posed a fire hazard.
A drug dealer nicknamed Yaya stood with arms folded at the doorway; visitors needed his permission to enter. Inside, there was Suyapa Rivera, seven months pregnant, who feared leaving her apartment because the stairs shook; she and her husband, a truck driver, paid $400 a month. There was Francisco DeLeon, paying $94 a month for the rent-controlled unit he has lived in for two decades; heat was sporadic last winter, so he spent the season wrapped in blankets. And there was the family of 16 Mexican immigrants living in a two-bedroom apartment. They were paying $500 a month to the leaseholder, who lived 12 blocks away.
Over the last decade, as conditions worsened, the property was passed from one landlord to another like a lit firecracker. The only constant has been Barry H. Levites, whose large real estate company either owned the buildings or held the mortgage.
Mr. Levites runs his business out of a cluttered second-story office that overlooks East 149th Street in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. He works at a frenetic pace, barking orders to employees over an intercom, negotiating deals over the telephone, and signing documents all at once. Next to his desk he keeps a machine that measures blood pressure.
Mr. Levites, who has not been inside the buildings in years, said he tried to salvage them several times, turning them over to a succession of landlords, but each one collected the rent without providing maintenance. Soon "the building was infested with drug dealers," he said.
Indeed, the apartments taken over by the dealers are easy to identify; the door frames have been reinforced with concrete to thwart police battering rams.
"At one point, we wanted to sell it for whatever we could get," Mr. Levites said, with a dismissive wave of his hand. "Then we got Isaac White."
A casual agreement in 1994 placed the property and its 38 apartments in the hands of Mr. White, a retired construction worker with little experience as a landlord. At first, Mr. White just collected the rent and did repairs, but eventually Mr. Levites was able to sell the troublesome property to Mr. White. The sales price could not be learned; the new owner described it as "a little song."
Mr. White's song became a dirge. The drug dealers warned him not to meddle, and tenants refused to pay their rent because conditions were deplorable. Trying to maintain the buildings cost him his life savings of $40,000, he said, and ruined his family life. What's more, city housing officials sought to have him fined and imprisoned for not doing agreed-upon repairs in buildings that were notorious long before they were his.
"I ain't got no home and I'm dead broke," Mr. White said one day last spring as he sat on a bench outside Housing Court, hat on his head and cigar in his mouth. "Those buildings broke me."
The buildings were so far gone that the city's housing agency made plans to vacate the premises and board the front doors shut. But the nonprofit Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, which had organized the tenants, intervened, as did the local City Councilman, Guillermo Linares.
After a meeting with the Housing Commissioner, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, the principals reached a series of agreements. In exchange for the city's dropping its overwhelming case against him, Mr. White agreed to sell the property to a nonprofit group for a dollar. The city, meanwhile, agreed to work with the group as part of a new program to salvage distressed properties.
Housing officials say they have done $150,000 in emergency repairs, and are hoping to provide a $1.6 million loan, an amount based on the estimated $40,000 in repairs needed by each apartment. They are considering waiving more than $480,000 in outstanding taxes.
"The best plan for a building is never to shut it down and let it rot," Ms. Barrios-Paoli said, "just as the best plan for a person is never to go to a shelter."
There was one other detail in the matter of West 163d Street: Barry Levites still held a $150,000 mortgage. But when told of the arrangement between the city and the nonprofit group, he agreed to declare the mortgage satisfied.
"He's had enough," a city official explained. "He's letting it go."
 
Many Offer Their Help
More than 100 people have called to offer help to the tenants whose lives and living conditions have been chronicled this week in The New York Times. The Children's Aid Society has agreed to manage donations or other offers of help. Inquiries or donations may be sent to Philip Coltoff, Executive Director, Children's Aid Society, 105 East 22d Street, New York, 10010.

Graph: "A Slim Margin"
 In the poorest neighborhoods of New York, tenants often cannot afford the rent that landlords say they need to cover expenses, provide adequates service and realize a profit. As a result, some landlords fall behind in their tax payments -- one measure of distressed housing. Graphs provide a look at the five community board districts that have the largest precentage of buildings in tax arrears.

HEADLINE: Southern Co. Unit Getting Role in Asia

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Southern Company said today that its Southern Electric International unit had agreed to buy a majority interest in Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd. in a deal worth $2.7 billion.
Consolidated Electric, one of Asia's largest independent power producers, is now 60.4 percent owned by Hopewell Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, whose managing director is Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur. 
 Southern's announcement said Consolidated Electric shareholders "will receive $2.1 billion from Southern and $600 million in dividends for 80 percent of the company. Hopewell will become the largest minority shareholder of C.E.P.A."
Company executives were not immediately available to explain how the transaction would be carried out.
"Combining the assets of Southern Electric International and C.E.P.A. will create one of the world's largest independent power producers, supplying electricity to the heart of Asia -- including three of the world's most populated countries -- as well as Europe, North America and South America," A. W. Dahlberg, Southern's chief executive, said.
The company is betting that Asia's strong economic growth will continue to increase demand for electricity, analysts said.
Consolidated Electric owns and operates generating plants in China and the Philippines and has projects under development in Pakistan and Indonesia.
The company was established in 1993 as a holding company for Hopewell's electricity projects.
Southern, based in Atlanta, said the transaction was subject to approval by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and by shareholders of Consolidated Electric.
Southern, the largest producer of electricity in the United States, is the parent of five Southeastern utilities: Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric. It also owns power plants and transmission systems in Britain, Argentina, Chile, Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas. Southern's stock lost 62.5 cents to close at $21.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Hopewell is a major developer in Asia with projects as diverse as highways, bridges, mass transit projects, hotels and retail, residential and commercial properties. The sale would provide much needed funds for the cash-strapped company.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When politicians seek to please on medical benefits.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
"I TRUST the people," remonstrated Bill Clinton in response to Bob Dole's charge during Sunday's Presidential debate that he put more faith in government. "But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital," Mr. Clinton added.
Don't expect Mr. Dole to press the issue of the President's inclination to depend on Washington to end what Mr. Clinton called "drive-by deliveries." After all, it was Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a rising star in the Republican Party, who led the drive at the state level to bar health maintenance organizations from sending mothers and newborns home without a second day to recuperate. Remember, too, that parallel Federal legislation, signed by the President in September, was widely supported by Congressional Republicans. 
 On the other hand, don't expect the broader issue of Government micro-management of minimum health care benefits to disappear without a trace. For in a period of relentless efforts to contain health insurance costs, everything points toward more of the same. "It's sad," said Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton, that "at the first sign of discomfort we get meat-ax regulation."
Sending new mothers home the day after they deliver has drawn fire from some medical professionals, but the practice has hardly been confined to health maintenance organizations run by followers of Dr. Mengele. It has virtually become the norm in California, where H.M.O.'s have been leaders in cost-cutting.
The majority view goes more or less like this: When the delivery is vaginal and uncomplicated, and the newborn's health can be adequately monitored at home, the risks are very small. The trick for H.M.O.'s is to prevent the ambiguous cases -- mostly low-income mothers who had little prenatal care and are unlikely to head for the doctor at the first sign of distress -- from slipping though the cracks.
That said, drive-by deliveries were rapidly becoming a public relations disaster for H.M.O's in the Northeast, a mistake that Mr. Reinhardt argues was largely driven by their failure to analyze costs and bargain with hospitals for changes in pricing practices. Deliveries themselves are expensive, he acknowledges, but a day for rest in the hospital does not use valuable medical services. "It's more like a stay in a hotel," Mr. Reinhardt suggests.
Thus H.M.O.'s would have been well advised to concede an extra day of hospitalization for women who insisted, and then to have used their financial leverage with hospitals to bargain down the cost to a few hundred dollars.
Is there a lesson here, apart from the cynic's observation that health maintenance organizations ought to pay more attention to their patients' concerns in election years? Most economists, including Mark Pauly of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, think the first line of defense against the inclination to micro-manage treatment is more and better information: Consumers of medical care need to know what they'll get in advance, particularly in gray areas where comfort and convenience are paramount. "This is often a problem that can be best solved by informed buyers," he suggested.
There are exceptions, though. Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard, points to cases where it is clear in advance that the vast majority of consumers would opt for the same medical protocol, and giving them a choice would simply be wasted effort. Hardly anyone, presumably, would choose to opt out of the right to trauma care in the emergency room in order to save on insurance premiums.
But there are tougher calls here, too -- circumstances where it is difficult to believe that the competitive market alone would satisfy diverse preferences at the lowest possible cost. In many cases, health care comes as a take-it-or-leave-it package, as a fringe benefit to employment. Thus the employer decides what benefits to buy with only indirect input from the actual consumer.
In theory, employees can always voice their complaints, or even quit if they are not satisfied. Few, though, are going to risk the boss's wrath because their H.M.O. will not promise, say, replacements for lost contact lenses or surgery for deviated septums.
Society as a whole may claim a stake in setting minimum health care standards for individuals. Certainly there is a long history of state intervention in setting medical priorities, particularly in life-and-death decisions. "We probably wouldn't approve of the Kevorkian H.M.O.," Mr. Newhouse suggested, only half-joking.
Legislating a two-day minimum maternity stay will raise health insurance costs by just a fraction of 1 percent. The real danger here is the precedent in an era of tight government budgets. Elected officials who cannot please constituents with additional spending or tax cuts still have the option of currying favor by mandating private benefits. And as long as there is a plausible rationale along with emotional appeal, minimum-benefit creep will be hard to resist.

HEADLINE: Investors Are Calling for WMX to Stick to Its Core Business

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
This morning, Phillip B. Rooney, the chief executive of WMX Technologies Inc., will be visited by Robert A. G. Monks, a principal of Lens Inc., an investment partnership that owns $25 million in WMX stock. Lens often comes down hard on the chiefs of companies that underperform, and Mr. Monks has no plan to coddle Mr. Rooney.
Mr. Monks wants WMX to pull back from any business that is not directly related to trash disposal. He wants WMX to buy back a lot of its stock as well as the various parts of its subsidiaries, including Wheelabrator Technologies and WMX International, that it had taken public. 
 In other words, he wants WMX to go back to being plain old Waste Management Inc., the company it started as in 1968 and that, while just about half of its $10.2 billion in sales, is still its most profitable operation.
"It isn't clear that this company can run businesses beyond domestic trash," Mr. Monks said.
Mr. Monks has some high-powered support. Soros Fund Management, George Soros's deep-pocketed investment fund, owns about 5 percent of WMX. Soros executives rarely discuss their investments, but other investors familiar with Soros say its expectations are even higher than those of Mr. Monks.
Yet the meeting may yet turn out to be civilized. WMX's recent actions seem right along the lines of what Mr. Monks and Soros want.
WMX has sold its water-treatment equipment business to the U.S. Filter Corporation, its scaffolding business to an investment group, and its process engineering and construction business to Raytheon Engineers and Constructors. Mr. Rooney says he expects to sell WMX's industrial cleaning business.
WMX has already bought back five million shares of stock. And, analysts predict it will generate $700 million in cash this year.
All the moves, Mr. Rooney said, are in line with his plan -- articulated last spring -- to sell $1 billion in underperforming assets by mid-1998 and increase productivity in those that remain, slash capital spending, reduce debt, generate more free cash and buy back stock.
"Bob Monks and I are in agreement about a lot of things," said Mr. Rooney, a 27-year WMX veteran who says that he, too, owns $20 million worth of stock. "I guess everyone just wants us to move faster."
They certainly do. "He says $1 billion by 1998, and we say dispose of $4 billion minimum," said one big investor who also strongly suggested that the company should replace Mr. Rooney, an operations maven, with a financial whiz.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Rooney insists that operations experience is what WMX most needs right now. He notes that WMX has already increased the productivity of its trash business by 15 percent, by computerizing truck routing and applying other technologies. And he says he is pushing WMX's disparate businesses to sell their services as a package.
Mr. Rooney has some Wall Street converts. "WMX is finally a positive story," said Leone Young of Smith Barney. William Gencoof Merrill Lynch agreed, saying, "He is executing what he said he will execute."
WMX shares, which were mired in the mid-$20's until a few months ago, closed at $34 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. But the stock's rise seems less a sign of faith in management than a reaction to the buyback and to the idea that Lens and Soros are on WMX's case -- and to an unsubstantiated rumor that Mr. Rooney would be replaced.
One sign of lingering investor caution: U.S. Filter's stock rose when it bought the water equipment business, yet WMX stock did not budge. "The sale of the water business could be the beginning of a turnaround, but the market did not react," Mr. Monks said. Another investor added, "If they could clear away more of the kudzu cluttering this company up, it could be a $50 stock."
Such clearing would take a powerful weed-cutter. Throughout the 1980's, WMX invested heavily in hazardous-waste disposal and in European operations. "No one thought the hazardous-waste business would fall apart or that the European Community would not offer unified regulations and economies of scale," said Marc H. Sulam, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Yet that is what happened. Processors learned to generate fewer hazardous by-products and Washington pushed toxic-waste disposal down its priority list. Europeans retained their own rules, and preferences for home-grown disposal companies.
Mr. Rooney thinks WMX should stick it out in Europe. But over all, he agrees that WMX's real future rests with its past: Waste Management. The trash-disposal behemoth's biggest competitor, Browning-Ferris Industries, has had problems stemming from overinvestment in recycling. And with landfill space running out, few new competitors are likely to usurp WMX's domestic franchise.
It is that franchise that still attracts Mr. Monks. "WMX is an intriguing company," he said. "It is one that can be fixed and ought to be fixed."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Atom Plant Likely to Close

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The owners of the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant in Haddam Neck, one of four troubled nuclear reactors in the state, said yesterday that they would probably shut down the 28-year-old plant because it had become too expensive to operate.
Connecticut Yankee is the oldest operating full-scale commercial nuclear power plant in the nation, but it has been shut down since July 22 for safety reasons, along with the three Millstone reactors in Waterford, Conn., leaving the state with no operating reactors. 
 Anthony E. Nericcio, a spokesman for the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, the consortium of eight utilities that own Connecticut Yankee, said the final decision to decommission the plant will not be made for at least a month, but that the likelihood that the 582-megawatt reactor would not be shut down was "very slim."
The plant's fate highlights not only the increased scrutiny of nuclear plants in Connecticut, but also the fact that nuclear power has become relatively expensive compared with other fuels, like oil and gas.
Mr. Nericcio said the decommissioning would probably take at least two years. He added that the 350 employees there had been told that they would continue to have jobs for at least another six months. After that, they face several possibilities: they might continue to work during the shutdown, they might be terminated, they might be offered buyouts, or they could be transferred to the Millstone plants or the Seabrook nuclear power plant in Seabrook, N.H. Those plants are either owned outright by Northeast Utilities, of Berlin, Conn., the largest member of the consortium that owns Connecticut Yankee, or by other consortiums that include Northeast Utilities.
He also said that employees working on a contractual basis at the plant would be let go soon.
"It was received quietly," he said, when asked about the response from employees at the plant. "It was a surprise."
Mr. Nericcio stressed that the decision to shut down the reactor, which sits hard by the Connecticut River in the eastern part of the state, was based on economic factors and was not tied to the safety concerns that have recently dogged the plant.
Simply put, prices of natural gas and oil have fallen so low and remained low for so long that nuclear power is no longer a comparatively cheap source of energy.
"Oil is cheaper than bottled water," said Charles Komanoff, an energy economist in Manhattan who has long followed the nuclear industry.
Bruce D. Kenyon, president and chief executive of Connecticut Yankee, said in a statement released yesterday: "The owners of Connecticut Yankee have done an analysis of the economics involved in running this plant for the next 10 years. At this point, the economic picture does not seem favorable."
To a degree, though, the economics of operating Connecticut Yankee have hinged on increased costs stemming from shutdowns and increased regulatory scrutiny. Much, but not all of that scrutiny, has been sparked not by safety problems at the Haddam plant but by concerns about the Millstone reactors, which have a spottier safety record.
Connecticut Yankee was licensed to operate until 2007. It began operations on Jan. 1, 1968, the same day as the San Onofre reactor in Southern California, which was shut down for similar economic reasons in 1990; the two reactors were the first full-scale commercial nuclear reactors to operate in the nation. Since San Onofre's shutdown, a handful of other reactors have been shut down because they were not cost-effective.
"This is a surprise because Connecticut Yankee represented the best of the nuclear power industry for its first two decades," Mr. Komanoff said.
A shutdown of Connecticut Yankee is not expected to have much effect on electricity rates for any of the companies that own part of the plant. Besides Northeast Utilities, the owners include the New England Power Company, the United Illuminating Power Company, the Boston Edison Company, the Central Maine Power Company, the Montauk Electric Company, the Cambridge Electric Company and the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation.
"The costs of decommissioning are expected to be offset by being able to buy cheaper energy," Mr. Nericcio said.
Mr. Kenyon, in his statement, said that the decision to shut the plant stemmed from meetings in September of representatives of the utilities in the consortium. The owners analyzed the costs associated with operating and maintaining the plant, and compared those with the cost of purchasing replacement power.
Under many of the scenarios evaluated, Mr. Kenyon said, continuing to run the plant would have saddled the operators with extra costs that ranged from tens of millions of dollars to $100 million, depending on assumptions made about plant operations, expenses and the cost of replacement power.
Moreover, he added that since the last economic analysis, projected fuel costs have dropped even further, while the rate of growth in demand for power has slowed in New England and more efficient technologies are being developed.
"Regardless of the outcome, Connecticut Yankee employees should be proud of the contribution they have made and service they have provided to the people and businesses of New England."

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Wars Creep Near U.S. Border

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The swaggering adolescent in cowboy boots shoved past a stream of American tourists and stepped into the nine lanes of traffic inching through the afternoon heat toward the United States border. Suddenly, he pushed a 9-millimeter pistol through a car window and fired four times at the driver's head.
As the driver slumped bleeding to the seat, the San Ysidro border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego erupted in shrieks. The gunman slid his pistol under his belt, sauntered back to the sidewalk and climbed into a waiting van that sped away up a side street. 
 The shooting last Thursday of a Tijuana man who the police said was a minor drug trafficker was unusual, coming as it did just 50 yards from American soil, under the noses of United States Customs officials. It even seemed to startle the jaded youths who stand at pay telephones, reporting to the Tijuana drug cartel on the carloads of cocaine moving north from the Mexican state of Baja California.
But it has been all but forgotten in the days since as several other Tijuana youths have been killed in a drug war that has also seen the slaying of several senior narcotics officials. The growing violence is rocking Mexico and threatens to spill over into the United States.
"This is the equivalent of what we experienced in Chicago in the 30's," said Alan D. Bersin, the United States Attorney in San Diego. "And given the increasing integration between Baja California and California, it affects us. We're not quite at the point where, when Tijuana sneezes, San Diego catches a cold, but the risks of cross-border violence are certainly perceived."
The violence also threatens Tijuana's economic boom. In recent years foreign businesses, attracted by a minimum wage of only $2.90 a day, have made Tijuana one of the hemisphere's fastest-growing industrial centers. But the drug killings here and the August kidnapping of a Japanese executive have aroused "a great deal of nervousness," Mayor Jose Guadalupe Osuna said.
"We're having to battle harder to get new industries," Mr. Osuna said. "They're asking a lot of questions, and they want us to boost our police presence in the industrial parks."
According to Mexican and American officials, the bloodshed is being driven by a turf war in which rival gangs are muscling in on the Arellano Felix family, whose drug organization has long controlled the Tijuana border, and a parallel conflict raging among corrupt factions within Mexico's Federal Judicial Police.
Seven Mexican officials who have worked on drug cases in Tijuana have been slain in as many months, along with more than a dozen state and municipal police officers and scores of minor traffickers.
The killings last month in Mexico City of two top Mexican commanders who worked closely with American agents in Tijuana to track the Arellanos has forced American officers to tighten security.
"When you work side by side with a comandante who gets killed, you have to be alarmed," an American official said.
The Arellano brothers -- Francisco Rafael, Ramon, Benjamin and Javier, natives of the state of Sinaloa -- settled in Tijuana in the late 1970's, according to documents filed with Benjamin's 1987 indictment on cocaine charges in San Diego. The family took control of the Baja border in 1985, when the trafficker for whom Benjamin was working, Leonardo Contreras, fled Mexico after killing two Mexican police officers.
The Arellano brothers bought Government protection and attained immense wealth, and although their narcotics activities were widely recognized, they mingled openly with the cream of Tijuana society and resorted to violence only infrequently, said Victor Clark, a human rights activist who has studied the narcotics trade here.
But a struggle that broke out in 1992 between the Arellanos and a rival trafficker, Joaquin Guzman Loera, grew into a vicious vendetta. It attracted widespread attention in 1993 after a Roman Catholic cardinal was killed at the Guadalajara airport when Ramon Arellano's gunmen fired on the cardinal's car, mistakenly identifying it as Mr. Guzman's, prosecutors said.
In the crackdown that followed, the authorities arrested Rafael Francisco in December 1993 and confiscated Arellano family properties sprawling all across northwest Mexico, including five ranches, 91 vehicles and 118 houses. Over the years, the other brothers have eluded arrest, despite a reward of about $666,000 for their capture.
But this year, an aggressive federal commander, Ernesto Ibarra Santes, appeared to be closing in. Mr. Ibarra headed a 30-man mobile intelligence unit that with the help of Drug Enforcement Administration agents was focusing on the Arellano organization. On March 1, Mr. Ibarra's unit swept through Tijuana, confiscating 20 houses said to belong to Arellano associates. In another operation on Aug. 5, Mr. Ibarra arrested two top Arellano associates in the central state of Aguascalientes.
As Mr. Ibarra turned up the pressure, a string of current or former Mexican law enforcement officials based in Tijuana were killed.
Then on Aug. 15, as part of a nationwide purge of the federal police, 30 of the 120 officers based in Baja California were dismissed on suspicion of accepting bribes from drug traffickers. Among those let go was the federal police's Baja California commander. Mr. Ibarra was elevated to the job.
On Sept. 13, Mr. Ibarra received a call from Attorney General Antonio Lozano's headquarters, ordering him to report immediately to Mexico City. When Mr. Ibarra arrived in the capital late the same day, no security detail was waiting to escort him, so he left the airport in a cab. Minutes later, a car pulled alongside the taxi and gunmen sprayed it with automatic rifle fire, killing Mr. Ibarra, his two bodyguards and the driver.
The police later found $50,000 in the bullet-riddled taxi, giving rise to speculation that Mr. Ibarra might have been accepting payments from the Arellano brothers' rivals.
On Thursday, amid great fanfare, Mr. Lozano announced the arrest in Mexico City of two men he identified as Arellano lieutenants who had taken part in Mr. Ibarra's murder. Mr. Lozano also vowed to restore order in Tijuana, but American officials said they doubted that the killings would end soon.
"We're not going to get caught in the crossfire," one official said.

HEADLINE: A Rehearsal for 2000

 BODY:
The Vice-Presidential candidates devoted most of their 90-minute debate last night to arguing about Bob Dole's tax plan, the value of government regulation and the future of the inner cities. It was the debate about vision that Mr. Dole and President Clinton might have had this week, but did not.
On the G.O.P. side, the vision on display was mostly that of the Vice-Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, not his running mate. Comparing Mr. Kemp's passionate defense of the 15 percent tax-cut plan with Mr. Dole's vague explanations of how it would work, voters would have the right to wonder how many members of the Republican ticket actually believe in its most central economic plank. 
 Mr. Kemp's advocacy was the center of last night's debate. He repeatedly envisioned an America where business is unfettered, where the highest tax rate is 25 percent and where the fast-churning economy gives even inner-city residents access to credit and capital to start their own business. Mr. Gore stuck mainly to pointing out the obvious danger of this attractive but "risky" approach.
Those regulations Mr. Kemp dislikes, Mr. Gore noted, help insure workplace safety, clean water and the right of employees to deal with family emergencies without worrying about being fired. The 15 percent tax-cut plan, he said repeatedly, would "blow a hole in the deficit" while sending interest rates skyrocketing. When Mr. Kemp said tax cuts had worked for John Kennedy, Mr. Gore pulled him back to earth by pointing out that Mr. Dole himself had voted against the Kennedy tax cut.
In sum, it was an earnest wonkfest in which Mr. Kemp provided the soaring rhetoric and Mr. Gore scored with a prudent, reality-based view of government. Mr. Dole might have wished for a debate in which Mr. Kemp launched the "character" attacks Mr. Dole has avoided. But Mr. Kemp has his eye on the year 2000 and was not about to sully his chances by becoming Mr. Dole's Doberman. At the beginning of the debate he even announced it was "beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally." The announcement was no doubt a shock to the Dole campaign's emerging plan, field-tested this week in New Jersey, to get down and dirty.
Like Mr. Kemp, Mr. Gore hopes to run for President in 2000. The combined pressure of both men's ambitions was enough to smother any high drama. The most frequently used phrase of the evening was "with all due respect." While Mr. Kemp sometimes got tangled up in verbal spaghetti, Mr. Gore was much easier to follow. Yet his slow, didactic tone suggested he sees America as one vast first grade.
But we don't want to be too picky. It was encouraging to see the two men spend so much time fencing about urban policy and the need to extend the benefits of capitalism to every segment of American society. At every opportunity, Mr. Gore reminded the audience that 10.5 million jobs had been created over the last four years. Mr. Kemp seemed to recognize the potency of that number for 1996. But it also seemed clear that both men were thinking that a lot of statistics -- including the No. 1 spot on their tickets -- would be different four years from now. It was a promising rehearsal for those who believe that the politics of substance is worth pursuing, no matter how dull it gets.

HEADLINE: Canada Strike Against G.M. Widens as Two Sides Harden

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Ontario, Oct. 9

 BODY:
A week-old strike by Canadian workers of the General Motors Corporation spread further this evening, as the auto maker's chairman signaled that the company would not quickly back down in the dispute.
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said the company needed a labor pact that would let it keep cutting costs, notably by selling two parts factories in Canada. "We've got certain things that will cripple the company if we don't get fixed right," he said at a news conference in the Detroit area this afternoon. 
 The Canadian Automobile Workers union, which now has all of its 26,000 G.M. workers on strike, demands that the auto maker accept broad restrictions on its ability to shrink its work force further and buy more parts from outside vendors. The union has offered to let G.M. sell the two factories in question, but only if the buyer is required to pay the employees the same wages and benefits for three years.
G.M. has accepted such an arrangement for past sales of parts factories, but it has refused this time, while also demanding a variety of other departures from the three-year labor contract that the union reached on Sept. 17 with the Chrysler Corporation.
In a brief interview here tonight, Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, said, "Jack Smith doesn't know what's going on here, he ought to get in his car and drive over and talk to me."
Two hours after Mr. Smith spoke this afternoon, another 2,460 auto parts workers here and 2,210 workers elsewhere in Canada joined the walkout. Hundreds of workers toted signs, whistled and shouted in 45-degree weather in front of a car-seat factory here this evening.
Union officials and industry analysts warned that the strike could easily last another two or three weeks, eventually threatening more than 100,000 American workers with temporary layoffs.
"It seems to me like positions are slowly hardening -- it appears to me like this one could be a long one, a month," said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Negotiators for G.M. and the Canadian union have met almost every day since the strike began, but for less than an hour at a time, as each side waits for the other to make the next move. "There remains a lot of hard work and a lot of very tough ground to cover before a settlement can be reached," said D. Stewart Low, a G.M. spokesman.
The strike has had little effect so far on G.M.'s operations in the United States, where many assembly plants rely on parts shipped from Canada. The strike began on Oct. 2 at Canadian assembly plants that produce only a few parts for the United States operations, spreading on Sunday night to a 5,300-employee engine and transmission factory in St. Catharines, Ontario.
Dean W. Munger, G.M. Canada's vice president for personnel and top labor negotiator, has said that the company accumulated extra stocks of some parts in preparation for a strike. Tom Klipstine, a company spokesman, confirmed today that G.M. had leased warehouse space in preparation for the strike and moved finished parts out of factories before picket lines were established.
But Mr. Klipstine cautioned that the quantity of parts in storage was not large, and certainly not enough to meet G.M.'s needs for a month.
On Monday, as a result of the strike, G.M. temporarily laid off 1,050 of 4,000 workers at an engine plant near Buffalo, and 800 of the 6,000 workers at a transmission factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. G.M. has not announced any layoffs since then, but as many as 400 more workers in Ypsilanti may be let go later this week, Mr. Klipstine said.
Wesley R. Brown, an automotive production analyst at CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich., was skeptical that G.M. would be able to keep its assembly plants in the United States open for long. "By the last week of October, it would be likely that almost all of the North American operations could be down, could be almost completely down," he said.
In March, G.M. temporarily laid off 176,000 workers when a 17-day strike at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, forced an almost complete shutdown of North American auto assembly operations and the closing of many G.M. parts factories. The 6,000 outside suppliers of auto parts to G.M. also furloughed a huge number of employees then.
G.M. is the largest corporate employer in the United States and the world's largest industrial company in terms of sales. In addition to state unemployment benefits, laid-off G.M. workers would draw supplemental unemployment benefits of $220 to $330 a week from the company. The combination of benefits is equal to 70 percent of their pay for a 40-hour week -- still a sizable pay cut, since most G.M. workers usually work a lot of overtime as well.
The auto maker's contract with the United Automobile Workers union did not require it to pay supplemental unemployment benefits in March to workers laid off because of the Dayton strike. But G.M. is obligated to pay supplemental benefits to American workers who are laid off because of the Canadian strike, provided that the American workers meet the fairly easy state standards for drawing unemployment benefits.
Parts suppliers, which make everything from seats to trunk carpets, usually do not pay supplemental unemployment benefits, so their workers would suffer a sharper drop in pay.
Analysts have already begun lowering their estimates of G.M.'s fourth-quarter profits to reflect the strike's cost. Ronald A. Glantz, a Dean Witter analyst, forecast the strike would last three weeks and cut after-tax profits by about $450 million, or 60 cents a share.
But G.M. should be able to recoup about two-thirds of the loss by raising production next year, he added. G.M. is already producing its highly profitable sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks as fast as possible, but few of its car factories are running at full capacity.
The Canadian strike expanded this evening to include the 1,300-employee car-seat and door factory here; an 1,160-employee transmission factory also in Windsor; a 450-worker auto-parts distribution plant in Woodstock, Ontario, and a 1,760-employee diesel-locomotive and armored-car factory in London, Ontario.
The car-seat plant here assembles seats for a Cadillac factory across the river in Detroit. Mr. Brown at CSM predicted that the factory would close within a few days. G.M. is trying to sell the car-seat factory and a bumper factory in Oshawa, Ontario.
Mr. Smith said that G.M.'s balance sheet, which holds $13 billion in cash, was strong enough to withstand the strike.
 In interviews tonight and at a strike rally here last weekend, workers said they had prepared for a strike, many building up savings with lots of overtime. But a few workers were nervous. "We have three kids, a house -- if there's a strike, it'll be tough," said Jeff Brown, a 36-year-old seat-belt assembly worker here.
Strike pay for Canadian workers is only a fifth of their regular pay. The Canadian Automobile Workers union says it has enough money in its strike fund for an eight-week walkout, and can raise more through bank loans or by mortgaging its headquarters.

Comments by Fed Governor Send Treasury Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After waffling through most of the trading session, prices of Treasury securities deteriorated yesterday after comments by Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor.
Speaking from text to a community banking conference in Dallas, Mr. Lindsey said: "While the commitment of the Federal Reserve to a low inflation environment is unwavering, I cannot assure you that all politicians feel the same way. Nor can I assure you that sustaining the fight against inflation will not mean a temporary rise in interest rates at some point in the future." 
 Traders interpreted those remarks as being bearish. Although prices had opened sharply higher in thin trading volume, influenced by overseas buying, they ended on the decline. The 30-year bond fell 10/32, to a price of 99 1/32, sending its yield up to 6.83 percent, from 6.80 percent on Tuesday.
According to some analysts, prices had fallen as a result of the slow distribution of Tuesday's 10-year Treasury note auction, and that prompted overseas traders to buy intermediate maturities at prices that were too inexpensive to pass up.
Wholesale trade data for August, which were released yesterday morning, were within expectations, providing continued evidence of steady inventory growth through the third quarter that is likely to increase third-quarter gross domestic product. The August wholesale trade report showed a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in sales and a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in inventories. It had little impact because the market is more interested in tomorrow's retail and manufacturing data.
"The highlight of the report," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "was the five-tenths of 1 percent increase in wholesale inventories, which lends further credence to the concept that inventories are being replenished during the third quarter following the sharp slowdown in accumulation during the first half."
More important for the bond market will be tomorrow's release of the Producer Price Index and retail sales. Mr. Fine said retail sales in September were likely to show an improvement from the lackluster levels of the prior three months, although not to the extent of suggesting a rapid acceleration in consumer spending.
"The P.P.I. will be carefully noted as always, but barring any upside surprise from the market's anticipated two-tenths of 1 percent rise, focus will immediately turn to next Wednesday's more important Consumer Price Index," he said. "Certainly last week's unexpectedly sharp decline in nonfarm payrolls, while a below-trend deviation, helped to alleviate much of the concern about an overheating labor market, and also helped reduce some of the apprehension that typically builds up in front of the price indexes and retail sales. In addition, it gives the Fed more latitude to continue to keep its monetary policy on hold despite the Federal Open Market Committee's bias toward tightening."
In the corporate bond market the AT&T Capital Corporation priced $3.1 billion of global asset-backed securities yesterday through underwriters led by Nomura International and Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The proceeds will be used to help pay for its purchase from the AT&T Corporation by a group of leasing companies and managers. Sale of the unit, formed 11 years ago to finance phone equipment sales, was made as the long-distance company carried out plans to split into three public companies.
Yesterday's sale was divided into five parts and sold through a Capita Equipment Receivable Trust, with the average life of the securities that are backed by equipment loans ranging from 0.46 year to 3.81 years. The securities were priced to yield from minus 4 basis points off the six-month London interbank offered rate to 49 basis points above the 6.125 percent Treasury note due July 2000. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Except for a small amount of A-rated subordinated debt, the whole issue is rated triple-A by the major bond houses.

Shunning the Sound Bite

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
Last Sunday night, Bob Dole did not do it. For whatever reason -- lack of passion, strategic miscalculation or oversight in the heat of the moment -- he failed to make much of a case for his proposed 15 percent tax cut in debating President Clinton.
So last night, Jack Kemp did it for him. Facing Vice President Al Gore in a debate televised nationally from St. Petersburg, Fla., the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee put heart and soul -- and a torrent of words -- into an effort to sell the tax cut to the country and to prove that it would foster more rapid growth, much as he had helped earlier to sell the plan to Mr. Dole. 
 Together, Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp confronted the tax issue head on and laid their cases pro and con before the electorate in some detail. They explored its impact on the environment, on blacks and on the inner cities. Seldom in the image-driven, sound-bite campaigns of recent years has a single topic received such extensive exposure at the height of a Presidential campaign.
"We cannot just run the clock out on the 20th century," Mr. Kemp said, arguing again and again that every time in this century that the United States had cut income taxes, revenues had increased and the economy had grown. A tax cut now, followed in short order by a thoroughgoing rewriting of the Federal tax code, he declared, would "take the country roaring into the 21st century."
He painted a picture of a country overtaxed, overregulated and overworked because the economy was growing far too slowly under Mr. Clinton. The "haves are doing well," he conceded, but he argued that "the have-nots are not."
It was precisely what the Republican leadership, which considers the tax cut the party's best hope for victory, had wanted. Before the debate, Alan Novak, the Pennsylvania party chairman, said that if not Mr. Dole, someone else had to rebut Mr. Clinton's criticisms of the Republican tax program, and added: "That's right up Jack's alley."
But Mr. Gore did not stand idly by while Mr. Kemp defended the tax cut, and after 90 minutes of back-and-forth, he seemed to have held his own. He repeatedly branded the Dole-Kemp program "a risky, $550 billion tax scheme" that would "blow a hole in the deficit" and "knock our economy off track."
When Mr. Kemp said his plan was not "trickle down" economics but as propulsive for the economy as Niagara Falls, Mr. Gore replied that the Republican proposals would "put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls." He insisted the proposals would mean cuts in Medicare and other social programs.
The Republican nominee brought the greater energy and fervor to the debate, though he sometimes got tangled in his statistics and syntax.
But even if Mr. Kemp proves to have prevailed in the eyes of most of those who watched, he may not have changed many votes. Few people, academic studies have shown, vote on the basis of their views of the Vice Presidential candidates. Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp trail by 10 to 15 percentage points in most polls, with less than four weeks left until Election Day.
Mr. Dole had also been criticized by many in his party for failing to exploit the so-called character issue, and he had berated himself for not pressing it effectively when he confronted President Clinton.
But given a chance at the beginning of the session by the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, to discuss any "ethical differences" between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, Mr. Kemp spurned it with the comment that it was "beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally."
The two men did discuss abortion, including so-called "partial birth abortions," the form of late-term abortion that Congressional Republicans tried to ban in their last session, a subject that was absent from the Presidential debate. Mr. Dole's opposition to abortion is believed to be a big element in his difficulty in attracting support among women. Mr. Kemp conceded that there was no chance of passing a Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, even though the Republican platform calls for one and suggested that persuasion and discussion were needed.
Nothing that was said appeared likely to change the minds of suburban Republican and independent women with whom Mr. Dole has failed to connect.
A major question now is whether Mr. Dole, who has been taking a harder anti-Clinton line in his radio and television advertising and on the stump in the last few days, will follow through in that vein in the final Presidential debate, which is scheduled for next Wednesday in San Diego. He had promised to do so, but Mr. Kemp's avoidance of personal attacks put that tactic in doubt.
Old friends and old Congressional colleagues, Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp smiled frequently, joked with each other and never came close to losing their tempers. Mr. Kemp kept his famous prolixity under control, though he could not resist using the term "Judeo-Christian" a lot, and the Vice President, who is noted for a wooden speaking style, managed occasionally to sound fairly relaxed, even if he used the phrase "with all due respect" so often it sounded like a recording.
The Vice President praised Mr. Kemp as an effective voice against "coarseness and incivility" in the United States during his long career.
If, as so widely suggested this week, the confrontation in Florida last night was a preview of the 2000 Presidential campaign, it will be a very different matter from those of the recent past, full of discussions of enterprise zones and hydrocarbons and economic theory and the Greek roots of English words.
Mr. Gore rattled off long lists of what he termed the accomplishments of the Clinton Administration, to which Mr. Kemp replied that it was not nearly enough. The harshest words were Mr. Kemp's, when he accused the Democrats of demagoguery for asserting that the Republicans wanted to cut Medicare benefits.
But he also went after the Administration on foreign policy, another subject largely absent so far. Mr. Clinton, he said, substituted ambiguity for decision-making, and had much less success in Bosnia, Haiti and Mexico than he claimed.

Credit for Shrinking Deficit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The nation's budget deficit sank to a 15-year low of $109 billion in fiscal 1996, two Republican lawmakers said today in taking credit for the drop.
The announcement, pre-empting the Clinton administration's planned release of the figure later this month, came from Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Representative John Kasich of Ohio. 
 The Administration in July projected the deficit at $117 billion and, a month later, the Congressional Budget Office predicted $116 billion.
Lawrence Haas, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the Republicans' figure was "quite conceivable," but he attributed the decline to the President's 1993 economic program.

HEADLINE: Retailers Dreaming Of Bright Holiday Season;
The Bet Is on High Consumer Demand and Low Inventory

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Here is all that has to happen for retailers to have their best Christmas in years: No more than an inch of snow can blanket the Northeast in December; the stock market must continue to go gangbusters; stores will have to have whisper-thin stacks of inventory, and shoppers -- well trained to buy stuff only when it is on sale -- must suddenly agree to pay full price just for the fun of it. This with five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
All those things, of course, are not likely to fall into place quite so neatly. 
 But retail experts agree that this could still be a decent holiday season, because at least part of that wish list will almost certainly come true. Add in the fact that Presidential election years are traditionally great for retailing no matter who wins, along with high levels of consumer confidence and new video games and apparel styles, and the prospects are even better.
"I think it will be a good Christmas," said Carl Steidtmann, an economist at Management Horizons, a consulting unit of Price Waterhouse L.L.P. "Retailers are set up to be more profitable. Levels of apparel inventory are very low, which puts less pressure on them to promote. There is a change between the balance of supply and demand that is better than we have seen in a long time."
Christmas is always the make-or-break season for retailers, and with the industry mired in tough times, it could well determine which American retailers will live and which will bite the dust. Merry-Go-Round has gone out of business and the Petrie Stores Corporation and the Caldor Corporation and others have filed for bankruptcy in the last year.
Indeed, it is highly unlikely that retailers could fare any worse this Christmas than they did in 1995, which -- barring recessions -- was the worst in a decade. The question is whether retailers can really reach the stellar sales gains of nearly 8 percent enjoyed in 1992, a goal some retail experts say is attainable, while others are keeping their growth estimates closer to a respectable 5 percent.
Some of last year's themes remain. High-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, owned by Saks Holdings Inc., Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General Inc., and luxury jewelry stores are positioned to rake in the cash from shoppers flush with gains from Wall Street's tireless bull market. Those retailers also have a monopoly on brand-name purses, belts and shoes, which shoppers have once again gone gaga for, just as they did a decade or so ago. "It is going to be much more intense this year in terms of brand awareness," Rose Marie Bravo, president of Saks Fifth Avenue, said. "We are really promoting anything 'lux.' Gucci, Chanel, Prada -- all the signature items."
On the opposite end, discount stores are also looking forward to a good season, as shoppers continue to hunt for bargains at the stores that have survived discounting's mergers and bankruptcy filings.
Merchants in the middle, particularly specialty stores that dot the country's malls, are still struggling. "The middle ground does not seem to be performing too well," Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, said. Mall-based stores -- ranging from the Limited to bath shops like Nature's Elements to record stores like those owned by the Musicland Stores Corporation, which announced earlier this week that it had hired Smith Barney to help it explore strategic alternatives -- have all had a tough few years, and are facing Christmas fearfully.
Toy sellers, bruised last year by the lack of fresh products, are already benefiting from the arrival of Nintendo 64. It went on sale in the United States on Sept. 29, and 350,000 were sold in the first five days. And tie-ins from films like "Space Jam," starring Michael Jordan, and Disney's live-action "101 Dalmatians," are expected to do well.
Sellers of educational toys -- stores with goofy names like Noodle Kidoodle and Zany Brainy -- have carved out only the tiniest piece of the market in recent years. But for the first Christmas ever, they are coming into their own.
"These stores are developing major hits of their own," said Frank Reysen Jr., editor of the trade journal Playthings, citing Beanie Babies and Stomp Rockets as runaway best sellers. Of course, Barbie, in all her incarnations, is flying out of conventional toy stores.
Even housewares shops, which had a mixed year, are looking for a good season. Several analysts call Williams-Sonoma Inc.'s stores hot, especially the Pottery Barn unit, which redesigned many stores this year to feature hip urban furniture at affordable prices.
Retailers will show "varying levels of performance," said Matthew Fassler, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, "but I am not looking for any disasters."
Shoppers have been pretty much sitting on their wallets since last Christmas. But it is not just an array of new offerings and a bunch of family members who would not take kindly to being forgotten at the holidays that will entice them into stores.
For one thing, pent-up demand for all types of goods seems inevitable, largely because retail spending continues has so far defied all other economic trends. While consumer confidence hit a six-year high in September and housing and car sales continue to be strong, retail spending, or same-store sales, has lagged month after month. When retailers report their results today for stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- the numbers are expected to be mediocre at best.
"It is hard to reconcile soft consumer spending numbers with the broader economic picture," Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said. "I just don't think the soft numbers can last."
Further, analysts and economists said, a stock market that remains strong in the third quarter and generally robust economic growth will help. "We are going to see stronger spending in the months ahead," Mr. Crandall said. "And if you go to a mall, you will see that the Christmas season started last week."
But just in case shoppers are not as eager as everyone hopes, retailers have taken measures to see that they are not served up a cash register full of coal. In an effort to reduce preseason promotions and after-Christmas sales, most are planning to keep inventory levels low.
"So far retailers have been more cautious with inventory levels in 1996 than they were at this time in '95," said Susan Silverstein, a retail analyst at Gruntal & Company. "Despite the fact that there was some buying resurgence in spring," she said, they did not load up on goods, so they can expect decent profits.
Most retailers insist they will not put their wares on sale before the holidays, but they are headed for the usual showdown against tough-minded shoppers enamored of sale signs. This year, as always, stores will almost certainly lose a few rounds of that game.
For example, toy retailers, still feeling last year's pressure from discounters, are expected to begin sales right after Thanksgiving. Some department stores and other apparel stores, while expected to enjoy renewed consumer interest in fall fashions, will also hit the price gun, retail experts said. "Promotions are going to be rampant," said Mr. Barnard, the consultant. "I have no doubt about it."
And while almost all the experts said there were still far too many stores for too few shoppers, the number of stores that have gone out of business has increased 7 percent for the year, according to Dun & Bradstreet reports, which has eliminated some competition.
Other stores are already on shaky ground. County Seat Inc., a private jeans store based in Dallas, has defaulted on bond interest payments and is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Musicland is also on thin ice, some analysts say, and recently retained an investment bank to help it explore its options.
There are other business fundamentals at work. Catalogue retailers got the cold shoulder from shoppers last season. But they also faced big increases in postage and paper costs, forcing them to limit the number of catalogues they sent, and this took a bite out of profits.
But with paper prices down, sometimes by nearly 40 percent, brace yourself for more catalogues, said Mark Marcon, a retail analyst at Cleary Gull Reiland & McDevitt in Milwaukee. "The expected return per catalogue doesn't have to be as high now," so revenues should rise, he said.
Anna Schryver, a spokeswoman for Lands' End Inc., the homey catalogue merchant in Dodgeville, Wis., said she is looking toward a good season, though she declined to give actual sales predictions. Last year, the company was biting its knuckles and hoping for the best, all while cursing postal rates. Mr. Marcon has increased his fourth-quarter earnings estimate for the company to 83 cents a share, from last year's 77 cents.
What could stand between retailers and shoppers' pocketbooks?
Well, there is the nettlesome issue of personal debt. While a three-year streak of high growth in consumer borrowing has seemed to slow, there is at least the perception that it is out of control, analysts said. Perhaps more troubling, personal bankruptcy filings have risen roughly 25 percent so far this year.
But many economists said the dangers of debt were exaggerated. "We are far enough away from the levels of debt of the late 80's," Mr. Crandall said, that it is hard "to make the case that people are tapped out."
Also, retailers have been lamenting a late Thanksgiving -- it falls on Nov. 28 this year, making the official shopping season five days shorter than last year. While this seems like a reasonable fear on paper, most retailers do not expect people to write off anyone on their shopping list to make up the time. What it might mean is fewer impulse purchases, simply because there is less time and quicker markdowns from retailers.
"The retailer will play a little bit of chicken with the customer to see how high the resistance level is to full price," Ms. Silverstein, the analyst, said. "But with five less shopping days, they can't extend that game as far as they would probably like."
So while many analysts are looking at 1992 for a benchmark for the season, many more said they will be happy to see a modest 3 to 5 percent sales increase, compared with last year. "We can live with 3 percent," Allen I. Questrom, chairman of Federated Department Stores, said. "We have learned over the years to make our projections smaller."
For a stocking stuffer, here are some oddball facts: Golf clothing and accessories are expected to sell splendidly. Cigar smoking, which had seemed to be a flash in the pan, has spawned its own retail boomlet. Humidors, cigars and other related supplies are hot. Mr. Potato Head, the poinsettia of Christmas toys, will now be sold in the form of a back scratcher. It can't be worse than last year's Kermit the Frog perfume.

Excerpts From Debate Between Vice President Gore and Jack Kemp

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the debate last night in St. Petersburg, Fla., between Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private company. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS.
 
MODERATOR
The order for everything was determined by a coin toss. So, we go now to the first question, and to Mr. Kemp: Some supporters of Senator Dole have expressed disappointment over his unwillingness in Hartford Sunday night to draw personal and ethical differences between him and President Clinton. How do you feel about it?
KEMP -- Bob Dole and myself do not see Al Gore and Bill Clinton as our enemy. We see them as our opponents. 
 This is the greatest democracy in the world. People are watching not only throughout this country, but all over the world as to how this democracy can function with civility and respect and decency and integrity.
Bob Dole is one of those men who's served in the United States Senate. His public life is a public record.
He fought on the battlefield. He has worked with Democrats and Republicans. In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally.
Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first. And I can't think of a better way of serving this nation in 1996 than by electing Bob Dole the president of the United States of America.
These issues are fully capable of being understood and reflected upon by the American people. This is a democracy in which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment rights in the history of mankind.
And Bob and I respect that. These issues will be aired, but they will be aired with dignity and respect, and ultimately leave it to the American people to make up their minds about who should be the leader of this country into the 21st century.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President.
GORE -- I would like to thank Jack Kemp for the answer that he just gave. I think we have an opportunity tonight to have a positive debate about this country's future.
I'd like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.
KEMP -- It's a deal. I can't even pronounce it.
GORE -- What I do want to talk about tonight is Bill Clinton's positive plan for America's future. We have a plan to balance the budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, creating millions of new jobs, including one million new jobs in America's inner cities.
I'm excited about the chance to talk about this plan and even more excited about the chance to work on it if you, the people of this country, will give Bill Clinton and me the privilege of doing so for four more years.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp?
KEMP -- I've really got only two differences with Bill Clinton, President Clinton, and Vice President Gore: foreign policy and domestic policy.
Our foreign policy is ambivalent, confusing. It is sending strong signals to the wrong people. And we have learned over the years that weakness is provocative.
The domestic economy is not doing what it can do. This president believes we're at our capacity. Bob Dole and I believe we can do a lot better.
It's about the potential of the American people to lift themselves up and not have their lives controlled by the United States Government in Washington.
 
Taxes
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, what do you see as the political philosophy differences in a general way between you and President Clinton on the one hand, and Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole on the other?
GORE -- The differences are very clear. We have a positive plan based on three principles. We want to provide opportunity for all Americans. We insist on responsibility being accepted in turn by everyone. And we want to strengthen our communities and their ability to support families and individuals in our common effort to create a bright future.
Here's how we plan to do that. We have a balanced budget plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income families. We've already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest-pressed working families in America.
Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for tuition at community college, junior college or college; a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition, for those who go further, so that in essence, no American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for college tuition.
Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers, tax encouragement for savings, and help in paying health care expenses. And a tax break -- actually, the elimination of capital gains taxes on the profits from the sale of a home.
All of this is within a balanced budget plan which protects Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.
KEMP -- Jim, this economy is overtaxed, overregulated. There are too many people suing each other. There's too much litigation. Our education is not up to the standards that the American family and the American people want for their children.
And clearly, the welfare system is a disgrace to our Judeo- Christian principles. It's not the values of the poor that should be called into question. It's the values of the welfare system from Washington and that prevents people from climbing out of poverty.
Our biggest debate with this administration on domestic policy is that they think we're at our fullest capacity, that we've reached our potential, and that 2.5 half percent growth is enough for America.
Frankly, that's just not good enough for this country. We cannot just run the clock out on the 20th century. It clearly -- we need to lower the tax rate across the board, on working and saving and investing.
I know, my friend Al will suggest that's trickle-down economics. Well Al, if it's trickle-down economics ask Van Woods, a young entrepreneur who owns a restaurant in Harlem, if it's trickle-down. He said he would hire 16 more people if we would cut the capital gain tax.
MODERATOR -- Time. Mr. Vice President.
GORE -- I talked about our positive agenda for the future a moment ago. Your original question was about the contrast.
The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky $550 billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families.
It would blow a hole in the deficit, cause much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, and knock our economy off track -- raising interest rates, mortgage rates and car payments.
We stopped that plan before. We will stop it again. We want a positive plan for growth and more jobs.
 
Families and Income
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, back to the philosophy question. Do you think there's a basic philosophy difference between these two tickets or is it about specifics, which both of you have talked about?
KEMP -- Well, this is a perfect example. Bob Dole and I want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every American working, saving, investing and taking risks in America.
All wealth is created and all growth is generated by risk taking entrepreneurs. The tax rate on capital in America is way too high. It's too high on the family. And it's particularly too high on working men and women.
The average family in America at a medium level of income probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the Federal Government. That's more than shelter, food, clothing and energy. That's just not right.
When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents -- we were one working family. One bread winner per family was all that was necessary. Now, if a woman wants to go to work or a man wants to go to work, it ought to be their choice, not the choice of the Washington, D.C. establishment.
Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore suggest that they'll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do. That isn't America. That's social engineering.
The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian sense, that work, honesty and integrity and contracts and property and investment and savings should be rewarded.
And Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the capital gains tax -- I'll be glad to talk about it a little bit later because there's not enough time. But we're going to repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the 7.5 million words with a flatter, fairer, simpler code. And that will take this country roaring into the 21st century.
GORE -- This risky tax scheme would blow a hole in the deficit. You don't have to take my word for it. Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, Business Week, 83 percent of hundreds of economists and a random survey just recently all said it would blow a hole in the deficit.
There's another feature that I would like to hear Mr. Kemp speak about. Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said that the plan -- the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families in America was unconscionable. That means it's wrong and it shouldn't happen.
I agree. It is still part of the plan. We believe that taxes should not be increased on the those families. We have a plan to cut taxes in middle-income families within a balanced budget plan, eliminating the deficit and protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp.
KEMP -- Every time this country in the 20th century has cut tax rates across the board, revenues went up, the economy grew. And I am surprised at this point in his career, that Vice President Gore and the President cannot understand that you get more revenue from a bigger pie.
And clearly creating more jobs reduces the social welfare drain, clearly makes more opportunity for capital to be invested in our inner cities. And frankly, Al, we shouldn't just tinker with the capital gain tax. We should eliminate it in the inner cities of America to put capital to work to make democratic capitalism and jobs available in our inner cities of the United States.
 
Affirmative Action
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, should Federal Government affirmative action programs be continued?
GORE -- Yes. President Clinton addressed this issue when he said, "Mend it. Don't end it."
Diversity is the great strength in America. Look around the world at other places where they have not paid attention to the necessity of promoting harmony between different ethnic, racial and religious and cultural groups.
We ought to be very proud in our country, as most Americans are, that we've made tremendous progress, but we ought to recognize that we have more work to do.
Now, the first thing that we are trying to do is to create a million new jobs in the inner cities of this country with tax credits for employers who hire people who are now unemployed. We are seeking to have vigorous enforcement of the laws that bar discrimination.
Now, I want a congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican Party over the years on this question. It is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day after he joined Senator Dole's ticket, he announced that he was changing his position and was hereto, thereafter going to adopt Senator Dole's position to end all affirmative action.
That's not good for our country. Bill Clinton and I believe that the United States of America has its brightest days ahead and we will see them even brighter if we promote diversity and harmony among all our people.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp?
KEMP -- Jim, my position on affirmative action has been clear ever since I left a professional football career for Congress in 1970. Some people think I quit playing a few years earlier, but I retired in 1970. My life has been dedicated to equality of opportunity, and our democracy should provide that, not equality of reward.
Affirmative action should be predicated upon need, not equality of reward, not equality of outcome. Quotas have always been against the American ideal.
We should promote diversity and we should do it the way Bob Dole has been talking about, with a new civil rights agenda based upon expanding access to credit and capital, job opportunities, educational choice in our inner cities for a young urban mother who can't get the type of an education she wants for her child, and ultimately the type of ownership and entrepreneurship from public housing residents in D.C. to Nickerson Gardens in Watts, Los Angeles.
People need to own. And that's what Abraham Lincoln believed. And when people own something, they have a stake in the American Dream. That is affirmative action in America.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President?
GORE -- With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action. There is a specific measure on the ballot in California. It was embodied in legislation introduced by Senator Dole to apply to the whole nation.
Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to fight against it and now has endorsed it.
I don't think it's a minor matter. I think this is one of the most important challenges that our country has to face in the future. And I hope that Mr. Kemp will try to persuade Senator Dole to adopt Mr. Kemp's position instead of the other way around.
 
Race
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, do we have a serious race problem in the United States right now?
KEMP -- Yes. We really do. This country has yet to deal with the type of inclusionary policies.
It is so very important for Americans -- white and black, Jew and Christian, immigrant and native born -- to sit down and talk and listen and begin to understand what it's like to come from that different perspective.
Our country is, as the Kerner Commission report, suggested a number of years ago, was being split, but they said between white and black. I think it's being split, Jim, not so much between white and black, although that's still a very serious problem.
KEMP -- We really have two economies. Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives -- a small d, Al.
It's capitalism and incentives for working and saving, and investing and producing, and of families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call the American Dream, but what is really universal.
But unfortunately, in urban America -- and I was glad to hear the Vice President talk a little bit about it -- they have abandoned the inner cities. There's a Socialist economy. There's no private housing. It's most public housing.
You're told where to go to school. You're told what to buy with food stamps. It is a welfare system that is more like a Third World socialist country than what we would expect from the world's greatest democratic, free-enterprise system. That must change, and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
GORE -- Remember what I said just a moment ago. If it were not so, he would have told you. The problems between races in America must be addressed. The good news is we're making progress.
We've seen 10.5 million new jobs created in the last four years. We've seen the unemployment rate come down dramatically. We've seen the African-American unemployment rate go below double digits for the first time in 25 years. And it's stayed below for 25 months in a row. We have empowerment zones and enterprise communities, 105 of them, in communities all across the United States of America.
Let me tell you a story about Joann Crowder in Detroit. She was on welfare for eight years until the empowerment zone was created there. She just got a job in the new business that launched its enterprise right in that empowerment zone. We want to do that for millions more all across the country.
KEMP -- Well with all due respect, Jim, there are nine empowerment zones, a few little tinkering with tax credits around the country for inner cities.
Los Angeles after the riots did not even get an empowerment zone, believe it or not. That's just unconscionable in America to have let Watts, South Central and East L.A. out.
Earl Graves of Black Enterprise Magazine said the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to capital, credit and ownership. That will change.
We will greenline every city in the United States where there's unemployment and welfare. And we will eliminate the capital gains tax and eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that takes a job.
That's the answer. Give ownership and entrepreneurship to low-income people based on need, not the color of their skin.
 
The Tax Code
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, you said recently that one of the problems related to this was that all the capital was in the hands of the white people.
What did you mean by that?
KEMP -- The single greatest problem, in our opinion, in the domestic economy is that this tax code, 83 years old, a relic of the cold war and hot war, inflation and Depression, 7.5 million words long, overtaxes capital, overtaxes working men and women and families. Clearly the Gordian Knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop.
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, as soon as we get through this first step of cutting tax rates across the board, are going to repeal the whole code. While Bill Clinton and my friend Al Gore defend the status quo, we're going to repeal the 7.5 million words of the U.S. Tax Code and make it once and for all tax income once, not twice, three, four -- and if you die it confiscates your estate. That's unacceptable.
We must have a tax code going into the 21st century that does not protect the establishment. And this tax code does. And by cutting and eliminating the capital gains, by cutting and eliminating the estate tax, by bringing the top tax rate down to something reasonable like -- here he goes again.
I think in peace time it shouldn't be higher. Bob and I don't think it should be higher than 25 percent -- be phased in.
The capital would flow out into the economy. We would have people giving access to capital. Small businessmen and women, African-American, Asian-Americans, Latino-Americans, female Americans would be able to start their businesses.
Dana Crist of Lancaster said the day the tax bill is passed in the Congress she will open a new factory with 40, or 50, or 60 employees in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He'll call that trickle-down. I call it Niagara Falls.
GORE -- The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the American economy in a barrel and send it over the falls.
It is a risky $550 billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on nine million of the hardest-working families. Again, Mr. Kemp opposed that and called it unconscionable. Now it is part of the plan that he is supporting.
Not only that, though, it would blow a hole in the deficit. It would raise interest rates. That means higher mortgage payments, particularly those with variable rate mortgages, higher car payments. It would also lead to much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It is extremely risky. And as for these harsh words, I don't take them personally.
He said much worse about Bob Dole when he said Bob Dole never met a tax that he didn't hike. He wrote about 450 separate provisions in that code. You better check with him before you eliminate it completely. He may be getting royalties.
KEMP -- Jim, a $550 billion tax cut -- this is something Al does not want to mention -- has be to viewed against the context of a $50 trillion U.S. economy output of goods and services over the next six years. A $550 billion tax cut and a $50 trillion economy over six years is 1.5 percent. And the only hole it would blow is a hole in the plans of this administration to try to tinker with the tax code and defend the indefensible. It would blow up the bureaucracy. But it would expand the economy. That's important for America.
 
Balancing the Budget
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, is it really possible to balance the budget without reforming drastically the entitlements programs, including Social Security and Medicare?
KEMP -- Before I answer that, Jim, let me just say, it is disgraceful, the campaign being waged to scare the American senior citizens in this state and my home state of -- well, New York and California -- about Medicare.
GORE -- There's one other one in there, isn't there?
KEMP -- And Maryland now.
The amount of money being spent to try to mislead the American people is demagoguery. And only in the Clinton White House and in Al Gore's mind could an increase in spending per capita on a senior citizen, from $4,800 in 1996 to $7,200 over the next five years be considered a cut.
KEMP -- Does anybody think that Bob Dole, who almost gave his life for his country, who has served in the Senate, who helped save Social Security, who crawled out of a foxhole on Riva Ridge in Northern Italy in 1945 to save a wounded radio man, does anybody think in this country that he could possibly want to move our country ahead and leave anybody behind?
Of course, we can balance the budget. Of course, we have to hold down the growth in entitlement spending. But clearly, you cannot balance the budget, Jim, without growing this economy. It's only growing at about 2.5 percent. We should double the rate of growth, and we should double the size of the American economy. This means more jobs, more wealth, more income and more capital, particularly for our nation's poor and those left behind.
GORE -- Mr. Lehrer, our balanced budget plan extends the Medicare Trust Fund 10 years into the future. A commission is fine. But a commission would not do any good if we adopted this risky $550 billion tax scheme.
The word scary has been used.
A couple of days ago, I went with Governor Lawton Chiles, who is here, to Sarasota, to the Friendship Senior Center. I talked with a woman there named Dorothy Warnell. And she said, you know, we may not be as sophisticated as some of those people in Washington, but we can add and subtract.
Here are the numbers she's adding and subtracting:
Bob Dole's plan would have already imposed an extra $268 on the average, Medicare-receiving couple. And his plan would have doubled deductibles. It would have cost an extra $1,700 over the lifetime of his plan and eliminated nursing home standards and guarantees of nursing home care for seniors.
Bill Clinton prevented it from happening. We will never allow that to happen.
KEMP -- Jim, Medicare is too important to senior citizens around this country to play the type of politics that is being played on this issue. It is losing $8 billion as we stand here tonight.
By the president's own trustees of Medicare, three members of which serve in his cabinet, it will be losing $23 billion a year by 1998.
Something must be done. Bob Dole suggested a commission.
But, clearly, you cannot save Medicare, Social Security or any program of the social welfare net of American people under which they should not be allowed to fall, unless we grow this economy at at least twice the rate it's growing today.
That is the issue, not scaring people in America.
 
Medicare and Social Security
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, Mr. Kemp has accused you of demagoguery.
GORE -- Well, as I said before, he used much harsher language when he talked about Bob Dole.
He said that Bob Dole's solution for every single problem was to increase taxes. He said just two years ago that the Bob Dole tax increase of 1982 was the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
But let's get to the point. Medicare has been adjusted 23 times since it was created in 1965. Bob Dole incidentally just bragged this year that he was one of only 12 people who voted against the creation of Medicare in the first place.
I don't think he's -- he didn't believe in it then. And the plan that he promoted last year would have certainly been devastating to Medicare.
Again, don't take my word for it. The American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700 hospitals. The Catholic Health Association, the A.A.R.P. and many other groups who pay careful attention to Medicare said that the Dole-Gingrich plan on Medicare would have led to deep cuts, possibly set up a two-tiered system and would have ended the kind of Medicare system that we have.
Our plan extends Medicare 10 years into the future. We will always protect Medicare within the context of a balanced-budget plan.
KEMP -- Folks, they have no plan. They have absolutely no plan. The President himself suggested that the reduction in the growth of Medicare over the next five or six years ought to be held to 6 percent. Under the Republican plan, irrespective of the numbers, it will grow at 7 or even more percent.
But that is beside the point. What has to be discussed is how we, as a nation, are going to create the size of an economy, create a national wealth that would at least double this $6- or $7-trillion economy, we would have $6 trillion dollars in 15 years, extra wealth for the American people.
Another trillion dollars of revenue with which to save Medicare, Social Security. And you can't do it with a tax code and a regulatory code and people suing each other with frivolous suits as this Administration is allowing to happen. That has to change and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
GORE -- I think Mr. Kemp has unintentionally made a mistake in saying that President Clinton called for a reduction to 6 percent, or whatever you said.
I believe you're referring to the Money Magazine interview. And the publisher of Money magazine just sent Mr. Kemp a letter two days ago asking him to please stop inaccurately citing Money magazine. It is not what the President said. It is not the President's position.
Let me make clear what his position is. We will save Medicare. We will stop efforts to hurt Medicare and we'll do it within a balanced-budget plan.
 
Abortion
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, what, if anything, would a Dole-Kemp Administration do to change the current legal status of abortion in this country?
KEMP -- I will answer the question. But for the record, I would like to release the letter to our friends in the press of the letter I got from Money magazine suggesting that Bill Clinton wanted and did lower the cost of living allowance for senior citizens as a way of reducing Social Security.
Putting that aside, we recognize there's no consensus in America. This country is split between those who call themselves pro-choice -- and I'm sure very sincerely -- and those of us who call ourselves pro-life.
This is a very emotional issue. I'm sure it is for a woman. It certainly for those of us like my wife and myself who have three adopted grandchildren. We thank God every night of our lives that a young woman was given a choice, was given the opportunity to choose life.
This country should not be torn asunder over this debate. It has to be carried out with civility and respect. And Bob and I believe it can be.
But we should recognize that every human life is precious, and there should be all of the protection that we can give for an unborn human being.
And to think that in this country, for every three births there is one abortion. But even worse than that, as ugly as that might be -- and I know it's a tragedy to many people both on the pro-choice and pro-life position -- we have a President who vetoed a Congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she enters the world. That is unacceptable.
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President?
GORE -- President Clinton has made it clear that he will sign legislation outlawing procedures such as this, if there is an exception to protect the health of the mother where serious health consequences such as the inability to have any further children are involved and her doctor advises her so.
What is really at stake is here is whether or not women will have the right to choose. The platform on which Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are running pledges a constitutional amendment to take away a woman's right to choose and to have the Government come in and order that woman to do what the Government says no matter what the circumstances.
Mr. Kemp has voted 47 out of 47 times to have such an amendment and to restrict this completely no matter what the circumstances, even where rape and incest is involved. We will never allow a woman's right to choose to be taken away.
KEMP -- There is no consensus. A constitutional amendment would not pass. We must use persuasion not intimidation. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp will try to remind the American people what a tremendous asset our children are and why there should be protection for innocent human life including that of the unborn.
But to think that this Administration vetoed the one chance they had to ban that practice without working with people in the Congress who would have loved to have had the opportunity to stop that gruesome practice is just unacceptable to the American people. And Bob Dole would never have vetoed that ban on partial- birth abortion in the third trimester of a woman's pregnancy.
 
Haiti
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, Senator Dole has criticized the President on Haiti. He said he handled that wrong. What did he do wrong?
KEMP -- Well, it was Bob Dole that suggested that there be a fact-finding commission. President Carter was on it. Colin Powell was on it.
You cannot say, in our opinion, that Haiti is a great success. Clearly it was maybe the right thing to do. But we did not go in with enough information. We caused problems in the first place by denying Caribbean countries and third world countries a chance to trade freely in the United States. It causes economic problems and turmoil.
And then we turn around, as we did in Mexico, having to bail them out. We caused the problem in the first place. And it cost us $20 to $50 billion to bail them out.
Haiti is very ambiguous at best. We pray that democracy comes to Haiti. But so far the message from Haiti is quite ambiguous, not withstanding the declaration of victory by this Administration.
GORE -- Well, I didn't hear anything wrong. The fact is we restored democracy to Haiti. When I say restored, actually it's the first real democracy that Haiti has ever had. And it happened with scarcely any shots being fired.
I was in the Oval Office the night when President Clinton dispatched our troops from Fort Bragg. It was a tense moment. The planes were in the air, and our negotiators were talking with the dictator down there. And when that dictator got the news from his spies outside the gate that all these planes were taking off, he said, let's get out of here.
That's how it was done. It was one of the most deft uses of diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find anywhere in the annals of the history of this country. I was so proud of our President in the way he handled that. And the result so far is excellent. And we hope and pray that it will remain that way.
KEMP -- Many more results like Bosnia and Haiti and Mexico and the Middle East and we won't have much success.
One of the most serious problems was the tremendous effort by this Administration to force on Mexico a devaluation of the peso. The economy has dropped by almost 40 to 50 percent. Then we go in and bail them out. We cause the problem, and then we have to bail them out.
We should have a foreign policy that is predicated upon trade, on spreading democracy, by giving people opportunities to trade freely with us and making sure that everybody recognizes the rule of the -- the Golden Rule, to do unto others as you would have then do unto you.
Diplomacy first, and don't bomb before breakfast.
 
Mexico
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, Mexico. We caused the problem and then had to go in and bail them out?
GORE -- No. That's not right. When Mr. Kemp started talking about the Golden Rule, I thought he was going to talk about the gold standard again.
That used to be an integral part of this so-called supply-side economics. But it may be something else that he now agrees with Bob Dole on, because Bob Dole voted to take us off the gold standard -- a wise vote in my opinion. Most all economists say that if we did that it would throw us into a deep recession or depression and throw millions out of work.
But let me come directly to this question.
No. When there was a crisis involving the Mexican peso, again President Bill Clinton showed bold and dynamic leadership.
I want to hasten to add that Senator Bob Dole gave critical bipartisan support at the time. He agreed with the President. He supported the President. He said this is a wise move.
He could not get a majority in the Senate and Speaker Gingrich could not get a majority in the House to go on record in support of it. So the President, as Presidents often have to do, went alone and did the right thing.
You know, people said it was a big risk at that time. We've ended up making a $500 million profit. All of the loans have been paid back.
We're using that $500 million to further reduce the deficit. It's come down 60 percent already. It's going down even more toward a balanced budget. And this is helping.
KEMP -- It's unbelievable that we could cause a drop in the standard of living of a friendly country like Mexico by nearly 40 to 50 percent. Unemployment goes up. We send U.S. tax dollars and IMF monies to Mexico and we make a profit. At that level, that gives new meaning to the word profitability for U.S. foreign policy.
The pain, the suffering, the unemployment, the bankruptcies, the loss of the standard of living, the people who have had to come across the border of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. If that's our foreign policy for the third world or Latin America, I believe, more than ever, we've got to elect a president who understands trade, who understands honest money, who understands private enterprise, who understands democratic capitalism, not socialism caused by the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration.
GORE -- Well, I fail to understand the basis of the charge that we caused the monetary crisis in Mexico. They manage their own monetary policy. Years ago we used to hear this phrase in American politics, the blame America first crowd.
I never liked that phrase. But if it was going to be applied today, it would have to be applied to this statement.
The United States of America shouldn't be blamed for the management of Mexico's monetary policy. We helped our neighbor in an hour of need and they survived. They're stronger. They're coming back. They paid us back. And we got a dividend in the process.
 
The Environment
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, some Democrats have charged that the environment would be in jeopardy if Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are elected. Do you share that fear?
GORE -- I certainly do. Let me first say that in citing John F. Kennedy's tax cut in the 1960's, I want to also remind you that Mr. Kemp has pointed out in the past, Bob Dole was in the Congress then. He was one of those who voted against John F. Kennedy's tax cut.
The environment faces dire threats from the kind of legislation that Senator Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to pass by shutting down the Government and attempting to force President Clinton to accept it.
They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to come into the Congress and literally rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.
President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks. We have a positive agenda on the environment because we believe very deeply that it's about our children and our future. Clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste sites when millions of children live within one mile of them -- that's important.
We have a plan to clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste sites in America over the next four years. We've already cleaned up more in the last three years than the previous two Administrations did in 12.
The President just set aside the Utah National Monument. He is protecting the Everglades here in Florida. Bob Dole is opposed to that plan.
President Bill Clinton will protect our environment and prevent the kind of attacks on it that we saw in the last Congress and that are including in the Republican platform.
KEMP -- And so will Bob Dole. I mean, Al, get real. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1932 that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
The only thing, Jim, they have to offer is fear -- fear of the environment, fear of the climate, fear of the Medicare, fear of Newt, fear of Republicans, fear of Bob, and probably fear of cutting tax rates.
They ain't seen nothing yet.
Look, we recognize that this country has to live in balance with our environment. Every one of us who have children and grandchildren recognize how we have to reach a balance.
It is not jobs versus our environment. Both are important. This is the most over-regulated, overly litigated economy in our nation's history. And to call a businessman or woman who sits down and has a chance to express his or her interest in how to make these laws work and call them a polluter is just outrageous. It is typical of the anti-capitalistic mentality of this Administration. That will change because we believe in democratic capitalism for everybody.
GORE -- There are lots of jobs to be created in cleaning up the environment. All around the world we're seeing problems that people want to solve. Because they love their children, they want them to be able to drink clean water and breathe clean air. They don't want them to live next to toxic waste sites.
When the United States of America takes the lead in protecting the environment, we do right by our children and we also create new business opportunities, new jobs, new sources of prosperity for the United States of America. And we're going about it in a common sense way.
 
Regulation
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, you mentioned already before and you'd said on "Meet the Press" Sunday that the Federal Government engages in "regulation reign of terror." What exactly do you mean?
KEMP -- Well, exactly just what I said. Regulations that would take property or reduce the value of some farmer or rancher or homeowner's property, or wetlands or endangered specie and take that property or reduce its value without compensating the owner, that is a reign of terror. It's happening.
In Oregon not too long ago, a farmer took 25 percent of his property and declared it a wetland. It had the runoff of snow that allowed it to be declared a wetland. But he did it himself, voluntarily.
He found within a couple of years that the bald eagle began to use it as a habitat. The Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all of the Federal agencies came onto his property, declared it a Federal wetland and said he couldn't drive. They took away the road. He couldn't mend his fences. And they wouldn't pay the value of the loss of the -- they wouldn't pay, or compensate, I should say, for the loss of value to that property.
How can we as a free society turn people into enemies or adversaries of the United States government? OSHA does it, E.P.A. does it, ERDA does it, and you name it. We should recognize that this country should live in such a way as to build an alliance with our free enterprise system that can build a better America for our children and our grandchildren. We can do it, but it's got to take new leadership in Washington.
GORE -- Well, it takes values that recognize the importance of the environment. Mr. Kemp voted against the Clean Water Act, voted against the renewal of the Superfund Act.
We have been taking a new approach: protecting the environment but getting rid of unnecessary regulations. We're eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations.
We've entered into a new project called Project XL -- this is at the EPA -- where we enter into a bargain with businesses. When they say, "we'll exceed the standards," we say, "give the EPA a way to measure the progress and then throw away the rule book altogether."
Now, this is the kind of common sense approach that can clean up the environment while eliminating unnecessary red tape. Make no mistake about it though. There are those who would like to go much further. Some have even proposed -- and this bill he cites would do it -- that polluters ought to be paid if they agree to stop dumping poisons into the river.
The pay polluters provision is wrong. We fought against it. We'll never allow that.
KEMP -- When I went to Congress from Buffalo in 1970, you could almost walk across Lake Erie because of the pollution. Today, thanks to the secondary and tertiary treatment plants which many of us voted for on both sides of the aisle -- which actually started under Richard Nixon, a Republican President -- our water is cleaner in the Great Lakes.
We've got a lot of progress that we've made, and we've got to make more. But to turn the country into a regulatory effort by the Federal Government, to suggest that we can't work in harmony, A., with the environment, and with business, is a big mistake.
 We should use incentives, not always using sticks against business in America and the jobs that it creates.
 
Civility
MODERATOR -- Mr. Kemp, some are saying these days that something's gone terribly wrong with the American soul, that we've become too mean, too selfish, too uncaring. And the spitting incident, how it was handled, the baseball player is used as a recent example. What do you think about that?
KEMP -- Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country, has to be one of the greatest and most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st century.
How in the name of American democracy can we say to Eastern Union, a democratic capitalism will work there if we can't make it work in East LA, or East Harlem or east Palo Alto, California?
How can we tell South Africa and the new Mandela government that democracy and private property and limited government and the rule of law and civility will work there if it is not working in our own backyard here at home or in the South Bronx?
USA Today just a few weeks ago did a study. They said the affluent are doing very well in America, the "haves." But the "have- nots" and the poor are being left behind.
It's a giant, in my opinion, zero-sum game, kind of like musical chairs when we were young boys and girls growing up and it seemed like when the music stopped, the big guy elbowed out the little guy from that last chair.
That's not America, folks. We need more chairs. We need a bigger table. We need a greater banquet. We need to create more wealth. We need to create more jobs and more access to credit and capital and educational choice, and opportunity for any man or woman and child to be what God meant them to be, not what Washington, D.C., wants them to be.
GORE -- I think, Mr. Lehrer, that throughout much of his career, Jack Kemp has been a powerful and needed voice against the kind of coarseness and incivility that you referred to in the question.
I think it's an extremely valuable service to have a voice within the Republican Party who says we ought to be one nation. We ought to cross all of the racial and ethnic and cultural barriers. I think that is a very important message to deliver.
And we ought to speak out against these violations of civility when they do occur.
You asked about the incident involving Roberto Alomar. I won't hesitate to tell you what I think. I think he should have been severely disciplined, suspended perhaps, immediately. I don't understand why that action was not taken.
But the same could be said of so many incidents in all kinds of institutions in our society. But I compliment Mr. Kemp for the leadership he has shown in moving us away from that kind of attitude.
KEMP -- Well I thank you, Al. I mean that very, very sincerely.
But I'm trying to make a bigger point, that civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American Dream -- that if you're born in this country to be a mezzo-soprano or a master carpenter or a school teacher, like my daughter, or a professional football quarterback, nothing should be in your way.
And removing those barriers is what Bob Dole is all about -- moving our country forward and leaving no one behind.
 
Community
MODERATOR -- Mr. Vice President, do you agree with that thesis, that in order to solve the problem of civility, the problems of the American soul, you have to -- it's an economic problem more than it is something else?
GORE -- I think that economics is one of the single most important parts of this problem. That's why we're focusing on tax credits to hire one million more people coming off welfare in the inner city.
That's why we're focusing on an economic policy that has already created 10.5 million new jobs and is going to create millions more, within the context, again, of a balanced budget that protects important programs. We have focused especially on the most distressed areas because we cannot leave anyone behind.
Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the Small Business Administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past -- these are parts of the plan.
Another part of it is the community development financial institutions and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities, say, should be kept in the community -- not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there.
That prevents that money being taken from the community and invested in some go-go investment on the other side of the world. And when they invest in the community, they find that there's a better payback rate, more small businesses are created and the community improves.
That's happening in America today -- not fast enough, but faster than before. And we think we can accelerate it with our plan.
KEMP -- There really is no separation between a strong community and a strong economy. And you can't have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families.
The word "economics" in Greek came from the word "family" or law or custom of the family.
A family without a job, where both bread winners are away from home and they cannot spend time with their children, or can't send the child to the school of their choice, rather than just the choice of the Federal bureaucracy, cannot possibly be as strong as a family that has the nurture, the love, the dignity and the justice that goes along with one bread winner, a strong job. And if that man or woman wants to work, it's their choice, not just to pay taxes.
So we need both. We need strong community -- we need strong schools. We need schools that nurture the type of discipline and respect from teachers and parents. And Bob Dole wants to empower the public school districts and the teachers, not the Federal bureaucracy at the Department of Education.
GORE -- Well, Senator Dole has said that he wants to abolish the Department of Education. He voted against the creation of Head Start. He vigorously opposed the Family and Medical Leave Act which was the first law that President Clinton signed as President.
Now Senator Dole has suggested that he would repeal the Family and Medical Leave Act if he had the chance if he was elected President.
We believe in more educational opportunity and measures to strengthen families, not restrict their access to education.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE;
Economy Dominates Kemp-Gore Debate

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and his Republican challenger, Jack Kemp, faced off last night in a 90-minute debate that presented voters with rival economic messages and partisan cross-sniping over social issues like abortion and affirmative action that have received scant airing in the Presidential contest.
"Bill Clinton and Al Gore suggest that they'll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do," Mr. Kemp said. "That isn't America. That's social engineering." 
 Mr. Gore, an old colleague of Mr. Kemp in their Congressional days, repeatedly denounced Bob Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut. "This risky $550 billion tax scheme would blow a hole in the deficit," he warned, using the word "risky" as an anti-Dole mantra throughout the discourse.
While the debate was anticipated by some political handicappers as a peek at the potential Presidential choice for the year 2000, both men sought to hew loyally to the agendas of their principals on this year's tickets. Reporters inside the debating hall sensed a mood of earnestness more than visceral fire in the two debaters, and noted that midway through the evening one or two members of the audience had their eyes closed as if in meditation or even, perhaps, in sleep. [Excerpts, pages B14-15.]
At the outset, the two candidates declared a truce of sorts on the character issue that Mr. Dole had said he regretted not raising in last Sunday's debate with Mr. Clinton.
"In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally," Mr. Kemp said. "These issues will be aired, but they'll be aired with dignity, respect and ultimately leave it to the American people to make up their minds."
Mr. Gore thanked Mr. Kemp, saying the Democratic ticket would not consider their rivals as "the enemy," but would seek a full and civil debate before the voters.
While the economy remained the centerpiece of the debate, held in the Mahaffrey Theater in St. Petersburg, Fla., their topics ranged across a variety of concerns, including abortion, foreign policy and even to an incident preceding the current baseball playoffs, in which Roberto Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles' second baseman, cursed and spat on an umpire over a disputed strike call.
"He should have been severely disciplined," Mr. Gore said with a stern look, apparently having rehearsed even this question in the long days of debate preparation. He used it to denounce uncivility in American life.
Mr. Kemp's criticism of the Administration extended to one of the President's proudest programs, the Family Leave and Medical Leave Act, which Democratic pollsters find very popular with the women voters that both candidates are targeting. "I wouldn't have voted for it; it's in place," in the voluntary practices of employers, argued the Republican challenger, accusing the Administration of driving "this wedge between workers and management."
But Mr. Gore slowly dwelled on the law's merits and said eagerly, as if delighted that his Republican opponent had criticized it, "We now want to extend it."
On the CNN "Larry King Live" program after the debate, Pat Choate, the running mate of the Reform Party's Presidential candidate, Ross Perot, gave Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp low marks. "Both of the guys dealt with symptoms and not the vital problems," Mr. Choate said. "They got into a bidding war with the American public on what they would do -- $1,500 tax credit, 15 percent tax break, a little of this, a little of that. They didn't touch the issues."
For Mr. Gore and Mr. Kemp, loyalty to the top of the ticket was the hallmark of the evening, with the Republican challenger repeatedly describing Mr. Dole's war wounds as a heroic measure of the sort of leadership the nation needed. The Vice President said he was proud of Mr. Clinton for various reasons, including his foreign policy and his stewardship of the economy.
Tactically, Mr. Gore sought to defend Mr. Clinton from his opponent's criticism by recalling Mr. Kemp's own past attacks on Mr. Dole in earlier political battles. "He said much worse about Bob Dole when he said Bob Dole never met a tax that he didn't hike," Mr. Gore declared with a slow smile of tolerance.
Mr. Kemp, who seemed intent on slowing his normally rapid speaking pace, accused the Administration of "demagoguery" in using "fear" to try and panic older voters with assertions that Republicans endanger the health of the Medicare program.
"Al, get real," he declared, complaining to the moderator, Jim Lehrer, that "the only thing they have to offer is fear."
But the Vice President replied by reciting a bit of the Dole record when Mr. Kemp praised President John F. Kennedy's 1962 tax cut for stirring economic growth. He emphasized that Mr. Dole "was one of those who voted against the John F. Kennedy tax cut."
Again and again, as Mr. Gore cited data showing a growing economy, Mr. Kemp contended that the current rate of economic growth could be doubled under a Republican administration. "This economy is overtaxed and over-regulated," he said. "We cannot just run the clock out on the 20th century."
The Republican vowed to overhaul the tax code and crimp the capital gains tax in a Dole administration to spur greater growth. "He'll call it trickle down," Mr. Kemp said, smiling at Mr. Gore. "I'll call it Niagara Falls."
Mr. Gore seized the image to predict that a Dole administration would "put the American economy in a barrel and send it over the falls," a remark that drew one of the evening's few audience reactions, laughter, discernible on television.
On the abortion issue, which Mr. Dole has sought to play down in his centrist-oriented campaign, Mr. Kemp said "this country should not be torn asunder" by it. But he added, "We have a President who vetoed a Congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she enters life."
He was referring to a form of late-term abortion that the Administration has said was improperly prescribed in a Congressional measure.
The two politicians ended their debate as they began, on firm notes of fealty to their Presidential candidates. "He's been through the Valley of the Shadow," Mr. Kemp said in urging the election of Mr. Dole.
Mr. Gore, with a parting intonation of the word "risky" in describing his Republican rivals, finally evoked the President's campaign signature. "We want to build a bridge to the 21st century," he said, using the bridge image but once in one of the surprises of the evening.
Mr. Kemp and Mr. Gore also quarreled over affirmative action programs, as the Vice President noted that Mr. Kemp had been a supporter of such programs until he was selected by Mr. Dole as his running mate. The former Senator had introduced legislation in Congress to abolish all affirmative action programs in the Federal Government.
"I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican Party over the years on this question," Mr. Gore said, before going on to note his opponent's change in position. "That's not good for this country. Bill Clinton and I believe that the United States of America has its brightest days ahead, and we will see them brighter if we promote diversity and harmony."
Mr. Kemp asserted that he had not changed his position, and argued that he had been dedicated to "equality of opportunity and our democracy should provide that -- not equality of rewards. Affirmative action should be credited on need."
Mr. Kemp said his views on affirmative action were based on the racial policies that had been pushed by Lincoln. "People need to own something," Mr. Kemp said. "When people own something they have a stake in the American dream. That's what Lincoln believed."
"With all due respect," Mr. Gore responded, "I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted" a policy that would end affirmative action.
Asked whether the Federal budget could be balanced without tackling Medicare, the huge Federal health program for the elderly, Mr. Kemp insisted that it could, and then accused the Democrats of scaring elderly Americans with their charges that Mr. Dole would cut their benefits. He called them "disgraceful" and accused Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore of "demagoguery."
Mr. Kemp said a man who had nearly lost his life in war and crawled out of a foxhole to save a wounded radio man would never "leave anybody behind" in efforts to balance the budget. He said that it was possible to reach a balance by holding down the growth of programs like Medicare but that it was essential to double the growth of the economy.
On foreign policy, Mr. Kemp attacked the Administration's policies as "ambiguous, contradictory and precipitous," but seemed to have trouble articulating his specific criticisms. Asked by the moderator, for example, about the Clinton effort to return democracy to Haiti, Mr. Kemp said, "You cannot say in our opinion that Haiti was a great success," but then added, "Clearly, it was perhaps the right thing to do."
On the environment, an area that Mr. Gore has made his specialty, Mr. Kemp assailed what he said was a "reign of terror" by overzealous Federal regulatory agencies, which he said barred businesses and landowners from developing their property.
"The only thing they have to offer," he said of the Clinton Administration, "is fear, fear of the environment, fear of the climate, fear of Newt, fear of Republicans, fear of Bob Dole."
But Mr. Gore used the question to attack Republican environmental policies, saying the environment faces "dire threats from the kind of legislation Bob Dole and Speaker Gingrich invited by shutting down the Government. They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to rewrite the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act."

HEADLINE: Dole's Positive Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis's disparaging of Bob Dole's tax plan ("Pie in the Sky," column, Oct. 7) should not go unanswered, since the plan is the major proposal in a campaign many in the media ridicule as full of negatives.
Contrary to Mr. Lewis, the Dole plan was not unveiled at the San Diego convention, but 10 days earlier in Chicago. The "supply-side doctrine" Mr. Lewis reports Mr. Dole embracing is not the "puerile fantasy" that "reducing rates would increase tax revenue." Indeed, Mr. Dole makes clear that under his plan less than one-third of the loss in tax receipts will be made up from economic growth and changes in taxpayer behavior. The rest will be made up by slowing the rate of growth in Federal spending. 
 Now for some simple arithmetic. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that total Federal spending in the fiscal year 1996 is $1,566 billion. Under last June's Congressional budget plan, spending for fiscal 2002 is $1,842 billion. The Dole plan will reduce this to $1,783 billion -- but that's still 13.9 percent more than in 1996.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, base-line spending on interest, Social Security, Medicare and defense (the only items that are "off the table" under the Dole plan) rises from $1,035 billion in 1996 to $1,225 billion in 2002, an 18.4 percent increase. Under the Dole plan, net spending on other programs rises from $584 billion to $664 billion, or 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips Against the Yen, Hurt by the Slump in Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen yesterday, hurt by a continued slump in United States bonds that raised concern that foreign investors might pare their American holdings.
"The bond market selloff signaled foreign exchange traders to sell dollars," said Charles Spence, director of foreign exchange at the Standard Chartered Bank. 
 The dollar also suffered against the yen as Japanese investors, who have supported the currency of late, were absent from the market because of a national holiday, Health Sports Day.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 111.15 yen, down from 111.55 yen on Wednesday. The British pound edged up to $1.5665 from $1.5650. But the dollar rose to 1.5382 German marks from 1.5287.
The dollar erased an early drop against the mark after a Bundesbank official denied there was a rift between the central bank and Finance Minister Theo Waigel over European monetary union.
The denial followed a report yesterday in the German weekly magazine Die Zeit that Bundesbank officials feared a "crisis of confidence" for the union, unless European Union officials went further toward adopting German proposals for tough penalties on countries that slide from the economic requirements of the union.
"The denial helped push the dollar back up," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, a currency trader at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.
The plans for monetary union include the introduction of a single currency, the Euro, on Jan. 1, 1999. Signs of progress toward union hurt the mark because the Euro will replace it as Europe's benchmark currency.
The mark also suffered from continued speculation that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia might have died. While Russian officials denied such talk yesterday, speculation persisted among traders.
"People are still wondering what's going on with Yeltsin," said Seth Garrett, director of foreign exchange at CS First Boston.
Political turmoil in Russia hurts the mark because Germany is Russia's largest creditor and trading partner. The Swiss franc also benefited from the speculation, because the currency is treated as a safe haven in times of international turmoil.

THE INHERITANCE
How Three Families and America Moved From Roosevelt to Reagan and Beyond
By Samuel G. Freedman
464 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27.50.
 At noon on Election Day in 1994, Tim Carey, one of the central figures of Samuel G. Freedman's new book, is sitting in a bar in Crotonville, N.Y., eating baked clams and predicting victory for George E. Pataki. "We're gonna win," he assures his companion. "Forty-eight to forty-four. By God, my third chance at governor. Oughta get one. Just one."
The victory came off as promised, ending two decades of Democratic gubernatorial control, and it is the central event both of Mr. Carey's political life and of "The Inheritance," Mr. Freedman's saga of three working-class American families and their steady migration out of the Democratic Party in the 60 years that separate Franklin D. Roosevelt from Bill Clinton and Herbert H. Lehman from Mario M. Cuomo. 
 Tim Carey's grandmother was a dirt-poor Irish immigrant who worshiped F.D.R. and the W.P.A. and trudged the precincts of Crotonville door to door in every Democratic campaign in which she had the energy to walk. His mother was a housekeeper who married a butcher and professed little interest in politics on either side.
But Tim Carey himself, born in 1947, grew up to be not only a Republican but also a tough, pragmatic political professional, a master of phone banks and turnout data and a participant in the losing gubernatorial campaigns of Perry B. Duryea in 1978 and Lewis Lehrman in 1982, and in the ultimate revenge of Pataki vs. Cuomo in 1994.
Mr. Carey's story roughly parallels the two others that Mr. Freedman tells in copious but engaging detail over the course of more than 400 pages. Frank Trotta Jr. is the grandson of a plumber who was so dedicated to his union that he placed its welfare above all other concerns in life, even, at times, those of his family. Leslie Maeby's grandfather was a Democratic ward boss and city councilman in Baltimore. By the 1980's, both of them are, like Mr. Carey, not only dedicated conservatives, but also seasoned campaign veterans who draw from the Republican Party moral sustenance and regular paychecks.
What were the ingredients of the transformation? That is the question Mr. Freedman's book was written to resolve, and he works on it patiently and judiciously, avoiding the trap of oversimplification. Each of his stories offers its own nuances and lessons.
Mr. Trotta came to conservative politics by way of patriotism. While his high school classmates in New Rochelle, N.Y., were marching against the Vietnam War, he was organizing in support of it, deeply offended by the challenge to flag and country.
Ms. Maeby was a rebel against the counterculture. She reached college in the early 1970's, took one look at the prevalence of drugs and casual sex and decided to cast her lot with the traditional values of her upstate New York suburban family.
Mr. Carey's migration had more to do with economics. Not long after graduation from the State University of New York at Albany, he took a job with Mr. Lehrman, the drugstore magnate, and found himself agreeing with Mr. Lehrman's speeches in favor of supply-side economics.
But all three of these baby-boom conservatives have one feeling in common. They are convinced that there is something corrupt and stale about the Democratic Party their grandparents believed in, and they want no part of it. Each of them sees the Democrats as the party of crooked machines, crooked unions and undeserved welfare benefits, and comes to regard the Republican Party as the instrument of middle-class freedom and opportunity. All three spend a good portion of their young adult years working in or near the New York Legislature, and all three come away from the experience disgusted.
The weaknesses of the Legislature are, of course, not entirely chargeable to the Democrats -- the State Senate was and is a fiefdom of entrenched Republican power. Indeed, Mr. Trotta ultimately projects his disgust onto both parties: after his political mentor, State Senator Joseph R. Pisani, is indicted on charges of income-tax evasion, Mr. Trotta retreats to his law practice and swears off active politics for good.
The other two, however, reach a different conclusion. If there is something corrupt and sleazy about American politics in the declining years of the 20th century, they feel, then it is the Democratic Party that most reflects that sleaziness, committed as they believe it is to budgetary waste and riddled with lifetime professional politicians who have done little besides campaign and hold office in their entire adult lives.
And here is a curious paradox that Mr. Freedman, the author of two other nonfiction books and a former reporter for The New York Times, never quite articulates. The three central figures in the book are rebels against the edifice of big government and the political establishment it has spawned. And yet they are unmistakable creatures of that establishment, despite the partisan choices they have made. They, too, are lifers in the system, whether they set out to be or not. They reach middle age struggling to reconcile their visceral antagonism to government with their equally deep-rooted enthusiasm for the political game itself.
This phenomenon is not confined to New York State. In hating government and loving politics, the conservatives in this book resemble more than a few of the principal players in the Republican revolution at the national level in the mid-1990's. They are the Albany equivalents of Newt Gingrich and Phil Gramm, Trent Lott and Lamar Alexander, veteran officeholders who profess to see government as distasteful but manage to generate long, successful careers denouncing it from the inside.
To say that is not to call any of them hypocrites. No one should be required to love government in order to practice politics as a profession. But the frustration and self-doubt that these people display as they struggle to justify their professionalism seems a special problem of conservatives at a time when politics is more than ever a professional enterprise.
If government is inherently impure, they wonder, are they somehow compromising themselves by their lifelong immersion in it? It is a question that their grandparents, dedicated to the clubhouse and union hall politics of a simpler time, would never have understood.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Heating Oil and Natural Gas Fall in Price as Reserves Grow

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Heating oil and natural gas futures tumbled yesterday after a rise in inventories eased concern that reserves would be low this winter.
On other markets, corn and soybeans fell while silver rose. 
 Inventories of heating oil and other distillate fuels rose 1.3 million barrels last week, to 113.6 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute reported after the close of trading on Tuesday.
The week's increase, the largest in a month, bolstered hopes that refineries will soon replenish stockpiles, which are close to 20-year lows.
"We had the first decent inventory build in a while," said Tom Bentz, the energy services director at ING Derivatives Clearing Inc. in New York. "When people see that, they think maybe they're going to see a trend of similar increases week after week so that things would get a little looser."
Yesterday, a selloff in heating oil and crude that began on Wednesday continued. Heating oil for November delivery dropped 3.05 cents, to 70.92 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after falling 2.22 cents on Wednesday. Crude oil for November delivery fell 81 cents, to $24.26 a barrel, after falling 47 cents on Wednesday.
Natural gas inventories, which have been rising ahead of the heating season, rose 94 billion cubic feet last week to 2.569 trillion cubic feet, the American Gas Association said after the market closed on Wednesday, within 8 percent of levels a year ago.
Soybean futures dropped after export sales fell short of trader expectations. The Agriculture Department said exporters sold 21.4 million bushels of soybeans in the week ended Oct. 3, down 27 percent from the previous week. Some traders were expecting exports as high as 47.8 million bushels.
November soybeans dropped 8 cents, to $7.3025, on the Chicago Board of Trade, while December corn slid 3.75 cents, to $2.90 a bushel.
Silver futures rose 8.7 cents, to $5.06 an ounce, as stockpiles monitored by the Comex division of the New York Commodity Exchange dropped to 133.8 million ounces, the lowest since July 3, 1985.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Touring the Canyons of Money and Dreams

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
YOU can get lost in lower Manhattan. The streets are not named after numbers. They disregard the Manhattan grid. They bend, twist and turn back on themselves, creating looming, demented perspectives on a scale Dr. Caligari never dreamed of. On Broad Street, home of the New York Stock Exchange, New York's usual system of street addresses is turned upside down: the numbers mount higher as you proceed south. This escape from logic affords immense delight, an oasis of irregularity within a city that offers little relief from the rigid, rectilinear grip of the civil engineer.
On Sunday, New Yorkers will have a rare opportunity to lose themselves within the inner recesses of a financial citadel. Nine of the area's most impressive buildings will be holding open house. Organized by the Association for Downtown New York, a civic improvement group, the event will enable people to see interiors that are ordinarily screened from public view. Included on the itinerary are such gems as the Red Room at the Bank of New York, a dazzling Art Deco interior of glass mosaic; 55 Wall Street, a classical temple with a Wedgwood dome that Donald J. Trump may turn into a House of Blues, and the International Commercial Bank of China, an exquisitely restored building that once housed the New York Chamber of Commerce. Beyond the chance to glimpse some spectacular spaces, the open house is an opportunity to see this city within the city at a time of momentous transition. 
 Lower Manhattan has long been a favorite weekend destination for urban romantics. The streets, bereft of traders, come into their own as the canyons to which they have often been compared. The whole district takes on the character of a natural wonder, a Grand Canyon of human creation. The strange mix of architectural styles could be an assemblage of natural rock formations. They have been carved out not by wind and water but by history and money, a substance that, in this part of town, is virtually a force of nature.
Visitors who lose themselves in these streets have entered into their ethos. The place itself embodies a condition of lostness, or, rather, a sense of will exerted against the unknown. Even more than the rest of the city, lower Manhattan sits atop a foundation of pure speculation. This was true when the place was called Nieuw Amsterdam, and settlers raised wooden pikes to protect themselves from the overpowering newness of the New World. It remains the case today, as the city calculates how to resist the centrifugal force of a new economic order. Lower Manhattan is now an existential proposition. As recently as 10 years ago, financiers needed Wall Street as urgently as Willie Sutton needed banks, and for the same reason. That's where the money was. This is no longer exactly the case. Global currency now floats around in cyberspace, blips on a screen.
Though the stock market rebounded from the 1987 collapse, the same cannot be said for the financial district. Thousands of jobs have been lost. Many buildings stand vacant, or only partly occupied. Shops have closed. Chase Manhattan Plaza, for years a symbol of the Rockefeller family's commitment to the area's future, is no longer the bank's headquarters, a casualty of Chase's merger with Chemical Bank.
But the area is on the upswing. Buildings too small to accommodate large trading floors are being converted to residential use. Across from the Stock Exchange, the Information Technology Center is attracting refugees from Silicon Alley. A health club now conducts aerobics classes in what was once a grand ground-floor banking hall.

God and Mammon
Sunday's open house, a self-guided tour that may be conducted with the assistance of an excellent booklet produced for the occasion, starts with the Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway. As a point of departure, the site is geographically and historically apt. Across the street from City Hall Park, the 800-foot tower sits at the border between the civic center and the financial district. And it introduces the major theme that runs through the entire tour: the use of architecture to mask the brutalities of material acquisition within the trappings of religion.
Completed in 1913, the building was designed by Cass Gilbert in the Gothic style, with tracery-encrusted walls, Tudor-arch entrances and a lobby full of gargoyles. The idiom reflected Frank Woolworth's allegiance to Christianity and capitalism, not necessarily in that order.
In its day, it was called "the Cathedral of Commerce," not by Woolworth himself, but by an admiring minister who intended no irony. The building, at its completion the world's tallest, stands as a reminder that the desire to reconcile high and low culture was not a post-modern invention. Here, Woolworth's nickels and dimes were piled up to an edifice that seeks to rival Chartres.

Gargoyles to Greeks
At 195 Broadway, the second stop on the tour, Gothic gargoyles are exchanged for Greek gods. Now known as the Kalikow Building, the edifice was originally designed as the headquarters for AT&T. Though the architectural style differs from that of the Woolworth Building, the message is the same: Making money is an act of faith. Embrace the faith or go to hell.
The lobby is the building's main distinction. An extraordinary hall of columns, the lobby inducts the visitor into a modern version of the Panhellenic procession, an Athenian ritual dedicated to civic prosperity. The religious effect is due not only to the hypnotic rhythm of the columns, but also to the soft light filtered through alabaster in the lobby's chandeliers.
The building's exterior is less memorable, especially since the abduction of "Golden Boy," the gilded allegorical figure of Electricity that stood upon its pinnacle. The statue was removed in the 1980's and shipped uptown to be boxed inside the lobby of the "Chippendale" skyscraper that Philip Johnson designed as AT&T's new headquarters. It was replaced by a gold ball, a sad prosthetic stump.

Gothic Updated
One Wall Street is an anomaly. Typically, Art Deco architects aimed for a streamlined classicism. Here, the intention was to update the Gothic style. Now owned by the Bank of New York, the building was erected in 1931 by Irving Trust, formerly headquartered at the Woolworth Building. In his design for 1 Wall Street, Ralph Walker tried to transfer the Gothic idea into 20th-century terms.
The Red Room, originally the ground-floor reception room, was the work of Hildreth Meiere, an artist who specialized in ecclesiastical commissions. The soaring room, with walls that create the rippling effect of a Cubist painting, is encrusted with brilliant mosaics of red and gold. Ostensibly abstract, the patterns nonetheless convey Gothic aspiration, with golden wing forms that appear to flutter near the ceiling.

The Spirit of Zen
Chase Manhattan Plaza presents perhaps the most exotic religious association of all. There, in a circular pit, Isamu Noguchi sought to recreate the spirit of Zen. Noguchi denied that the design was a Japanese garden, and properly so. Conspicuously outfitted with plumbing that enables water to variously spray, bubble and gurgle over the arrangement of stones, this is clearly as much a modern work as the tall International Style tower that looms above it.
Still, the patterns made by the cobblestone paving, and the natural rocks grouped upon it, were clearly inspired by the famous rock garden at Kyoto's ancient temple of Ryoanji. And it's a great East-West moment to see this image of non-attachment recalled in the midst of the money-changers. What is the sound of one coin clinking? Within the tower itself, designed by Gordon Bunshaft in 1960, a recently renovated lobby gleams beneath a silver leaf ceiling.
One of the world's great skyscrapers is 70 Pine Street. A downtown companion to the Chrysler Building, this is one of the few towers that actually capture the pulse of Jazz Age New York, a period that radically changed the skyline.
The 65-story tower, formerly the home of the Cities Service Company, was built on the eve of the Depression, but there's no hint of hard times in its exuberant vertical thrust. Tiers of curved parapets mount toward the crown like a great blast from a brass orchestra. The crown itself, a cube of glass, is an immense piece of Deco jewelry, a Cartier diamond in the sky.
It is shocking, however, to realize that this building, along with most of those presented on this tour, is not designated a landmark. Indeed, scandalously few buildings in lower Manhattan have been awarded landmark designation. The reason is obvious. The owners of these buildings have the city over a barrel. They don't want the limitations imposed by that status. And the city isn't in a position to turn a deaf ear when companies threaten to relocate to New Jersey.

Barricades Are Up
There are barricades on Wall Street, metal fences policed by security guards who give the best fish-eye in town. Officially, the barricades are there to keep terrorists from attacking the Stock Exchange. In fact, the barricades have been set up not only to prevent terrorists from getting in but also to prevent the Stock Exchange from getting out. There have been rumblings that this nerve center of finance, cramped in its historic Broad Street temple, might have to move, an option too hideous for the city to contemplate.
It's useful to be reminded that the owners of these buildings aren't fooled for one moment by their religious trappings. Still, the barricades don't detract from the riotous sense of fantasy that the buildings themselves embody.
One aim of the open house is to demonstrate architecture's power to turn money into dreams: The blue gas flame that glowed at night from the crown of the Standard Oil Building on lower Broadway. The "moonbeam" technology employed at the Cities Service Building, an experimental technique in which radio waves, transmitted from the tower, were bounced off the moon. The opening festivities at the Woolworth Building, in which President Woodrow Wilson touched a telegraph key in Washington to set the building ablaze with electric light. Even the strange combination of morbidity and pretension that would cause Bankers Trust to place a replica of Mausolus's tomb, the original mausoleum, atop its tower at 14 Wall Street.
To a degree, of course, lower Manhattan's architectural fantasies are deceptions, acts of urban sleight of hand designed to disguise the cruder aspects of profit-taking. But how masterfully entertaining these disguises contrive to be. Inspiring, too; spiritually uplifting almost despite themselves. The profits are made and lost many times over. The fantasies endure.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Drop to 5-Week Low

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
First-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 22,000 last week to the lowest level in five weeks, partly because of the return of workers laid off after hurricanes in late summer.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 319,000, down from a revised 341,000 for the week ended Sept. 28, the Labor Department said today. The late September figure was first reported at 340,000. 
 It was the smallest number since claims totaled 317,000 the week ended Aug. 31.
A spokeswoman for the Labor Department attributed much of the decline to workers returning from temporary layoffs caused by the storms.
Many analysts had expected claims to remain unchanged from the previous week, noting signs that job creation had slowed recently.
The four-week moving average of new claims dropped by 2,500, to 332,250, last week from 334,750 a week earlier. It was the lowest since 328,750 in the period ended Sept. 21.
Many analysts prefer to track the less volatile four-week average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: No Bark, No Bites

BYLINE: By Christopher Buckley; Christopher Buckley is the editor of Forbes FYI.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Adm. James Stockdale's startled "Who am I? Why am I here?" was the most memorable moment of the 1992 Vice-Presidential debate. Wednesday night's showdown between Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp produced nothing to match it.
The debate was a model of decorum; within minutes phrases like "with all due respect" and "my friend Al" were flying through the air like cruise mistletoes. The Kemp camp did not try to psych out Mr. Gore by seating the head of Philip Morris in the front row; the Gore people did not recruit Richard Darman, the Reagan Administration's budget director, to glower at his old rival, Mr. Kemp. 
 Fight fans the world over must have thrilled to hear the Vice President, sounding like a St. Albans School prefect, tut-tutting that the expectorating miscreant Roberto Alomar of the Baltimore Orioles should have been "severely disciplined," and then thanking Mr. Kemp for promoting civility.
"Well I thank you, Al," replied Mr. Kemp, "and I mean that very, very sincerely."
Mr. Gore speaks so deliberately you get the feeling he's under the impression that English is your second language. "Here's . . . how . . . we . . . plan . . . to . . . do . . . that." You savvy tuition tax credits?
He can take an inherently dramatic moment -- the night American troops were sent into Haiti -- and make it sound like this: "When that dictator got the news from his spies outside the gate that all these planes were taking off, he said, 'Let's get out of here' . . . I was so proud of our President in the way he handled that, and the result so far is excellent." Bill and Al's Excellent Deployment.
As for the Mexican bailout, I had no idea we'd made $500 million on the deal. We must do this more often.
Mr. Kemp is genuinely driven by the power of ideas, even if they occasionally help to produce deficits of $3 trillion. Mr. Gore is phlegmatic; Mr. Kemp is pneumatic. He gets so excited -- thank goodness someone does -- that his chest heaves and swells to the point where you think one of those creatures from the movie "Alien" is going to pop out, squeak "With all due respect," clamp its tentacles over your face and lecture you comatose about empowerment zones.
The best sound bites? Certainly Mr. Kemp's admonition that gentlemen do not "bomb before breakfast." (As William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, pointed out afterward, "What does it mean to be a Republican if you can't bomb before breakfast?")
Mr. Gore got off a freeze-dried (just add saliva) bite. "The problem with this version of Niagara Falls," he said, apropos Mr. Kemp's metaphor for unfettered free enterprise, "is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the American economy in a barrel and send it over the falls." Not bad, although those who build bridges to the 21st century ought to watch the Niagara Falls jokes.
The debate left little material for video editors to regale us with in 2000, should these two men meet again as Presidential candidates. Foot-in-mouth-wise, the debate was a disappointment. No one talked of "Democrat wars" or compared himself to John F. Kennedy. Even the bloopers were minor-league. Said Mr. Kemp in an all-embracing moment: "African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latino-Americans, female Americans."
Maybe the video archivists can make a little mischief out of something else. A friend of mine -- a Democrat, as it happens -- said that at one point he distinctly saw a fly buzzing about the Vice President, and reported a brief, delicious moment when Mr. Gore's eyes crossed as they attempted to follow it, with excellent result.

HEADLINE: China's Endangered Democrats

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration is busy these days repairing relations with China, it cannot ignore Beijing's continuing abuse of citizens who speak out for wider democratic freedom. Yesterday the State Department rightly protested the latest wave of Chinese arrests. American concerns also need to be conveyed personally by top Administration officials.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will travel to China next month to begin planning for an exchange of Presidential visits expected to take place in 1997 if President Clinton is re-elected. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher should make clear their concern over the abuse of Chinese dissidents. 
 China does not like to hear criticism of its human rights record. But Washington has a responsibility to tell Beijing that China's hopes for economic expansion and political stability are poorly served by its cruel persecution of anyone who publicly challenges the party line.
A high-level party gathering this week launched another campaign to tighten public order and defend Communist values. On Tuesday the authorities picked up Liu Xiaobo, a literary critic, for asking party leaders to honor their promises of free speech and assembly, and a day later sentenced him without trial to three years in a labor camp. Yesterday they notified relatives of Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 student democracy movement, to prepare for a trial in the next few days. He could face seven years' imprisonment. Mr. Wang has been held without formal charges for 17 months.
Meanwhile Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent advocate of democracy, is now serving the harsh new 14-year sentence imposed on him last year. He had already spent 16 years in prison and secret detention for his peaceful political advocacy. Bao Tong, a high government official in the reform era of the late 1980's, has completed the seven-year prison term he was sentenced to after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, but continues to be held in a restricted government compound.
Washington needs to keep channels of communication open to a major military and economic power like China. But one important use of those channels is to convey how strongly Americans feel about democratic freedoms and the protection of human rights.

HEADLINE: Nobels as a Lagging Indicator

 BODY:
It is gratifying that American scientists have once again dominated the Nobel Prizes for science and economics. Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences announced that three Americans shared the Nobel Prize in Physics and that two other Americans shared the Chemistry Prize with a British scientist. Another American was named co-winner of the award in economics.
Nobody is naive enough to believe that spawning the world's leading economists will guarantee the world's most robust economy. But the Nobel science prizes are often taken as a measure of a nation's scientific prowess. Even so, they are lagging indicators, honoring pioneering work performed years ago. The physicists David Lee, Douglas Osheroff and Robert Richardson were cited for superfluidity studies done a quarter-century ago. The chemists Robert Curl, Richard Smaller and the Briton Sir Harold Kroto won for their discovery a decade ago of a new form of carbon. 
 The Nobel Prizes are thus a measure of past greatness, not of current or future excellence. These latest awards come at a time when basic research expenditures in America, adjusted for inflation, are actually falling slightly, with worse projected to come. The deficit-reduction efforts endorsed by both major political parties will primarily hit civilian discretionary programs, with a big chunk almost certainly coming from research budgets. Research will be a tempting target because the impact might not be noticeable until, years hence, no Americans grace the Nobel victory stand.

HEADLINE: The Heavy Burden of Low Rates;
Small Japanese Savers Find the Return Barely Worth It

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Gone are the days when Hisashi Ishigaki could spend the fruits of his bank savings on home repairs and new shirts. Now, the interest he earns barely buys a daily cup of tea.
True, Mr. Ishigaki, a 67-year-old retired auto engineer, siphoned off some of his $100,000 nest egg to pay down his mortgage and buy a new car. But these days, rock-bottom interest rates in Japan are barely keeping pace with inflation, and so his savings are quickly evaporating. 
 For decades, ordinary Japanese have been parking their money in the bank and watching it grow, often doubling in 12 years. Today, though, when Americans complain about the 4.5 to 5 percent they get on six-month certificates of deposit, the Japanese are eking out one-quarter of 1 percent, one-eighteenth as much. Put another way, the same Japanese saver who reaped more than $2,500 annually on a $50,000 deposit for most of the 1980's, when interest rates ran above 5 percent, now collects only $125.
"I look at my bank account," Mr. Ishigaki said, "and -- you know, we get interest about twice a year -- and I say, What on earth is this?' You can't say it's just interest, that it's just a small bit of money. We need it to live on. It's a matter of life or death."
The main reason for the cascade in rates is the Government's effort to pump up the faltering economy with cheap money for industry and consumers. The economy -- after stagnating since the speculative bubble burst in the early 90's -- sailed ahead in the first quarter of this year, expanding at a 12.2 percent annual rate, only to shrink in the second quarter to 2.9 percent.
But what is good for the economy can be agony for Japanese savers, whose frustration is mounting. Yoko Ito, 65, manages her family's finances, and used to prefer the banks because they seemed so much safer than stocks. But Mrs. Ito learned a lesson the hard way when her long-term trust fund, invested in stocks, lost half its value in the market plunge of the early 1990's.
That fund is maturing this year, and her broker is pestering her to reinvest it in stocks. She doesn't have the appetite now, but the banks don't look appealing either.
"Until several years ago, we could use the interest to pay our utility bills," Mrs. Ito said. "When I see the small amount of interest every month, I feel so bad that my husband worked all these years to earn precious money. This is miserable."
So far, most people are just watching in disgust as their interest income slides, and there is little indication that a revolt is building like one that took hold among some Americans in the 1970's. Then, when inflation-adjusted interest rates on savings accounts turned negative -- as they did briefly this summer here -- the public outcry ultimately led to the creation of all sorts of alternative savings vehicles like bond and money market funds.
Nothing like that is happening yet in this country, but the low rates threaten to change the saving habits of Japanese like Mrs. Ito, whose frugality has fueled decades of economic growth. Some critics of Government policy fear that today's Japanese supersavers will become tomorrow's American-style spendthrifts. Already, people have been rushing to buy homes to take advantage of cheap mortgages and to beat an expected increase in the consumption tax.
"I'd prefer to spend my money on trips abroad and on cars, rather than putting it in the bank," said Yoshitoshi Arii, a 63-year-old retiree as he withdrew some cash from a bank recently. "I think this is the effect that the Government is hoping for."
But if so, the policy may be backfiring. The latest Government figures show a small decline in household spending, possibly because many Japanese feel impelled to save more to make up for lost interest income and to prepare for rough days ahead. Still, with the economy's weakness, growth in overall savings has slowed somewhat in recent months.
Japanese pension funds have been quietly suffering from the low rates, too, and the result is that many are in trouble, with some logging deficits in their operations. Other institutional investors are fed up, and now some economists worry about instability -- with billions of dollars in capital fleeing overseas in search of higher returns.
The hardest hit, however, are retirees and the poor, who often have few alternatives. Finance Minister Wataru Kubo and other senior officials have expressed sympathy for their plight. And banks have opened special "welfare deposits" that pay 4.15 percent a year, though the amounts are limited to $30,000.
One of those angry pensioners is Masakazu Uenaka, 83, a former steel-company administrator, who wrote a pointed letter to a national newspaper. After retiring nearly three decades ago, Mr. Uenaka and his 77-year-old wife, Ikuyo Uenaka, took part-time jobs. They worked themselves to the bone and built up about $500,000 in savings.
Though their savings allow a comfortable living, they had hoped to live off the interest income and use some of the principal to build a country house for their extended family.
"I had to give up my dream of having a villa in Hakone," Mr. Uenaka said in a recent interview. "All these plans have collapsed."
His wife, determined not to tap into the principal except for emergencies, is depriving herself of extravagances such as renovating the bathrooms. "Also, I can't buy a new suit to wear to the alumnae gatherings," Mrs. Uenaka said. "I've cut down on my visits to the beauty parlor, and I dye my hair at home now."
For many older people, the situation is much worse. Most Japanese employees get retirement bonuses of around $200,000, typically using half to pay off their mortgages and banking the rest for the interest income. In the old days, they could expect $5,000 or more a year. But even at the higher interest rate given for deposits of $100,000 or more, the payoff has shrunk to about $280 after taxes for six-month rollover deposits -- or $23 a month, enough for lunch for two at a noodle shop.
Japan's central bank instituted the present level of easy credit a year ago to stave off a crisis of confidence in the nation's financial system. At the time, thinly capitalized banks were saddled with several hundred billion dollars in bad debt, and one big institution, Daiwa Bank, had just disclosed a $1.1 billion trading loss at its New York office.
Fears of a financial crisis have since receded but the central bank has kept rates low, in part to give the commercial banks time to increase their profit margins and ease their debt problems. But with the economy still sputtering and Japanese companies hesitant to embark on big investment projects at home, the central bank is in a quandary.
If it keeps rates low, and if creeping prices produce negative real interest rates, Japanese people will have a hard time even preserving the value of their savings. But if it raises rates, it might suffocate the precarious economic recovery.
"They want to dismantle the crisis management as soon as possible, and they launched a trial balloon to raise the official discount rate," said Takashi Kiuchi, an economist who heads the LTCB Research Institute in Tokyo, referring to a time in the spring when many economists were predicting that rates would rise. "But that didn't take place."
With the central bank sacrificing the saver, the consensus among economists is that rates will probably not be raised any time soon.
Moreover, with public distrust of the stock market still high six years after the plunge in stock prices, and with virtually no mutual funds available to spread the risk of stock investments, most Japanese savers feel stuck with the banks.
A few emboldened individuals, like Akiko Murakami, a 49-year-old woman who manages her family's household finances, are putting money into higher-yielding foreign bank instruments or name-brand American corporate bonds like those of the Walt Disney Company. Together, these yield-seeking investors -- including institutional investors -- are now pouring the equivalent of billions of dollars into foreign bonds, on the assumption that interest rates will remain much lower here than overseas.
Citibank N.A. has also watched its foreign-denominated deposits soar. Dollar deposits last month, it said, grew 43 percent over those a year before, while its New Zealand dollar deposits exploded by 500 percent in the same period.
These investments involve foreign-exchange risk, such as the danger that the yen will strengthen against the dollar.
"But it's better than keeping it in Japanese banks where the rates are so low that it's the same thing as keeping it at home," Mrs. Murakami said. "I don't keep money at home, in the cabinet, but sometimes I feel like I might as well. For kicks, my friends and I sometimes talk about getting a whole bunch of people together to yank out our money from the banks at the same time.
"If enough people are in on it," she said jokingly, "the banks will be unpleasantly surprised."
Others, like Hiroko Endo, a 50-year-old mother of two, are experimenting -- very tentatively -- with stocks. "We're putting some 'extravagance' money into the stock market," Mrs. Endo said. "But the money we need is in the bank."
Most Japanese are even more cautious about investing in stocks or in foreign markets, and many mistrust brokers. "I'm afraid of investing it," Mr. Ishigaki, the retired engineer, said. "Floating interest rates and all that -- unless you're an expert in the monetary world, it's hard."
For the most part, the Japanese are showing little interest in personal-investing courses or in financial counseling, partly because of their bad memories of the stock market plunge starting in 1990. "People got burned back then and they are no longer in the mood," said Minori Narita, an administrator at the NHK Culture Center, which once attracted scores of housewives and pensioners to its personal-investing classes.
Brokers are trying to change that attitude, and the younger generation may be more amenable. But they face an uphill battle.
"The Japanese people are too afraid," said Hiroyuki Fujimoto, a 34-year-old broker at Nomura Securities. "They need to play around more with their money and be more adventurous."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries' Prices Move Down Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday, the fourth consecutive decline, as concerns about inflation and interest rates grew before today's report on producer prices.
A sharp drop in the number of first-time unemployment claims made some traders question the prevailing market view that the economy is slowing and that interest rates will remain stable. Bond prices had been rising in recent weeks, with buyers encouraged by the Federal Reserve's decision to leave short-term rates unchanged and by last Friday's unemployment report, which showed a surprising decline in the nation's payrolls. 
 But traders yesterday were not willing to increase their bets on longer maturities with producer price and retail sales data for September due out today.
"Traders still have a slightly positive bias, but they are not willing to buy at the high price levels with so much uncertainty about the economy and inflation," said Dave Shabelman, a market analyst with MMS International in San Francisco.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 20/32 , to 9812/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.88 percent, from 6.83 percent on Wednesday.
Overseas selling heading into the New York session contributed to the market's decline yesterday. Concern about a strengthening labor market emerged yesterday following remarks by Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor, who according to a report in Investor's Business Daily said gross domestic product probably had slowed to a pace that would keep the jobless rate from falling further.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said Mr. Meyer's remarks worried the market.
"The market has been trading with a weary, almost nervous attitude this week, especially with the less than robust 10-year auction on Tuesday," Mr. Regan said. The yield on the 10-year note has gone from 6.50 percent at auction to a current 6.62 percent.
The market's worries grew after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended Oct. 5 fell by 22,000, more than expected, to a seasonally adjusted 319,000. The decline caused the four-week moving average to slip to 332,250.
Also weighing on the market yesterday was a poorly received auction of one-year bills. Mr. Regan said the auction was on the poor side because of reservations about today's data. "The market had been looking for a rate of 5.33 percent, but 5.34 percent came in," he said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of a new one-year bill:

HEADLINE: In Housing Battle, Faint Hope and a Few Bright Spots

SERIES: BARELY FOUR WALLS: Housing's Hidden Crisis -- Last of six articles

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Ana Nunez, paying $350 a month for a tiny, illegal room above a pawnshop on the Lower East Side, illustrates the harsh realities of housing for many of the poorest New Yorkers.
But the hope for a better future is embodied in Lula West's new two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. 
 Miss West and her teen-age sons, Jemar and Emanuell, live in a warm, pleasant building on what was, not long ago, a burned-out block in one of the city's most devastated neighborhoods, East New York. The walls of her apartment are freshly painted, the floors are hardwood and the kitchen appliances are just a few years old. Her sons' awards and trophies are proudly displayed on shelves in the living room, as are a smattering of books and a small television. Dried flowers perk up the modest furnishings. The rent: $422 a month.
"This is the best apartment I've had in all my life," said Miss West, who is 38 and has lived in East New York for 13 years.
It is not by accident that Miss West's accommodations are so much better than the makeshift and often expensive apartments in attics, basements, old commercial buildings and illegal boardinghouses that many other poor New Yorkers reluctantly call home. Nor did her home result from the efforts of the private sector, which virtually everyone agrees cannot fill the need alone. Government -- in the form of Mayor Edward I. Koch's vast city housing program -- planned and helped pay for the complete rebuilding of Miss West's apartment house at 539 Williams Avenue.
But the program that gave Miss West a decent and inexpensive home was a product of a bygone era: in the last several years, with money and political will in short supply at every level of government -- city, state and Federal -- housing programs that at their peak did not manage to reach all of the poor who needed assistance in New York City have been cut back substantially.
And as they look to the future, many housing advocates and experts agree that this retrenchment will probably lead to more substandard, expensive dwellings in a city already notorious for its high housing costs and cramped accommodations.
"We can expect it to get worse, absolutely," said Ron Shiffman, a member of the City Planning Commission and the director of Pratt Institute's Center for Community and Environmental Development. "While we have reversed the trends of the past and done a lot of building, that was geared primarily toward the existing population, and the population of the city is growing."
Decent, inexpensive housing is in short supply in New York for many reasons. While the city's population is growing, its aging housing stock is not being replenished quickly enough. The income of poor New Yorkers is often simply inadequate to cover the basic cost of maintaining apartments. (A mother on welfare with two children gets $286 a month for rent -- less than the average landlord's monthly cost per apartment.) Rent control and rent stabilization also keep rents low, although their effect on low-income housing is uncertain.
With the city in chronic budget trouble these days, and the Giuliani administration eager to get out of the housing business, very little new construction is on the drawing boards.
"I think we're at a point where we cannot continue that huge investment, not that the need has gone away," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.
There is also less money for new rent subsidies for poor and working-poor families, and less money for housing inspectors to clamp down on illegal apartments and unsafe conditions.
But that is not to say that people concerned with low-income housing are bereft of modest hopes. Local nonprofit groups continue to develop some housing. And some experts assert that changes in the city's regulatory system could be made to improve the lives of people living in substandard housing.
New York's low-income housing crunch is significantly different from what most other old, industrial American cities are experiencing, many experts said. Most cities with an aging and significantly dilapidated housing stock, like Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Baltimore, have also had significant population declines, which has eased the pressure on housing.
But New York City now labors under the unusual burden of an increasing population, due largely to immigration, and an aging housing stock that is not being replenished quickly enough. The two trends force up rents and intensify the competition for livable low-income housing.
 
Roots of a Crisis
Government Retreats From Role as Backer
Since the 1930's, the Federal Government had assumed prime responsibility for helping to house people too poor to pay on their own for a decent place to live. The Government built and maintained housing projects. It also helped finance private developers who built new low-income housing, and it gave rent subsidies to poor people, paying the gap between what they could afford and a reasonable rent in the private housing market.
The private market cannot do it alone, many people say, because the cost of building and operating housing in New York City simply exceeds the ability of many poor people to pay. The city's problem is as much insufficient household income as it is inadequate housing.
The situation, says Louis Winnick, an urban economist who has studied housing in New York for decades, is not complicated.
"I have preached maybe to the point of obsession that there are three reasons why housing is in a crisis in New York City -- cost, cost and cost," Mr. Winnick said. "There is no way that any builder, the most ingenious builder in the world, can build for the poor without subsidies. All the private market can do is a thin band of the population, and that is not going to change. Without public subsidy, there cannot be any prospect for new housing for the poor and even the middle class."
But the Reagan Administration sharply curtailed the Government's role in constructing new apartments for the poor in the early 1980's, and now the Clinton Administration cuts mean that the city is barely giving out any new Federal rent subsidies. And Congress has threatened much deeper cuts.
Landlord representatives say that thousands of apartment building owners in poor neighborhoods depend on the Federal subsidies, called Section 8, to meet expenses.
"If you remove Section 8, there is no doubt in my mind that you would see greater abandonment," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the city's largest landlords' group, the Rent Stabilization Association. "Without that, the entire low-income housing stock is down the tubes."
Some critics note that while the Federal Government is retreating from its traditional commitments to house the poor, it has kept intact far more expensive housing subsidies for the middle class and the wealthy. Deductions of homeowners' mortgage interest and property taxes have remained largely untouched, costing the Government about $94 billion a year, according to recent Congressional estimates. But the major national program for building new housing for the poor -- a Federal tax credit for corporations that invest in low-income housing -- is worth about $2.6 billion a year in forgone revenues.
"You really have to question the national priorities," said Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiative Support Corporation, a nonprofit organization that helps finance community revitalization, particularly with the housing tax credits. "The largest housing program in the nation, the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for local real estate taxes, is available only to homeowners, and only to homeowners who itemize."
This contrast reflects, among other things, a profound national shift in political power over the last three decades. As the country's population has moved from large cities to suburbs and smaller cities, so has political clout shifted from the big cities to the suburbs and towns.
Still, while the flow of Federal, state and city dollars into low-income housing has slowed substantially, it has not stopped altogether. Many of the dozens of local nonprofit groups that became housing developers and operators over the last decade through New York City's programs remain active. Some still receive city money to create new housing, though on a vastly diminished scale. Others have found specialized sources of money from the state and Federal governments.
The East New York Urban Youth Corps, for instance, is an ambitious neighborhood group in Brooklyn that rebuilt Lula West's apartment house on Williams Avenue. Over the last seven years, the nonprofit group has reconstructed or built from scratch 56 small buildings.
Martin Dunn, Urban Youth Corps's executive director, said the group continued to develop new housing in the last two years by tapping specialized sources, like Federal money for housing the elderly and state money for housing AIDS patients. But Mr. Dunn and many other low-income housing advocates are worried that even those resources may soon dry up.
"It's entirely dependent on whether the public support, the government support, is there," he said. "As a group, we have the capacity to do more. The vacant land, the vacant and substandard housing still exists, and the demand for housing is still there. All we need is access to financing, and this can continue for another 10 years."
 
Patchwork Approach
Hopeful Solutions, On a Small Scale
Some low-income housing experts assert that, even without significant new public investment, some small improvements could be made in the city's regulatory system, which even city officials admit has ceased to function properly.
Bruce J. Gould, a Housing Court judge in Manhattan, has long been a proponent of creating a new administrative tribunal to enforce housing violations. The city does not have nearly enough lawyers to pursue in court all the landlords whose buildings have been cited for violating the housing code, and the Housing Court would not have nearly enough judges if the city did pursue every violator.
But by creating an administrative body to handle violations, "you would have a systematic way of going after everybody," Judge Gould said.
Several tenant lawyers said they doubted a tribunal would accomplish much because it might encourage more landlords to certify falsely that they have fixed code violations.
"This will get people to certify, I guess, but without addressing the underlying problems," Andrew Scherer, a Legal Services lawyer, said.
But Judge Gould disagreed, saying that inspectors could go out and make sure that the repairs had in fact been made.
Other tenant advocates contended that with a relatively small commitment of money, the city could hire more housing inspectors. Since the early 1970's, the number of inspectors has fallen from nearly 700 to fewer than 200.
"They could put their resources into enforcing the law, and a lot of substandard housing could be brought up to code," said Scott Sommer, chairman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenants-rights group.
Ms. Barrios-Paoli, the city's Housing Commissioner, said she wants to rethink and reorganize the entire housing regulatory system. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declined requests to be interviewed about low-income housing.
Some tenant advocates suggested that in the winter, the city should hire retired housing inspectors to help with the peak load of inspections for problems with heat and hot water. And some said that the city should offer courses to small, inexperienced landlords on basic building maintenance. City housing officials are planning a small experiment soon with such a course.
Still, these are only modest improvements, and their proponents acknowledge that it would take major commitments of government money and political will to truly improve housing for New York's poor. Some housing scholars contend, however, that what is needed is less, not more, government involvement.
Peter D. Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the solution to New York's low-income housing shortage lay right here in the city.
If New York were to eliminate rent control and rent stabilization, which limit rent increases on more than 1.1 million apartments, Mr. Salins said, private developers would have more incentive to build new housing for the middle and upper classes, and in the process would free up older housing for the poor. Those rules expire next year, and although no one expects that they will not be renewed, landlords can be expected to try to relax them. Easing the city's restrictive zoning and unwieldy environmental regulations would also stimulate new market-rate construction, he said.
"The city has poured a fortune into housing," Mr. Salins said. "No city has done as much. We should have the best housing in America, but we don't measure up with other cities. And the question is why? The housing market isn't working. We have stymied the market in a number of ways."
Many other housing experts, however, dismissed the idea. They said the primary problem was the combination of tenants' lack of income and the high cost of developing and operating housing.
Some experts even suggested that things might have to become worse before they got better.
"The public assistance and housing programs that are now being dismantled grew out of social unrest in the 1930's and the 1960's," said Steven Banks, coordinating attorney of the Legal Aid Society's homeless family rights project. "They sprung not just from benevolence but from real fears, from people in the streets."
Indeed, it was the surge in homeless people on the streets of New York in the early- and mid-1980's -- along with the physical devastation of the city's poorest neighborhoods -- that persuaded Mayor Koch and his advisers to offset cuts in Federal housing assistance by committing huge amounts of city money to rebuild abandoned apartment houses and neighborhoods.
Over the last decade, the program begun by Mr. Koch and continued by his successors has produced more than 43,000 new apartments and more than 20,000 new houses on vacant, city-owned land -- more new housing, in fact, than was developed during that time by all other American cities combined.
But the program did not come close to eradicating New York's enduring shortage of low-income housing, which did not surprise the officials who created it.
A study in 1985 estimated that the city needed at least 231,000 new apartments to accommodate all the people living doubled-up with friends and relatives, in homeless shelters or in seriously dilapidated housing. A follow-up study two years later estimated that by the year 2000, New York would need 372,000 more apartments and houses than it would have.
And the economic conditions that helped sustain the city's housing program are now a distant memory.
"It's the same problem that existed when we got into the housing program," Mr. Koch said. "The Federal Government has withdrawn from low-income housing production. It's unrealistic for the city to step in because they can't even afford to keep building schools, and that's an even higher priority."
Still, the beneficiaries of the decisions made 10 years ago are keenly aware of how their lives were changed by government's intervention. Lula West used to live down the block from her current home in East New York, in a small, rundown, roach-infested building. She paid $286 a month, the basic welfare housing allowance, for her old apartment. She pays more now, but she says the new apartment is worth the sacrifice.
"I pay $422 a month, but it's all right," said Miss West, who is legally blind and lives on Federal assistance for the disabled. "Thank God, I made it here."
 
Many Offer to Help
More than 100 people have called to offer help to the tenants whose lives and living conditions have been chronicled this week in The New York Times. The Children's Aid Society has agreed to manage donations or other offers of help. For inquiries or donations, call (212) 949-4935 or write to Philip Coltoff, Executive Director, Children's Aid Society, 105 East 22d Street, New York, 10010.

HEADLINE: Place Your Bets: A New Casino;
Mohegan Sun Will End Foxwoods' Local Monopoly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: UNCASVILLE, Conn., Oct. 10

 BODY:
Michael Giguere sipped a Coke and looked ill. It was late Wednesday afternoon, and in a few minutes, 20,000 people would be streaming through the doors of Mohegan Sun, a giant new casino that is opening to the public on Saturday.
Mr. Giguere, a 30-year-old Montville resident who until that moment had worked only as a roofer, was about to sweat through his first full shift as a blackjack dealer, a test for him and 5,500 other employees of the new casino. After 10 weeks of training, he was panicking about whether he would spin out the cards smoothly, collect and pay out his bets properly, and avoid spilling the chips. 
 "I'm too nervous to talk," Mr. Giguere said. "Please leave me alone."
Only a year or so ago, the dealers, waitresses and cashiers had been welders, machinists, nurses and engineers, working for companies that were laying people off or closing whole divisions. For them, and this region, the opening of the casino offers a ray of hope, and yet one more sign of how southeastern Connecticut has moved away from the blue-collar manufacturing that was once its hallmark to a very different industry.
With the opening of Mohegan Sun, a casino the size of three and a half football fields in a factory complex that used to make nuclear reactor components, this part of the state now has two of the three largest casinos in the nation.
Only 10 miles away from the new casino, owned by the 1,100-member Mohegan tribe, is Foxwoods Resort Casino on the Mashantucket Pequots' reservation in Ledyard, the world's most profitable casino with more visitors last year, at least 20 million, than the combined populations of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Mohegan Sun will end the monopoly over the New England gambling market that Foxwoods has enjoyed for several years and may cut into its revenues, estimated to exceed $1 billion this year. But equally important, it is a large step toward turning the region into a gambling and resort mecca rivaling Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
"There is no market like this anywhere in the world," said Sol Kerzner, the South African gambling mogul whom the Mohegans brought in as a partner. Indeed, there are 21.8 million people in a 150-mile radius, 3 million more than in a comparable area around Atlantic City.
The shift toward gambling comes as southeastern Connecticut has searched to find jobs and businesses to spur an economy that had been heavily reliant on the relatively high salaries of military work. With the slashed payrolls of military contractors and the movement of some Navy operations to other parts of the country, this area has lost thousands of jobs.
For instance, Electric Boat, the submarine manufacturer in Groton that once was the region's biggest employer, has seen its work force drop more than 50 percent in the last decade to 10,900 this year, from 24,500 in 1986. It is expected to drop an additional 3,000 to 4,000 in the next two years.
"We need jobs," said Patrick J. Dougherty, Mayor of Montville. "And the casino brings them."
Mr. Dougherty said about one-third of the adults in his town had once worked for the Navy or Pentagon contractors. Now, the bumper-to-bumper traffic between Montville and Electric Boat has thinned. It is common to hear people at church talk about how they just got a "golden handshake" and are planning to move, if only they could sell their home, he said.
The casino, while not providing the same level of pay as military work, is going to help the town, he said. Already, Montville has changed its zoning to allow for large commercial developments. A six-story hotel is on the drawing board, and there is talk of a golf course, he said. Such development is part of the region's new emphasis on tourism. In addition to the two casinos, Six Flags is looking to open an amusement park. The Mystic Aquarium is expanding. The Mystic Seaport, a maritime museum, is continuing as a major attraction, and other developments are expected.
Even those who are not enthusiastic about the changes are resigned to them. "I'm not sure whether its progress, but I don't think there's anything else to be done," said Helen Aldrich, an 80-year-old retired secretary, who is the Montville town historian.
Mr. Kerzner said more than half the employees had never worked in a casino, though Mohegan Sun has recruited heavily from Atlantic City and Las Vegas for many management positions. Also, about 650 employees from Foxwoods have moved to the new casino, G. Michael Brown, Foxwood's chief executive, said.
On Wednesday night, three new dealers sat in the employee cafeteria, waiting for the shift to start. "It feels sort of strange not to be going to work with a helmet on," said Bill Barnard, a welder for 19 years at Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft engine manufacturer. "And I'm going to be associating with people, with customers."
Mr. Barnard, 40, said he was laid off earlier this year and came down to the casino looking for a job on the construction crew driving a dump truck. "I asked, do you need any help?" he recalled. "They said, sure, we're looking for blackjack dealers, if you can pass the test." Although he had never played the game before, he was hired.
Across the table, Jim Aiello, 47, a computer programmer who had been laid off from a water utility, shook his head in disbelief. "We were chosen out of 20,000 who applied," he said. "And the job has benefits."
The third man, who declined to give his name, was less upbeat. He had been laid off from Electric Boat this summer and was not sure that the casino was where he wanted to be. While he had been making $16 an hour at his defense job, about $30 on overtime, here he was making about $8, not including tips.
"People can hype everything up, but it's a bad situation," he said.
For many of the younger generation of employees, the casino was a step up from jobs at convenience stores, fast-food restaurants and odd jobs in the service economy.
"A four-year college degree wouldn't get me anything better," said John Oliver, 27, who said he had done odd jobs for the last few years. "This is my dream job. I love to gamble."
One worker quit her job as a waitress at Friendly's to come here. Another, Jenn Ryan, 23, a croupier, said it had allowed her to escape from 80-hour weeks at minimum wage as the manager of a convenience store and gas station. "This is going to be less hours for the same final take-home pay," she said.
The new casino officially opens to the public on Saturday, but on Tuesday the Mohegans and their partners invited "10,000 of their closest friends and relatives," in the words of one casino official. On Wednesday night, they conducted a "soft opening," holding an invitation-only charity benefit in which the slot machines were "live," but table games used only play money bought from the casino. All proceeds went to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
The event was not just philanthropic. With Gov. John G. Rowland, state lawmakers and local business leaders sipping free champagne and noshing on shrimp, crab and other free food, the evening was a chance for the Mohegans to show they have arrived and create a buzz. The new casino is being billed in television and print ads as "a legendary" experience and "a casino like you've never imagined," where "the magic of the sun never sets."
It is a striking contrast to its bigger rival, Foxwoods, which is elegant but understated, a sort of well-run suburban mall with lots of amenities and almost 5,000 slot machines. In turn, Mohegan Sun could perhaps be described as New England Native American Glitz, a sort of Disney park casino with a Mohegan theme.
Giant faux animal skins, decorated with hieroglyphs and Mohegan symbols, hang from the rafters. Aluminum pipes, stylized to look like rough hewn logs, adorn the gambling floor. A huge video screen in the Wolf Den, a 300-seat lounge in the center of the complex, shows a video of a wolf, the tribe's icon, running through the woods.
The ceiling is decorated with clouds, which, through sophisticated lighting, appear to be scudding across the sky. A fiberglass cliff and a small forest of artificial pine trees tower over a food court where gamblers can dine on burritos, egg rolls, grinders and cheesecake. There are 19 restaurants, not to mention an elaborate day-care center -- complete with a kid-sized karaoke and two-story indoor playscape where gamblers can leave their children for $6 an hour.
Still, for some the ambiance was secondary.
At 7 P.M. on Wednesday, Anna Capuano, 78, of Stratford, had been sitting in front of a slot machine for two hours and had not had a chance to look around. Her hands were stained black from the tokens she had been dropping into the machine.
She watched the wheels spin on the machine, got three bars, and some coins began pouring out.
"Yup, this place is beautiful," she said.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Journal;
Iraq at Play: Eliza Doolittle Is Now a Belly Dancer

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq

 BODY:
You can tell that the Baghdad rendition of "My Fair Lady" is going to be somewhat different when, five minutes into the musical, a male dancer brandishes a pistol and shoots his lithe female counterpart dead.
Then there is the matter of Eliza Doolittle. Since women who sell flowers are largely nonexistent in Iraq, a local version had to be found. 
 Rewrite transformed her into an accomplished village belly dancer who masters the cha-cha-cha even while smoothing her squawking country vowels. (That was Mom being shot in the beginning, presaging both the dancing talent and untamed character of her daughter.) And the happy ending was also canned.
Baghdad used to bill itself as the living incarnation of "1,001 Nights," a proudly cosmopolitan capital where the entertainment spun on until dawn. But a combination of international sanctions and Draconian laws largely cut off the outside world, dampening the music and laughter. The thriving cabaret theaters are the only remnant of the city's night life.
The Government shuttered all nightclubs years ago to eliminate the spectacle of sanctions profiteers flinging around stacks of cash for a bottle of Scotch while most Iraqis have trouble feeding their families. Satellite dishes, never cheap, were banned outright this year.
Since the population is starved for entertainment, and trade sanctions eliminated the importing of new films, the city's downtown movie palaces have been converted en masse into theaters. The most popular shows are basically nightclub belly dance fare thinly disguised as plays -- the gyrating goes on hold every 15 minutes or so to introduce the barest plot sketches.
"My Fair Lady," or "Sayadati al-Jamila" in Arabic, opened this summer and has been selling out nightly at a rate expected to sustain an 18-month run.
"The educated in an Iraqi audience appreciate a show's foreign origins," said Mahmoud Abu al-Abbas, who adapted the show and stars in the Prof. Henry Higgins role. "But you also have to make the characters look like Iraqis so the ordinary audience will take it."
Despite Western confrontations with Iraq, its citizens show little overt hostility toward things Western. (At the once gleaming, now frayed Hotel Rasheed, the receptionist registering a guest's American passport number spontaneously sought to reassure him about his safety. "Don't worry, the only Americans we hate are George Bush and Bill Clinton," he said. "You are welcome in Baghdad.")
So no one finds it surprising that a work created in the West would be so popular with the cast and the audience.
"As artists, we don't think about the play in that way," said the show's star, Leila Mohammed. "But I don't really think of myself as Eliza either," she said, laughing through an attempt to sing "The Rain in Spain." Like all the music, it was replaced with the undulating drumbeats of southern Iraq.
The reworked version does include puns turning on English words. A sorcerer trying to exorcise evil spirits -- jinn in Arabic -- from one character watches her topple over on stage. "I am not sure if it's a question of jinn or gin," he deadpanned.
Audiences say the cabaret shows are wildly popular because they allow Iraqis to forget the difficulties of living in a once rich country brought low by a six-year-old international blockade imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
"It has been a difficult period, so we go out to forget the suffering, to forget the sanctions," said Fajr Sweidan, a 40-year-old food store owner who was taking his wife, sister and two children to the show.
Inevitably, however, sanctions jokes get mixed into the slapstick routines. One denizen of Professor Higgins's study -- full of books and dominated by a painting of Venus de Milo -- complains that the electricity has been out for an hour again. "We only get electricity for an hour," retorts a visitor from the countryside.
The bleakness of life under sanctions, especially a sort of pervasive national depression, is also woven into the dialogue. One character laments that the source of his listlessness cannot quite be diagnosed: "It is not sorrow, it is not pain, it is not anger. I think I am going crazy and I don't know why."
No one is overtly blamed for the problems, and references to domestic and international politics are largely absent. There is a minor dig at the television network run by President Saddam Hussein's older son, Odai, known for broadcasting endless imported South American soap operas and American gang movies. When a character starts singing a trite song, the other character cuts him off by asking, "Did you learn that from Youth Television?"
If it sounds as if the plot meanders from the original, it does. That is why critics accuse the theaters of trying to plaster Western titles on their shows in a quest for respectability where none exists.
"You don't have to copy an English or American film and make it terrible," said Mohamad Shukri Jameel, an Iraqi film maker. "It is a travesty."
"But they are packed," he said of the shows. "Before you could go to a bar or a restaurant, but now it's either illegal or too expensive. Everyone thinks it's better to go to one of these shows for an hour or two. It is all a reaction to the war."
Postwar sentiments also prompted the writers to throw out the happily-ever-after ending. The now lovely pupil, swathed in a pink pantsuit instead of her belly dance spangles, feels so unloved by her soulless professor that she spurns him and swears to return to her village.
"The rest of the shows all have happy endings, but our show is the reality," Mr. Abu al-Abbas said. "There is never a happy ending for Iraqis."

G.E. Reports 11% Increase In Third-Quarter Earnings

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company announced yesterday that third-quarter earnings increased 11 percent over the period last year.
"It was a truly solid quarter," said Ann M. Schwetje of Smith Barney. Nicholas P. Heymann, a NatWest Securities analyst who is among the most bullish of G.E.'s fans, readily agreed. "It shows everything is A-O.K. and on track there," he said. 
 Indeed it is. G.E., a conglomeration of 12 disparate businesses, has always been well hedged -- a sluggish European market can always be offset by a boom in Asia, while one good sweeps week at NBC can make up for a badly timed entry into on-line information markets. And lately, only G.E.'s smallest businesses, like transportation and information systems, have been hiccupping. Indeed, the company's sales were up more than 15 percent, to $20 billion.
"One of the joys is that our largest divisions, like GE Capital, power systems and NBC, led the record growth," said Bruce Bunch, a G.E. spokesman.
G.E. has been cutting costs across the company. Its manufacturing divisions are chasing service and spare parts contracts, far less capital-intensive businesses than equipment manufacturing. And all its businesses are trying to sell more to existing customers, which is less expensive than trying to woo new ones.
The cost improvements have freed up a staggering amount of cash. So far this year G.E. has generated $5.4 billion in cash, compared with just $2.4 billion in the first nine months of last year. Much of that money has been used to increase dividends and to buy back stock. In fact, the stock buybacks were in part responsible for raising earnings to $1.08 a share. The gain over the third quarter last year was 13 percent a share, exactly what analysts had predicted. Actual earnings were $1.788 billion, up 11 percent over the corresponding quarter last year.
Both the sales and earnings reflect a nonrecurring bonanza from last summer's Olympics, which analysts say tacked $650 million onto NBC's sales numbers and added close to $60 million in profits to the company's coffers. The sluggish economy in Europe, an area that accounts for about a fifth of G.E.'s sales (a quarter, counting exports from the United States), reined in some sales.
Still, the good news far outweighed the bad. G.E.'s major appliances, despite a flat market, saw sales increase about 4 percent, as G.E. continued to grab share away from Whirlpool, Maytag and other makers of washers, dryers and the like.
G.E. plastics and silicones did well, despite soaring chemical costs, primarily because demand was high and no new capacity came on stream.
G.E.'s power systems division, which has had technological problems with some of its newer turbines as well as a flat market from American utilities, got a tremendous boost when Nuovo Pignone, the Italian company it purchased in late 1993, received a $1 billion contract to supply compressors to Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas company. Power system's sales were up 30 percent and its profits up 35 percent for the quarter.
Even G.E.'s nuclear businesses are enjoying a turnaround, as more utilities hire the company to manage existing nuclear power plants.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall On Worries Over Earnings And Inflation

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks drifted farther away from record territory yesterday amid growing caution about earnings reports and September's inflation data.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.95, to 5,921.67, rebounding from an early 26-point loss, but extending a weeklong slide from record levels. The index breached 6,000 for the first time on Monday. 
 Broader measures also recovered from steeper losses in the morning, but the rebound was cut short by a worsening bond market. For the fourth session, the yield on the 30-year Treasury rose, finishing the day at 6.88 percent, up 5 basis points.
"People are worried that retail sales may be picking up a bit and that maybe the inflation numbers that are coming out will be a little higher than they have been," Robert Streed, senior investment adviser at Northern Trust in Chicago, said.
In their monthly sales reports, the nation's retailers showed mixed results for September. Still, the trend was strong enough to leave analysts upbeat about the Christmas selling season.
In another indication of inflationary pressure, first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 22,000 last week, to 319,000, the lowest level in five weeks.
Although the volatile weekly unemployment tally is given far less attention than the Labor Department's monthly unemployment report, analysts had expected the claims to remain unchanged from the previous week, noting signs that job creation had slowed in recent weeks.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly a 13-to-11 margin. Volume totaled 395.4 million shares, down from 408.5 million on Wednesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.13 points, to 694.61.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.01 points, to 1,236.97, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.11 point, to 579.99.
Shares of General Electric fell 7/8, to 92. The company said its third-quarter profits rose 11 percent, lifted by the Summer Olympics broadcast by its NBC television network.
Sears, Roebuck, which reported a 7 percent gain in September sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1/2, to 48 1/4. Shares of the Gap rose 1 1/2, to 28 1/4, in active trading after reporting that same-store sales were essentially flat. The stock had fallen in recent sessions amid fears of an even worse showing.
Shares of Olin, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., jumped 4 3/8, to 88 1/2, after the company said it would spin off its ammunition and aerospace divisions into a new company, Primex Technologies, sell four chemical businesses and buy back as many as 10 million common shares.
Monsanto shares rose 1 1/4, to 41 7/8, in Big Board trading. The company, based in St. Louis, said yesterday that it was considering splitting off its chemical businesses.
In Nasdaq trading, shares of Sunglass Hut International fell 45/16 , to 93/16 , after the company, based in Coral Gables, Fla., warned that earnings for the current quarter could fall below forecasts unless sales for the rest of the period exceed targets. Sunglass Hut blamed a slowdown in mall traffic, cooler weather and a lack of new products. Afterward, several brokerage firms downgraded Sunglass Hut, and one downgraded Oakley, a sunglasses designer that relies on Sunglass Hut as a key sales outlet. Oakley shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, finished the day at 37 1/4, down 7 7/8.

HEADLINE: For Nuclear Power Plant, Bottom Line Is Death Knell

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
For many years, the debate about nuclear energy in America has been framed by concerns about the environment and dominated by complicated discussions of geology and water tables and the disposal of spent fuel rods.
But the decision on Wednesday by Northeast Utilities in Connecticut that it probably will not restart the 28-year-old Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant in Haddam Neck -- currently shut down for safety reasons -- suggests that the environmental arguments are no longer the prime mover. Accountants now call the tune. 
 For the nation's oldest operating full-scale nuclear power plant, the numbers simply do not add up anymore, the company said.
The idea goes to the heart of what utility industry experts say is one of the great emerging themes of the nation's aging archipelago of nuclear plants: drastic change.
The aging plants were built in an environment of utter stability -- with 40-year-licenses, billions of dollars in capital costs and a dense overlay of necessary scientific and government regulation. They have now lived long enough to see just about everything change around them, as the electricity-generating industry has been transformed from stodgy and slow to fast and competitive.
Newer, more efficient power plants and plummeting costs in some parts of the country for fuels like natural gas have lowered costs for non-nuclear power-generation choices. At the same time, deregulation of the utility industry has given more customers choices about which competitor they choose. Being a power-generating company has become a high-risk business in one of the least forgiving environments of all: Wall Street.
"It's a tough, tough industry right now because of competition, and the simple fact is, you can't pass the cost on if the customer has choice," said Paul Patterson, a senior analyst at Furman Selz, the investment firm.
Certainly, Connecticut Yankee's fate is not a death knell for all nuclear power. But the plant had two important factors in its favor: a long-term record as one of the most reliable in the nation, as measured by the infrequency of past shutdowns, and its location in New England, where it had little local competition from cheaper energy sources like hydroelectric power that have battered nuclear plants in the west. That is not a hopeful note for nuclear operators in tougher markets.
In other words, if an aging plant cannot make economic sense in Connecticut, where can it make sense?
"A lot of folks with 10 to 15 years left on their licenses are going to be watching this very carefully," said Karl R. Rabago, the energy program manager for the Environmental Defense Fund.
In economic terms, any uncertainty adds to the risk of an investment, and, utility experts say, for older plants like Connecticut Yankee especially, concerns and uncertainties about safety and age have been compounded in an industry that, like telephone service and health care, is in the middle of a total transformation.
If the company does decide to close the plant formally -- a decision it expects to make in the next several months -- Connecticut Yankee will have to deal with a moving target as costs and prices are deregulated.
Under deregulation, which is proceeding in all three states in the region, utilities that once had territorial monopolies and had their prices set by the government will compete for customers in much the same way telephone companies do.
But the question is, which era's values should hold sway -- those of the old regulated mentality or those of the market? Does the company have to swallow the costs because, under the harsh logic of the market, it made a bad investment? Or should the costs be spread to its customers because the company built the plant in a different time, under rules that were changed when it was too late to go back?
"The old regime was a regulatory compact," said Jamshed K. Madan, a principal at Georgetown Consulting Group, a Connecticut firm that advises mostly state utility regulators. "The utility would provide safe and adequate service at reasonable cost, and on the other side, would get a return that was commensurate with that operation." What that meant, he said, was that a company with higher costs simply built that into the rate structure.
"Competition doesn't work that way," Mr. Madan said. "If you have $10 extra in cost, you might just be the highest cost producer, and you've got to eat it."
To some extent, industry experts say that nuclear energy's economic problems are really the problems of all power generators, who face the fiercest blasts of competition as the utilities are deregulated. They must compete on price or close up shop in the world to come.
Indeed, Connecticut Yankee's second-largest shareholder, New England Electric System, a utility in Westborough, Mass., which owns 15 percent of the plant, announced just last month that it wanted to divest itself of the generation business entirely and to concentrate on delivery. Last month the company also formally requested the economic review that led to Wednesday's report on Yankee's viability.
One of the main topics in the industry is how to compensate companies for the obsolete investments they made in regulated days. Environmental groups, in an unusual alliance with the utilities, have pushed the idea of allowing companies to pass along some of the costs of closing old plants. They argue that it would be fair to the companies, and by being fair would hasten the companies' decisions to shut down the plants that the environmentalists don't like.
So far, only California has created a structure to make those pass-through costs, said Mr. Patterson at Furman Selz, though Massachusetts is close behind. It is expected to follow California's lead, perhaps by the end of this year.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Indonesian Businessman Has Strong Ties to Clinton

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Last year, when Indonesia's Ambassador here wanted to arrange a rare meeting with President Clinton, he did not rely on the State Department or the White House, but turned to James T. Riady, a 39-year-old Indonesian businessman, for help. The Ambassador said he knew that the President's longtime friendship with Mr. Riady was how Mr. Clinton "came to be familiar with Indonesia."
As a member of a billionaire Indonesian family whose business interests and political influence span the United States and Asia, especially in China, the family's ancestral country, Mr. Riady is adept at using his connections to bring together the political and commercial elite on both continents. Nineteen years ago, Mr. Riady was an intern at an investment bank in Little Rock, Ark., when he met Mr. Clinton and helped set up the family's ties to Arkansas. 
 With Mr. Clinton's election to the Presidency in 1992, the Riadys and their business associates have become more politically active, from soliciting campaign contributions to influencing trade policy and conducting quiet diplomacy.
In the United States and overseas, they have played an important role in helping finance the Democratic Party over the last four years, contributing and raising millions of dollars. In turn, the Riadys' political support helped them place their American representative in an influential trade job in the Clinton Administration, the family's associates say.
The Knight Ridder news service reported that one of the largest contributions to the Democratic Party this year, $425,000, came from Arief Wiriandinata, an Indonesian who lived briefly in Virginia and whose father-in-law was a senior executive who worked for the Riadys.
Last month, in response to queries from The Los Angeles Times, the Democratic Party returned an unlawful $250,000 contribution that had been solicited from a South Korean company by the former American head of the Riady's American business operations, John Huang. Mr. Huang became vice chairman of the party's finance committee after stepping down late last year as a high-ranking trade official at the Commerce Department.
The flood of money from Asian interests has renewed debate over whether laws governing foreign contributions are too weak.
Out of the limelight, Mr. Riady has become a player in Asian-American relations, holding discussions with Mr. Clinton about United States relations with China and Indonesia, American and Asian officials say. The officials also say he has acted as a back-channel between the State Department and President Suharto of Indonesia on East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia now controls and where human rights questions have been raised.
In the commercial realm, the Riadys have become business partners with Americans who want to do business in Asia, along the way hooking up with some prominent Arkansans who are close to Mr. Clinton. Among them is C. Joseph Giroir Jr., the former law partner who hired Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock.
The projects being planned by Mr. Giroir and the Riady family include a $1 billion power plant in China.
Mark Fabiani, an associate White House counsel, said, "The Riadys are longtime supporters of the President." Mr. Fabiani's initial review of records has uncovered only two or three possible meetings between the President and Mr. Riady at the White House, including one in 1995 involving Mr. Giroir, Mr. Huang and Mr. Riady.
The Riady-Arkansas connection is longstanding. Mochtar Riady, the family patriarch, studied banking in China and made the family's initial investments in Arkansas. But it was his son, James, who spent the most time in Arkansas and became close to Mr. Clinton.
In 1977, when he was 20, James Riady went to Little Rock to train at Stephens Inc., a large investment bank. He met Mr. Clinton, then the state's Attorney General, and later returned to help run Worthen Bank, a large Arkansas bank that had been partly owned by the Riadys and the Stephens family.
The lawyer at the Rose Law Firm who represented both the Worthen Bank and Mr. Riady in the 1980's was Webster L. Hubbell, another former law partner of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Hubbell kept up his connections to the Riadys. When he quit as Associate Attorney General in 1994 to defend himself against charges of bilking his former law partners and clients, Mr. Hubbell traveled to Indonesia. He has testified before the Senate Whitewater committee that he was retained by the Riady family's company, but declined to discuss what he did or how much he was paid.
In his testimony Mr. Hubbell said he worked for a Riady affiliate until he pleaded guilty to two felony counts in late 1994. The affiliate was part of the Lippo Group, a diversified holding company controlled by the Riadys with interests in banks, insurance and real estate.
In the United States, the Riady holdings include a California bank, the Lippo Bank. In April 1994, Federal bank examiners found evidence that the bank violated "laws and/or regulations," Federal records show.
Later that year Federal regulators ordered the bank to impose tighter controls to assure compliance with the anti-money laundering law, the records show. The order was lifted last March. A bank official declined this week to discuss the matter.
Mr. Huang was the Lippo Bank's vice chairman until the summer of 1994, when he joined the Commerce Department as the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Economic Policy. The Riadys have told associates that they were able to help Mr. Huang get his Commerce Department job as a result of the family's political support for Mr. Clinton, according to two Riady associates who asked not to be identified.
In that position, Mr. Huang would have been able to influence a wide array of trade policy issues, though a spokeswoman for the department, Anne Luzzatto, said Mr. Huang primarily involved himself in managerial and administrative matters.
In 1992, James Riady and his wife gave at least $175,000 to the Democratic Party and the Clinton inaugural fund. Election laws allow foreigners to donate to political parties as long as they are legally residing in the United States at the time. Mr. and Mrs. Riady were legal immigrants living in the United States until 1993, according to Federal records. They now live in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
Mr. Riady has avoided talking publicly about his ties to Mr. Clinton. As recently as this week, he told a reporter at an Asian business forum in New York that he would not discuss his American political activities or his relationship with the President.
But Mr. Riady has told others that his political support for Mr. Clinton stems from his longstanding friendship and the Democratic Party's greater interest in minority issues, including those of Asian-Americans. In Indonesia, ethnic Chinese were subjected to official as well as social discrimination. In recent years, however, with the opening up of China, the elite Chinese business community, including the Riady family, are pillars of the establishment.
Other Asian and American officials describe Mr. Riady more as a bridge between Indonesia and the United States.
Arifin M. Siregar, the Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, said in an interview last year that Mr. Riady was very useful in setting up the 1995 meeting with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Siregar said Mr. Riady attended the meeting but he declined to discuss what they talked about.
Mr. Fabiani said there was no record of a White House meeting, but he did not want to suggest that the meeting described by Ambassador Siregar did not occur.
The Riadys have also set up meetings between Americans and President Suharto. And James Riady has promoted East Timor's investment opportunities to Americans, taking some Arkansas associates of Mr. Clinton there, according to associates of Mr. Riady.
The State Department has criticized Indonesia's human rights record, but the Administration has angered some labor and human rights groups by not linking the criticism to economic issues. For example, the Administration has maintained tariff preferences for Indonesia despite complaints by human rights groups. At the Asian-Pacific economic summit talks that were held in Jakarta in 1994, however, human rights and East Timor were not high on the agenda.
During that mid-November summit, Mr. Clinton slipped away for a visit with Mr. Riady, a Lippo spokeswoman, Dewi Dharmanan, said at the time. Mr. Fabiani said the President only met the Riadys briefly in Jakarta during a summit-related reception at which they were the hosts. While he was in Jakarta, Mr. Clinton planned to meet with some Arkansans, but the idea was dropped because a White House aide thought it was a bad idea, according to private testimony before the Senate Whitewater committee cited in The Wall Street Journal.

HEADLINE: Both Kemp and Gore Erred in Debate Over Policy on Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
When the Vice-Presidential debate turned to foreign policy, there was a sharp exchange of views over Mexico, with Jack Kemp accusing the Clinton Administration of causing Mexico's worst economic crisis in half a century, and Vice President Al Gore defending the Administration's actions with boasts that Mexico had already paid back all the money it borrowed.
Both were wrong. 
 Mr. Kemp first broached the subject of the Mexican peso crisis, which has been criticized by Republicans since the early months of 1995, when Washington cobbled together an international rescue package.
In the past, some Republican leaders have accused the Administration of having been caught asleep at the wheel when the peso was devalued in December 1994. The war cry at the time was, "Who Lost Mexico?"
During Wednesday night's debate in St. Petersburg, Fla., Mr. Kemp shifted direction. He blamed the Administration for forcing Mexico to devalue the peso, setting off a chain reaction of panic selling and roaring inflation that crippled the Mexican economy and threatened to spread to other countries.
"We caused the problem in the first place," Mr. Kemp said. "And it cost us $20 billion to $50 billion to bail them out."
In fact, the $50 billion package included only $20 billion from the United States, and the Mexicans have never used all that had been made available to them. The remaining $30 billion in the package was put up by the International Monetary Fund and the central banks of several European nations.
Mr. Gore patiently but persistently tried to give his version of what happened. "No. That's not right," he said the first time. "I fail to understand the basis of the charge that we caused the monetary crisis in Mexico," he said later. "They manage their own monetary policy."
Mexican officials have always said they were forced by rapidly deteriorating economic conditions to abruptly devalue the peso just three weeks after Ernesto Zedillo became President in 1994.
In the months before the devaluation, private economists and United States Treasury officials had grown increasingly worried about Mexico's growing debt and the evaporation of investor confidence in Mexico.
"We had expressed grave concerns about Mexico's inconsistent exchange rate policy and monetary regime in 1994," Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said in a telephone interview. "Mexico made its own decision to devalue the peso, and notified us of it after it had been taken."
But Mr. Gore's precise performance grew sloppy when he bragged about how the Mexican rescue had turned from a risky loan to a nicely profitable venture.
"We've ended up making a $500 million profit," the Vice President said. "All of the loans have been paid back."
In fact, the Mexicans have not paid back everything they owe the United States. They had drawn down $12.5 billion of the total of $20 billion that the United States had offered. Under pressure to pay back the loans before the elections, the Mexican Government has moved quickly to repay $9 billion.
Mexico still owes $3.5 billion. The next payment is not due until next summer.
So far, Mexico has paid $1.36 billion in interest on the loans, according to the Treasury Department. The $500 million in profit that Mr. Gore mentioned is calculated to be over and above what the Government would have made if it had used the money set aside for Mexico in other ways. Mexico was charged a premium, about four percentage points higher than other borrowers would have received.
Mexico has risked angering the European nations that contribute to the International Monetary Fund by focusing its repayment efforts almost exclusively on its debt to the United States.
Mexico borrowed about $14.5 billion from the international organization. So far, it has paid back $1 billion.

1 Economy, 2 Diagnoses

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Listening to Jack Kemp and Al Gore debate on Wednesday night, it would be easy to conclude that the two men lived in completely different countries.
Mr. Kemp's America is one in which economic growth is drastically stunted, condemned to inching along at 2.5 percent a year, unless its citizens are no longer grossly overtaxed and its Government drops what he called its "anti-capitalistic mentality." 
 Mr. Gore's America, in contrast, is a capitalist's dream, the job-creating envy of the world, charging ahead while Europe and Japan are languishing in low-growth swamplands. It is bursting with productivity, overflowing with exports produced by the world's most highly trained workers.
Not surprisingly, both worlds have been overdrawn in the heat of the campaign end-game. And though both campaigns insist that only the private sector can spur growth and create jobs, each sees the Government playing a central role in charging the economy. But their paths to that goal are dramatically different.
Mr. Kemp, far more consistently than his running mate, makes the case that the only answer is an across-the-board tax cut that would free entrepreneurs to spend money any way they wish. "We should double the rate of growth, and we should double the size of the American economy," Mr. Kemp said on Wednesday, setting a goal even higher than the one he has usually espoused on the campaign trail. That would mean growth rates of 5 percent a year -- a pace rarely seen in the United States in the past two decades.
Mr. Gore, along with the Administration's economic advisers, talks mantra-like about the wonders of cutting the deficit. Their tax-cut programs are modest and narrow: to assure that every high school student can afford some form of college, for example, or to encourage companies to hire welfare recipients.
It is hardly unusual for candidates to portray the state of the American economy in such starkly different terms; incumbents always seize the best statistics of the day and claim credit for them, and challengers usually talk about missed opportunities for the country to do far better.
But their solutions overlap more than either side would like to admit: both advocate a $500 tax credit per child for working families, and contend that it is possible to balance the budget without cutting into Medicare, Medicaid and entitlement programs, a feat that makes partisans in both camps roll their eyes. At times, with his talk of urban policy and making sure the poor are not left behind, Mr. Kemp sounded like the Democrat, while Mr. Gore's discussion of the benefits of deficit reduction had echoes of pre-1996 Bob Dole.
The problem, many economists say, is that both sides are probably overselling the Government's power to affect the growth of an economy the size of the United States'.
"The truth of it is that there is not a hell of a lot the Government can do," said Charles L. Schultze of the Brookings Institution, who served on President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers. His own analysis is that Mr. Dole's tax-cut plan, if fully paid for with large budget cuts, would increase growth by about a tenth of a percentage point a year -- hardly the stuff of campaign drama. And even a Government commitment to education and training larger than anything the Administration has proposed would have about the same effect, he concludes.
"The bottom line is that if you want get the most bang for the buck in economic growth, cut the budget deficit," Mr. Schultze concluded.
The opposite scenario, commonly discussed on Wall Street these days is that after a five-year expansion, the American economy seems likely to slow down in coming years, no matter what economic course the Government pursues. But that is too impolitic a subject to be mentioned by either campaign. "Not great sound bites there," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers allowed the other day. "Next subject."
While the differences in economic views were particularly vivid in the Kemp-Gore debate on Wednesday night, the contrasts have surfaced only episodically during much of the campaign. Mr. Dole declared several weeks ago that achieving economic growth of roughly 3.5 percent through a 15-percent cut in taxes "is what this campaign is all about," but he did not talk about boosting America's growth rate in his first debate with President Clinton last Sunday. That reinforced the view that while Mr. Kemp is a true believer in the power of tax cuts, Mr. Dole has his doubts. "He reveals his discomfort with his proposal by not sustaining a continued effort to sell the package to the American public," Salomon Brothers warned clients last week.
Conversely, while the Administration has taken a page from Mr. Dole's book in declaring that "the era of big government is over," his campaign has rarely let a week go by without unveiling another small program or targeted tax cut that is termed part of a "concerted growth agenda." In fact, while some of those tax incentives are clearly tied to increasing productivity -- credits for higher education or job retraining -- others seem more akin to election-year gifts. First among those is Mr. Clinton's proposal, first made during the Democratic convention, to end the capital-gains tax on the sale of a home, up to $500,000.
The key to the Clinton Administration's tax cuts is that they do not cost much. That has freed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore to make the case that the $550 billion tax cut proposed by the Dole campaign -- which they pejoratively term a "tax scheme" -- would "blow a hole in the deficit." And that message, more than any other, seems to have undermined the political effectiveness of the call for a 15 percent tax cut.
"It was a miscalculation," Richard Darman, the veteran of many budget wars during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, said of the 15 percent plan recently. "The public actually cares more about deficit reduction than about tax cuts. This year, the Republican candidates didn't believe those polls. After the election, maybe they will believe it."
But that is only one theory about why the Republican theme that worked so well for Ronald Reagan in 1980 -- cut taxes and the economy will boom -- is not selling so well.
The most compelling theory is that that experience of the Reagan years has undermined the political appeal of big tax cuts.
It was during the Reagan era that the United States ran up the huge budget deficits that still weigh down the economy today. While Democrats and Republicans still argue over which party is responsible for failing to trim the budget to pay for the tax cuts, the experience left millions of voters suspicious of any plan that calls for cutting taxes first and spending later.
Another theory -- one put forward by Republicans like Mr. Darman and Democrats like Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- is that voters no longer feel the bite of ever-increasing taxes the way they did in the 1980's. At that time, the problem was "bracket creep": inflation kept pushing taxpayers into ever-higher tax brackets. But there are fewer brackets now, and little inflation.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle Mr. Kemp's growth argument faces is a more basic one: while America may be growing slowly, its biggest competitors in the world are growing even slower. Growth rates tend to be a hot political issue only when Americans have the sense that their clocks are being cleaned by the competition; Mr. Clinton played that card well in 1992, when the Japanese economy appeared to be thriving at the expense of Silicon Valley and Detroit. Today, both the popular perception and the politics of America's competitive standing have reversed.

In the Hamptons, Prices Are Soaring, but Not All

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Some brokers in the Hamptons are cautioning people not to panic. It's not that the market is so bad -- but that it's so good.
"In terms of prices for some properties, we've surpassed even the hot 80's," said Philip Elliott, who manages the East Hampton and Southampton branches of Sotheby's International Realty. "But we don't want people to panic and start raising the prices of their houses; we don't want to give the impression that anybody can sell anything at any price because then they'll wind up not selling at all." 
 The market, he said, is strong, "but it's not tearing away; it's not scary." Furthermore, brokers say there are exceptions: some of the more mundane houses in less desirable locations and some of the post-modern-style houses built in the 1970's and 1980's. Nevertheless, Hamptons brokers report that their sales volumes are up from 30 to 60 percent over a year ago.
"We're experiencing a terrific frenzy," said Melanie Ross, president of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate. "Right now, we have far more buyers than supply in about every price range."
And the sales are not only in prestigious East Hampton and Southampton. In Bridgehampton, the average price of a house soared 77 percent in less than a year, Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East Hampton said. In Bridgehampton, the average price of 40 house sales was $450,000 in the first quarter; by the middle of the year the average of 32 sales was $800,000.
Average home prices in nearby Wainscott, where properties are traditionally less expensive than in the towns with "hampton" in their name, jumped by 24 percent, from $267,000 to $330,000.
Brokers gave several reasons for the increase, beginning with the country's economy, followed by a great year on Wall Street. Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead, also credited the recent repeal of New York State's 10 percent surcharge on the profits on transfers of real estate over $1 million.
The price increases are particularly remarkable in land sales. Mr. Newbold pointed to a 5.3-acre parcel overlooking Sagg Pond in Sagaponack. In June of this year, an investor bought the land for $650,000. This month, he said, it went under contract for $1,395,000.
Or take the case of a 1.3-acre lot on Sagg Pond Court, which is closer to the beach than to Sagg Pond, also in Sagaponack. The lot, in a subdivision of 10 lots, sold in 1994 for $299,000. The lot sold again one year later for $375,000. This year, it sold for $495,000, Ms. Saatchi said.
But Ms. Saatchi -- whose total volume, she said, was up 60 percent -- wanted to be very clear.
While prices have risen "almost across the board in village houses, in antiques and vintage properties that can be fixed up and in brand new homes in the traditional style," she said, there are exceptions: "Seventies and 80's contemporaries are out of fashion," she said, along with properties "that are not well located, where we still have a lot of supply." These are "undistinguished houses on one-acre lots in the woods, where one street looks like another," she said. Ms. Ross agreed. "In the higher price ranges -- over $2 million -- there's hardly anything left, but you can still get a little two- or three-bedroom house in the Springs or Noyak for $150,000," she said. "These are in wooded areas, close to a bay beach, no pool. They're actually quite pleasant, but not desirable for most of our buyers and certainly not to people looking for an address."
For the smaller homes in wooded areas, Ms. Ross said, prices have stabilized -- they are no longer going down and may even be up slightly. For one of the new homes on Parsonage Lane in Sagaponack, south of the highway (on the ocean side of Route 27, the main road through the Hamptons), prices seem to be steadily rising.
In June 1994, Ms. Saatchi said, the highest price for one of these five-bedroom, five-bath houses with pool and garage, built by the same contractor, was $1 million. In May, one of the houses sold for $1.375 million and one is listed for $1.85 million.
The brokers seemed particularly amazed at prices for houses within the village of East Hampton. A house north of the highway in town "just closed on Newtown Lane in September for $600,000 -- a two-bedroom with a guest house -- and one in July for $575,000," Ms. Saatchi said. "Two years ago, I would've fallen over in disbelief if any house there sold for more than $400,000."

Prospect of a British Rate Rise Sends Pound to 11-Month High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The British pound reached an 11-month high against the dollar yesterday and rallied against other currencies on expectations of higher British interest rates.
The dollar finished mostly higher against other currencies, an indirect result of the pound's strength. It also benefited from remarks by senior officials in Japan indicating that interest rates there would remain low -- which depressed the exchange value of the yen. 
 The main theme in currency dealings was the appetite for the pound, which came a day after the British Government reported higher-than-expected inflation data for September, suggesting that the nation's central bank would soon raise rates. Higher rates make a currency more attractive.
Traders also focused on the release earlier this week of minutes of a September meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the central bank governor, Eddie George, that also suggested the possibility of higher British rates in coming months.
The prospect of higher British interest rates, combined with steady or falling rates in continental Europe and Japan and the uncertain prospect for rates in the United States, combined to create heavy demand for the pound.
"Sterling was strengthening against the dollar as it was strengthening against the rest of Europe, and that's a positive sign for sterling," said Michael Malpede, chief currency analyst at the Refco Group, a Chicago-based brokerage firm.
Late in New York yesterday, the pound rose to $1.5750, from $1.5665 on Thursday and the highest level against the dollar since early November 1995. The pound also hit highs for the year against the mark.
The dollar rose to 111.60 yen from 111.15. It ended lower against the German mark, at 1.5307 compared with 1.5382 marks on Thursday.
Some traders said that a rousing speech by Mr. Clarke on Thursday to the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, England, also encouraged optimism about the pound, spurring some hope that the Conservatives might win the general election that will be held by May 1997 and retain power. Recent polls continue to show the opposition Labor Party with a big lead, but the Conservatives ended their conference with a strong show of unity.

HEADLINE: Price Report Revives Bonds After a Week of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After being pounded this week by investor fears of inflation and higher interest rates, Treasury prices rebounded yesterday in a shortened session.
Buying was encouraged by a report on September producer prices that showed inflation in check and by retail sales data that pointed to moderate growth. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to 9828/32 , in trading that ended at 2 P.M. in New York. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.84 percent, from 6.88 percent on Thursday. The Treasury market will be closed on Monday, in observance of Columbus Day, and will reopen on Tuesday.
Prices rose after the Labor Department reported that its Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent, less than expectations of a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent. And the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, but that followed a revised figure for August, which showed a modest decline. In addition, the strength in September sales came largely from cars and light trucks, which are expected to slow.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, said the market had declined the four previous sessions largely "on repeated news stories or opinions that P.P.I. and retail data could be worse than the consensus."
"But when they came in at pretty much the consensus, the market experienced a relief trade," he said.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, said: "The fear that consumers would come roaring back in the fourth quarter was not borne out by the retail sales statistics.
"In fact, after incorporating last month's significant revisions, it appeared more like the consumer ended the third quarter with more of a whimoer than a bang."
The market may have also received help from comments yesterday by a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey. In an address to the Atlantic Economic Conference in Washington, Mr. Lindsey said real income growth was virtually nonexistent.
His comments confirmed the market's optimism that the Federal Reserve would continue to hold interest rates steady.
Indeed, Mr. Lindsey said the Fed's monetary policy was "about right" in terms of historic levels.
Still, any lingering concerns about inflation and Fed policy may not be enough to drag down the market sharply lower, Mr. Hamilton of Everen Securities said.
"We still feel that international accounts have been the driving force behind the recent run-up in bond prices," he said. "Until we see selling from those international accounts, sharp moves down will probably not occur. As long as the dollar remains on its general upward path it will act as a support in a down market."

HEADLINE: U.S. Benefits Go; Allure to Dominicans Doesn't

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
The line outside the United States Consulate here begins forming at dawn, and as the police struggle to keep order and vendors hawk lottery tickets it lengthens rapidly with Dominicans who hope to join relatives already living in the United States.
Nearly everyone seems to know that the United States is adopting measures that sharply cut benefits to legal as well as illegal immigrants. But that has not dampened their determination to reach what they see as the land of their dreams. 
 "I've got two good arms and two good legs to work," scoffed Elisa Mojica, a recently wed 22-year-old beautician who is awaiting a visa to join her 24-year-old husband, Amauris, in New Jersey. "I don't want to go there to live on welfare; I want to go there to improve my life."
The lure of a better future will continue to draw immigrants to the United States, Dominicans say, so long as poverty and lack of opportunity here endure. Although some in Congress maintain that immigrants flock to the United States for the benefits that the new measures on welfare and immigration would now deny them, interviews with more than two dozen Dominicans show that most of them dismiss American efforts to discourage immigration as illogical and likely to fail.
In the Absent Dominicans barrio, named in honor of those who sent home the money that built the tidy pastel houses lining the street, Ruben Cueva said he continued to dream of joining his 2 sisters and 10 nieces and nephews in Queens.
"If you've got money, the Dominican Republic is the best country in the world in which to live," said Mr. Cueva, who was recently hired as foreman of a garbage collection team after a long spell without a job. "The rich here, they have no need to go anywhere. But we who are poor, we are eating stones, so these measures are not going to stop anybody from going to New York in search of the green."
Over the last decade, that search has made this Caribbean nation of 7.5 million people the source of more legal immigrants to New York City than any other country, according to the New York City Department of Planning. Of the roughly 40,000 Dominicans who have entered the United States legally each year since 1990, more than 22,000 a year have settled in New York City, with many of the rest establishing themselves elsewhere in the metropolitan area.
But there is also a substantial flow of illegal immigration to the United States, both the Dominican and the United States Governments acknowledge. Statistics compiled here indicate that more than 700,000 people have left the country in the last decade, the bulk of whom are assumed to have settled in cities in the Eastern United States.
In the United States 28 percent of Dominican households classified as post-1980 "new arrivals" have received public assistance at one time or another, ranking them third among immigrant groups. By comparison, 38 percent of new Vietnamese arrivals and 33 percent of immigrants from the former Soviet Union received such assistance. For all households in the United States, the figure is 7.5 percent; in New York City, 13.3 percent of the households are on public assistance.
Many Dominican immigrants, however, gravitate toward factory jobs or end up opening small businesses. The money sent home by Dominicans living abroad is now the largest single source of foreign exchange for this country, amounting to more than $1 billion a year and making the recent American debate about immigration and welfare resonate deeply here.
"My relatives were just down here visiting, and that's all we talked about," said Tomas Vasquez, a 50-year-old cement salesman. "I don't think there is a single family in this country that doesn't have somebody in the United States, so naturally there has been a lot of attention paid to the coverage in the newspapers and on radio and television."
The new welfare law, which was signed into law on Aug. 22, will deny many current legal immigrants food stamps and supplemental Social Security income and denies future immigrants the right to food stamps, public housing, Medicaid and other social services during their first five years of residence. Congress has also approved a restrictive immigration bill that includes provisions requiring minimum income levels for sponsors of immigrants, and President Clinton is expected to sign the measure soon.
Here, few questioned the right of the United States to try to diminish the flow of immigration from poor, developing countries like this one. "Personally, I think these new laws are anti-Latino," said Narciso Frias, a 31-year-old mechanic. "But it's their country, and they should be able to take whatever measures they think are necessary to guarantee their national security."
Yet most of those interviewed here said economic pressures would continue to encourage Dominicans to try to reach the United States, whether legally, through family reunification programs, or illegally, in the flimsy boats called yolas that regularly make the dangerous sea crossing to the west coast of Puerto Rico. From there entry to the American mainland is relatively easy.
"What else would make people risk their lives to board yolas and go to a place where they are not wanted?" asked Juan Pablo Diaz Gonzalez, a 59-year-old store owner from the northern town of Moca who often visits relatives in the United States. "This country has been in a state of economic stagnation for years, so people are desperate and have no other choice."
Billilo Vidal, an unemployed painter and carpenter, counts himself among that group. Last year, he said, he stowed away on a ship carrying a consignment of machinery back to the United States after an industrial fair here, but was discovered and briefly jailed. Nevertheless, he said, he plans to try again as soon as he can afford to do so.
"If I had the money, I'd be out of here in a flash, regardless of whatever measures might be taken in the United States," said Mr. Vidal, 41. "It's not that I want to go, but that I have to go. I've got five kids, and I'm not even able to give them what they need for breakfast. I want to have a house that I own, instead of having to pay rent, and I can only achieve that in the United States, not here."
The concern that Dominican immigrants might be adversely affected by the new welfare and immigration laws extends to the highest levels of Government here. President Leonel Fernandez Reyna, who took office in mid-August, grew up in New York City, where his mother worked as a seamstress, and he attended elementary and high school on the Upper West Side.
In a speech last month, which was later televised in New York on Channel 41, Mr. Fernandez, a 42-year-old lawyer, said he recognized that "many Dominican families residing in the United States that have benefited from welfare and food stamps will begin to experience difficulties once this law is promulgated." But he urged Dominicans living in the United States to feel free to pursue dual citizenship, which was made legal here in 1994, in order to retain whatever benefits they could.
"If you, young mother, or you, elderly gentleman, or you, young student, feel the need to adopt the nationality of the United States in order to confront the vicissitudes of that society stemming from the end of the welfare era, do not feel tormented by this," he said. "Do it with a peaceful conscience, for you will continue being Dominicans, and we will welcome you as such when you set foot on the soil of our republic."
But long before Mr. Fernandez spoke, Fernando Mateo, the 38-year-old owner of a document courier and money transfer company, Mateo Express, had already taken that step. Many other Dominicans are sure to follow suit as a result of the pressure they are feeling, he said, with easily predictable political consequences.
"Indirectly, the Republicans are doing us a favor by encouraging us to empower ourselves by becoming American citizens," Mr. Mateo, who divides his time between New York and Santo Domingo, said at his office here. "If we do that, we will be heard, the way the Cubans are in Miami. Any time they holler, the President goes running to Florida. Then we'll be able to negotiate, and anyone who wants our vote will have to help develop this country, so that less of us take off for the United States."

HEADLINE: Fewer Unwed Mothers

 BODY:
Last year the illegitimacy rate in America dropped for the first time in 20 years. The number of babies born to teen-agers also declined for the fourth year in a row. There may be several factors at work here -- more accurate reporting, for example, and wider use of contraceptives, particularly among teen-agers -- but the new data can only hearten all those who worry about the social, economic and personal consequences of illegitimacy.
The National Center for Health Statistics reports a decline in the rate of births to unmarried women, from 46.9 per 1,000 in 1994 to 44.9 last year -- the first drop since 1978. About half of the decline is attributable to more accurate reporting of out-of-wedlock births to Latino women in California. The rate of births to 15-to-19-year-olds dropped 3 percent in a year, from 58.9 births per 1,000 women in 1994 to 56.9 last year. 
 The Alan Guttmacher Institute says that government-financed contraceptive programs deserve some of the credit. In a new study, the institute concludes that on an average annual basis, these programs prevented about 1.3 million unplanned pregnancies -- two-thirds of them involving unmarried women -- and 29 percent involving teen-agers.
The institute notes further that family planning programs are cost-effective, with every tax dollar spent on contraception saving three dollars in Medicaid costs for pregnancy-related health care. Family planning services also avert more welfare costs.
Federal and state funding for these programs exceeds $700 million, but measured in 1980 dollars, spending has decreased by about 30 percent. Young, poor and single women are most at risk from unplanned pregnancies. They are also the largest consumers of publicly funded family services. Higher funding for these services would be a smart investment.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Help Stocks Regain Part of Week's Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks broke out of a weeklong slump yesterday, helped by economic data pointing to modest growth with stable inflation, sending interest rates lower in the bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.71 points, to 5,969.38, cutting its loss for the week to 23.48 and pulling back within 31 points of 6,000. 
 The Dow broke above the 6,000 mark for the first time on Monday and did it again on Tuesday but quickly backed away both days.
Broader measures were higher too, moving back toward Monday's record highs, after several days of profit taking amid jitters about of third-quarter profits.
Bellwether technology shares were among the session's biggest gainers, as signs of improving computer demand were reinforced by Morgan Stanley's upgrade of Intel, the world's leading producer of semiconductors.
Stocks received an early lift from bonds, which ended a four-session losing streak and rallied after the Government reported that inflation at the producer level eased in September while retail sales rebounded from a summer slump.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of a percent in September; the Commerce Department said retail sales rose seven-tenths of a percent.
The two readings were seen as reinforcing the delicate balance that has helped the markets bounce back so quickly from July's selloff: strong enough economic growth to keep company profits rising but not so strong that prices will soar.
The Federal Reserve has been holding off an increase in its key lending rates, betting that the pace of business activity is slowing enough to contain inflationary pressures.
"Inflation is low; the odds of a Fed interest rate hike are remote at least until after the election, so people are comfortable with stocks," Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis, said.
Higher inflation and interest rates hurt bonds by making their fixed payments less attractive, forcing down prices to improve their yields. Higher rates at the Fed or the bond market hurt stocks by slowing consumer spending.
As bond prices rose yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury -- a determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- fell to 6.84 percent from 6.88 late on Thursday, but still above last Friday's 6.74.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining stocks by 7 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 396.1 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.05 points to 700.66.
The advance in computer-related shares helped lift the Nasdaq market back to record levels. On Monday, the Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,250.87, its first high in four months after trailing the broad market's rebound from July's selloff.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.30 points yesterday, to 1,248.27, led by Intel, up 5 1/2, to 105 3/8, and Microsoft, up 3 3/8, to 137 1/8.
I.B.M. was among the Dow's biggest gainers, adding 7 points to the Dow's advance as it rose 2 1/8, to 129 7/8. Compaq rose 2 1/2, to 71 5/8.
"It's still evident to many investors that this is the growth area of the market and that it got sold off too heavily," Mr. Dickey of Dain Bosworth said. "This most attractive growth area is still attracting the money."
Shares of Sabre Group Holdings rose to 31 5/8 from an initial offering of 27 on its first day of trading. The computerized reservation system of American Airlines sold 20.2 million shares for a total of $545 million.
Cascade Communications tumbled 15 1/8, to 71 3/8. The company, a maker of switching products, reported third-quarter earnings that tripled its results from the similar period a year earlier, but it failed to surpass Wall Street's expectations.
Earlier, stocks in Tokyo rose. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 97.33 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,968.16.

HEADLINE: Impact of Canadian Strike Extends Beyond G.M.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Toyota Corollas that are assembled in North America use a part manufactured at a General Motors factory in Canada that is now on strike, showing the increasing vulnerability of auto makers to labor walkouts as they buy more parts from each other.
The General Motors Corporation sent a flat-bed truck with a police escort several times today to a factory in Oshawa, Ontario, to try to remove the die used to stamp seat brackets for the Toyota Motor Corporation cars, said James A. Nimigon, the strike captain at the factory. Mr. Nimigon said that the police had asked him to order the picketers to move aside and let the truck through the factory's north gate, and that he had refused. 
 D. Stewart Low, a G.M. spokesman, confirmed today that the auto maker was trying to remove a stamping die from the Oshawa plant on behalf of an outside customer, which he declined to name in keeping with company policy. Mr. Low said G.M. was telling the union that job preservation as well as profits depended on G.M.'s ability to maintain a reputation as a reliable supplier for other auto makers.
Other people familiar with the situation said that the die was for making Toyota Corolla parts.
Toyota assembles the fast-selling Corolla in Cambridge, Ontario, and in a joint venture with G.M. in Fremont, Calif. Both factories were still operating today.
"We're still open for business and we don't anticipate a problem at this point," said Greigory D. Mordue, a Toyota spokesman in Cambridge. He declined to comment on the company's inventory of the seat brackets, which hold springs inside seats, or the G.M. strike.
Mr. Nimigon said that he did not know if the seat brackets were produced elsewhere in North America, or if brackets for Corollas made in Japan were compatible. But, he added, "We just know they're very desirous of getting the die out." G.M. also wants to remove three containers from the factory, each holding 800 to 1,000 finished brackets, he said.
Michael Leveque, a union strike marshal, said that the union had sought but not received assurances that the die would be brought back to the factory after the strike.
Auto makers are buying more parts from each other and moving rapidly to establish joint ventures for auto parts production, all as a way to reap greater economies of scale. Chrysler and BMW recently announced plans to build an engine factory in Brazil as a joint venture.
Alex Trotman, the chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, said on Thursday that the engine factory was a model for the industry. He said that a reorganization of Ford's auto parts operations was partly intended to increase sales to other auto makers, and that Ford would even consider joint ventures abroad with G.M.
But maintaining separate factories has insulated auto makers until recently from labor problems at their rivals' operation. When members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike last March at two G.M. brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, some workers stayed on the job to continue making brakes that Chrysler and several other auto makers desperately needed.
The U.A.W. contracts with G.M. over the years have required workers to continue making parts for other auto makers during strikes. But the more militant Canadian union has not agreed to such a provision and, in any case, the labor contract in Canada has already expired.
The Canadian union's 26,000 G.M. workers are on strike to obtain new restrictions on G.M.'s ability to buy lower-cost parts from outside vendors. G.M. is trying to sell two parts factories in Canada, and the union also wants G.M. to guarantee that workers at these factories will not suffer a cut in wages or benefits.
G.M. has temporarily laid off only 2,000 American workers but is expected to lay off thousands more early next week when it closes a Cadillac factory in Detroit and a small-car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.
Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, said in a call with reporters today that while high-level talks would continue in Toronto through the weekend, most of the bargainers had gone to their hometowns to celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving, which is on Monday.
Mr. Hargrove also said that he would not object if the U.A.W. reached a labor contract with G.M. while Canadian workers remained on strike. The U.A.W. and G.M. have already resolved most of their differences, people close to the talks said today.
Some auto analysts have predicted that the current strike in Canada will discourage foreign auto makers from building any more factories there. Mr. Hargrove said in a brief interview on Wednesday night that conservative Government policies, such as making it easier to hire replacement workers, were disrupting communities and making Canada a less attractive place to live and do business.

HEADLINE: Producer Data Show Prices Still in Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Moderating prices for food and energy helped keep inflation at the producer level in check last month while consumers spent cautiously at a pace scarcely faster than when the summer began, Government figures showed today.
The Producer Price Index climbed two-tenths of 1 percent in September, according to the Labor Department, a result that comforted the financial markets, which have feared that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates after the election to curb a rise in the prices. 
 "The P.P.I. provides even more evidence that inflation is under control and that the Fed can relax," said William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services in Boston.
This view prevailed even though the "core" rate of inflation, which excludes the often volatile food and energy components, rose three-tenths of 1 percent to match its biggest increase of the year.
Economists noted that the pickup in the core rate was dominated by presumably temporary surges in the price of cars and light trucks and that there was nothing worrisome in the prices of producer goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production.
The data encouraged investors, who drove bond and stock prices higher yesterday. The rise in bonds drove the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer and corporate interest rates -- down to 6.84 percent from 6.88 percent. And the Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.71 points, to 5,969.38.
The markets were heartened even as the Commerce Department's first estimate of retail sales for September showed an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent, which was greater than expected.
But this was also heavily influenced by the automotive sector and seemed large only in comparison with a weak August, which now shows a two-tenths of 1 percent decline instead of a gain of that size, as initially estimated.
"The retailing picture going into the fourth quarter is quite weak," said Susan M. Sterne, president of Economic Analysis Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., firm specializing in consumer behavior. She said nominal sales growth in the third quarter was just six-tenths of 1 percent, the poorest since the final three months of 1991, when the economy was just emerging from its latest recession.
While income growth is "stable," she said, financial stress as reflected in record credit card delinquencies is restraining retail spending, which accounts for one-third of economic activity.
"We are starting to lend less and borrow less," Ms. Sterne declared, implying that the coming holiday shopping season may be no better than lackluster.
Excluding automotive dealers, who enjoyed a 1.7 percent gain, retail sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, not quite making up a five-tenths of 1 percent August decline.
In all, consumers pushed $205.7 billion across retail counters last month, 4.7 percent more, with no adjustment for inflation, than in September 1995. Consumer prices for the 12 months through August rose 2.9 percent.
Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a sales gain of one-tenth of 1 percent last month while those selling furniture and other home equipment had a sales decline of three-tenths of 1 percent.
In nondurables, up six-tenths of 1 percent over all, food stores registered a 1.2 percent sales gain while lesser increases were posted by gasoline service stations, restaurants and bars, and stores selling general merchandise. Drugstores and apparel stores had modest declines.
The report on producer prices, which does not include imported goods or services, showed sharp deceleration for both food and energy last month, each rising just two-tenths of 1 percent. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
Passenger cars rose 1.2 percent after a small decline and prescription drugs, light trucks, book publishing and women's apparel and capital equipment also turned upward.
Prices for items at the intermediate stage of production, like construction materials, increased three-tenths of 1 percent and a scant one-tenth of 1 percent without food and energy. Durables used in manufacturing, like plywood, climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, reversing August's decline, while such nondurables as chemicals rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
Crude goods dropped 1.5 percent over all last month but rose six-tenths of 1 percent excluding food and energy.
Although Wall Street welcomed today's sets of figures, many analysts remained quite wary of inflation. Nicholas Perna of the Fleet Financial Group, for example, pointed to the relatively long time it has often taken for a tight labor market to generate faster inflation.
He warned, "By the time you see the state trooper with his radar gun, you've already got a ticket."

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Shaky Belarus to Honor A-Weapons Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The United States, its influence limited, is trying to prevent the former Soviet republic of Belarus from slipping into a dictatorship and reneging on its promise to President Clinton to give up its nuclear missiles by the end of the year.
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, two other former Soviet republics that also inherited modern missiles, have both become nuclear-free, handing over their missiles, as agreed, to the Russian authorities for dismantling. But Belarus has not even begun the process. 
 The Belarussian President, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has called for street demonstrations by handpicked "people's deputies" on Oct. 19 in an effort to disband Parliament and force through a new constitution in a referendum on Nov. 7, the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
The proposed constitution would extend his term until the year 2000, allow him a second seven-year term, let him appoint a majority of the highest court and control a new upper house of Parliament with veto power over the lower house. And despite opposition in Belarus, senior American officials say Mr. Lukashenko could win such a referendum, even without election fraud.
Mr. Lukashenko, a flamboyant, demagogic 41-year-old elected in 1994 to replace the man who brought the country to independence, wants to reunite with Russia and stymie market reform. He ran on an anti-corruption program and the promise to integrate with Russia and restore Soviet-style economic security. He has restored the Soviet-era flag, shut down newspapers and radio stations, fired elected officials, restricted human and civil rights, broken up some opposition demonstrations and banned others, and prevented the Parliament's chairman, Semyon Sharetsky, the country's second-ranking official, from appearing on television.
Belarus, with only a thin and debatable history of sovereignty separate from Moscow, might be considered just another victim of history, a sort of geopolitical joke. But unlike the authoritarian governments of Central Asia, for example, Belarus is a European country with nuclear weapons, bordering what are likely to be the boundaries of an expanding NATO and led by an unpredictable and openly anti-Western leader who is pushing for nearly unlimited power.
In light of the recent developments there, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who is going to Moscow next week, has canceled plans to stop in Minsk, the Belarus capital, because of serious doubts that Belarus will become non-nuclear by 1997. Such a high-level visit would be seen as support for Mr. Lukashenko and its cancellation as a form of criticism.
The restoration of a Communist dictatorship in Europe would be an embarrassment for the Clinton Administration, which has broadcast its success in helping the former Soviet Union make a transition to a relatively democratic, free-market way of life.
A failure to get Belarus to give up its 18 nuclear missiles, however, would be dangerous, even if they are currently under the control of Russian officers. The SS-25 missiles are Russia's most modern mobile single-warhead missiles.
The Clinton Administration is using what tools it can muster to influence Mr. Lukashenko. The Americans are pressing the Russians hard to get Belarus to live up to its nuclear promises.
"We'd be comfortable with Russia playing a role in this," a senior American official said.
Mr. Lukashenko, for his part, has talked darkly of a Washington-Moscow conspiracy to undermine him. Last April, he and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a pact of "federation" between Belarus and Russia, but Amrican officials suggest that Mr. Yeltsin was looking more to his own re-election struggle than to real reunification, a notion popular among Russian Communists and ultranationalists. The Russians are also leery of absorbing the sizeable debts of Belarus, which has made little effort to reform its economy or collectivist agriculture.
The United States has also tried to strengthen the democratic opposition to Mr. Lukashenko by providing assistance to non-governmental organizations working there and discouraging large corporations like McDonald's and Ford, who seek advice from the State Department, from making significant investments in Belarus just now. The United States also gave quick political asylum to the leader of the main democratic opposition party, Zenon Poznyak.
Congress, in the 1997 Foreign Assistance Act, has banned all American aid to the Belarus Government.

U.S. Pressures Mexico To Halt Tomato Shipments
The Clinton Administration pressured Mexico into agreeing to end the shipment of low-priced tomatoes to the United States, defusing a major political issue in Florida just weeks before the election. 
 The action, which seems likely to raise consumers' costs for tomatoes this winter, was the latest in a series of Administration efforts, under the aegis of Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, to sidestep trade problems. [Page 1.]
 
Fidelity Funds Hold Cam-Net Issues
Two mutual funds managed by Fidelity Investment are among the biggest investors in a small Canadian company whose chairman, Daryl Buerge, was charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with a Federal sting operation. The Fidelity Convertible Securities fund and the Fidelity Equity-Income fund bought convertible bonds issued by the Cam-Net Communications Network of Vancouver, British Columbia. [38.]
 
Vickrey, Nobel Laureate, Dies
Professor William Vickrey of Columbia University who won the Nobel memorial prize in economics earlier this week -- and was cheered by "the bully pulpit" it offered him -- was found found dead behind the wheel of his car on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Harrison, N.Y., of an apparent cardiac arrest. He was driving to a conference in Cambridge, Mass., after a whirlwind three days of nonstop attention. He was 82. [1.]
 
S.& L. Poster Boy No More
Just a few years ago Charles H. Keating Jr. was the poster boy of the savings and loan crisis, a shady operator accused by the Government of having committed about every crime associated with the debacle. But in a striking turn of events, Mr. Keating had his state criminal conviction overturned earlier this year, then last week was released from prison on bail. Suddenly, Government officials and other experts are having to confront the question of what it means if the supposed arch-villain of the savings and loan crisis is not found guilty. News Analysis. [38.]
 
A New Index for Growth Brands
The Hambrecht & Quist Group, the investment bank in San Francisco, is seeking to carve out a niche for itself with a new index it calls its Branded Consumer Growth index. It tracks 51 companies as diverse as Tiffany & Company, Starbucks, Cannondale, Nike, Boston Beer and Ben & Jerry's. The index has outperformed the S.& P. 500 since its start in 1993. [39.]
 
Time Warner Wins a Round
Time Warner won the first round of a bitter dispute over efforts by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to promote Rupert Murdoch's new 24-hour news channel. A Federal judge temporarily blocked New York City from showing the channel on a city-run cable station carried by Time Warner. [1.]
 
Stocks Break Out of Slump
After a four-day slump, stocks posted a strong gain, buoyed by economic reports that pointed to low inflation and steady interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.71 points, to 5,969.38, for a loss of 23.48 points on the week. The Nasdaq composite gained 11.30 points, to 1,248.27. For the week, the Nasdaq eked out a 0.71 point gain. [41.]
 
Treasury securities' prices also rebounded, sending the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.84 percent from 6.88 percent on Thursday. The market will be closed Monday in observance of Columbus Day. [41.]
 
An Aggressive Move Into Asia
An aggressive electric power company must go far these days for growth. After acquiring 80 percent of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd. for $2.1 billion, A. W. Dahlberg, chairman of the Southern Company, is looking to cities like Keti Bandar, Pakistan, and Sual, in the Philippines, for profits. [38.]

Christian Coalition Mailing Prompts Apology to Blacks

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
In a move that has been criticized as lacking racial sensitivity, the Christian Coalition has distributed a sample of an election pamphlet with photographs depicting a fictitious white candidate espousing views favored by the conservative religious organization and another fictional candidate, who is black, opposing them.
Christian Coalition officials, who, in recent months, have sought to improve relations with blacks, said they were embarrassed and chagrined by the sample pamphlets and said they had stopped sending them out last week. 
 Ralph Reed, the group's executive director, said that he had faxed a letter of apology to the head of the branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Texas, where the sample had been widely distributed.
He added that he had tried, so far without success, to call civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume, the national leader of the N.A.A.C.P., to express his regret over the incident.
The pamphlet is a sample of the evangelical group's 1996 voter guide for state and Congressional elections. On the cover is a picture of "John Doe." Under his photograph are positions he champions: support for a balanced budget amendment, backing of vouchers to allow parents to send children to private and religious schools, support for school prayer and opposition to "homosexual adoption of children."
All the positions taken by John Doe are in line with those advocated by the Christian Coalition.
Across the page from Mr. Doe is a picture of a black candidate, "Joe Sample." He supports "abortion on demand," opposes term limits for Congress, supports "taxpayer funding of obscene art" and opposes every position the coalition favors.
"I think it's outrageous," said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of liberal organizations that lobbies on economic and equality issues. "It obviously is intended to send a not-so-subtle message about the coalition's attitude towards black candidates, which I think is troubling."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Reed said that the sample was prepared by a private company and that its distribution had been approved by a low-level employee who had seen only a poor quality fax that was so dark that the race of the candidates could not easily be discerned. He said that none of his group's top officials had seen the pamphlet before it was distributed.
"It was a mistake made by an outside vendor and not by any member of the Christian Coalition staff," Mr. Reed said. "It was wrong. It should not have happened. I was personally offended by the characterization of an African-American candidate in this way. As someone who grew up in the South, I am extremely sensitive to the use of race in this manner. I have zero tolerance for political race-baiting of any kind, no matter how subtle."
The voter guide sample was part of a packet that included a cover letter, an order form so churches could order the guide in bulk and a memorandum from a Washington lawyer assuring ministers that distribution of the pamphlet would not violate Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The letter said the voter guides had been "thoroughly reviewed" to insure they did not violate I.R.S. regulations. The Christian Coalition is being sued by the Federal Election Commission, which has accused the coalition of promoting Republican candidates, including former President George Bush, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina through the use of its voter guides. As a nonpartisan organization that asserts that its political activity is educational, the Christian group is prohibited from endorsing or working for specific candidates.
The controversy over the sample election guides comes at a time when the Christian Coalition, which was founded by Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, has been trying to reach out to politically conservative blacks.
After a spate of arsons at small black churches in the South, the group raised about $600,000 to help rebuild some of them. At the time, Mr. Reed said he was sorry that too many white evangelicals were on the "sidelines" or "on the wrong side" in the desegregation struggles of the 1950's and 1960's.
Mr. Reed said that his group intended to send out about 500,000 voters guides -- thought none with the offending pictures of ficticious black and white candidates -- to black churches out of a total of 45 million pamhlets that will be sent out before the Nov. 5 election.
Several civil rights leaders said today that the sample voter guide had raised suspicions about Mr. Reed's apology.
"It really calls into question the credibility of the overtures that the Christian Coalition made to the black community after the church burnings," said Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League. "I recall people being skeptical of those overtures and how genuine they were. An incident like this affirms that skepticism."
The pamphlet reminded some political scientists of past campaign advertisements that used racial imagery like the George Bush commercial that featured Willie Horton, a black convict who raped a white woman while free on a prison furlough program, and the 1990 commercial for Senator Helms that showed white hands crumpling a job rejection notice while a narrator spoke of the position going to a woman or a minority.
It is unclear how widely the sample voter guide was distributed. People for the American Way, a liberal organizations that often monitors the activities of the Christian right, said it had received calls from affiliates in Texas and Pennsylvania who has seen copies of the guide.
Mr. Reed said he did not know how many copies had been mailed.

HEADLINE: In Federal Subsidies, South Gets the Short Stick;
End the Union?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's annual report on the fiscal shortchanging of New York and other "frost belt" states is nothing but cant (news article, Oct. 8). As Mr. Moynihan knows, one of the objects of Federal spending programs is to compensate for differences in fiscal capacity among the states, usually measured by per capita income. 
 All of the large "deficit" states in his analysis boast per capita income above the national norm, resulting in higher tax payments. In contrast, most of the "surplus" states record incomes below the national average and thus send less money to Washington on a per capita basis. Each year, the Senator suggests this redistribution of Federal monies is unfair. Does he propose we dissolve the Union?

HEADLINE: President Wins Tomato Accord For Floridians

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Defusing a major political issue in Florida just weeks before the election, the Clinton Administration today pressured Mexico into an agreement that will set a minimum price for the tomatoes it ships to the United States, greatly easing pressure on the growers.
The deal satisfies both growers and government officials in one of the most hotly contested states in the Presidential election. For years Florida has been demanding protection from competition from roughly $800 million in tomatoes that come over the border annually. 
 Today's action, which seems likely to raise the price that consumers will pay this winter for tomatoes, was the latest in a series of efforts by the Administration to sidestep trade problems that could prove politically troublesome.
Early this year, for example, it delayed an opening of the Mexican border to Mexican trucks under the North American Free Trade Agreement, contending that the trucks were unsafe and a conduit for drugs. It also limited lumber imports from Canada. Both countries have periodically accused the United States of not living up to the spirit of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Mexico reiterated that complaint today.
The architect of these deals for the Administration was also one of President Clinton's closest political confidants, Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor. As Mr. Clinton's campaign manager in 1992 -- and, in recent weeks, his negotiator with Bob Dole's campaign over the ground rules for the Presidential debates -- Mr. Kantor is extraordinarily attuned to the politics of trade accords. And whether the issue is vine-ripened fruits or the shape of debating lecterns, Mr. Kantor is a relentless negotiator on Mr. Clinton's behalf.
Mr. Kantor was in Seattle today at a campaign appearance, and could not be reached for comment. But in a statement released in Washington, he said: "The agreement will provide strong relief to the tomato growers in Florida and other states and help preserve jobs in the industry. Mexican growers will have continued access to the U.S. market, but only on fair terms."
Others in the Administration put a harder political edge on Mr. Kantor's accomplishment. "This was Mexico's moment to pay back for the bailout," one senior official said, referring to the Administration's decision to lend Mexico $12.5 billion to help it through a devastating financial crisis last year.
"The math was pretty simple," another official said. "Florida has 25 electoral votes, and Mexico doesn't."
It is unclear how much the tomato issue could affect swing votes in Florida, which has gone Republican in recent years but which now seems in play, with Mr. Clinton slightly ahead of Mr. Dole in the polls.
Tomatoes have been a bipartisan staple in Florida for some time. Democrats and Republicans have supported the Florida Department of Agriculture, which has spent more than $1.5 million to press the tomato-growers' complaints. But it is Mr. Clinton who can now assert that his Administration stemmed the annual wintertime flood of low-price, juicy Mexican tomatoes.
Technically, the tomato case centered on the question of whether Mexico, taking advantage of cheap labor that was made even cheaper after Mexico's financial crisis, is "dumping" roughly $800 million in tomatoes in the United States.
Dumping is the sale of products at prices below their cost, but determining that cost is often a matter of conflicting interpretation. The agreement reached today came after Mexican producers realized that the Commerce Department was just days away from a preliminary dumping ruling that could have put punitive tariffs or quantitative restrictions on tomato imports.
Under the accord reached today, Mexican farmers agree not to sell their tomatoes in the United States for less than 20.68 cents a pound -- the lowest average price of Mexican tomatoes for a period during which American officials say prices were not artificially suppressed by Mexican competition. The result of that accord, however, will probably be an increase in tomato prices this winter, when Florida and Mexico are virtually the sole suppliers of all the tomatoes Americans consume.
Florida's complaints about Mexican imports date to the late 1970's. But they have become more vociferous in recent years, partly because the 40 percent devaluation of the peso in early 1995 dramatically lowered the dollar price of Mexican tomatoes, and partly because Mexican growers had improved the shelf-life of their products, and, to the taste of some, had learned to produce juicier tomatoes.
Mr. Kantor has always been sympathetic to the Florida growers' complaints, even when it seemed as if Florida was firmly in the Republican column, but there is little question that his interest in the issue has been particularly strong this year.
Others have not been so sympathetic. The International Trade Commission ruled against the Florida growers twice in the past year, in separate cases that sought relief from what the growers called a "surge" in Mexican tomato imports. Mr. Kantor and his successor as the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, called the latest of those rulings "disappointing."
Then the growers attempted to get Congress to act, a movement led by Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and a critic of the free trade agreement. That effort was also supported by Mr. Dole, but final legislation was never passed.
The Florida growers then filed a separate complaint with the Commerce Department, which rules on dumping cases, and finally seemed headed to victory. A preliminary finding was scheduled for release earlier this week, but decision was postponed after it became clear that the two sides were working toward an agreement that would set a minimum price for imports, in return for an agreement from the Commerce Department to suspend its investigation into dumping charges.
"It is a really effective agreement," said Howard Vine, a Washington lawyer who represented the Florida Department of Agriculture. "It protects many in Florida, but it imposes a discipline in the domestic industry," forcing some tomato producers to become more efficient, he said.
Mexico's Commerce and Industry Ministry reiterated in a statement the "concerns about the manner in which the United States authorities have carried out the anti-dumping investigation into Mexican tomatoes."
"On several occasions," it said, "Mexico has said that the investigation is incompatible with the disciplines established in the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"As a result, Mexico reserves its right to continue using legal instruments available in these agreements to defend the interests of its exporters," the statement said.

HEADLINE: New Law Bans Genital Cutting In United States

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Congress outlawed the rite of female genital cutting in the United States just before it recessed two weeks ago, and directed Federal authorities to inform new immigrants from countries where it is commonly practiced that parents who arrange for their children to be cut here, as well as people who perform the cutting, face up to five years in prison.
The new law also requires United States representatives to the World Bank and other international financial institutions that have lent billions of dollars to the 28 African countries where the practice exists to oppose loans to governments that have not carried out educational programs to prevent it. 
 Support for these measures -- included in an end-of-session spending bill -- mounted this year as the case of Fauziya Kassindja, a young woman who fled Togo to avoid having her genitals cut off and sought asylum here, gained attention in the American news media, Government officials said.
"You keep trying to explain that this is not circumcision," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, who along with Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has repeatedly introduced bills in past sessions to outlaw the practice. "This is more like Lorena Bobbitt. Once they really find out it goes on and is not some victim fantasy we're having, they're horrified."
Experts say there is no way to measure how many girls are being genitally cut in the United States since the rite is usually performed privately.
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated that more than 150,000 women and girls of African origin or ancestry in the United States may be at risk of the rite or have already been cut. Researchers developed these rough estimates by matching 1990 Census Bureau population data on the number of girls and women whose families came from the African countries where the practice is customary with estimates of the prevalence of the rite in those countries.
New York and Newark, as well as Los Angeles and Washington, are among the metropolitan areas where the largest number of these girls and women live, according to the estimates.
The data was gathered in response to an April directive from Congress. At that time, Congress also told Federal health officials to develop a program to educate immigrants about the dangers of the practice, which they are now doing.
The Federal ban on genital cutting, which takes effect six months after the law's passage on Sept. 30, comes as states and health workers are increasingly debating how to respond to a cultural practice that is a highly valued rite of passage among some African immigrants, but is abhorred by many Americans.
California, Minnesota, Tennessee, Rhode Island and North Dakota are among the states that have outlawed the practice in the last two years, Congressional researchers say.
A group of physicians at the the Harborview Medical Center, a public hospital in Seattle, have taken a different view. After Somali mothers repeatedly requested that their daughters be genitally cut in the hospital, the doctors proposed what they considered a largely symbolic form of the ritual: nicking the tip of a girl's clitoris, with her consent, under a local anesthetic. No tissue would be removed, they said. The proposal has stirred an emotionally charged debate there.
"I think that this is an issue that should be decided by a physician, the family and the child," Abraham Bergman, chief of pediatrics at the hospital, said. "Privacy should prevail and the brouhaha is inappropriate."
It is not clear whether the procedure being proposed in Seattle would violate the new law against what Congress termed "female genital mutilation," Government officials said.
The Federal law provides for the prosecution of anyone who "circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person who has not attained the age of 18." Infibulation involves stitching together the labia to largely cover the vagina.
Members of Congress say they believe the United States needs to send a clear, forceful message to immigrants here that female genital cutting is a practice they must abandon.
They say the United States should follow the example of the French, who over the last 10 to 15 years have criminally prosecuted parents in more than 30 families from Mali, Mauritania, Gambia and Senegal for the excision of daughters. Such cases are usually reported to the police by doctors, who detect the practice while examining the girls. Usually, the convicted parents have been given suspended sentences, though ocassionally they get prison time.
"At first, the doctors hesitated, saying, 'We cannot betray families,' " said Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer who is France's leading crusader against the practice. "I said, 'Your first obligation is to the child. If you do not report a family when you notice they practice excision, then the next child born will be excised, too. You bear the responsibility.' "
The Congressional push to outlaw genital cutting in the United States was led by a handful of senators and representatives. Senator Reid, the point man in the Senate, said he first lost sleep over this issue in 1994 after CNN broadcast a video of a 10-year-old Egyptian girl being cut.
"They grab her and hold her down and rip out her genitalia with a razor blade," Senator Reid said, adding that he thought of his two young granddaughters at the time. "I said, 'What am I going to do about this?' All my staff advised me to stay away from it. You have to be careful on issues like this. Is this something a man should be involved in?
"The first time I talked about it on the floor, I felt very uncomfortable. You're talking about a little girl's vagina."
Representative Schroeder, who is to retire from the House of Representatives after the New Year, has been working on the issue for more than 20 years.
Both said in recent years that they have been unable to get a ban through Congress. They said some members simply could not believe that the practice actually goes on. And some were worried that it would lead to proposals to abolish male circumcision.
This year, they said, their years of pestering their fellow lawmakers, combined with greater press attention to the issue, including a series of articles in The New York Times, and the Republican-controlled Congress's desire to counter the tendency of female voters to support Democrats, led to passage of the law.
A separate measure to pressure African governments to take action in their own countries had another important ally in the Senate, Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
The provision, which takes effect a year from now, made United States support for loans from international financial institutions dependent on foreign governments carrying out educational campaigns against genital cutting. It charges the Secretary of the Treasury with deciding whether United States representatives to the lending institutions will oppose or support loans and grants to countries.
"Some in the World Bank bureaucracy have always taken the position that if the United States suggests another country do something differently, the client countries will react against it," Senator Leahy said. "In fact, it is through this kind of pressure that we've had changes necessary in a number of countries, ranging from privatization in the former Soviet Union to female education in developing countries. This requires diplomacy on the part of the international financial institution, but they have a lot of people paid a great deal of money to practice that diplomacy."
Officials in such financial institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund say that the success of the new American strategy will depend on how diplomatically it is carried out.
"If it highlights the problem, it will be constructive," said Eric Chinje, external affairs officer for Africa at the World Bank. "If it provides an instrument for fingerpointing, it will be counterproductive."
World Bank officials say they are paying more attention to the problem, but human rights advocates for women say the bank has done too little, investing what they consider a paltry amount to support groups combatting genital cutting, a practice that affects tens of millions of African women and girls.
This year, World Bank officials said, the bank provided $285,000 in grants to two groups: the nonprofit Research, Action & Information Network for Bodily Integrity of Women, based in New York City, and the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, based in Addis Ababa.

HEADLINE: After 3 Days in the Spotlight, Nobel Prize Winner Is Dead

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
For 50 years, William Vickrey was the ultimate absent-minded professor, a brilliant eccentric using abstract economic theory to find solutions to everyday problems. When he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Tuesday, he seemed finally to have a platform from which to make his ideas widely known.
Television crews descended. His telephone rang incessantly. Admirers offered to set up meetings with people with the power to put his proposals to work. The world appeared once and for all to be ready to listen. And then, as suddenly as it had happened, it was over. 
 Professor Vickrey, who was 82, was found slumped behind the wheel of his car on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Harrison, N.Y., on Thursday, just before midnight. He died, apparently of cardiac arrest, while driving to a conference in Cambridge, Mass., after a whirlwind three days of nonstop attention.
Just hours earlier, sitting in the the tiny office at Columbia where he still went to work every day, encircled by the encroaching paper undergrowth of a well-lived academic life, Professor Vickrey had been asked how it felt to be getting a hearing after so many years. "It feels swell," he sighed. "Ahhhh, at last."
A man described by colleagues as so idiosyncratic and uninterested in material comfort that he barely knew how much he was paid, Professor Vickrey said that he cared far less about his half of the $1.12 million prize from the Bank of Sweden that he shared with James A. Mirrlees of Cambridge University than about what he called "the bully pulpit" it offered for his ideas.
For he had devoted much of his energy over 60 years at Columbia to what he described as carrying economic theory to "its ultimate logical conclusions," fashioning unorthodox solutions for such maddening problems as traffic congestion, crowded subways and bewildering taxes.
He is also credited by other economists with having revolutionized the way they think about auctions, and with having done seminal work in many areas of public economics -- taxation, pricing in public utilities and urban transportation.
"He never drew attention to himself, he never cared where he published," said Ronald Findlay, the chairman of the economics department at Columbia and friend of 27 years. "He was interested in propagating the ideas, not in getting credit for them."
Born in Victoria, British Columbia, the eldest son of a Canadian mother and American father, Professor Vickrey grew up in New York City and its suburbs. His father was executive secretary of Near East Relief, a nonprofit organization devoted to helping orphans from the Armenian holocaust.
That experience marked him permanently, as did coming of age during the Depression. "I was raised with the Armenian orphans on the breakfast table," he recently said. He said he had come to feel that any dollar he spent was a dollar not spent to help the orphans.
During World War II, he did civilian public service as a conscientious objector. As a result of that experience, he became a Quaker. Asked about his political views, he said: "Well, I have voted for Norman Thomas, if you want to know." He said he intended to vote for Ralph Nader for President.
Professor Vickrey graduated from high school in Scarsdale at 16 and was sent to prep school for a year before enrolling at Yale. He majored in mathematics, figuring he knew enough of it already that he would have time for electrical engineering, sociology and his other interests.

A Difficult Time Finding Acceptance
It was on a weekend trip home to Scarsdale from New Haven by train that one of his most provocative ideas took root. Noticing how many seats were empty, he thought: What a waste. He figured that his fellow students would enjoy a trip to New York in off-peak hours if the railroad would drop the price to fill the seats.
Out of that, he said this week, emerged many years later some of his proposals for so-called congestion pricing. If the price of traveling from place to place varied by time of day, toll-booth tie-ups would vanish, subways would run pleasantly full and people would waste less time.
In 1959, for example, Professor Vickrey suggested that one way to control traffic in congested cities would be to equip every vehicle with a transponder, then monitor when and how often each vehicle entered and left the congested area and bill the owners for the so-called social cost of their trips. The fees would be highest during rush hour and diminish gradually at other times.
Professor Vickrey went on to make similar proposals to dissipate congestion at bridges and tunnels and to relieve subway and bus overcrowding. He suggested that parking meter fees should vary by time of day and congestion level -- and even by the number of meters available that that moment.
He had little luck, however, getting his ideas enacted. As he told it, he was given a hearing in 1959 before the chairman of a Congressional committee investigating what were called Washington metropolitan problems. He found that his transponder idea was politely ignored: "There was generally a discreet silence."
But he published a paper on the subject and the idea turned up in the 1960's in a paper on road pricing put out by a commission in England. He was invited to England and given an audience with the Minister of Transport. "I got on TV beside a trained dog act," he recalled.
Since that time, though, Singapore has instituted a similar system. Something like it came close to fruition in Hong Kong, Professor Vickrey said. But at home, he suggested congestion pricing for Hudson River crossings to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the 1970's and was again ignored.
He suggested a new fare structure for the New York City subways in the early 1950's and also had no success. He spent two summers in Japan drawing up a plan for income tax reform that, he said, was rejected. He counted as "a minor victory" his role in 1947 in a new inheritance tax law for Puerto Rico.

Influencing Thought On Auctions
But much of his other work heavily influenced other economists. In particular, a paper he wrote in 1961 exploring the theory of auctions and and devising a new approach that became the cornerstone of much subsequent work in that field.
"It got people thinking about the different ways in which you can design an auction," Professor Findlay said. "In the modern theory of auctions, on which a large number of very brilliant economists around the world are working, they all acknowledge the seminal influence of Vickrey 1961."
Though that work helped win him the Nobel Prize, Professor Vickrey described it on Thursday with characteristic self-deprecation as "one of my digressions into abstract economics. At best, it's of minor significance in terms of human welfare."
Professor Vickrey first arrived at Columbia University as a graduate student in the mid-1930's. To save money, he was living at home. He would ride the train to the station at Park Avenue and 125th Street, then roller-skate across town, a practice he kept up until the late 1940's.
At Columbia, he was admired but seen as truly eccentric. When he took a sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study in California in the late 1960's, he received an award he proudly displayed years later known as "the Rip van Winkle award."
"For deep, uninterrupted concentration while attending seminars," the handmade certificate stated. Asked recently about his qualifications, he said: "Not only there but elsewhere, I have a reputation, not undeserved, for sitting with my eyes closed and possibly even dozing off."
What was more remarkable was that Professor Vickrey would suddenly stir and deliver "the most cogent comment or blockbuster question of the whole discussion," as James Tobin, the economist and Nobel laureate, described it while introducing Professor Vickrey at an award ceremony in 1992.

An 'Omnipresence' At Columbia
Though Professor Vickrey retired from teaching and became an emeritus professor in 1982, he remained what one administrator called "an omnipresence" on the Columbia campus, publishing books and papers and slipping quietly into seminars and brown-bag lunches on every imaginable subject.
Over the years, he found himself bounced into progressively smaller offices until he ended up three years ago on the eighth floor of a building on Amsterdam Avenue and 118th Street in a shoe box of an office that he cheerfully described as "the world's biggest mess."
There were file cabinets topped with cardboard boxes piled as high as the ceiling, files spilled across the floor, prehistoric coffee cups, articles of clothing, broken eyeglasses, tins of evaporated skim milk, a half-dozen oversized but empty soda bottles and walls of sloping books.
In the middle, in a space clear enough to allow his desk chair to roll six inches in any direction, Professor Vickrey would settle in daily, a large man with an expanding middle and wispy white hair, in a rumpled suit, its pockets stuffed with pens and occasionally papers.
Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics and friend who occupied the office two doors down, described Professor Vickrey as "a man of shining honesty" and a kind of innocence, a person who took problems like unemployment deeply to heart.
In recent years, Professor Vickrey had become consumed with trying to fight what he called "the mania for budget balancing," arguing to anyone who would listen that every $10 billion budget deficit cut would mean $10 billion less consumer purchasing power and thus less production and higher unemployment.
He was an inveterate writer of letters to the editor; he said many never got published. But the sudden attention after the Nobel Prize had left him hopeful that an article, "Fifteen Fatal Fallacies of Financial Fundamentalism," which he had sent to The New York Times Magazine, would see the light of day.

Starting to Enjoy Sudden Popularity
But for the time being, the Nobel Prize had happily robbed him of free time. From the moment the call from Stockholm woke him up at home in Hastings-on-Hudson on Tuesday at 6:30 A.M., his telephone had not stopped ringing with requests from people suddenly interested to hear what he had to say.
There had been a press conference at Columbia at 11 A.M. at which he was mobbed by reporters, then several hours of interviews back to back, then a champagne reception in the economics department, then radio interviews and television appearances and requests for more constantly piling up.
By Thursday afternoon, he was back in his office returning reporters' calls, enthusiastically elaborating on whatever anybody wanted to know. There was even a move afoot, he said, by someone he could not remember to arrange a meeting between him and city transit officials.
He was planning, he said, to leave for Cambridge sometime before 11 P.M. About 11:45 P.M., the Westchester County Police received a call from a driver on the Hutchinson River Parkway reporting a car stopped in the right, northbound lane. When the police arrived, the man behind the wheel, Professor Vickrey, was not breathing. He was pronounced dead at St. Agnes Hospital at 12:43 A.M., said Detective William Rehm of the Westchester County Police.
Dr. Louis Roh, a deputy medical examiner for the county, said in an interview yesterday that an autopsy found that Professor Vickrey had suffered from a mildly enlarged heart. He appeared to have died of sudden cardiac death brought on by an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, Dr. Roh said.
Whether the experiences of the previous three days might have triggered the problem is unclear. But Dr. Myron Weisfeldt, chairman of the department of medicine at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and a past president of the American Heart Association, said research strongly suggests that stress can precipitate sudden cardiac death.
Shortly after dawn, Professor Findlay received a call from Professor Vickrey's wife, Cecile, who is his only surviving family member. "It was, of course, absolutely devastating," he said, all the more so because just three days earlier, almost to the hour, he had called the Vickreys to congratulate them on the prize.
"It was going to provide him a new platform for his ideas," said Jonathan R. Cole, provost and dean of the faculties at Columbia, where plans are being made for a memorial service next week. "And many of those ideas still bear real consideration and would have had a new life. They would have been part of a new drama. The denouement came too soon."

HEADLINE: TIME WARNER WINS ORDER KEEPING FOX OFF CITY CABLE TV

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A Federal judge last night halted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to present Rupert Murdoch's new 24-hour news channel on a city-run cable station, putting a temporary end to an extraordinary struggle involving the Mayor and two of the country's most powerful media empires.
Only a few hours before the city was to begin broadcasting Mr. Murdoch's Fox News Network on one of the five stations it runs on Time Warner's New York City cable system, Judge Denise Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan granted Time Warner's request for a temporary restraining order. 
 Although the judge scheduled another hearing on the matter for Oct. 23, she made it clear that she thought the Giuliani administration was acting improperly in trying to use the city's noncommercial stations to broadcast the Fox channel and another channel Time Warner had rejected, Bloomberg Television News.
The city's involvement in commercial programming is "expressly forbidden" under Federal cable regulations, she said, adding that the five government-run Crosswalks stations are an "extremely valuable commodity" intended for use by the public. She added that the city had not adequately rebutted Time Warner's allegations that the Giuliani administration had acted at the behest of Mr. Murdoch, a political supporter.
"I find that the cable act has been violated," she said, adding that she thought Time Warner was likely to succeed in its request for a permanent injunction.
The judge's ruling was a stinging rebuff to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to thrust himself into the battle on behalf of Mr. Murdoch and against such Time Warner executives as Gerald Levin and Ted Turner. Time Warner's lawyers were jubilant at the decision, calling it a victory for the First Amendment, while city attorneys said they were disappointed the judge had denied the public access to a nascent news outlet.
"We think the judge is not correct in her decision and we respectfully disagree," said Paul A. Crotty, the city's corporation counsel. "We hope to convince her that the city's use of the Crosswalks channel is altogether appropriate, because we want to make sure New Yorkers have access to quality news programming without commercials."
The battle also cost the Mayor his most prominent black supporter yesterday, when Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner Inc., resigned his position as an economic adviser to the Giuliani administration in protest over the city's actions.
At Mr. Murdoch's request, the Giuliani administration had tried unsuccessfully since Oct. 1 to pressure Time Warner to turn over one of the 75 channels on its New York City cable subsidiary to the Fox News Channel, placing the city in the unusual position of siding with one commercial interest over another. Administration officials had even suggested that the company's cable franchise was in danger of being revoked over the issue.
The cable company has refused, saying it is not obliged to carry the new channel. The Fox News Network competes with Cable News Network, which Time Warner now owns after merging Thursday with the Turner Broadcasting System.
Late Thursday night, the administration began showing Bloomberg Television News on one of the five channels that the city runs as part of its franchise agreement with Time Warner. Before the ruling was issued, city officials had said they would do the same thing with the Fox channel last night, contending that the news channels met the criteria of educational programming as defined in the franchise agreement.
The judge's order blocked the city from showing both Fox and Bloomberg, and early this morning, Bloomberg was no longer appearing on the city's channel.
The city's stand infuriated officials of Time Warner, leading to the lawsuit and Mr. Parsons's resignation as chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which promotes business growth.
Mr. Parsons, a former law partner of Mr. Giuliani's who led the Mayor's transition council in 1994, suggested that the Mayor was acting like "either a bully or a vigilante" in putting the stations on the air, and said the action "put the city in the news business" in violation of the First Amendment. He said he once believed that the Mayor sought a respectful and constructive business environment in the city, but said he was no longer certain of that.
"My concern is the business community is going to see this as more than just highhanded, and perhaps smacking too much of political expediency," Mr. Parsons told reporters yesterday in Time Warner's 29th-floor corporate boardroom in Rockefeller Center. "If Time Warner can be treated in this fashion for what at best are transparent reasons, what kind of message does that send to the rest of the business community?"
Though he would not be explicit about those reasons, the lawsuit filed yesterday made it clear that Time Warner thinks that the Mayor is acting solely at the behest of Mr. Murdoch, the influential owner of The New York Post and WNYW-TV, Channel 5. The city is acting "essentially as Rupert Murdoch's latest political puppet," according to legal papers filed by Time Warner in Federal court.
"Murdoch has also called in political debts owed to him by the Mayor of New York in an effort to force Fox onto the Time Warner cable systems in New York," the papers say.
At a news conference yesterday, the Mayor had no reaction to Mr. Parsons's resignation except to say that it was curious that the company was citing First Amendment grounds to try to prevent a news channel from being seen in New York. He said he wouldn't respond to the lawsuit because "it's all part of a kind of attack mentality."
The Mayor has said he is siding with Fox because it is the only 24-hour news channel based in New York City and contributes more than 1,000 jobs to the city's economy. Fox has said access to the New York City audience -- Time Warner has 1.1 million subscribers in every borough except the Bronx -- is essential to it.
The abrupt break between the two men seemed to sever one of the Mayor's most important political relationships. Mr. Parsons, a former chief executive of the Dime Savings Bank who was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, was a strong voice for Mr. Giuliani in both of his election campaigns, and led the Mayor's transition advisory council. The Mayor tried to hire him as a deputy mayor, and eventually named him chairman of the agency that attracts and retains businesses in the city.
Mr. Parsons appeared to be disappointed that the Mayor ignored years of friendship and never called him since the dispute began, and did not tell Time Warner when the city would begin broadcasting the two channels. Asked if he still considered himself a supporter of the Mayor, Mr. Parsons paused for several seconds before responding. "I'd say that's under review," he said.
The depth of Time Warner's anger was reflected in the court papers filed yesterday seeking the restraining order. In a sworn affidavit, Richard Aurelio, the president of Time Warner Cable of New York City, said that on Oct. 1, Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter and city attorneys made him an offer designed to evade prohibitions on using city channels for commercial programming. Under the proposal, he said, the city would show an educational service like the History Channel or the Discovery Channel on one of the city-owned channels, opening up a slot that Time Warner could then use for Fox.
A city attorney "stated that the parties could 'paper the deal' to make it appear as if there were no quid pro quo," Mr. Aurelio said in the affidavit. After the company protested, "another lawyer for the city snapped back that the city 'didn't need a lecture about the law' and was fully aware of the 'risks' of its proposal," he said.
"The only question, we were told, was whether we too were prepared to run these 'risks,"' Mr. Aurelio said. The Time Warner officials were eventually told to leave the meeting when they refused to agree, he said.
Mr. Crotty called the allegation "a piece of slime." But Judge Cote said the city had not adequately refuted it at yesterday's hearing.
In her ruling, Judge Cote seemed to leave the city with little room to maneuver, because she said Fox and Bloomberg were essentially commercial enterprises that did not belong on stations set aside for educational and governmental purposes. The city's franchise agreement with Time Warner forbids commercial programming on those five stations. City officials had said they could satisfy that provision simply by not broadcasting the commercials. But the judge noted that on the first night Bloomberg was on the city channel, several commercials were shown.
Also in court yesterday, Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer, filed a brief supporting Time Warner on behalf of three Democratic elected officials who frequently disagree with the Mayor: Mark Green, the public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, and Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President.

The Channels In Question
The five city-run cable channels at the center of the dispute between the Giuliani administration and Time Warner reach 1.4 million households in New York City. The channels, Crosswalks, feature a range of programming, from job listings to City Council hearings to foreign-language documentaries.
The city operates the channels under the terms of its franchise contracts with Time Warner and the other major cable operator in the city, Cablevision Systems. Under Federal law, municipalities have the right to request such channels. In New York, the contracts say the city can use the channels, Nos. 71 to 75, to transmit programming that is educational or governmental in nature, without being more specific.
The Mayor oversees the channels, which are separate from the public-access cable channels in each borough. While Crosswalks is restricted to educational or governmental programming, virtually anything can go on the public-access channels, from nudity to performance art to soap operas. The borough presidents supervise the channels, but have little ability to censor material on them.
Even before Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani decided to put the Fox News Channel and Bloomberg Television News on Crosswalks, the city interpreted the contract provisions to allow it to run horse racing on the channels. The reasoning was that such programming served a governmental purpose because it would help the city-owned Offtrack Betting Corporation, officials said.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
What Will Gates Give?

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis 

 BODY:
ONE OF THE UNSPOKEN RULES OF the very rich is never to talk about your money, or at any rate not in public. That is why it was so interesting when, one evening this August, Ted Turner decided to unburden himself to Maureen Dowd of The Times. Turner talked about how, two years before, he had given away $200 million to universities and environmental groups. "My hand shook when I signed the papers," he told Dowd in Montana, where he has his big ranch, "because I knew I was taking myself out of the running for the richest man in America."
But since then, Turner has become both a fierce advocate of charity and a mortal enemy of the annual list published by Forbes magazine of America's richest people. "I talked to both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the two richest men in the country," he said, interestingly, "and they would be inclined to give more if there was a list of who did the giving rather than the having. What difference does it make if you're worth $12 billion or $11 billion? . . . They are fighting every year to be the richest man in the world. Why don't they sign a joint pact to each give away a billion and then move down the Forbes list equally?" 
 Actually, Warren Buffett is worth $15 billion and says he plans to give his money away posthumously (to promote population control). But Bill Gates, who is worth $18.5 billion, shows no sign of using it for anything but making more money. No doubt he has his reasons. They can be overcome.
 THE FIRST THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT the blend of aggression, ruthlessness and mania for control that inspires a man to make billions for himself prevents him from dropping it into a stamped self-addressed envelope and shipping it to Oxfam, even if, say, The New York Times Magazine were to publish an annual list of America's Biggest Givers. But there are ways for a billionaire to distribute his fortune without first undergoing a radical psychological overhaul; it is possible to give acquisitively. George Soros is giving both his time and the billions he has earned speculating in the market to promote "open" societies in former Communist countries and to defend legal immigrants in the United States, in the process making himself the most powerful private man on the planet. By hurling himself and his money into politics, Ross Perot has brought campaign-finance reform into the public debate without denying his ego in any way I can see.
The second important point is that we do not want Bill Gates simply to hand over his money to some charity. The biggest problem with charities is that they are run by well-meaning people who have no clue how to handle money and little practical idea about how to get their way in the world, at least compared with Bill Gates. It requires a certain ruthless ambition to make the world a better place. That is why George Soros and Ross Perot have each in his own way been so successful. And if Gates's money is to be deployed ruthlessly, who better to supervise the deployment than Gates himself?
A more interesting question is what Gates might persuade himself to use his money for. Like most successful entrepreneurs, he is best motivated by clearly defined goals (destroying Netscape, requiring the whole world to own Windows 95). He needs a very specific problem, small enough for one man with a few billion to solve and yet large enough that there are great ego rewards in solving it. Fortunately, the current public hatred of government spending on liberal experiments leaves Gates with not only more after-tax dollars but also a few obvious philanthropic possibilities.
PUBLIC SPACE: The decline in the number of places where all social classes mingle is one of the more noticeable trends that goes hand in hand with the widening gap between rich and poor. Every major city needs places where money is not an issue. Parks are the obvious example, but why stop at parks when you have $18.5 billion and Bill Gates's brain? What will be the great public square of the future?
CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT: Maybe the answer to the above is a public space where kids of all kinds could mingle. A Gates Theater, staging musicals to which tickets are distributed free on a first-come, first-served basis? A Gatesland that makes Disneyland look like child's play? Whatever, the goal is to create a place so alluring that even rich kids can't stay away. One of the great indignities of being poor (or, for that matter, middle class) is not being able to provide your children with the idle pleasures of the rich. Children are much more likely to assimilate to a group from different backgrounds, and having once done this, they will remember for the rest of their lives that they once shared something in common with a poor person.
GUN CONTROL: The Gates Gun Control Program could turn the problem on its head -- by paying people not to own a gun. (Why not? We pay farmers not to grow crops.) To keep down costs, the program would be restricted only to those who had done hard time in jail. Gates inspectors would conduct spot-checks on those who took Gates's money. Cheaters would be rendered ineligible for future Gates dough.
EDUCATION: "With a billion dollars you can build a whole university," Ted Turner said, but no one needs another university. What is needed is a single shining example of a public-school system so that people can see what you can get when you pay for it. Pick a city, any city. Radical spending measures may be required -- say, six-figure salaries for teachers and paying parents for making their kids attend.
EQUALITY: The Gates Foundation should seek ways to offset the alarming tendency of the poor to remain poor. Gates got rich, in part, because of forces beyond his control -- i.e., the new global economy. These same forces are helping to undermine the less fortunate among us. The man able to find a way to offset the social forces that gave rise to his fortune in the first place would be worth much more than $18.5 billion.

HEADLINE: LIVES;
Hush of the Hives

BYLINE: By Derrick Jensen; Derrick Jensen is the author of "Listening to the Land: Conversations About Nature, Culture and Eros."

 BODY:
The past few years I've begun to burn my beekeeping equipment. Frames and boxes, varnished with beeswax from years of use, keep the house warm. Other equipment I've stored in the barn. Chickens roost on the lip of the extractor, and last year a hen started setting in a settling tank. I'd love to start with bees again, but I've become discouraged by all the death.
I look at empty hives still standing in my yard and feel the urge to hear again the hum of thousands of bees flying in all directions, to pop open a hive and smell the rich, moist, fecund scent of live bees and honey, but I'm scared. 
 The fear began for me in 1994. Here in Spokane the year started wonderfully, a hot, wet, spring that produced a waist-deep carpet of blue and purple wildflowers. Hives bubbled with bees.
Then bees started dying. At first I blamed the weather -- it was dry from mid-June to early September. Then I blamed pesticides. Then urban sprawl. But most of all I blamed myself. I didn't know what I was doing wrong, but it had to be something.
It was strange solace to learn that bees were dying everywhere; solace because this meant the deaths weren't my responsibility; strange because I had to ask what sort of solace there was to be discovered in such loss. A 1996 American Beekeeping Federation survey of last winter's kill reads like the casualty list of a horrific battle: "Maine, 80 percent loss. . . . Massachusetts, 55-75 percent. . . . Michigan, 60 percent. . . . "
Why? Varroa mites, which cause deformities and paralysis, introduce viruses and ultimately kill entire colonies. The best guess on how the mites got here is that in the 1980's a beekeeper smuggled honeybee queens from South America or Europe, hoping their offspring would pollinate more effectively and give more honey than American honeybees. But along with queens, the beekeeper accidentally brought varroa mites. Because bees groom each other constantly, mites spread throughout hives, then clung to bees as they entered other colonies. Since commercial beekeepers often follow blooms across the country, mites soon overspread the continent.
It would be as pointless as it would be easy to blame the die-off on the smuggling beekeeper. The collapse was inevitable anyway. In February the hills surrounding Modesto, Calif., roll with white-blossomed almond trees. Although monocropped miles of almond flowers may be beautiful they're as unnatural as Frankenstein's monster; the staggering number of blooms to be pollinated grossly overmatches the capacity of wild pollinators like bumblebees, moths, wasps and beetles to set fruit, causing almond ranchers to pay distant beekeepers up to $35 per hive to bring in bees for the four-week bloom.
Almonds aren't the only crop needing pollination. Apples, cherries, pears, raspberries, cranberries, blueberries, cucumbers, watermelons -- each of these densely packed crops requires similarly densely packed beehives to set fruit.
The strengths that have made modern beekeeping the foundation upon which the agricultural infrastructure rests are precisely the weaknesses that have made beekeeping, and modern agribusiness, vulnerable to something tiny as the mite. These are the intertwined attributes of standardization (the use of one pollinator across many crops), density (the annual gathering of half a million hives to pollinate almonds, for example) and mobility (the transport of bees, and consequently mites, to and from all parts of the country).
Years ago, working with bees provided me a somatic understanding of cooperation: work against bees and they sting; work with them as they work with themselves and they reward you with honey, joy and sore muscles. More recently they taught me about loss. Now, as I watch modern beekeeping collapse under the weight of its own strengths, they're teaching me that the modern industrial economy -- based as it is upon these same traits of standardization (the conversion of forests to tree farms, grasslands to cornfields, diverse cultures to capitalism), the short-term maximization of resource usage and the absolute mobility of resources -- faces the same vulnerabilities as beekeeping.
Despite the losses, each year new people discover the richness of this craft, and for them high losses and a widening spiral of chemical treatments may simply be part of the bargain. As for me, this year I watched a pair of nuthatches try to squeeze into an empty beehive. No matter how they tried, they couldn't make it. With saw and file, I made them a home. They raised babies there, and seemed to like it. So did I.

MANHATTAN NOCTURNE
By Colin Harrison.
355 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers. $24.
The protagonist of Colin Harrison's third novel, a top-of-the-heap tabloid columnist named Porter Wren, sells his mayhem, scandal and tragedy in New York City, that "landscape of bad possibilities." He leads an irregular life. ("I get calls in the night and . . . go wherever it happened: the car, the bar, the street, the club, the store.") He's happily married and the devoted father of two children, but his appetites have always landed him in trouble. In the tradition of Walter Neff of "Double Indemnity" and countless other smart guys who should have known better, Porter is now sorting through the rubble after the fact, and making, he tells us, "a confession and an investigation" into the workings of his own heart. As we might expect, it all began with a woman. 
 At the sort of glittering party that has Joe Montana rubbing elbows with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Porter is tantalized by the mysterious and beautiful Caroline Crowley. A reader familiar with the dictates of noir will recognize the drill: she's the most stunning woman in the room, with "a full, throaty voice," and seems jaded beyond her years. She's inexplicably focused on him.
Our hero mutters cynical and knowing things about not playing the sap and then hustles right off into her Erotic Web of Intrigue. She wants him to investigate the murder of her husband, a Wunderkind film maker, himself a chronicler of urban noir, who died violently, under baffling circumstances. It's clear that she's not telling the whole truth. It's clear that she's trouble. There's even a fragment of a jade figurine involved.
Porter, however, ignores the warning signs. (Caroline's "entire apartment was sterile. Like a hotel suite . . . it had no character, no essence of its inhabitant"; it was all "expensive surfaces.") And soon it becomes clear that he's deeply entangled with powerful forces. But by now he's in Caroline's sexual thrall, so he proceeds to act out the ritual we know so well: "I washed my face and looked in the mirror. I'd heard a lie in Caroline's voice somewhere, maybe more than one, and I wanted to think carefully about what she'd told me. But I was tired and my head swam with the drink." "The thing was driving me mad. There was something I wasn't seeing."
What's striking about this genre -- by this point a hybrid of at least the hard-boiled detective novels of the 1930's and all the film noirs since then -- is the way it indefatigably centers on the protagonist's anxiety about the overtly sexual female's essential unreadability. The Bad Woman, out for herself and willing to use her body, is the figure upon which all the action turns, the cipher upon which the protagonist projects meanings that leave him unsatisfied. She is the irresistible force in a genre that prizes, above all else, control. She triggers the titillating exchange of weakness and power that fascinates both the protagonist and the genre's adherents. To paraphrase James M. Cain, she's the wish that has terror in it. (One of Cain's hapless heroes cracks, right before the roof falls in, "I loved her like a rabbit loves a rattlesnake.")
Mr. Harrison, who is the author of the well-received novels "Bodies Electric" and "Break and Enter," this time has produced a thriller that seems to want to be equal parts Raymond Chandler, William Styron and Tom Wolfe. When not in his no-nonsense Philip Marlowe mode ("I was a married newspaperman. It didn't make much sense to me. It didn't need to, not yet"), Porter meditates with a sad fatalism on the dark domestic crises of the heart, or muses satirically on the grotesque inequalities of the city's economic stratification. There is, of course, a nice dovetailing between the world view of a novel like "The Bonfire of the Vanities" and the premises of noir: that vision of society as wilderness, a world of deceptive surfaces where guilt, because it's all-pervasive, can be assigned to sacrificial victims.
These corollary aspirations generate some of the greatest pleasures in Mr. Harrison's novel, so that the same narrative that impresses us with its top-to-bottom knowledge of New York City fauna is also illuminating about the quiet acts of omission that irrevocably damage a marriage. (Porter's wife, Lisa, is a wonderfully drawn character.) "Manhattan Nocturne" is also filled with tips for the street-smart: how to remove the Club from a steering wheel with aerosol Freon and a hammer; how to track down a British citizen in Manhattan without the help of a phone number, address or Social Security number.
These sorts of pleasures also allow for digressions (there's a discussion of back labor during delivery) and editorials: "These aims had been leached out of me (as they generally have been from the American news media, which, as the 20th century draws to a close, seems to sense its own clamoring irrelevance, its humble subservience to a pagan culture of celebrity)." As a result, the pace is not exactly headlong. The digressions and editorials help inhibit the sense of desperation and fear that usually drives such stories. (This is a genre, after all, that lists among its titles "Journey Into Fear," "Ministry of Fear," "Fear in the Night," "Sudden Fear," "Storm Fear," "Cape Fear," "Experiment in Terror," "Nightmare Alley" and "I Wake Up Screaming.")
Fear seems necessary in thematic as well as narrative terms, since we assume that what underlies the narrator's terror of the femme fatale's impenetrability is his terror of his own. And though Porter talks a lot about the other, dark side of himself, he doesn't seem particularly anxious on that score. It's as if he's had his sense of self diminished -- in a squinting, tough-guy way -- but not really rocked. ("All this bleeding was my fault, and I was glad that Lisa and the kids were far away from me. I wasn't worthy of them now. Somehow this was not a surprise to me; always I have known that I am selfish and small-hearted.") And that may be the point at which Styron's and Chandler's protagonists are incompatible: part of the romance in noir seems to involve a final secret sense of satisfaction with the self-betrayal, a sense of "I didn't know I had it in me." Which may be why, in the early stages, the femme fatale always initiates our hero into another, more intense world of passion.
Noir then becomes an unexpectedly unsuitable vehicle for a literary portrait of a soul divided, since its focus, finally, is not, as the narrator claims, on having had to dismantle and reassemble his sense of himself so much as it is on his delight at having reasserted control in the face of the bad woman's charms, and having gained the power to read her accurately: "She had a beautiful face, but she could make it ugly, and now she did. . . . 'No, Caroline, no. You brought me into this. You thought you could just . . . lead me around. But you didn't study me very carefully, Caroline, you didn't figure out how a small-town boy like me with not one connection in New York City elbowed and hustled and hassled his way to be a newspaper columnist.' "
The novel's protagonist is most memorable when that small-town boy, for all his bluster, articulates with real sadness his understanding of his own wrongdoing, and of the damage he's done to those he loves: "The house will be empty again, quiet again, until someone else stands there, looking at the windows and walls and floors, mindful perhaps that the last occupants, my wife and children and myself, were only passing through."
When Porter Wren scales back from sexual athlete and social satirist
to homebody, "Manhattan Nocturne" soars.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
In Princeton, a Brief Ivy Interlude

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
THE novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald once described Princeton as encircled by a "ring of silence," with "sordid Trenton" 12 miles to the south and "the suburban slums of New York" 50 miles north. He was an undergraduate at the time, full of strong opinions and callow pretensions, desperate to kiss a pretty girl and get into the best clubs on campus. When he left the university early to join the Army in 1917, he went straight to Brooks Brothers in New York to replenish his wardrobe first.
Of course, Princeton, chartered by King George II of England in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, has changed since Fitzgerald's day -- welcoming women in 1969 and filling the greenswards between Colonial halls and Collegiate Gothic residential colleges with modernist structures by Robert Venturi and I. M. Pei. Still, if Fitzgerald were to return, he'd know it immediately, because Princeton remains a place apart from what he called "the dirty gray turmoil" of the everyday world. 
 Harvard and Yale were founded earlier, and have the same Neo-Gothic architecture and cloistered atmosphere; but Princeton's small-town setting gives it a heightened sense of removal -- which runs so deep that it has fostered a superstition. Fearing dire consequences (like the flu during finals), undergraduates never walk out of FitzRandolph Gate on Nassau Street at the north side of campus, separating gown from town. Passage is reserved for graduating seniors, for whom it is a rite symbolizing entrance into the real world.
But in the dog days of a New York summer, I was already in the real world. And I wanted out -- not for four years, but for a little getaway. I couldn't afford to go far or stay long, which is why Princeton appealed to me. It takes less than an hour and a half to get there on the train run by New Jersey Transit, for $14 round trip, off-peak. At Princeton Junction you catch a one-car shuttle to town. On board I learned that the shuttle is affectionately called the Dinky, and the small depot in Princeton the Dinky Station.
When I arrived I half-expected to be greeted by an upperclassman handing out freshman beanies. But in late August the campus was largely deserted, so I shouldered my bag and marched up leafy University Place, passing the cathedral-like McCarter Theater (with a late-September to May season) and the University Store on the west side of campus, where I could have bought a Princeton captain's chair for about $300. But my budget was too tight for that. In fact, it was only by making a few compromises that I'd been able to afford this Ivy League interlude at all, because Princeton isn't an intrinsically frugal destination.
Downtown there are just two places to stay, the large, venerable Nassau Inn (with a Norman Rockwell mural depicting Yankee Doodle in a feathered cap and rates for singles that range from $130 to $190); and the 15-room Peacock Inn on Bayard Lane, where I booked the cheapest single in the house for $80 (now $90) including breakfast. I'd have liked to stay for three nights, touring the university on foot and renting a bike to reach several Revolutionary War sites around town. But, amazingly, there are no bike rental shops in Princeton, so I stayed for two nights and got an economy car priced at $44 (from Stefanelli's Avis, a 10-minute walk from the inn) for a little shunpiking on my last day in town.
The Peacock Inn turned out to be a three-story, white frame house that was moved from its original on-campus site around 1875 to a neighborhood of spreading trees and handsome residences about two blocks west of the university. Downstairs at the Peacock there is a fancy French restaurant called Le Plumet Royal, which was too pricey for me; but I can attest to the chef's expertise on the basis of the buffet breakfast, which included hot coffee in a silver pot, moist blueberry muffins and delicious broccoli quiche.
The staff at the Peacock was preparing for a wedding when I arrived; as one of the few guests not attached to the nuptial party, I was given a small room with a slanting ceiling covered in floral paper, at the back on the third floor. No. 17 had green carpet, a window I couldn't open (because it had an air-conditioning unit in it), a low double bed, pretty wicker furniture and fresh towels, but no towel rack or sink. A terrycloth robe was provided for trips to the rather stuffy shared bath next door. Actually, $80 struck me as a lot to spend for a room with a shared bath; but the price was almost, if not quite, justified by the inn's nice, old-fashioned decor, excellent location, and intangible amenities -- like the fact that Bertrand Russell stayed there and Albert Einstein, who lived in Princeton from 1933 to 1955, used to come for drinks.
Of course, luminaries have been as common in Princeton as squirrels, beginning with Jonathan Edwards, the stern theologian who served for 34 days as the university's third president. The Battle of Princeton on Jan. 3, 1777, brought a score of Revolutionary War heroes to the area, including Hugh Mercer, Alexander Hamilton and George Washington (who later attended a session of the Continental Congress held in Princeton's Nassau Hall and donated 50 guineas to the university to help it recover from the ravages of the war). Presidents James Madison, Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy, writers including Fitzgerald, Booth Tarkington and Eugene O'Neill, as well as the movie star Jimmy Stewart, were Princeton men, though not all graduated.
But as I learned while taking a free Orange Key Guide Service tour of the 600-acre main campus, anyone who matriculates at Princeton becomes a class member in perpetuity whether they are graduated or not. Thus, President Kennedy, who eventually earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard, will ever remain a member of Princeton's class of 1939; and Fitzgerald, who never returned to Princeton after World War I, will always be in the class of 1917.
Nonetheless, Fitzgerald, who drew on his Princeton experiences for his first novel, "This Side of Paradise," understood the ethos of the place well, coming to love "the temperate shapes of Nassau Hall's old brick, and the way it seems still a tribunal of early American ideals, the elm walks and meadows, the college windows open to the spring -- open, open to everything in life -- for a minute."
Georgian Nassau Hall holds pride of place at the head of the old Front Campus, with two bronze tigers lazing at the entrance, donated by the class of 1879, Woodrow Wilson's -- actually, just about everything on campus bears a year, from memorial benches to bathrooms. It was completed in 1756, occupied by the British during the War of Independence, and bombarded by Continental Army cannonfire in 1777 (the marks are visible on the south facade).
Inside, my tour guide, Emily Koster, a poised and friendly sophomore, pointed out a stone tablet in the Memorial Atrium, bearing the names of Princeton's 70 Civil War dead -- exactly 35 Yankees and 35 Johnny Rebs -- and a full-length portrait of George Washington in the wood-lined Faculty Room; painted by Charles Willson Peale, it replaced a portrait of King George II, which, legend has it, was decapitated by a Colonial cannonball.
I've taken college campus tours from Ireland to Texas -- not just because they are generally interesting and free, but because they make me feel, briefly, adolescent again, and on the verge of making one of life's first important decisions. The Princeton tour was one of my favorites, because Ms. Koster had an eye for salient detail, bringing the Collegiate Gothic architecture of Princeton to life by noting that a cappella groups favor gargoyled Blair Arch as a performance site for its exquisite acoustics. Princeton lore was revealed, like the fact that an anonymous donation of a million dollars financed the decoration of the campus with modernist sculpture by artists like Pablo Picasso and Jacques Lipchitz. And I loved the way Ms. Koster's eyebrows arched when a young man in the crowd asked if Princeton students were on a first-name basis with their professors.
Afterward I toured the Art Museum, with Picasso's long-necked, cockeyed sculpture "Head of a Woman" posted like a sentry at the door. Founded in 1882, the collection includes everything from Mayan steles to a construction by Red Grooms. An uncharacteristically intimate painting by Thomas Hart Benton called "Pussycat and Roses" caught my eye, as did a parody, painted by a mischievous young Toulouse-Lautrec, of Puvis de Chav annes's ridiculously stiff French salon favorite "The Sacred Wood Dear to the Arts and Muses."
Over the next few days I returned to the campus, peeking into Princeton's vaunted eating clubs on Prospect Avenue, inspecting a skeleton of a Late Pleistocene dire wolf at the Museum of Natural History in Guyot Hall, and laughing out loud at an exhibition (since removed) of urbanely silly cartoons from The New Yorker by Whitney Darrow Jr. (class of 1931), in the Harvey S. Firestone Library. To swim laps beneath orange and black pennants in the pool at Dillon Gymnasium ($5) and climb the spiraling stone steps inside the beautiful, Neo-Gothic Cleveland Tower, I had to convince a passer-by with a Princeton ID to help me gain admittance -- at the tower, it was a grad student who'd just arrived from China and wanted to take in the view from the crenellated, 173-foot summit himself. In Prospect Garden, I sat amid zinnias reading "This Side of Paradise," and at dusk one evening paused to watch an elderly gentleman gaze up at the arched windows of Rockefeller Residential College, searching for his old room and memories, I felt sure.
 IN Princeton's small downtown there were upscale stores around Palmer Square, used-book shops (including Witherspoon, a basement full of wonderful old stuff) tucked off Nassau Street, and a small historical museum in Bainbridge House to explore. I favored Olives Gourmet Bakery and Deli for picnic lunch fare (like chicken salad and a French roll for about $6); and at a stylish bistro called Quilty's on the same block, I settled in for dinner: a salad, two delicious lump crab cakes and a goblet of Clos Robert Fume Blanc '94 for about $20.
Perhaps I could have forgone the rental car altogether; I could have walked to Princeton Battlefield State Park, which surrounds the historic Thomas Clarke House, about a mile and a half southwest of town. There, I stood near the spots where General Hugh Mercer was mortally wounded and General Washington appeared on a great white horse to rally his demoralized men -- resulting in a rear-guard victory that many historians believe helped turn the tide of the Revolution.
But the car came in handy in the end, because with it I was able to lunch on a pint of River House Ale and a London broil sandwich ($10) at the Rocky Hill Pub on Route 518, and then tour Rockingham. In this modest country home about 10 miles northeast of Princeton, Washington stayed in 1783 while the Continental Congress convened in Nassau Hall. Afterward, meandering Route 27 took me back to Princeton, where I realized that I still had just enough time to paddle out onto the old Delaware and Raritan Canal in a canoe rented (for $9 an hour) at Turning Basin Park, about two miles south of the university. The canal, which connected the Delaware River to New York Harbor in the 1830's, is a froggy, currentless body of water lined by Princeton backyards. I'd dropped my paddle, and was leaning back with my eyes closed when I heard the Dinky rattle across a railroad bridge overhead -- which, alas, I had to take as a summons back to the real world.

 BODY:

Increases Under Rent Control
 
Q My apartment is under rent control. Every year my rent is increased by 7.5 percent. How is this increase determined and when does it stop? . . . Charles R. Schneider, Brooklyn.
 
A According to a rent control "Fact Sheet" published by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, rent control in New York City operates under what is called the Maximum Base Rent system. Under that system, a maximum base rent is established for most rent-controlled apartments.
The maximum base rent is determined according to a formula calculated to reflect real estate taxes, water and sewer charges, operating and maintenance expenses, return on capital value and a vacancy and collection loss allowance. The maximum base rent is then adjusted every two years to reflect changes in those operating costs. 
 The rent that rent-controlled tenants actually pay is called the maximum collectible rent. Generally, the maximum collectible rent is less than the maximum base rent. By law, however, owners who certify that they are providing essential services and have removed violations may raise rents by up to 7.5 percent each year until the maximum base rent limit is reached.
So, for example, if a tenant's current monthly rent is $400, and the maximum base rent is $450, and the tenant's rent was increased 7.5 percent, the rent due would be $430. If at the same time, however, the maximum base rent was updated and increased by, say, 14.7 percent (the update factor used in 1994/1995) the maximum base rent for the apartment would increase to $516.15, thereby making another 7.5 percent increase likely the next year.
Accordingly, while the maximum collectible rent may increase by 7.5 each year until it "catches up" with the maximum base rent, that may never happen if the maximum base rent increases by an equal or greater amount.
Rents of rent-controlled tenants may also be increased in other ways. For example, an increase could be granted if an owner adds services or substantially rehabilitates a building. Increases are also possible when labor costs increase, when fuel costs increase or when a landlord can demonstrate that he or she is experiencing an economic hardship.
At the same time, tenants may challenge rent increases for various reasons.
Challenges may be based on the grounds that the building has violations or that the owner is not maintaining essential services. Tenants may also obtain decreases if it can be shown that that the owners' expenses do not warrant an increase.
The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development may also decrease rents in certain cases. Such cases include substantial, uncorrected code violations and reductions in services.
The Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption program exempts rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants from certain rent increases. To qualify, the head of household must be 62 or older, the total household income, after taxes, must be less than $20,000, and the current rent must be at least one-third of the net monthly income. The program exempts maximum base rent increases, fuel increases and increases attributable to landlord hardship and major capital improvements.
Additional information is available by calling the department's Rent InfoLine at (718) 739-6400.
 
Brokers' Fees For Rentals
 
Q With demand for rental apartments in New York City greatly exceeding supply, some rental brokers have raised their fees. Instead of the usual commission of 15 percent of the yearly rent, some brokers are now charging 18 or even 20 percent. Is there a legal limit to the commission a broker can charge on the rental of an apartment? Is there a state agency that regulates rental commissions? . . . Franz Demnon, Manhattan.
 
A "There is no limit on brokers' commissions, either by statute or regulation," said Gwenn Lee, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of State.
Ms. Lee explained that while the department's licensing division controls the licensing of real estate brokers, it does not have any control over the commissions that brokers charge, either for sales or rentals.
"It's a free-market system," Ms. Lee said, explaining that the "usual" commission is usually "whatever the market will bear."

HEADLINE: Employment Workshop for Older Jobless

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN work disappears, depression is likely to take its place. So say those who conduct A.A.R.P. Works, a career-planning workshop for the unemployed. Aimed at helping people older than 50 find new jobs, the program is sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons.
Since its inception in 1988, A.A.R.P. Works has become an accurate barometer, recording the highs and lows in the Westchester job market, said Claire Watsky, a professional career counselor. 
 "For years, there were only lows," observed Ms. Watsky, who has been the volunteer head of the workshop since it began. "When it came to employment, older people, no matter how well qualified, were viewed as anathema."
Saying that the most recent survey conducted by the association showed that people 55 and older had more than seven times the unemployment rate of those 16 to 54 years old, Ms. Watsky continued: "By now, we can pretty accurately predict the climate of the job market. In June we first noticed a distinct upturn in the hiring of older workers. And I say, 'It's about time.' "
In the last few years, despite the upward surge in employment in the county, Ms. Watsky said: "The 50- and 60-year-olds were the very last group to be hired. It wasn't until after all the available 30- and 40-year-olds were gone that employers finally began to give experienced older workers a chance, since many businesses were short staffed as a result of too much downsizing."
When Dorothy Allen's job with a nonprofit crime victims information and counseling organization was phased out last January, she went to London, she said.
"I felt I really needed a break before beginning a job search," she explained. "I'm over 60. I knew it was going to be tough, but I have to work. I've been supporting myself since my divorce many years ago."
Ms. Allen, who spent 15 years as the assistant director of Legal Awareness of Westchester, a nonprofit clearinghouse for legal information, said she honed her marketable skills as a volunteer.
"I was the ultimate volunteer when I was leading the good suburban life in New Rochelle as a wife and the mother of two daughters," she said. "I was on the library board, on the board of the Girl Scouts, president of the P.T.A., and I learned a lot."
But nothing, she added, prepared her for the current job market.
"For three months, I answered ads, sent out resumes without getting to first base," she said. "Not a single interview resulted from my efforts. Of course, I knew I was doing something wrong, so last spring, when I read an article about the A.A.R.P. workshops, I signed up."
From all reports, Ms. Allen recalled, she expected the other participants to be mired in gloom and doom.
"I kept hearing that the older jobless going into uncharted territory were frightened and fearful," she said. "To my surprise, I found high-caliber movers and shakers, a very confident group. While acknowledging that they had lost their jobs, most of them were able to view their situation positively, as an opportunity to do something different and interesting."
"One of the workshop's counselors opened up my mind to possibilities," Ms. Allen said. "On the practical side, she critiqued my resume and helped me redo it, and she stressed the importance of networking. Tell everyone you know that you are looking for a job was her advice. And it worked. A friend of a friend of mine faxed my new resume to a nonprofit organization that was looking for a project coordinator. On Aug. 1, I started working for Tobacco Free New York on issues that are dear to my heart, such as implementing programs to discourage teen-agers from smoking. I am extremely happy with the way things turned out."
And so, Ms. Watsky said, are others in the workshop group.
"In the eight years we've been running the A.A.R.P. program, this is the most optimistic time for employment of older workers," she said. "Good stories are coming back to us from the participants. For instance, a former nurse has landed a good job in the health field. Several people who relocated to take jobs out of state report that they are making good salaries."
Walter M. Svec, 58, a former banker and a member of the group, did not need a big salary but, he said, "I did need a job to supplement my pension, and I felt too young to retire, especially since my wife is still working."
Mr. Svec, who spent 39 years climbing the career ladder at a major bank, before retiring as a vice president in the commercial credit division, signed up for the A.A.R.P. workshop because, he said, "Having spent my entire working life in one place, I really didn't know how to go about looking for a job."
Mr. Svec said he came away from the course with a better understanding of himself. "I was able to make a self-assessment and define my values," he said. "And on the practical side, I learned interviewing techniques and how to write a good resume."
Two weeks ago, Mr. Svec started working as manager of student accounts in the business department at a college.
"The atmosphere is very pleasant," he said. "I like working with people. And I'm able to put my banking experience to new use."
The next workshop will begin on Oct. 21 and will run through Nov. 21. The fee for the seven sessions is $20. The program will be conducted by trained A.A.R.P. volunteers, including an executive recruiter, a management consultant, a retired guidance counselor and a former businessman. Speakers other than the association's volunteers will also offer advice.
A free information session will be held Wednesday from 10 A.M. to noon at Diversified Information Advisers, 4 Manhattanville Road in Purchase, the site of the workshops.
For more information, Ms. Watsky can be reached at 381-2048.

As Serene as a Teahouse in Kyoto

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
IN A ROW OF SEDATE BROWNSTONES ON THE Upper East Side of Manhattan, one stands out. The tall windows, edged in black, look like hanging scrolls. The off-white facade, the dark gray sidewalk and the weeping Japanese pine by the front door merely hint at what lies beyond it. Inside is Kaikodo, one of the city's newest and most elegant art galleries, which opened six months ago in a modernized town house on 64th Street east of Lexington Avenue.
Hung on a wall of the low-ceilinged entryway with a shimmering black slate floor is a Japanese scroll depicting the darkening leaves and misty mountains of autumn. Two steps down, in the library, a room of honey-toned floors and bookshelves, are colorsplashed Song and Ming ceramics and ancient Shang bronzes, each framed in its own cubicle. The 16-foot windows illuminate Kaikodo's main gallery, a soaring space two stories high displaying 14th-century paintings and 16th-century calligraphy. 
 Kaikodo is the brainchild of Howard and Mary Ann Rogers, its owners, who have spent most of the last 20 years living and working as teachers and art dealers in Japan. While the gallery's serene, uncluttered spaces may suggest a Kyoto temple or a teahouse, Mr. Rogers said that its most Japanese aspect was its absence of extraneous detail.
He made his first trip to Japan in 1976 on a Ford Foundation fellowship after graduate school in California. He planned to stay six months but remained to write a book on Chinese paintings, which he completed in 1978. He then started teaching art history at Sophia University in Tokyo and married Mary Ann Perse.
By 1980, the couple had begun collecting Chinese paintings and ceramics. Three years later, to finance their expanding appetites for objects and augment their modest teachers' salaries, they became part-time dealers. Their first piece was a Song jar, which was given them as payment for a translation he had done.
Throughout the 1980's, the couple helped organize exhibitions at several prominent American museums. Mr. Rogers worked on the 1980 catalogue of "Eight Dynasties of Chinese Paintings" that appeared at both the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and he was the curator of "Masterworks of Ming and Qing Painting From the Forbidden City," a 1989 traveling exhibition that wound up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Rogers catalogued the ceramics from Tokyo's Idemitsu Museum of Arts for a 1988 touring exhibition, "In Pursuit of the Dragon," which was sponsored by the Seattle Art Museum.
Their background in museum work gave them an advantage few dealers enjoy. "When we became dealers, we knew museum curators all over the world," Mr. Rogers said. "But we had known many of them in graduate school at Berkeley or traveling in the late 1960's in Taiwan." Finally, in 1994, Mr. Rogers gave up teaching to become a full-time dealer.
The timing of the couple's setting up shop in New York was fortuitous. "I call it good luck," Mr. Rogers said. They bought the town house during the real estate recession, and, after a year of planning and a year of construction, they opened the gallery just as the Asian art market gained momentum.
Kaikodo is doing a brisk business. At its first exhibition last spring, most of the pieces were sold; in its current show, which ends Oct. 26, more than half were bought. The rarities in this show include a tile from the fifth century emblazoned with a boar's head (priced at $45,000) and an owl-shaped Shang bronze pot ($1 million). The least costly object, at $2,500, is an 18th-century still life. Last month, the staff at Kaikodo doubled in size, with the addition of Carol Conover and Arnold Chang, two Chinese art specialists formerly with Sotheby's.
James J. Lally, a prominent New York dealer in Asian art, said he welcomed the addition of Kaikodo to the Manhattan art scene. "This is a positive development," he said. "It demonstrates again the importance of New York as an Asian art center, at a time when Europe is becoming more difficult because of the new tax laws in the European Economic Community."
Notwithstanding difficulties in foreign markets, the Rogerses continue to operate a gallery in Kamakura, Japan, also called Kaikodo. In comparison with the Manhattan branch, Mr. Rogers said the one in Japan was almost rustic; it is far more crowded with objects and set up to function as a home. (In fact, the couple live there half the year.) Also, business is conducted differently in each place. In Japan, he and his wife take the artworks to clients, especially museums. In New York, most sales take place at the gallery.
Mr. Rogers said he preferred the Western style. Standing in the main gallery surrounded by art treasures, he said, "In Japan, everyone is secretive, and important scrolls are kept rolled up and out of sight."

A Journey in Geometric Designs And Photographs That Confound

BYLINE: HELEN A. HARRISON 

 BODY:

A Journey in Geometric Art
 Wisser Library, New York Institute of Technology, Rte. 25A, Old Westbury. Through Oct. 30. 686-7633.
In a survey spanning more than 40 years, Martin Schreiber traces his development as an abstract artist who began as a painter but eventually embraced sculpture as well. In fact, his most recent pieces are amalgams, painted reliefs that combine elements of both forms of expression. 
 The earliest work, a 1952 oil, is an understated homage to de Stijl principles of harmony, not imitative but respectful of its source. Like Mondrian's canvases, its austerity is relieved by evidence of the painter's touch. Later, however, Mr. Schreiber would expunge painterly handwriting, opting instead for an almost mechanistic formalism in which all trace of brushwork is eliminated.
The works of the last 30 years are progressively concerned with color relationships and then symbolic form, as in Mr. Schreiber's 1980's "Comet" series, which owes something to Kandinsky's late geometric phase. His recent reliefs, combining painted and cutout metal elements -- some in the shapes of Hebrew letters -- are an uncomfortable union, lacking the cohesiveness and purity of the earlier, color-based geometries.

Space Sites 1
 Port Washington Public Library, 1 Library Drive, Port Washington. Through Oct 30. 883-4400.
Using photography to reinterpret earlier work, Katinka Mann has transformed shaped canvases into cut and folded wall reliefs that subtly tamper with the evidence before our eyes. Texture, dimension and, above all, spatial relationships are redefined in terms of a new and remarkably effective approach to perception.
Ms. Mann has employed light to color and model the original shapes, making interior spaces glow and exterior planes shimmer with unseen radiance. Her Polaroid and Cibachrome prints are then reshaped to confound notions of depth and surface, negative and positive, recession and protrusion.
In "Grey," for example, a shadowed area is brought forward, physically defying its implicit depth. "Brown With Opening" turns an apparent hole into an advancing shape. In several works, highlighted textures are belied by the prints' smooth, shiny surfaces. Colors that sparkle with the metallic luster of hot-rod enamel are also illusory, evoked by the nuances of reflected light.
 
Joan Harrison: Photographs
 Port Washington Public Library. Through Oct. 30.
Ms. Harrison is showing selections from her "Hybrids" and "Chasing the Light" series, two distinct bodies of work with little in common beyond symbolic content. While "Chasing the Light" is based on still-life setups photographed in black and white, the "Hybrids" combine color Polaroid prints with oil pastel drawings.
In both series, Ms. Harrison deals with identity as a mutable concept. The mask is a recurring motif, suggesting discrepancies between outer appearance and hidden reality. Her most arresting device is the application to dolls' heads of torn sections of portrait photographs, reversing the mask metaphor by using real faces to hide the false ones.
The "Chasing the Light" prints, with their understated theatricality and allusions to Surrealist precedents, are far more engaging than the "Hybrids," in which the drawing often seems a mere mannerism. Only when the subject triumphs, as in "The Lovers" and "Anxiety," does the marriage of media prove to be a happy one.

Unique Differences
 Graphic Eye Gallery, 301 Main Street, Port Washington. Through Oct. 27. 883-9668.
Although the gallery is primarily devoted to prints, neither of the artists in this two-person show is exhibiting them. Clara Steiner's drawings on cloth and mixed-media works are graphic but not printed, while Alice H. Proskauer's collaged canvases go in a different direction altogether. Perhaps that divergence explains the show's title.
Ms. Steiner refers to printed sources in her group of "Bookless Pages" and other works using recycled paper. In "Dot Com" and "Max-Pax-Fax," new information technologies are critiqued as purveyors of raw data, often without context or meaning. A card table cover and bedsheet become more intimate vehicles for communication, allowing domestic associations to suggest human interaction that sometimes connects and sometimes misses the mark.
Words and phrases play a prominent role in Ms. Steiner's work, with puns, admonitions and witty asides reminding us not to take our confusion too seriously. Even her "Angry Jacket," weighed down by decorative trappings and clearly fed up with playing the stereotype of feminine finery, is more an amusing caricature than a militant rebel.
Ms. Proskauer's canvases are arrangements of torn and shredded burlap, built up in elaborate organic shapes that she further models with painted highlights. Occasionally sand is added for extra textural interest, but apart from their tactile qualities the works are curiously vapid. Some artists can wrest extraordinary power and meaning from the basest materials, but Ms. Proskauer fails to transcend cloth and pigment.

HEADLINE: Sam and Elizabeth, Guns and Art in Hartford

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
THE new exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford is in part a portrait of Victorian New England in the industrial age, in part a profile of a vibrant, influential couple, Sam and Elizabeth Colt. "Sam and Elizabeth: Legend and Legacy of Colts Empire" tells its multi-faceted story through paintings, sculpture, furnishings, decorative arts, period photographs and manuscripts.
Samuel Colt (1814-1862) was, of course, the firearms inventor and entrepreneur who built an industrial village on the banks of the Connecticut River, changing the face of Hartford and the state. 
 Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt (1826-1905) was his high-born, public-spirited wife, who focused on philanthropy and art collecting, creating a private picture gallery in her Hartford mansion and bequeathing it upon her death to the Wadsworth Atheneum -- unusual achievements for a woman of her time.
Their lives were marked by extraordinary financial success and worldwide recognition, but also by tragedy. Samuel Colt died after a mere six years of marriage and of Elizabeth Colt's four children, three died in infancy, the last in his 30's. Mrs. Colt dedicated the rest of her life to building a church, a park, several monuments and a wing of the Wadsworth Atheneum.
"Creating a historical exhibition infused with art was no small challenge," said William Hosley, the Atheneum's curator of American decorative arts who with Karen Blanchfield, the department's assistant curator, organized the show. "It's a great story that has both human drama and beautiful things."
Appropriately enough, the first exhibit is the well-known sculpture of a rampant colt that stood atop the blue, onion-shaped dome of the Colt armory until 1989. Executed in gilt zinc in Germany in 1860, the lively landmark became Colt's trademark and symbol of his firearms industry.
Flanking the rearing horse are two romantic, monumental oil paintings representing the inventor and his wife, the massive gilt frames crowned by the colt. There are also intimate miniature portraits of the couple done in 1856, the year of their wedding. Period quotations and personal effects give visitors a brief overview of both lives, including Samuel's earlier, ill-fated attempt at various enterprises and his great talent for self-promotion.
The section on Coltsville presents, in photographic murals, prints and paintings, the factory village that grew around the still-existing armory. The 200-acre complex included workers' housing, a community center, a farm, a fire engine company and a factory that manufactured wicker furniture.
At the push of a button, museum visitors can tune in to the sounds of armory machinery, then to the brass band formed by factory workers, many of them German immigrants.
The owners of this industrial empire lived in a grandiose mansion known as Armsmear, set on a knoll overlooking the factory village. Built in 1857, the 20-room villa with its four-story tower, conservatory, greenhouses, ponds and landscaped grounds was considered one of the most lavish in the state. Mrs. Colt, a pillar of the Episcopal Church, left the house as a residence for clergy widows and laywomen.
A series of environments recreate Armsmear's library, reception room and observatory with original furnishings. Foremost among the reconstructive spaces is Mrs. Colt's picture gallery, featuring 30 paintings by American and European artists.
Mrs. Colt turned to the painter Frederic Church -- a Hartford neighbor -- for advice on planning the gallery. Church's own brooding landscape, "Vale of St. Thomas, Jamaica" holds center stage, along with Albert Bierstadt's misty canvas "In the Yosemite."
Central to the exhibition is the extensive section devoted to Colt's revolvers. His repeating revolver was patented in 1836, then became "the gun that won the West" and the key to his success.
"It was the perfect climate to make a fortune making guns," said Mr. Hosley. The mid-19th century, with its wars and rebellions in the United States and in Europe, and the new wealth and leisure that popularized target shooting and hunting, meant "Guns, far from being stigmatized, emerged as symbols of progress during that time."
Correspondence and gifts from high-placed admirers of Colt's firearms -- the Czars of Russia, the Sultan of Turkey, leaders of nationalist uprisings in Italy, Hungary and France -- are on display along with jewels, porcelains, fine glass and antique furnishings purchased during the couple's six-month bridal tour of Europe and Mrs. Colt's extensive later travels with her son Caldwell.
One of the most intriguing sections of the show documents Samuel Colt's devotion to the legendary Charter Oak. The centuries-old tree, said to have been the hiding place of Connecticut's Colonial charter when the British wanted to revoke it in 1687, was felled by a storm on Aug. 21, 1856.
"Colt wrapped himself and his enterprise in the mantle of the sacred tree," Mr. Hosley related. "He summoned the company band to play dirges and patriotic hymns at the site of 'aged monarch of the forest.' "
He also purchased much of the wood and had it carved into myriad objects, including an intricately carved, canoe-shaped cradle -- Colt claimed he was a man who could "paddle his own canoe" -- made for Sam Jr., embellished with the heads of eight colts and two rampant colt finials. Another eccentric work is an ornate chair carved for the Mayor of Hartford, bought by Samuel Colt when the common council balked at paying the bill.
"Sam and Elizabeth Colt were individuals driven to action by personal ambition, civic pride and a need for worldly and spiritual rewards," said Mr. Hosley. "Together, they helped transform the culture and economy of a community that, a century later, is grappling with the legacy of industrialization and a history of dependence on arms manufacturing."
"Sam and Elizabeth," at the Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, Hartford, until March 9, 1997. Tues.-Sun., 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., $8, discounts for senior citizens and students; children under 6 and museum members free.

HEADLINE: Helping Wineries Grow the Best Grapes

BYLINE: By MERYL SPIEGEL 

 BODY:
AS the Long Island wine harvest rolls into full gear, with the 17 or so wineries pulling their grapes for the 1996 vintage, Alice Wise, a small sturdy woman, is patrolling a two-acre vineyard in Riverhead, picking grapes by hand for her own special cellar, a basement winery the size of a large, walk-in closet.
Ms. Wise is not pressing grapes for a profit nor is she a home wine maker concocting her own blend. She is a viticultural specialist employed by Cornell Cooperative Extension at the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory, a 70-acre farm devoted exclusively to the study of vegetables, fruits and flowers grown in the region. 
 She is trying to determine which grape varieties will thrive best on Long Island, given its climate, soil and limited growing season. Her primary mission is to discover which ones can produce at least three tons of high quality grapes an acre.
"We can't have vines that produce one ton an acre," she said. "Even though they may be great in fruit quality, they don't pay the bills."
In France, where a bottle of wine could sell for $150 or $300, yield is not that critical, she added. "However, in the United States, especially on Long Island, taxes are high, labor is high, and there is a certain economic yield that you need to function as a business."
While Ms. Wise spends some time studying grapevine disease and pest management, most of her attention is devoted to pinpointing which varieties will grow best on Long Island. In fact, on a shoestring budget, she is providing the 20-year-old industry -- now believed to be grossing about $15 million a year -- with the only viticultural research specific to the area.
Every important wine region -- upstate New York, California, France -- has large, well-financed research programs because the data regarding one region is not applicable to another, according to Richard Olsen-Harbich, the wine maker at Jamesport Vineyards.
"What a chardonnay does on Long Island is very different than what it does in California or Upstate New York," said Dr. Herodotus Damianos, owner of Pindar Vineyards in Peconic, the largest in the region, and Duck Walk Vineyards in Water Mill, adding that the young industry lacked the resources of a major research institution.
While Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County pays Ms. Wise's full-time salary, she receives funds each year from the New York State Agricultural Experimental Station in Geneva to cover certain fixed expenses. For the last two years, the annual appropriation was $11,000, down from $15,000 in 1994, according to James Hunter, director of the station.
All funds necessary to support the research vineyard and other grape-related projects -- amounting to $10,000 a year -- must be "pieced together" through grants and corporate work, Ms. Wise said.
Mr. Hunter said in a phone interview that funds for the program were cut, because his budget, amounting to $10 million this year, had been cut $3.5 million over seven years. And since support for agricultural research is "so hard to come by," he said, "the private sector is going to have to help." Its future, he added, will depend on a partnership with private industry, state and Federal governments and universities with agricultural programs.
Mr. Olsen-Harbich of Jamesport Vineyards asserted that a major wine-growing region could not rely on private enterprise for research and development because there was "too much self-interest" at stake. And because the wine industry provides "one of the only viable types of agriculture" that can preserve farm land and promote tourism on the East End, he said there should be more financial support from government agencies.
In fact, the local industry is starting to pitch in. A number of vineyard owners, managers and wine makers have formed the Grape Research Advisory Committee to organize fund-raising events to sustain Ms. Wise's research.
Ursula Masoud, co-owner of Paumanok Vineyards in Aquebogue and a member of the fund-raising committee, said: "We have to keep it going in order to establish a database that everyone can draw from." And since the "state is in a squeeze, we must look for additional sources of funding and industry members have to play a role."
The committee's first event will be on Oct. 25 at Macari Vineyards in Mattituck. Through a $25 admission price and a cash raffle, Ms. Wise is hoping that the event will raise $5,000 to supplement her 1997 budget.
Those who attend will get the chance to taste the first wines produced from the vineyard's harvest last fall. They will include three chardonnays, a merlot, a cabernet sauvignon, a pinot noir and a dornfelder. "These are research wines meant to show members of the industry what different clones and varieties might taste like as wine,"Ms. Wise explained.
As a result of a tasting of dornfelder last April, Joseph Macari, owner of the new Macari Vineyards, said he planned to plant two acres of the German vine next year. If it wasn't for Ms. Wise, Mr. Macari said that neither he nor his new wine maker from Napa would have been exposed to the dark red variety that is "good for blending." An advantage of dornfelder, he added, is that it is an "early red" that ripens before the whites, allowing the grower to start harvesting sooner.
The motivating force behind the vineyard project was a survey of Long Island vintners taken by Ms. Wise in 1991 asking them what kind of grape and wine research they needed. "The majority of respondents said that clone research was what they wanted most," she said.
"Clones are like strains or different types of the same variety," Ms. Wise explained. For instance, she grows 14 clones of chardonnay in her vineyard and sees slight differences between them. "I see variation in how the vines grow, in cluster size and shape, and in how they taste even though they all taste like chardonnay."
Ms. Wise explained that a clone is discovered when a researcher notices that, for instance, one chardonnay vine looks or tastes or is behaving differently from the vine next to it, or the chardonnay in one vineyard is exhibiting a different character from the one in the vineyard next door. The researcher then selects out the clone, tests it and if the vine is, in fact, a different strain, the plant may be released to nurseries, where the new clone is propagated and then sold to grape growers.
Five years ago, Ms. Wise, previously a fruit specialist at the farm, was assigned to head the grape and wine research program in 1991. Within a year, she planted the research vineyard where she is currently growing 33 grape varieties and will produce small lots of wine from 15 this year -- 8 chardonnays, 4 merlots and 3 other reds grown in Europe, dornfelder and lemberger from Germany and gamay from the Burgundy region of France.
Several North Fork vintners interviewed said they had learned about new wine making possibilities through tastings of the research wines and often consulted with Ms. Wise by phone or in the field about pest and disease control. Charles Masoud, co-owner of Paumonok Vineyard and president of the Long Island Wine Council, said that in the past, growers had to test varieties on their own and wait five years for the results.
Now, Long Island vintners can go to the research vineyard and "shop before they buy."
"It's a luxury for us," he said. "It shortens the path in a competitive worldwide wine market and gets you where you want to go faster."
Last year the Wine Council donated $1,000 to Ms. Wise's research, Mr. Masoud said. People in the industry have also contributed wine bottles, corks, yeast, trellis posts and wires, fertilizer and other vineyard supplies.
Since this is just her second year producing wine from the vineyard, Ms. Wise does not expect the impact of her research to take hold for several years. Mainly, it is "investment for the future" and most useful for vintners establishing a new vineyard, expanding or replacing their plantings, or are diversifying their product line, she said.
Among the many grapes not pressed into wine, Ms. Wise is experimenting with growing several varieties not found on Long Island -- such as zinfandel and petit sirah from California and nebiolo, barbera and trebbiano toscano from Italy. If some perform well, she is hoping local vintners may find "niche markets" for them.
"We basically know that we can do chardonnay well, we do a pretty good job with merlot, we know that most years we do a pretty good job with cabernet sauvignon and beyond that it drops off quickly," she said.
However, a few wineries do make riesling, sauvignon blanc and gerwurztraminer, she added. "I think as we mature as an industry, finding market niches and having something that is a little different than your neighbor is going to be important."
Commenting on this year's harvest, she said that although August was "reasonably dry," the cool, rainy weather in July has produced grapes that "are pretty big" and are going to present a challenge.
"We live for warm, dry seasons on Long Island. When you have real ripe, real luscious fruit, it is almost like the wine makes itself," she added.
Varieties that ripen later in the season, such as cabernet sauvignon, are going to be especially "tough" this year because of a lack of sun, Ms. Wise said. "People are going to let it hang and let it hang to get to the point where they feel it is as ripe as it can be."
Ms. Wise developed "a casual interest in wine," she said, while working as waitress in college and later earned a master's degree in pomology (fruit science) from Cornell University. However, she said that training her taste buds to detect the subtleties between grapes came from on-the-job training.
"Part of being in the wine industry is actually going out into the vineyard and tasting the fruit because that is how you gauge the harvest, the appearance, the taste and texture. . When fruit starts to break down, it gets a little more mealy and the seeds get brown inside. It's real important to look and taste and feel these things in your mouth," she said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Hope Candidates Ride Coattails

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
TWO years after a national conservative tide swept Long Island Republicans to an additional seat in Congress, Democrats are encouraged by a more moderate mood among voters that they feel will enable them to recover lost ground on Nov. 5.
With President Clinton holding a wide lead in Nassau and Suffolk Counties over Bob Dole, according to several polls, the Democrats say they expect Mr. Clinton's coattails to improve Congressional candidates' prospects. 
 But political professionals said even if Mr. Dole closed the gap, the chances of victory are excellent for two Democrats, Carolyn McCarthy in the 4th Congressional District and Nora L. Bredes in the 1st. Republicans disagreed.
Also of interest is a spirited, some say nasty, race involving Gary Ackerman, Democrat, against Grant M. Lally, Republican of Oyster Bay, who is mounting a second challenge for the seat.
Ms. Bredes is seeking to recover a seat that Democrats had until two years ago and one that they have held more often than Republicans for 30 years. The incumbent is Michael P. Forbes.
"The furrow has been plowed in that area," the Suffolk Democratic leader, Dominic J. Baranello, said. "We anticipate Bredes is going to win on her own. All our surveys show her doing exceedingly well."
The district, by far the largest geographically on the Island, includes the five East End towns and parts of Brookhaven and Smithtown.
Republicans say they are concerned that expectations of Clinton landslides in New York and nationally will keep Republicans from voting. Political analysts have said the Dole campaign has virtually written off New York. But Republicans said they expected all four Republican incumbents from the Island to withstand challenges and win re-election.
"Our surveys indicate our candidates are in good shape," a spokesman for the Suffolk Republican Party, Alan Eysen, said. "Now it's up to the Republican voters to get out there and vote."
Rick A. Lazio appears to be comfortably ahead of Kenneth J. Herman in the 2d District, on the South Shore. Even some Democrats privately acknowledged that the seat was safe for Mr. Lazio.
In the 3d District, Peter T. King also appears to be leading. His opponent, Dal A. LaMagna, tells voters that his name "rhymes with lasanga" in an effort to build recognition.
In races that appear to be closer, Ms. Bredes and Mrs. McCarthy are trying to defeat freshmen who are closely associated with House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mrs. McCarthy, a political neophyte and a registered Republican until she switched parties to run against Daniel Frisa, has gained national attention in a crusade to advance gun control. Her husband, Dennis, was slain and her son Kevin was wounded by Colin Ferguson, who fired a handgun on a Long Island Rail Road train three years ago.
In the 1st District, Ms. Bredes, a Suffolk County Legislator who started in politics as an opponent of the Shoreham nuclear power plant, depicts Mr. Forbes as a tool of special interests whose votes have harmed working families.
Mr. Forbes, who defeated George J. Hochbrueckner in 1994, was widely seen as a major beneficiary of the Republican tide that year. He became an eager proponent of Mr. Gingrich's programs, including the Contract With America.
"Now that the poll numbers on Gingrich are so bad," Ms. Bredes said, "Forbes is not promoting his votes for the Contract With America. He is trying to disguise his support for Gingrich. But I don't think people will buy the disguise."
Ms. Bredes has gained backing from national Democrats who view her as crucial to regaining control of the House. "Nora Bredes has a record of service to the community," the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Donald L. Fowler, said at a campaign stop for Ms. Bredes. "Her opponent has a record of service to Newt Gingrich.
"The Republicans had a great opportunity to establish themselves as the controlling political force in this country and they simply blew it. They pursued a political agenda so far to the right involving such extremist measures that they took themselves right out of the middle."
Mr. Forbes said associating Republican candidates with Mr. Gingrich was "right out of the national Democratic playbook."
"Democrats are doing the exact same thing in every district," he added.
Mr. Forbes said many initiatives advanced by Mr. Gingrich had been usurped by Mr. Clinton, who then claimed credit for them. "Have the Democrats now succeeded in making Mr. Gingrich such an icon of evil that everyone is running away from him?" Mr. Forbes asked. "I'm not sure that is relevant in this campaign. If my opponent wants to run against him she should move to Georgia. Nobody is asking me how Newt Gingrich is doing on eastern Long Island."
Mr. Forbes said he had forged close ties to constituents with town meetings and forums on topics like breast cancer, aging and small business. "I am very visible and active in the district," he said. "I never moved to Washington."
"His votes in the 104th Congress," Ms. Bredes said, "have been votes to squash families, take health care away from seniors and cut educational support for children." She said Mr. Forbes had a weak record on environmental issues.
Some environmentalists have attacked Ms. Bredes, saying she ignored problems involving radioactive contamination at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton. Mr. Forbes said at a debate held by the Hampton Bays Civic Association that Ms. Bredes had received campaign contributions from top officials at the laboratory.
A write-in candidate, Lorna Salzman of the Peconic Green Party, said neither candidate had proposed measures "to deal with the vast radioactive contamination." Neither major party, Mrs. Salzman said, is "addressing the overriding political and economic problems of our nation." Those, she said, include "the growing gap between the rich and poor, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, the takeover by corporations of our public institutions and media and the growing incursions on our basic freedoms."
Ms. Bredes, a supporter of abortion rights, is backed by several women's groups, including the National Organization for Women.
Mr. Forbes, an abortion opponent who is also on the Right to Life line, said at the debate that Ms. Bredes's supporters were attacking him for being Roman Catholic, adding, "They said I was a tool of my Catholic religion, all because they don't like my pro-life stand."
Ms. Bredes's campaign said Mr. Forbes was trying to create a bogus issue.
Ms. Bredes said she expected to spend more than $250,000 in the race. Mr. Forbes said he would spend $400,000.
In the bizarrely shaped 5th District, which includes parts of Queens, the North Shore in Nassau and Huntington and Smithtown, Mr. Lally is again trying to unseat Mr. Ackerman, the sole Democrat whose district is partly or all on the Island.
In a campaign notable for its savagery, Mr. Lally, a lawyer, consistently refers to his opponent as "Dirty Gary Ackerman." He has called Mr. Ackerman a radical extremist; a corrupt politician; a flag defiler; a promoter of homosexual marriage; an advocate of illicit drug use whose motto is, "Just smoke it"; a receiver of campaign contributions from a union controlled by organized crime, a shameless political buffoon and a clown who did not even live in his district.
Mr. Ackerman, who was cast into the Long Island arena when the district, previously all in Queens, was reapportioned before the 1994 election, has acknowledged that his Queens home is a short distance outside the district. Publicly, he has taken the high road, telling constituents in a letter of his fight to "bring a sense of civility and moderation" to the 104th Congress. But his campaign manager, Alan Gershuny, described Mr. Lally last week as "an ultra-ultra conservative right-wing fanatic," a homophobe and an unashamed liar about Mr. Ackerman's votes and positions.
"Gary Ackerman happens to be a a moderate Democrat," Mr. Gershuny said. "I have never seen anything like the vileness of this man Lally. He is a disgrace and should never hold public office."
Mr. Lally said that he supported Mr. Dole's 15 percent tax cut as a good start and that he backed a version of the flat Federal income tax, cuts in the capital-gains tax and an end to inheritance taxes. Mr. Lally is also a strong supporter of capital punishment. Mr. Ackerman has voted against it. Both support legalized abortion, but Mr. Lally opposes Federal financing for it.
Mr. Ackerman's campaign has said Mr. Lally secretly orchestrated primary challenges to Mr. Ackerman's designations as the Democratic, Liberal and Independence Parties' candidate. "He tried to give us three primaries to make us expend our resources, but we caught his hand in the cookie jar," Mr. Gershuny said. "We threw them off the ballot."
The challenges were disallowed after Mr. Ackerman successfully objected to signatures on the nominating petitions. Mr. Gershuny said Mr. Lally was linked to a deputy Nassau County attorney who was charged this month with falsely notarizing signatures on a petition for a would-be challenger to Mr. Ackerman's Liberal designation.
Mr. Lally denied that, saying he took no part in working with the challengers. "It's more mud from dirty Gary Ackerman," he said.
About 40 percent of the voters are in Queens, where Democrats hold an enrollment edge. On Long Island, 25 percent are in Nassau and 35 in Suffolk.
Even the campaign photographs have been nasty. A photo on Lally literature shows the trademark white carnation Mr. Ackerman that wears on his lapel obscured by a hot dog roll in his hand. The roll, dripping with fixings, appears to be on its way to Mr. Ackerman's half-opened mouth. The portly Mr. Ackerman is bug-eyed in anticipation. Tufts of hair from his balding head sprout raffishly outward over his ears, adding to a clownish appearance.
Mr. Lally, composed, trim, youthful and with a full head of hair, smiles on an accompanying photo, the American flag draped behind him. "We have a real choice for a change," the caption says.
The unflattering photo was taken at a fund-raising event that featured delicatessen food from Queens, Mr. Ackerman's staff said.
Mr. Lally said the 1994 Ackerman campaign used a photo of Mr. Lally in commando garb, a photo that Mr. Lally said was taken at Halloween and later printed in an April Fool's publication at Georgetown University, where Mr. Lally earned a master's in international law.

How Seeds Get Around

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
HAVE you ever called the dog in from an afternoon's run in the meadow, only to find its fur matted with burdock? Or have you come in from a morning's weeding and found your trouser legs and shirt a mass of prickles?
These nuisances are nature's way of spreading seed. Seed has been designed with all sorts of hooks, barbs and sticky gels to provide a good hold on free transportation. If you're not careful in disposing of the nuisances, you may find unwanted plants in the garden next year. 
 Possibly the largest seed known belongs to the coconut. It is no small wonder that tropical beaches are festooned with rows of coconut palms. The seed floats where wind and wave take it, and it doesn't take much in the way of sand, rain and sunshine for coconut seeds to germinate.
By contrast, the tiniest seed, almost dustlike, belongs to the orchid family. It is almost impossible to see. Be careful to hold that sneeze when working around this seed.
Perhaps the first lesson about nature's distribution systems is learned in childhood by picking up a ripe dandelion puff and blowing on it. The seeds' small, silky hairs provide feathery parachutes, so a good wind or a good blow can send out for quite some distance.
Another childhood fascination with seeds involves the impatiens clan. No wonder it has acquired the name touch-me-not. The seedpods develop anytime after mid-August, and when touched, even slightly, the pods burst open and shoot out seeds. This is probably why jewel weed (a wild impatiens) seems to sprout everywhere. Animals, people, even a strong wind can jar the pods to spring open.
This seed dispersal method also explains why impatiens plants pop up each year in odd nooks and crannies. Sometimes these seedlings can be dug up carefully and transplanted to other sites for summer display.
Although witch hazels may not be as widespread as impatiens, their seed dispersal system is fascinating. The seed is cannonlike. When it is ripe, the seed capsule splits open and out shoots the hard black seed for quite some distance.
Some seed has a winged propeller. This is especially true for members of the maple family. The shade trees provide great entertainment in the spring, when the seed falls off the tree and comes down like a helicopter to land on the grass, in the flower border or vegetable patch. If the tasty seed is not consumed by birds or squirrels, it germinates and starts to grow, with the result that tiny maple trees sprout just about everywhere. If not pulled up promptly, some of the seedlings can get a deep roothold and soon become stubborn little trees.
Another tree with a propellerlike samara, or winged fruit, is the ash, which releases its clusters in late spring.
Probably one of the most delightful seedpods is the salt shaker type. Just tilt the pod, and out comes the seed. One of the first that comes to mind belongs to columbine. Although technically this plant is a biennial -- that is, it blooms every two years -- its steady supply of seed makes it seem more like a perennial. When the flowers have finished performing, the upright pods form, filling quickly with quantities of seed. When ripe, the pods split apart and the black seeds drop. Those who want to save the seed must watch the plants closely because it may be dispersed by nature before it can be gathered by the gardener.
Poppies have this salt shaker type of seedpod, too. Many a cook knows well the value of poppy seed for muffins and breads. Planting culinary seed would not be practical, however, as it is too aged for good germination.
SINCE so many types of seed are food for nature's creatures, they should be considered ecologically efficient in more than one way. Many birds feast on berries and, having ingested and gotten nutrients from the fruit, pass seed through the digestive tract and on to a germination site.
One of the prime squirrel foods is the tasty ripe red dogwood berry. And what about the squirrel's busy habit of burying acorns for the winter? Those they cannot scent out, find and eat in the winter may well sprout in the spring. The woods are thus blessed with oaks. Chipmunks can be good acorn planters, too, carrying as many as eight at one time.
Sometimes nature's creatures can't wait to feed. Ants don't. As soon as they find some seed, they transport it to their tunnels, often feeding on the aril covering and thus spreading the germination potential around. Bloodroot and cyclamen are two particularly fine plants that are dispersed in this way. It is another phenomenon that helps to explain how plants occur where they were not planted.
Although seed dispersal can sometimes be a nuisance, it is also a fine demonstration of the economical way nature spreads its bounty around.

Homework's Greatest Hits

 BODY:
For students, past and present: What was the best homework assignment you ever had to do? Or the worst? Why?

Believe It. Or Not.
The best assignment was a paper I did for Western Civilization I, my freshman year in college. The title was "Witch Craze versus Christianity." And we had to do it from an atheist's point of view.

Meeting Plato and Marx
The best? Reading a slender little paperback by George Soule titled "The Ideas of the Great Economists." It was a real rush, a turn-on to all the really interesting views of Plato, Veblen, Marx and the rest. I loved it so much I still have the very yellowed, well-thumbed little book to this day.

The best homework assignment I ever had was to watch "The Flintstones" and take notes on what they had that did not exist during the time period. It was probably also the worst, since the list took up nearly two pages!

HEADLINE: Eligibility Changes, Widening the Pool Of Potential Jurors

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
AS a lawyer, Neal Allen of Irvington is used to courtrooms. When he was recently summoned to the County Courthouse here for jury duty, however, the experience was disconcerting.
"They're very nice here in Westchester," said Mr. Allen, who had served on a Federal jury in Manhattan two years ago. "They want to make sure everyone knows what's going on. They try to make it very user friendly. But you sit and wait. Most people were picked for a panel by the morning. Forty of us were held over until the afternoon. I got called at 3 P.M. I knew the judge in the case, so when he asked if anyone knew anybody connected with the case I said, Yes, I knew him. The judge told me to 'get out of here.' " 
 Like Mr. Allen, many people who had previously been exempt from jury duty by virtue of their occupation, age or status are finding jury service notices in their mailboxes.
Since Jan. 1, 17 groups that had been entitled to automatic exemptions, including medical doctors, lawyers, members of the clergy, mothers of young children, people older than 70, firefighters and police officers, have become eligible for jury duty. Welfare recipients and people receiving unemployment compensation have also been added to the pool of potential jurors. Nearly 38,000 county residents have received notices since January.
At a recent orientation session for a prospective jurors, a video addressed jurors' concerns and promoted a civics lesson on the importance of jury service. Justice W. Denis Donovan of State Supreme Court described cases he had presided over in which doctors, police officers, priests, nuns, rabbis and lawyers had served as jurors. Justice Donovan said that even he had been called for jury duty a few months ago.
While celebrities like the actor Richard Gere, the Knicks basketball player Charles Oakley and Judith S. Kaye, Chief Judge of the State of New York, have been the center of news attention when they have been called for jury duty, the ordinary juror has felt the effects of reforms the most.
Instead of showing up every day for two weeks or so, jurors now call the courthouse to find out when they will next be needed. They are also required to serve only once every four years instead of once every two years.
But such changes do not mitigate the frustration and resentment many jurors still feel at having their daily lives disrupted.
Patricia Cutaia, a prospective juror waiting in the central selection room, is a social studies teacher at White Plains High School and the mother of a 14-year-old and a 10-year-old.
"The child care does not coincide," she said. "My husband is coming home from work early today to take care of our children. One child is missing an after-school activity today. It's still difficult when you have children. This is a dilemma. We want to be good citizens, and this is exactly what we teach. You need to have people for the jury system to work. But I'm not very happy."
For Beverly Kissel, a full-time mother of three who was called for jury duty last winter but had her service postponed until July when her children were in camp, the experience was sobering.
"I came with my youngest child's birth certificate, but there never was a time to give any reasons why you shouldn't be there," Mrs. Kissel said, expressing disappointment that there was no time for her to present the documents.
"They sent me to a panel, and I wasn't picked. But it was clear that they weren't taking any excuses."
For those who work in the judicial system, the changes are palpable. "I find far fewer people who've had previous jury-selection experience," said Gerald E. Loehr, a personal injury lawyer who practices in Westchester and Rockland Counties and New York City. In recent trials, Mr. Loehr has put a police officer on an auto accident case and a psychiatrist on another panel.
"I find the jurors are more willing to serve," he continued. "The fact that it's more efficient has a positive impact to all the parties in a lawsuit. It's a whole new ballgame."
Westchester's District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, said: "There's no question that the jury pools are more representative of the society at large. We're getting juries in less time, and as a former judge, I can tell you that saves an enormous amount of time. I personally can't wait to get on a jury, and I look forward to getting called for jury duty."
Although there are no statistics on how many previously exempted jurors now serve, the Commissioner of Jurors, Frances Tursi, said, "Doctors are being selected, and detectives are sitting on cases."
Still, there are some skeptics who think that the much publicized changes are window dressing and that being called for jury duty does not necessarily translate into actually sitting on a jury. A White Plains lawyer, Barry G., who agreed to comment only on condition of anonymity, said: "I was in a jury pool, but when I got into the box, I was knocked out. I guess most lawyers get bounced."
Mr. Allen, the Irvington lawyer, added: "It's very difficult for me to be picked for any jury. It's a waste of time for me. It may be hard for a lawyer who sits on a jury to take off his 'lawyer hat.' There's a legitimate effort to make more people part of the jury process, but now it's too global. There are valid reasons why certain people were exempt in the past. Certain people should be exempt."

HEADLINE: Pealing Bells, Bach to Madonna

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE 

 BODY:
THE tryouts are rigorous: Two months of intensive training, then the first cut, and finally, the selection. Those who make it have to have outstanding hand-eye and foot-eye coordination. They must be aerobically fit and unafraid of heights. And they must read music.
The Yale University Guild of Carilloneurs, which has 25 undergraduate members, last year trained 60 aspiring bell ringers, auditioned 24 and took 7, said Matthew Gubens, a Yale senior and former chairman of the guild. 
 So what's the big deal?
To ring the bells, of course. To play for all the campus to hear. To play Bach, traditional songs of Yale, "The Star-Spangled Banner" and Pearl Jam.
Uh, Pearl Jam? As in heavy metal?
Yes indeed, said Mr. Gubens. A half-hour program might range from Beethoven to the 18th-century carillon composer van den Gheyn to Madonna.
"I like the Simon and Garfunkel," said Alice Ko, a junior on her way to class recently. "It's a bit charming, the contemporary pop."
Earlier this fall, students changed classes to the beat of "The People in Your Neighborhood," a staple from the Sesame Street songbook.
"We can practice for hours on a classic. It's the simple Sesame Street theme song that people remark on," said Mr. Gubens.
The 54-bell Yale Memorial Carillon is housed in the 206-foot Gothic-style Harkness Tower, the centerpiece of Branford College. "For a lot of people, the allure is the tower," said Mr. Gubens. "But as they continue their training, they realize the instrument is an incredible thing to play."
"It's so expressive," he continued. "With seven tons in the lowest bell, you can get such fortissimo -- but there's such a dynamic range -- the smallest bell being about 23 pounds. That's a lot of dynamic capacity."
How the bells are rung adds to the tower's mystique. Do the students of this guild don brown hooded robes, climb more than 100 pie-wedge spiral steps to the belfry and leap up to pull down on their designated ropes in perfect order? No. It's a one-person band, actually.
Two visitors -- one lugging very heavy camera equipment and the other with no excuse whatsoever -- breathlessly followed Mr. Gubens up into Harkness Tower for his half-hour shift beginning at 12:45. The group made it to the fifth story, where the guild has its office. Chatting away and with one eye on the clock, Mr. Gubens went into the files and selected his sheet music for the ring.
A massive console resembling an organ with a long bench sat to one side, a Disney Quasimodo doll dangling above the keyboard. Mr. Gubens breezed past it and headed for yet another spiral staircase. "That's what we practice on," he said, disappearing through the ceiling.
The ascent was eight stories when all was said and done. Coming out of the staircase and into the belfry and daylight, the visitors confronted the bells -- from the enormous, lowest-pitched ones to the highest-pitched ones at the top. Underneath the rows of bronze stood a cabin where the console was housed and that protected it and the carillonneurs from the elements. ("You can see your breath in the winter," Mr. Gubens said.)
Mr. Gubens spread the music out, adjusted the hydraulic bench to his comfort level, and started off with the traditional Westminster Chimes.
Launching into a difficult piece by Ronald Barnes, Mr. Gubens, with clenched fists, stroked, pounded and pressed the batons, each of which is connected by a cable that pulls the clapper to the side of the bell. ("I can't move seven tons," he said.)
At the same time, his sneakered feet worked the batons for the lowest bells. The ethics-politics and economics major, who is preparing for medical school, tore through the runs of sixteenth notes with fists flying, sliding up and down the oak bench. It was an athletic event.
"When you play a wrong note the whole campus hears," he said between pieces.
Next came Purcell's Trumpet Voluntary: most wedding-goers would recognize the the stately Baroque work. Then Mr. Gubens lightened things up with the Sesame Street excerpt. For a touch of Ivy, he played Yale's alma mater, "Bright College Years," followed by the National Anthem. Oh yes, and the hour: One.
"We really are given total latitude over the repertoire," he said, gathering up his music. "We have a vast library in the tower. It's up to the carillonneur. Sometimes we get requests. We even have a web page. We get requests through there -- from across the world."
According to the university, the first 10 bells were installed in 1921, a gift of Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness, who stipulated that they be played four times daily by the university organist. In 1948 the Guild of Yale University Bell Ringers was founded by Elliott Kone ('49), and students have played the carillon ever since. A gift of 44 more bells was made in 1966 by Florence S. Marcy Crofut. All the bells were cast by the English bell foundry John Taylor & Company, which has been in existence since the 15th century.
Guild members ring on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:45 P.M., on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and weekends at 12:30 P.M., and every evening at 5. In the summer there is a concert series that features guest carillonneurs. The guild, which offers music for holidays and Yale sports events, will also play for weddings. To raise money for their recent trip to Belgium and the Netherlands to study with master carillonneurs, the guild took requests on Valentine's Day.
"On Halloween we have a special ring at 11 P.M. We cover the tower lights with gels, and we ring the hour 13 times. We play everything from the Funeral March to Caspar the Friendly Ghost," Mr. Gubens said.
During the summer months, while other students were waiting tables on Cape Cod or teaching tennis, Mr. Gubens landed a job as summer carillonneur at St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. As a senior, he realizes that his ringing days are coming to an end, just like a collegiate athlete's: "That's the sad thing about it. You can't take it with you."

HEADLINE: A Dog Track's Woes Added to a City's

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN the $30 million Shoreline Star greyhound race track opened in Bridgeport last fall after years of anticipation and amid considerable hyperbole, city and business leaders predicted it would attract large crowds and help spark an economic recovery in the deteriorating city.
But everything seemed to go wrong. Proposals for a nearby casino, as well as slot machines for the state's dog tracks and jai alai frontons, were turned down by the legislature, the crowds never materialized and the betting never set much of a pace. 
 Nearly a year later, even the dogs are scarcer -- the number of kennels at the track has dropped from 19 to fewer than 10. Performances have also been scaled back to five from the original eight, and there is no longer Friday evening racing.
The track has had financial problems ever since it opened, not coming close to the revenue projections of $60 million a year; state projections for the track are now about $14 million annually.
"I don't see how they're even managing to stay open anymore, they take in a lot more revenue from simulcast wagering than from on-track betting and that's a very bad sign," said John Ewaski, associate accountant in the State Division of Special Revenue.
Mr. Ewaski noted that when Shoreline opened last November, on-track wagers averaged $60,207 a performance covering 38 cards and for the month totaled nearly $2.3 million. During August the average had dropped to $41,888, covering 23 performances for a total of $963,435.
The handles -- which have hovered around $40,000 per performance -- are far below the original projections of $100,000 to $150,000.
And during the past few months a series of setbacks at the track has Shoreline employees and state officials predicting that it will close down by the end of the year. Among the setbacks are the following:
* The track's owners, led by the lawyer and entrepreneur A. Robert Zeff, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection several months ago, claiming the track had $33 million in liabilities and $22 million in assets.
* Contractors filed more than $2.2 million in liens against the track.
* The track's general manager, Jim Gartland, and several kennel operators left the operation.
* Layoffs reduced the original 600-worker total to 240.
* And the State Organized Crime Investigative Task Force began an investigation into Mr. Zeff's relationship with the former chairman of the State Gaming Board.
Mr. Muska, vice president for student and external affairs at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, resigned from the Gaming Board in April after it was disclosed that he had gone to Las Vegas with Mr. Zeff on the same day the state board voted to waive a background check on Mr. Zeff.
Mr. Zeff did not return calls for comment and Mr. Muska declined to comment.
Despite the off-track problems and diminishing crowds, the track's new general manager, Steve Alford, insists Shoreline Star will remain open.
"I compare our situation to a boxer taking all the hits, but still standing and determined to find a way to win the fight," said Mr. Alford, who replaced Mr. Gartland in July. "I still think we're going to turn this around, and by reducing our overhead and getting the creditors off our backs with the bankruptcy, we're starting to see some positive results. We're not that far now from breaking even."
Mr. Alford, who refused to comment about the state investigation into Mr. Zeff's activities, acknowledged that better planning and management during the track's opening last November might have made a difference. Mr. Alford, as director of racing, was second in command to Mr. Gartland when the track opened.
"We know we made some mistakes, probably opening at the worst time of the year and bringing in kennel operators expecting a much bigger return on their investments than was realistic," he said. "But we scaled things down and I think it's starting to pay off."
Gov. John G. Rowland ordered the investigation into Mr. Zeff and Mr. Muska's relationship, and in late June Mr. Zeff was arrested and charged with interfering with an investigation and destroying evidence after attempting to throw bags of audio tapes over a fence at his Westport home. In July, Mr. Zeff was arraigned on the charges and pleaded not guilty.
"The investigation is still ongoing, but we're not at liberty to release any information at this time," said Sgt. Dale Hourigan, a spokesman for the State Police. "All I can say is that it's a very in-depth and complex investigation that is going to take some time to complete."
Despite the problems, some kennel operators are hoping the track can survive. "We're willing to stick it out as long as they are and I hope they can turn things around," said Peter Laporte, owner of Delamack Kennels, which has 270 greyhounds in several places, including Bridgeport.
"Some of the big name kennels from out of state had to bail out because their overhead was too high and they were losing money," said Mr. Laporte. "But we've been operating in Connecticut since 1991 and there's far less of a risk for us."
Some regular bettors at the track said they liked Shoreline, and were hoping for a miracle recovery.
"It's a nice track, but the worst part is getting here, you've got to worry about being robbed, mugged or carjacked," said a patron, Nick DeLucca. The track is in the East End neighborhood, long known as an area of drug trafficking and crime.
Margaret Marzocchi, of Yonkers, said she goes to the track about once a week, but agreed the neighborhood keeps a lot of potential bettors away.
"It's really a shame, this is a nice track and clean building, but there's nobody here and I think it's mostly because of the neighborhood," said Ms. Marzocchi, who has been betting on the dogs for more than 20 years. "But with turnouts like this, I don't see how they can stay open much longer."
Neither do the employees.
"Every day we wonder how much longer this can go on, how much longer they can survive," said Millie Heyden, a 15-year veteran parimutuel clerk, "It's almost as though people are looking forward to getting laid off so they don't have to worry about it anymore."
Ms. Heyden said that on a good afternoon she would take in more than $2,000, but that on this particular day she was barely over $400.
"Morale here is terrible," she said. "People like me remember the days when this place was a fronton, and things were really hopping all the time. It's really kind of sad."
Jack Schwarzkopf, a parimutuel clerk for 20 years, said the State Assembly's failure to approve a casino in Bridgeport earlier this year pretty much sealed the dog track's fate.
"If a casino were right down the road, this place would be booming," said Mr. Schwarzkopf, who also blamed mismanagement, the decaying neighborhood and bad timing of the opening as contributing factors for the track's decline.
"They opened in November, the worst time of year to open a track like this," he said. "And by this November, I think it will be closed . . . at least as a dog track."
Mr. Schwarzkopf and other employees speculated that the building could remain open as a simulcast center, which has done considerably better than the dog track. Dog and horse racing simulcast for bettors are beamed on large screens and televisions around the building.
Some bettors said they expect the dog track to close, but will continue to wager there as long as it stays open.
"If it closes it closes, there's nothing I can do about that," said Leon Saunders, a twice-weekly patron who lives in Bridgeport. "Yeah I'll miss it. I've had some real good days here . . . but as long as it stays open I'll keep coming.
"If I want to bet on the dogs, where else am I going to go?"

HEADLINE: 'GIANT';
The Code of the West: Big Sky, Big Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I hesitate to argue with an author who understands West Texas ranch life as exquisitely as does Larry McMurtry, but I found myself disagreeing with his recent appraisal of the changes in that life style since James Dean and company brought Ferber's "Giant" to the Texas high country ["Men Swaggered, Women Warred, Oil Flowed," Sept. 29]. 
 Mr. McMurtry is sensitive to the changes in the oil industry, yet he misses the fact that West Texas ranching remains bound to, even possessed by, a land unchanged and unrelenting. The land continues to mock efforts to develop it, to fence it, even to manage it, and the code that governs daily life is surprisingly unchanged from my childhood. Houston and Dallas are a long way east, both geographically and economically, of the Pecos. West of the Pecos, the land remains master, and the economics of staggering mineral-rights leases still exist, as do the politics of possession that most often govern family and race relations.
As a young ranch wife, I often rose at 3:30 in the morning to cook for as many as 23 cowboys and illegal aliens so they could be off to roundup before the sun hit the desert. I now teach at a Midwestern university. Each time I return to West Texas, I am surprised at how the people of that country continue to hold to the heritage of the old West.
John Sayles's recent film "Lone Star" astutely represents the complexity of border politics these 40 years after "Giant." Two more wars, multiculturalism, technological innovations, immigration debates and economic diversification have brought only surface changes. The code of West Texas remains, as always, determined by the vastness of big sky, big ranching operations and big money.

And this year's Marie Antoinette award for humane solutions to real-life problems goes to Louis Menand for his suggestion that we can alleviate the suffering of unemployed academics by diluting the requirements for the Ph.D. and giving it to virtually everyone, thereby unleashing thousands more job seekers onto a now thoroughly saturated market ("How to Make a Ph.D. Matter," Sept. 22).

AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE
Fighting for Economic Security and Social Justice.
By John J. Sweeney with David Kusnet.
Houghton Mifflin, $18.95.
This short book might have been called "Something's Rotten in the U.S.A." Although he covers familiar territory, John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., makes a powerful case that something is badly awry as he describes how wages are losing the race to inflation and corporations have cavalierly downsized thousands of loyal workers out of their jobs -- all while corporate profits, stock prices and executive pay have soared. His prescription: millions more Americans should join unions, a step he says will give dispirited workers leverage to win higher pay and a real say in running their workplaces. Mr. Sweeney dreams that rebuilding the labor movement will restore a long-lost sense of community in the United States -- the sense of community he felt when as a boy in the Bronx he attended his bus-driver father's union meetings. (It is regrettable there aren't more such autobiographical and introspective touches.) He rightly lambastes unions for neglecting to organize workers, but he inexplicably ignores one of labor's chief problems: corruption. Perhaps that should be expected from what is essentially a tract to rally people to the union banner. Steven Greenhouse

The Off Season in the Hamptons Is Getting Busy

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
THE four-bedroom, fully furnished period house that Stephen R. Steinberg has rented for $1,200 a month since Sept. 15 in the center of Bridgehampton commands roughly $15,000 a month for the summer season.
While Mr. Steinberg's rent is less than a tenth of what his landlord charges during the summer season, which runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day, there is a catch. By May 1, he and his dog, a Chinese Shar-Pei named Wrigley, will have to find other accommodations or be prepared to stay for the summer at the much higher rate. But he is not worried, Mr. Steinberg said. 
 By then, he will know whether the law practice he opened in Sag Harbor last May after working many years as a litigator for the Manhattan office of the Fulbright & Jaworski law firm, will be successful. If the answer is yes, he expects to buy a house. If not, he will move elsewhere, he said.
The other season in the Hamptons -- generally from mid-September to mid-May -- has just begun, and brokers and owners say they see a growing market for winter rentals.
"The Hamptons, more and more, are becoming a year-round community," said Susan Green, a broker with the Bridgehampton office of the Braverman Newbold Brennan real estate agency, who found Mr. Steinberg his house.
Some people, like Mr. Steinberg, want to sample the off season before making the commitment to buy a house. Others come out to savor the peace and quiet of the winter months. Still others see this as an opportune time to find a relatively inexpensive weekend retreat, one they might not be able to afford during the summer.
Another of Mrs. Green's customers, a commercial loan officer for a Manhattan bank who asked that her name not be used, together with a friend is paying $30,000 for an eight-and-a-half month rental that started Sept. 15.
They come out each weekend to the four-bedroom, three-bath house in Sagaponack. It is one block from the ocean and has an ocean view. It rented last summer for $70,000.
"There are a number of reasons I like to go to the Hamptons in the fall, spring and even winter," said the woman, who lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side. "It's mostly peace of mind because, although summers are beautiful, they are hectic, and the winter season is much more subdued and it's very relaxing."
Rents generally range from $1,000 to $3,000 monthly based on the full winter season, but can go as high as $10,000 monthly, according to brokers.
"The days when an owner was happy to get someone to occupy the house just to keep the heat on and water the plants are over," said Joseph Horstmann, owner of the Main Street Properties real estate agency in East Hampton.
BROKERS usually charge the owners 10 percent of the gross rental. Winter renters must take into account that heating bills could add substantially to the amount they pay.
Nevertheless, the thought of having a cozy country retreat with logs crackling in the fireplace and being able to walk on empty beaches is starting to rival the attractions of the private pool and sunbathing, brokers say.
"I've been in this business 12 years, and when I first started, there were lots of winter rentals, they were very inexpensive, and not many people were interested," said Peter L. Hallock, president of the Allan M. Schneider & Associates real estate agency, whose main office is in East Hampton.
"Now it is the absolute opposite. There are very few rentals available, and people really want to be here. And although prices are creeping up, winter rentals are still our best-kept secret."
Frank E. Newbold, a partner of the Braverman Newbold Brennan agency, whose East Hampton office handles about 40 winter rentals a year, gave as an example a 4,500-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bath oceanfront contemporary with three fireplaces.
The house is in Bridgehampton and is on the market for $3.2 million. It is available over the winter for a monthly rental of $3,000. The rent for the Memorial-Day-to-Labor-Day summer season is $150,000.
The winter rentals most in demand are houses further inland, Mr. Newbold said. "In the summertime, people want to be on the beach in something open and airy," he said. "In winter, they want to be snug and cozy and prefer to be in a village. And a fireplace is a must."
Among his other listings is a two-bedroom farmhouse in Wainscott overlooking farm fields but within walking distance of the ocean. ("Perfect for sitting by the fireplace, holding hands and watching the sunset," he said.)
The rent -- $20,000 for the summer -- is $1,000 a month over the winter.
Another listing is a 19th-century Victorian in the center of East Hampton with four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a fireplace on an acre of property that is available for $890 a month.
The winter season is often the time when people who had rented for the summer are looking around for something to buy, so they rent for the winter while they search for a property. Or they rent while they wait for their house to be built.
The rental market has been extremely strong overall this year, said Harold F. Shepherd, an East Hampton broker, and this is helping to fuel the winter rental market. "A lot of people who rent over the winter can't really afford the summer prices," he said.
AT one time, Bob Bubka of East Hampton said, he would close up the two-bedroom cottage he owns near the beach in Amagansett over the winter. It rents for $16,000 for the summer. It was rented this winter for $700 a month as soon as he put it on the market, he said.
"What really attracts the winter renter is the solitude, and even though the ocean isn't swimmable, when there is snow on the beach it's magnificent to look at," he said.
Cynthia Barrett, a bond saleswoman, and her husband, John, a writer, own a three-bedroom postmodern house on 2.2 acres in Sagaponack that is available year-round. They want $22,500 for the summer season, and $1,300 monthly over the winter.
A similar house would sell for $350,000 to $400,000, Mrs. Barrett said. "So even if someone wants a year-round house without the headaches of ownership, it becomes quite economical," she added.
Weekly or even monthly rentals, however, are seldom available over the winter. Pipes have to be drained and the house must be properly winterized, said Ernest Schade, owner of Robertson Realty in Sag Harbor. "If all the owner gets is a month's rental, they might as well shut the house down," he said.
Nevertheless, David Pearlberg of Manhattan said he was pursuing his dream of spending the Thanksgiving holidays in the East Hampton-Bridgehampton area. Steve Corwin, a sales associate for Main Street Properties in East Hampton, has been working with him to locate the right property.
"I rent a house over the summer in the Hamptons, but this is the first year that we are thinking of spending the holidays there," said Mr. Pearlberg, who with a partner, Jackie Himelhoch, owns a cafe, Eureka Joe, on lower Fifth Avenue.
Each year, he, his mother and his sister try to come up with an intriguing way to celebrate the holidays, he said.
Last year, they treated themselves to dinner at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
"I suggested that this year a house in the Hamptons with a fireplace would be a nice idea," he said. "Something that is cozy and woodsy."
Ideally, the house will have four bedrooms, because friends will join them, and preferably it will have a country setting.
What they are finding is that a week's rent is somewhat more costly than they had thought, with asking prices in the $3,000 range.
"But for people from the city, the idea is so appealing," Mr. Pearlberg said. "Just having new surroundings, and a new way of celebrating the holidays, will be very rejuvenating."

HEADLINE: The Empty Firetruck

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
THE aerial ladder swayed under Ron Manke, and he leaned out of the bucket, holding an unwieldy 30-pound power saw and struggling to keep his balance. Arms extended, straining against his harness, he cut a hole in the roof of the building to let the smoke escape. The saw bit into the inch-and-a-quarter decking with a grinding whine, jerking his arms forward.
Afterward, splotched with soot, he said he felt exhilarated, because he had never worked on an aerial ladder before. And no lives had been lost, no property really damaged. It was just a drill in a vacant commercial building, part of Mr. Manke's training to sharpen his skills as a volunteer firefighter. 
 "I learned a lot today," said Mr. Manke, 26, a lieutenant in the volunteer fire department in Upper Saddle River, in northwestern Bergen County. "It's always a good day when you learn something."
Unfortunately for Upper Saddle River, his knowledge will not benefit its fire department. He was learning a lot for the Paramus Volunteer Fire Department, which was conducting the drill and of which he is the newest member.
Mr. Manke, who sells telecommunications equipment for a living, is making the switch because he can no longer afford to live in Upper Saddle River, the upper-middle-income town he grew up in. He is moving to Paramus, where houses are more affordable, and is taking his eight years of firefighting experience with him.
Upper Saddle River is one of dozens of towns that are struggling to keep volunteer fire departments and first-aid squads intact. Though statewide numbers are hard to find, a recent nationwide survey indicated that the number of volunteer firefighters had dropped almost 10 percent since 1983 while emergency calls jumped almost 50 percent. In New Jersey, many fire and ambulance-corps chiefs say they are having trouble finding volunteers, while others are just making do, especially during daytime hours, when many members are at work far from home.
"There isn't a community in the state that isn't short on volunteer personnel," said Edward S. Cohn, a former fire chief in Ramsey who is chairman of a state committee for the recruitment and retention of volunteers. "All the ranks are dwindling."
One day in August, for example, the Upper Saddle River Ambulance Corps got three back-to-back emergency calls but could not field a crew to respond to them. Volunteers from other towns answered the calls as part of a mutual aid agreement.
As the nationwide statistics suggest, the shortage of volunteers has been building for years. But in recent years, the towns that rely on them have been trying inventive ways to attract and retain volunteers, from paying stipends to waiving town recreation fees for firefighters and their families. Like other states, New Jersey has established a toll-free phone number, (800) FIRE LINE, for people to learn about voluntary emergency services and how to become volunteers.
The efforts have had mixed success. "There are different degrees of decline," said Mr. Cohn, who was instrumental in setting up the phone line. "I think there are communities that are in desperate need of help. But are we at a critical stage yet? I hope not."
Ron Manke says he expects to enjoy being part of Paramus's firefighting force (which has had its own recruiting problems in recent years). But he laments having to leave his hometown and the department where his father, Lou, is assistant fire chief and two brothers are volunteer firefighters.
"I regret leaving," Mr. Manke said. "But unfortunately, it's just something I have to do. Upper Saddle River is just so out of my range now."
Larry Rauch, the fire chief in Upper Saddle River, has seen his own son, Scott, leave the fire department for Mahwah's, and he says that losing experienced firefighters cuts away at the nucleus of volunteers on whom departments depend on for stability.
Of Lieutenant Manke, he said, "Paramus is getting a very experienced firefighter."

'Don't Have the Time, Couldn't Stand the Blood'
Volunteer firefighters go back to Colonial days. The role is as American as apple pie; George Washington himself was a volunteer firefighter. There was great competition between fire companies -- even fistfights as they raced each other to fires, writes Paul C. Ditzel, author of "Fire Engines Firefighters" (Crown, 1976). No city had paid fire departments until 1850, and even today, the most firefighters remain volunteers.
First-aid squads have a similar history, though Keith Griffiths, co-publisher of J.E.M.S., the Journal of Emergency Medical Services, points out that in the early days, the ambulances were often provided by mortuaries. Many volunteer ambulance squads modeled themselves after a life-saving crew that organized in Roanoke, Va., in 1928.
Of 1.07 million firefighters nationwide, volunteers number about 808,000, according to the National Fire Protection Association. But the number of volunteers has declined by nearly 77,000 since 1983. In New Jersey, only 39 fire departments, of 800 in the state, are made up of salaried firefighters. The others are manned by some 34,000 volunteers, said George Miller, assistant director of the State Division of Fire Safety.
"We haven't seen the total number dwindling," he said, "but what we're seeing is that people who would have passed on the torch have had to hang on longer because there's no one to pass it on to." Many fire officials around the state say it is hardest to attract and retain volunteers between the ages of 30 and 50.
The state has 450 to 475 first-aid squads, and of 22,000 emergency medical technicians registered in New Jersey, about 15,000 are volunteers. Beverly Barthmaier, president of the New Jersey First Aid Council, says volunteers tend to burn out in three and a half years. "The number of trauma calls they've been on," she said. "They just can't handle it anymore."
Even as membership has declined in some departments and squads, he said, there has been more of a demand on the those remaining: more training requirements, more calls to respond to, more paperwork and administrative demands.
Chuck Smeby, a fire protection engineer for the National Fire Protection Association, says the number of volunteers in the 18-to-25-year-old age group is declining. More ominously, there is a trend in the general population not to volunteer at all.
"Since World War II, the focus of the American public seems to have drifted from 'we' to 'me,' " David M. Beck, an associate editor of J.E.M.S., wrote in 1988. "The would-be volunteer may be too busy working hard and playing hard, as the number of leisure activities grows continuously and people seem comfortable with the notion that if you want something you pay for it."
Officials in New Jersey concur. "People just don't want to do it anymore," said Mayor William W. Bain Jr. of Deptford in Gloucester County, who is a career firefighter in Camden. "Volunteerism in general is at the lowest ebb it's been for years." And Thomas Horner, the former fire chief of Hazlet, Monmouth County, said: "People nowadays who move from the city think you're a paid department. They don't even think of volunteering."
But even those who want to volunteer cannot afford the time to do so. In today's economy, people are working longer and at second jobs. Or both spouses are working, meaning that one can no longer stay home with the children while the other answers fire or ambulance calls.
Training to become an E.M.T. takes 120 hours, plus 48 hours of follow-up training for the necessary recertification every three years. Besides being on call at least 12 hours a week, and 24 hours on one weekend a month, there are meetings and drills. Firefighters must take 120 hours of training and attend regular meetings and training exercises.
Whatever the reasons, Lindsay Graham, captain of the Upper Saddle River Volunteer Ambulance Squad, which is down to 18 members from the 50 it had when she came aboard 20 years ago, says she is frustrated.
"I haven't worked it out yet, why it is that people are not volunteering," she said. "Maybe they don't think about it. Maybe we're not high-profile enough. It's either 'I don't have the time' or 'I couldn't stand the blood.'
"But if they call us, they expect somebody to be there," she went on. "And sometimes, they don't notice who those people helping them are."

Paying the Volunteers, Caring for Their Children
Through the dusky glass doors of the old one-story Bergen Bluestone building, and all the thick smoke, a team of firefighters could be seen crawling, shadowy figures in semi-darkness looking for the source of the fire as part of a drill. And for victims.
James J. Tedesco 3d, the battalion chief, who had kept the wood fire blazing in the fireplace and was acting as a safety officer, was pleased as he watched Mr. Manke and his team in their fire-retardant hoods and air packs, yelling at each other to keep communication, their voices muffled by their face masks.
"It's what you try to get them accustomed to," said Chief Tedesco, a business service manager for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. "The smoke is one problem that you have to overcome, because you can't see your hands in front of your face.
"The other problem is the heat. It just sucks the energy out of your body, and they have to get used to that. They have to know how close and how deep to get into the fire."
There are four firehouses in Paramus, one at each point of the compass. They house the four engine companies and two ladder companies charged with fighting fires in the 10.5-square-mile borough, the second largest in Bergen County, with its major highways -- Route 17, Route 4 and the Garden State Parkway -- and many malls, including the Garden State Plaza, the Bergen Mall and Paramus Park.
"We have 25,000 people who reside here at night," said Councilman Sam Casiello, the fire commissioner, "but during the day the population rises to 250,000, what with shoppers and office workers."
When the current fire chief, Guy Picone, joined the department 13 years ago, there were 90 members responding to 750 calls. Just a few years ago, however, the number of members had dropped to about 75 while the calls had reached about 900.
In the late 1980's, Paramus instituted a stipend system. It now pays $3,000 a year to members of the fire department and the ambulance corps, which had also been struggling to get new members, Mr. Casiello said. In April, Paramus also began waiving certain fees for emergency service personnel and their families -- the $35 golf-course registration fee, for example. And this year the town started a junior fire program for 16-year-old volunteers, who can become probationary firefighters at 18.
Thanks to incentives like these, the fire department is back up to 125 members -- a healthy number, although the department is allowed 200 by ordinance. They have responded to 900 calls so far this year and expect to reach 1,100 by year's end, he said.
"It's kind of been like a roller coaster," Mr. Picone said, "but we've never been in a desperate situation."
Of the stipend, Brian Niland, the assistant chief (and next in line for chief), said: "It pays your taxes, pretty much. That's the way the guys look at it."
Similarly, Fort Lee, which bristles with high-rise apartments and their pricey views, looks on the $3,600 it pays its firefighters each year as rent money. Without such help, young people could not afford to stay, said the borough's fire chief, Joseph J. Licata, a code enforcement officer in the building department.
"We were losing volunteers," he said. "They were going to different towns because of cheaper rents."
Fort Lee's neighbor Cliffside Park pays a stipend of $150 a month, said Fire Chief Frank Leone, and is one of an increasing number of departments that have hired a small number of career firefighters to augment the mostly volunteer department.
Many departments are also relying on municipal employees to fill gaps on weekdays, when most volunteers are working at their regular jobs. In Paramus, at least 20 borough employees are volunteer firefighters, said Mr. Picone. He himself is a mechanic in the borough garage; Mr. Niland, the assistant chief, is a Paramus police officer.
Waldwick, north of Paramus, pays a $1,500 stipend to police dispatchers with E.M.T. training to respond to ambulance calls when the first aid squad is in a bind.
"When the firebell rings," said Gary Kratz, the borough administrator in Waldwick, "three-fourths of the Department of Public Works respond."
And some communities are hiring paid ambulance squads to cover for the volunteers during the day, said Mr. Leggett of the State Health Department.
Then there are creative remedies. "In some squads they have a squad mom who comes to headquarters to watch the children of those who go out on calls," said Ms. Barthmaier of the State First Aid Council. Upper Saddle River arranged with a nursery to watch children of recruits taking E.M.T. training.

Sons Follow Fathers, Brothers Follow Brothers
But Paramus also continues to get volunteers the way fire departments have always got them. Sons follow their fathers, brothers follow their brothers -- which is why firefighters often refer to their departments as family.
Brian Niland's brother, Dennis, is in the Paramus department, and John Ferguson is a probationary firefighter who will soon follow his brother Tim and become a full-fledged member. Bill Possehl's 29-year old brother, David, has become is a Paramus firefighter. These are just a few.
The other night, Chief Tedesco looked into the smoky store where the drill was still going on, and he asked his assistant, Capt. Dan Conway, how Mr. Tedesco's son, James 4th, who is a week short of 18, was doing.
"Fine," said Captain Conway. "We got him in there with the LT" -- the lieutenant. "He's standing right there by the fire."
As proud as he was, Mr. Tedesco also felt a father's nervousness, knowing that someday his son would be in a real firefighting situation. If he is in the burning building at the same time, he said, he will make sure James 4th comes out all right. "But when I'm stuck outside," he went on, "trusting to somebody else, that's where my faith really has to grow and trust that the people he's with are good firefighters."
Asked why they choose to rush into a burning, smoke-filled building when the natural response is to break the record for the 100-yard dash in getting out of there -- or why they expose themselves to seeing someone lying in a bloody roadway with unspeakable injuries who must get to a hospital -- emergency volunteers all tend to give the same response: they want to give something back to their communities.
The camaraderie of the firehouse or ambulance-corps headquarters, the sense of accomplishment, wanting to prove something to themselves: these are also mentioned, but service to the town is usually their first response.
Before he entered the smoky store during the drill, Mr. Manke said with a smile that he had fulfilled the dreams of childhood. "I like to be on the firetruck with the red lights and sirens," he said.
Mr. Possehl, a 37-year-old plant nursery owner who has been a Paramus firefighter for 19 years and was injured when chemicals blew up in his face as he wetted down a garbage-truck fire, says he enjoys "giving back to the community," and "the brotherhood of the firehouse."
"And there's a certain thrill," he went on. "A certain high from being able to put a fire out. You're scared to death when you're getting involved in a fire. If you're not scared, you're stupid. And when you conquer it, there's a great sense of accomplishment."
Adita Salas, who has seen her share of injured people in her 17 years with the Upper Saddle River Ambulance Corps, said, "Even though you've seen something really horrible, you also know that if you weren't there that day, somebody would have died."
For S. Carol White, after 22 years in the Upper Saddle River Ambulance Squad, there is still the nervousness going in and the adrenaline that blocks out the emotion -- though only until afterward.
But there is the joy too. She had always wanted to be a doctor, she said, and one day, 21 years ago, she helped to deliver Ron Manke's brother, Peter, in the back of the ambulance.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Glen Cove, L.I.;
An Ethnically Diverse North Shore City

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
HIS wife has lived all over the world; together, they have lived with their three children on the South Shore of Long Island and, most recently, in Queens.
But after deciding it was time to move back to the suburbs, Marc. S. Bresky and his wife, Aliza, chose Glen Cove, L.I. 
 "It has a wonderful ethnic diversity, which is culturally advantageous for my three children," Mr. Bresky said. "It also has the qualities of the South Shore, like the beaches, and the beautiful qualities of the North Shore, like large trees, large parcels of property, privacy and tranquillity."
Many before him have felt the same way.
One of only two cities on Long Island (the other is Long Beach), the historic peninsula of Glen Cove, with its views of Hempstead Harbor and Long Island Sound, became home to a number of prominent millionaires after the Civil War.
The arrival of such influential men as F. W. Woolworth, the Standard Oil magnate Charles Pratt and J. P. Morgan was hailed as the beginning of the "Gold Coast" era during the 1920's.
The financier's private island, once known, logically enough, as Morgan's Island, is now a waterfront community known as East Island.
Some mansions of the Gold Coast era have survived. Some are still private residences, but others are occupied by the Nassau County Museum, the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture and the Russian Delegation to the United Nations.
Film makers have taken advantage of the grandeur of these homes. "Sabrina" and "Batman Forever" are among the recent movies with scenes shot in Glen Cove.
AT the northern edge of the peninsula, in an area known as "The Landing," immigrant families first settled in the 1860's.. In search of employment and other fresh opportunities, they arrived first from Ireland and then from Poland, Italy and other parts of Europe.
The first jobs for many of the immigrants were at the Duryea Starch Works, one of the largest such businesses in the world, which opened in the 1850's on the south of Glen Cove Creek. Later other factories opened, including ones for tin, leather industrial power belts and chemicals.
Hard-working immigrant groups continue to contribute to the vitality of Glen Cove today, which is still thriving despite changes that have sapped the strength of many small cities.
Glen Cove Creek, once the hub of industrial activity, became polluted. Abandoned industrial complexes line its edge, and the creek area has been designated as a Federal Superfund cleanup site; the city plans to redevelop it and provide waterfront recreation.
In a world where small businesses are challenged daily by megastores, Glen Cove is still home to many smaller shops. Douglas Goldstein, whose father bought the hardware store Charles of Glen Cove in 1958, has maintained the store as a community focal point.
Just beyond the neatly organized aisles of everything from rock salt, fertilizer and mothballs to shelf liner, kitchen trinkets and small gifts is the "nuts and bolts room" where customers can find almost anything they need in old wooden cheese boxes. And if they can't, he stands with them on the same simple, warped wooden floors that his father stood on, and helps.
"We've always been the old-fashioned type of store," Mr. Goldstein said.
Likewise, Mark Udell carries on his grandfather's and father's tradition at London Jewelers on School Street. Though it is across from a new Starbucks coffee house and a multiplex movie theater, Mr. Udell keeps the atmosphere and personal service attuned to its beginnings in 1926, when his grandfather would journey to the estates once a week to wind all the eight-day clocks or tend to the silver.
Thomas R. Suozzi, the city's Mayor, has followed in the political footsteps of his father, Joseph A. Suozzi, who served as Mayor from 1956 to 1960, and his uncle, Vincent A. Suozzi, Mayor in the 1970's and 1980's.
Brenda Weck, who grew up in Glen Cove, left and came back to raise her family, said she returned because of the city's wealth of housing, educational and recreational opportunities. "We know that there are less expensive places to live and places just as pretty," Ms. Weck said. "But the majority of people stay here because of the greater possibilities. We want our children to have the same sense of security we had, and it's not necessarily financial security."
Susan Cornell, another native, recently moved with her husband, Richard, and their four children from an apartment to a Dutch colonial in Glen Cove. "To me this place is still hometown," she said. "My children are the fourth generation here. This is a place you develop roots. It's the kind of town people come up to you and say they can remember you as a baby."
Pascual Blanco, executive director of La Fuerza Unida de Glen Cove Inc., a not-for-profit social service agency, said the city saw an influx of Puerto Rican immigrants in the 1950's when mechanization in some industries cut field jobs.
"We wanted to settle in a place that had opportunity as well as tranquillity," said Mr. Blanco. "Many of us settled here, rather than in Brooklyn. Even though I'm Puerto Rican I've been able to mingle here with everyone and enjoy a sense of community. It doesn't mean that all racial feelings have been overcome. But to a certain degree, many have been exceeded."
Residents say the city's schools have nurtured their endeavors. "I think academically that our students do as well as any students on the North Shore of Long Island," said Frank DeLuca, superintendent of the Glen Cove School District. "Statistically, our schools compare with those of more homogeneous school districts. We send students to the finest schools in the country, from Georgetown to Stanford."
THE average S.A.T. scores were 413 for the verbal section and 461 on the math part, in the middle range when compared to other districts in the county. The reading scores for elementary students are just above the state average.
Among the schools in the district are the Gribbin school, kindergarten through second grade, the Landing elementary school, grades 3 and 4, the Robert F. Finley Middle School, grades 5 through 8, and Glen Cove High School.
Among the private and parochial schools are Friends Academy and St. Patrick's elementary school.
Though 15.4 percent of the city's school-age children are educated at parochial and private schools, 3,050 children attend the district's schools, founded in 1830.
Last year, the high school placed No. 1 in its division -- schools with populations of 900 or less -- in the Nassau County Mock Trial competition and made it to the quarter-final level in the contest.
Of the district's high school graduates last year, 60 percent went on to four-year colleges and 36 percent to two-year colleges or technical schools.
But what makes the district unusual, and appealing to many, is the diversity of ethnic and economic backgrounds of the students.
Michael Kirsch, the principal of an elementary school in Chappaqua, N.Y., who left Glen Cove years ago to start his own family but often comes back to visit his parents, said he has fond childhood memories of growing up here.
"Even though it's a very small city, Glen Cove really mirrors a larger microcosm of society," he said. "The extremes in property values, ethnic groups and religions made me aware that there were all kinds of people. I grew up believing in the melting pot, and its impact was to prepare me to get along with many different kinds of people."
Glen Cove has 18 houses of worship, including African Methodist Episcopal, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Lutheran and Greek Orthodox churches and conservative or reform synagogues.
Residents can swim at the city's three public beaches, play golf or tennis for a minimal cost at a number of public parks, or moor boats at several marinas.
Rosemary Semidey, owner of Gold Coast Properties, who is a fifth-generation resident, cited the city's wealth of public amenities as one reason for the stability of the housing market.
"There's so much here that the market is holding quite well in this economy," Ms. Semidey said.
Houses can range from small capes in the mid-$100,000 range to ranches, colonials, manor homes and estates that sell for more than $5 million.
John Wichrowski, a construction worker who paid $320,000 for a three-bedroom home on three-quarters of an acre in Glen Cove last October, believes the city offers house hunters good value for their money.
"I found my buying power here was a whole lot better than anything I could find elsewhere," said Mr. Wichrowski who moved after selling a house in nearby Glen Head. "I got a bigger piece of property, I think I got a lot of house for the money. It's a fantastic place. There's ample parking at the railroad. If my car is laid up, I could manage because of the bus service."
Ms. Semidey said services such as the teaching hospital, North Shore University Hospital at Glen Cove, and the city's own police, fire and sanitation departments provide an added level of security.
Antonia Petrash, a staff member at the Glen Cove Library who moved into town more than 25 years ago, said the city's proximity to both urban and suburban recreation made it easy to raise three children there.
"You could go to the Hamptons in the same day, or to Manhattan for a Broadway show," Ms. Petrash said.
Residents of Glen Cove said they don't find much to complain about, except the lack of electrified service on the L.I.R.R.
"I'm going to have to make sacrifices with the commute," Mr. Bresky said. "But I'm sure the quality of life we're going to have here in Glen Cove will be worth it."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
You Don't Need a Poll Tax To Subvert Voting Rights

BYLINE: By Brett Pulley; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Ed Rollins, the infamous campaign manager who caused a stir in 1993 when he said he had paid ministers to keep black voters away from the polls, lives his life these days in fear of setting foot in New Jersey. "When I have to use the Turnpike," he said in a recent interview, "I drive through the state really quickly."
While Mr. Rollins may be keeping his foot on the accelerator, he seems to be leaving some pretty toxic fumes behind. Three years after he made his fallacious claims, and decades after would-be voters were taxed and forced to take literacy exams at the polls, the potential for voter suppression still hangs like a stench over New Jersey. 
 The latest threat to voting rights came in the form of recently released state guidelines that could make it extremely difficult for low-income voters to cast their ballots in November. Under the proposed guidelines, a voter who had moved within a specific county but into a new election district would learn upon arriving at the polls that he or she could not vote without first trekking to the municipal clerk's office to file an affidavit confirming the new address, then back to the polling place.
In response to these new ballot security measures, the Democratic Party of New Jersey sued the state on Oct. 1, charging that the new requirements violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which was, among other things, intended to make it easier for people who move to vote. The lawsuit also charged that the rules violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which effectively ended discrimination against minority voters.
Poor urban dwellers would be adversely affected by the rules, the lawsuit argued, because they tended to be the most transient voters and because they also had the toughest time getting transportation to the polls. The additional travel required by the rules would have made it nearly impossible for such people to vote, the lawsuit contended.
"New Jersey has a long and sad history of efforts to interfere with voters at the polls," said Cardell Cooper, Mayor of East Orange and chairman of the national Democratic Party's get-out-the-vote effort in New Jersey this year. "We are taking the steps we need to take to make sure that nobody is improperly denied the right to cast a ballot on Nov. 5."
When a Federal District Court judge indicated that she was likely to rule in favor of the plaintiffs, Governor Whitman quickly stepped in. By late last week the Republican-controlled state government and the Democratic Party had signed an agreement, averting an Election Day travesty of democracy.
The agreement, however, did not come without some difficult, and strange, moments. Just hours after Democratic Party officials and the Secretary of State, Lonna Hooks (the state's chief election official), adopted a revised procedure that would allow relocated residents to vote at their new polling places without a hassle, the state Republican Party and Representative Richard A. Zimmer tried to stop the agreement from going forward. The settlement, Mr. Zimmer and his Republican allies contended, would infringe on the rights of poll challengers who check for voter fraud.
At a time when Republicans across the country say they want to draw more minority voters into their "big tent," why would Republicans in this state put the rights of poll challengers before the rights of voters? And how could Mr. Zimmer, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, advocate a position that threatens voting rights with only weeks to go before Election Day?
Mr. Zimmer said he intervened only because the state Republican Party had asked him to, and he didn't know about the details of the lawsuit. It is also possible that Mr. Zimmer chose to side with his party not only to tow the party line, but also to take a firm stand in opposition to his rival for the Senate, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, who had already joined the Democrats as a plaintiff.
To be sure, both sides were acting in the interests of their respective parties on this issue, but the Republicans' callous disregard for voting rights may signal that their interest in attracting minorities to join their ranks applies only to minority voters of upscale economic status.
Ultimately, all sides reached a compromise, but sadly, our state leaders allowed the guarantee of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution to become mired in partisan politics.
It may have been way back in 1965 when Lyndon B. Johnson proclaimed, "There can no longer be anyone too poor to vote." But if some officials here in New Jersey could have had their way, 1996 might have been deja vu in the Garden State.

HEADLINE: A Warming Trend in Winter Homes

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
CHARTREUSE and rusty brown bunches of paper-thin ferns were clustered around the bottoms of beet-red, goldenrod and caramel-colored trees; children peered out the backs of husky station wagons, their setter dogs' heads stuck out side windows, ears flying, as mothers and fathers in plaid flannel shirts threaded their way along the back roads of Vermont and New Hampshire on a green-apple-crisp weekend. For many the goal was merely to explore, to raid the maple-sugar shacks and cider mills and discount-clothing outlets, and then swing the station wagons around and head back to New York City apartments and suburban split-levels -- to taste the countryside in autumn and return to the land of paved driveways and canopied apartment houses.
But for some -- real estate agents say far more than a year ago -- the trip was another type of exploration: a journey to find, or at least to consider, a weekend house, or a place to spend fall and winter vacations. 
 So of course, they went to Vermont, to places like Stowe, with its plethora of ski runs -- where the dream may be a 17-acre building lot with views of Mount Mansfield, or maybe a distinctive Japanese-inspired cottage with a swimming pool. And they drove to New Hampshire, where the leaves are just as lovely but where towns like Peterborough are not as built-up, where instead of downhill skiing, there is cross-country skiing and skating on town ponds -- and where properties are a lot cheaper than they are in Stowe or Woodstock, Vt.
For those whose dream does not encompass the nippy air on the deck of a ski lodge but focuses more on, say, bicycling down the path for a loaf of bread in the south of France, there may be a much shorter distance to drive, but in a different direction: south, to Bucks County, Pa., where 18th- and 19th-century stone cottages by the stream aren't as cheap as they used to be, but then again, one may be able to spend more time in Pennsylvania than in Provence.
Agents who reported last year that prices of vacation home properties had dropped sharply are now saying that the free-fall in prices has come to a halt -- except, perhaps, for condominiums in resort locations, many of which are difficult to sell at any price.
For properties in the middle and lower price ranges -- anything up to $500,000 -- agents throughout the region say that prices have stabilized, which in broker parlance means that they may be relatively low, anywhere from 20 to 40 percent off what they were at the height of the market in the 80's, but that they don't seem to be going down.
Sam Strong, who runs the real estate company that bears his name in Old Lyme, Conn., cited "one little Federal on Joshuatown Road in Lyme." The house, which because of its small size, lack of garage and only two substantial bedrooms has traditionally been used as a second home, sold in June 1993 for $270,000, Mr. Strong said. It sold again, on Aug. 28, for $272,379.
"That about says it all," he said. The house, well situated on a prestigious country road, held its value during the last three years -- but didn't go up. During the height of the 80's, the realtor said, the same house sold in the mid-$300,000's.
At the same time, prices for higher-end properties -- from the Hamptons to Nantucket Island to Northeast Harbor, Me., -- seem to have taken off. Average sale prices in Bridgehampton are up 77 percent over prices a year ago, according to one brokerage firm. And on Nantucket, several houses traded for over $4 million.
For the most superb properties, those with acreage, privacy and a pond or a view in a blue-chip location, prices have risen dramatically, in many cases up to the level of the heyday just before, and just after, the stock market debacle of 1987. "This year, we crashed through the glass ceiling of 1988 prices," said Frank Newbold, a partner of Braverman Newbold Brennan, a Hamptons real estate company. At Dayton/Halstead, another Hamptons brokerage, sales volume is up 60 percent.
"Things have definitely changed," said George C. Balantyne, the vice president of Sotheby's International Realty in charge of the company's listings from Maine to Fairfield County, Conn. "We had gone through a period where people were waiting to see if things had gone as low as they were going to go. No one wanted to be the first to jump into the market -- they figured give it another six months."
A year ago, Mr. Ballantyne reported the largest sale in the Manchester/Dorset, Vt., market had been $400,000. "So far this year, we've had two sales over $1 million there, and they're both second houses," he said last week. "One sold to a man from New Jersey, another to someone from Tennesee." And on Squam Lake in New Hampshire, where the movie "On Golden Pond" was filmed, Mr. Ballantyne said, he knows of two contracts signed for properties over $3 million.
"These are numbers never even imagined for second-home properties in New Hampshire," he said.
NO matter what the price, agents report, prospective vacation buyers want to find a property up a narrow winding road and ideally with a pond or a stream running by their house, or a view of the mountains.
"It's hard to sell a village house to a New Yorker," said Heather Peterson, president of The Petersons, a real estate firm in Peterborough, N.H., started by her grandfather in 1948. "It's also hard to sell them any house, in a way, because they like the whole neighborhood to be consistent.
"Some don't mind buying a stately colonial on a village green," she said, "but only if every house on the green is a stately colonial. And you know, we don't really have neighborhoods like that in Vermont and New Hampshire -- oh, maybe Woodstock, Vt. -- that's the town rescued by the Rockefellers -- but mostly, we have rich people and poor people, and a lot of times, especially in town, they live right next to each other."
Pall Spera, a real estate broker in Stowe, agrees. But even in Stowe, he said, there are certain roads with more cachet, certain million-dollar subdivisions with more land per house, and certain outlying townships where property is worth more than it would be elsewhere. In nearby Morrisville, for instance, a massive green Victorian with turrets and dormers and fish-scale shingles just sold for $170,000 -- a house that would have cost double or triple only a five-minute drive away.
For Mr. Spera, a lawyer who moved to Stowe 27 years ago and opened the real estate company that bears his name, business is booming again after the black days of the early 90's. And although he says that property, on an average, is still 20 percent less expensive than it was in the heady days of the mid-1980's, prices have stabilized over the last four years.
"The ski resort reputation -- and the ski resort buyer -- is still here, but it's almost old news," he said. "You'll also find people who come here just to hunt moose or to discuss nuclear fission at elegant restaurants."
Most of his second-home clientele, from New York City, Washington and Connecticut suburbs like Greenwich and Darien, come looking, he said, "for the perfect Currier & Ives country."
But it's also Currier & Ives with a 90's twist. "Many people want a house that can be managed in their absence, maybe even rented out for them," said Mr. Spera. "We're a service economy: If you want your firewood delivered, your food purchased, your wine decanted and maids to clean up after your weekend, The New York Times and eggs benedict -- you can get it."
The would-be buyers are also looking for a solid investment.
"With the slowdown in the 90's, the second home slowed down," Mr. Spera said. "The buyers became much more ambivalent about buying -- after all, they really didn't have to buy. They started asking: 'Is there any real reason for me to be here?' "
Condominiums in the ski resorts of Vermont, often selling for as much as $200,000 in the heyday, apparently didn't meet the test.
"There came a point where condos were not stable," Mr. Spera said, "where pricing was amorphous, not predictable; they became almost impossible to fairly value."
Canadians, many from Quebec, had always provided a backup, a cushion for the condo buyer -- you could also find one to sell to. But then, according to Mr. Spera, they became more like Americans, reluctant to invest in real estate with no land attached. The market values of Vermont condominiums fell, occasionally to half their purchase price in the 80's.
NOW, Mr. Spera contends, condominium prices have stabilized -- but remain about a third less than when they were first built, and many can be hard to sell even at such prices.
"Now when people are looking for value, they like to see a house and some land, a 'Little House on the Prairie,' " he said. "You don't have to be Donald Trump to figure that out."
So would a millionaire developer like a purist's paradise, a 262-acre property with only one house -- a 1780 weather-beaten clapboard cape with eight fireplaces and a wood stove -- and a magnificent barn, all up a gravel road with a spectacular view of the Vermont hills?
The house, owned by an antiques collector, is in Nelson, N.H., a posh lakeside community in the southern part of the state near Dublin, and is priced at $465,000. The owner has already turned down several lower offers, according to the broker.
For those who find the price a little unmanageable -- despite the extensive acreage -- one possibility is the 1960's house on the slope of Rose Mountain in Greenfield, N.H., tactfully described as a "lodge," on 40.1 acres, for sale for $79,900.
Although the house has acreage and an absolutely breathtaking view of Mount Monadnock, along with the requisite walk-in stone fireplace, there are a few things missing. Like a foundation. (The house is built on concrete piers.) And an indoor toilet. (There is, however, an outhouse with a view.)
Nevertheless, this property also offers something that most do not: a "sweat house."
"The owner built it; it's like the Indian-male bonding place," said Ms. Peterson. "I think he's a bit of an Outward Bound kind of guy."
The house was on the market for about a month, she explained, but then the owner decided to rent it out for the winter. "He wanted to do some adventure play thing and wanted to make sure it was taken care of," she said. The rental hurt a possible sale, she explained: "We had some hiker types interested but they would've wanted to buy it right away -- not wait until spring."
In winter, it is impossible to drive right up to the house; residents must park their car in what is known as "the winter parking lot," and a utility vehicle might be useful even to make it this far -- a sturdy Volvo had a bit of a pull.
Such problems do not loom large down in Bucks County, where gravel roads are also prized, but where the winters are milder. There, the grass seemed a little more manicured, and an antique house and stone barn on the Delaware River, an estate called Burgess Lea, is for sale for $3.95 million.
Perhaps the fastest-growing segment of the Bucks County market is relocation -- men and women transferred to the big companies nearby: Merck, Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson, according to Linda Krick-Danese, director of sales for Kurfiss Real Estate in New Hope. New construction, especially in the upper price reaches -- the high $400's and low $500's -- is moving steadily.
IN general, property sales are off about 15 to 20 percent from the dizzying heights of 1986 and 1987, said Ms. Krick, who added that when it comes to second-home sales, it is impossible to judge, to guess at an average.
"Second homes are very eccentric around here, each house is different," she said. With what she calls "country properties," versus "executive colonials in a subdivision near the interstate," each one has its own price -- and audience.
"Country properties have a very specific audience," she said, "and it isn't the same audience as for the others."
Second-home buyers in Bucks County want "full-thickness stone walls, stone horse barns -- even though they don't have horses, people like to have dependencies. Then they want privacy and protection from the road; they'll pay another $150,000 or $200,000 for the same house in a rural setting.
"And they love water," she added. "The Delaware River is hard to find, but a pond or a stream. . . . " Solebury Township is perhaps the most prestigious place, but Upper Makefield and, farther north, Tinicum Township also have some wonderful places, the agent said.
In Tinicum, Ridge Cottage is priced at $795,000 and is one of those rambling, multilevel white-stuccoed stone farmhouses that come right out of an English shelter magazine; in fact, it has sheep grazing in the meadow and Staffordshire platters hanging on one of the exposed beams in the family room. It is described in its brochure as having "Irish country charm."
Ridge Cottage is owned by John and Cecilia Collins, who originally came from Staten Island and bought the house, with its guest house across the gravel road and 20 acres, about 12 years ago. Now Mrs. Collins spends the week in Tinicum, while her husband, a lawyer, spends part of the week practicing law in Staten Island.
"He comes here Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends," said Mrs. Collins. Because Tinicum is about 15 minutes north of New Hope, it takes him only about an hour and a half to drive to his office, she said. Mrs. Collins and her husband -- she was once an antique dealer with shops in both Frenchtown and Lambertville (both in nearby New Jersey) -- are packing up and moving to Ireland.
New Hope is different from Stowe and Peterborough -- and more like Nantucket or Stonington, Conn. -- because there are buyers who actually like to be in the center of town, a charming, bustling village with lots of antique shops and antique houses. For them, a large clapboard house with an elaborate secret brick-terraced garden off the side behind a high wood plank fence just went on the market. Complete with a quarter acre of land, spacious for an in-town house, the property is for sale at $279,000.
Its current owner, Thomas Sperling, is moving out of town, and he said he was sad to be selling the house, which he renovated, with its deep taupe wood trim, its reproduction of an antique stove in the kitchen and its tall handsome Victorian rooms -- and of course, its luscious garden and brick-patterned patio.
"You do get attached," he said quietly.

HEADLINE: HOUSING;
What to Do When the House Is Too Big and the Budget Not Big Enough

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
Patricia T. Gritman has spent most of her life in Ridgewood, a picturesque Bergen County village of broad streets, venerable old trees and Victorian houses. She learned to swim in the sandy-bottomed municipal pool and later sent her two children to the high school she attended.
"Even the principal was the same when they got there," said Mrs. Gritman, 54. "My town is such a phenomenal thing." 
 But the children are grown now, her husband, Richard, is retired, and she is soon to join him. And, she fears, without a change in zoning they may not be able to enjoy the leisure life in the community of their memories.
"We can't afford it," she said. "Our income will be reduced while our taxes will keep getting higher. I want to stay. My friends, my activities, my wonderful downtown is here."
"And," she added, "there are plenty of others like me."
It is a concern in many communities across the state, particularly those that aged gracefully without the help of strip malls, tract homes and factories belching steam -- places where strict building codes and high taxes keep the land steeped in history and gingerbread trim, but also force some long-time residents to relocate once they retire, divorce or become too ill to remain in their homes.
With all usable land occupied and zoning inhospitable to apartment buildings and condominiums, towns like Ridgewood have been left with a quandary: how to preserve the sense of community that made the town what it is.
"We're essentially talking about the economic viability of a city," said Susan E. Naruk, president of the Ridgewood Savings Bank and one of those in Ridgewood now fretting about its future.
"There is no question that Ridgewood can survive with a transient population that's just attracted to its lovely housing stock," she said. "But continuity is no small thing to these kinds of towns. People with a history in a place tend to be more committed to it. They join the volunteer fire department and support the local theater. They are what gives a town it's quality and stability."
Following the lead of other Bergen towns and several other affluent communities in New Jersey and southern Connecticut, Ridgewood is now considering a change in its zoning rules that would allow a small apartment to exist within some of its large old houses.
Called accessory housing, it is a way for the community to alter its housing stock without changing the feel or the look of the town. Under the proposed ordinance, which community leaders said would likely go before the Village Council sometime in mid-1997, no changes would be allowed to the facade of a house, which would have to remain owner-occupied, and additional parking would have to be accommodated discreetly on the property, not at the curb.
The ordinance borrows generously from one passed in Greenwich, Conn., 14 years ago. Like Ridgewood, Greenwich contains many houses built in the early part of the century. And in recent years, it, too, found its population in decline, as longtime residents grew old and housing prices rose beyond the reach of young families.
Since Greenwich adopted its ordinance, 165 homes -- roughly 1 percent of those meeting the criteria -- have been approved for conversion. There have been few complaints from neighbors who had worried that accessory housing might decrease their property values or peace of mind, said Diane W. Fox, the city planner.
"People have found that there is no visible change to the neighborhood," she said. "The apartments are small, unseen, and health codes regulate the number of people who can live in them."
Hundreds of communities across the country have passed similar ordinances in recent years, according to the American Planning Association. These include six of the eight towns in Fairfield County (which includes Greenwich), where a state law requires towns to set aside 10 percent of their stock to affordable housing, as well as much of Bergen County.
"This can be a win-win situation for these communities," said William G. Dressel Jr., the executive director of The State League of Municipalities, a lobbying group for all but four of New Jersey's 567 municipalities.
"The existing housing stock is what they've got to work with, largely a lot of big old Victorian houses," he said. "While these addressed the needs a century ago, we've moved on. A decision has to be made as to what the needs are now."
Housing advocates in Ridgewood are setting up seminars, distributing information and offering explanatory videotapes to help gain support for accessory housing.
Hope Dingley, the chairwoman of the Ridgewood Housing Task Force, said she is hopeful the measure will be adopted, noting that few young families can afford what at its cheapest and smallest is a $200,000 fixer-upper, and that few of the elderly can afford the taxes on the large old homes where many were born.
Despite a sense of growing support for the measure, a battle for passage might still take place. Arthur Wrubel, vice-chairman of the Planning Board envisions a very narrow interpretation of any new zoning code.
"My father-in-law is living alone in a Manhattan apartment," he said. "He shouldn't be there. He should be here with me." But, he said, allowing others, like young singles, into Ridgewood might be a tougher sell.
"That's opening the door a little wider than I want," he said. "I mean, it opens the door to the rest of the world. I think it's got to be for the family's that are here. We don't want a rooming house."

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
SENSING that many newlyweds would rather have help buying a home than home appliances, the Government is moving ahead with a program that lets couples open bridal registries at lenders approved by the Federal Housing Administration.
The Bridal Registry Accounts, established earlier this month, allow friends and family members to put cash wedding presents into a bank account. The money will earn interest and eventually go toward the down payment on a home bought with an F.H.A. mortgage. 
 "This new initiative will provide a great way for a young couple to save for their first home together," said Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
But no wedding, it seems, comes off without a hitch. The F.H.A. limits the size of the mortgages it underwrites to $157,000 in the nation's most expensive markets, like New York and San Francisco; the limit is as low as $78,600 in other areas. Most of its business will probably be in the South, Midwest and parts of the West. Indeed, of the 33 lenders in the program, none are based in New York, New Jersey or New England. (A few, however, may have branches in those states.)
F.H.A. loans also have down-payment requirements as low as 3 percent, which may sound great to newlyweds who don't receive enough in cash gifts to make a 10 or 20 percent down payment. Down payments of less than 20 percent, though, generally require private mortgage insurance, which can add $30 to $50 a month to mortgage payments.
"I would tell a young couple, or an old couple, for that matter, that it is ludicrous to spend the kind of extra money you have to spend to buy a home using private mortgage insurance," said Marc Eisenson, publisher of the Pocket Change Investor, a financial newsletter in Elizaville, N.Y. "You are better off renting and saving up the 20 percent down payment."
Then there are the interest rates on the savings. The rates, to be set by the banks, will probably be only about 3 percent in most cases. Financial planners advise that couples not keep the money in the registry accounts if they plan to wait more than a few months to buy their home.
"Shop around -- even a six-month C.D. would pay more than these accounts," Mr. Eisenson said. "And more important, if the couple has a lot of credit card debt, then it would definitely make more sense for them to use the money they have received to pay off debt charging them maybe 17 percent interest than it would to keep it in a savings account."
The idea for the H.U.D. program came from the Universal Lending Corporation in Denver, which had asked the department for guidelines for its own registry earlier this year. Universal makes all types of mortgages, not just F.H.A. loans.
Another lender, BankAmerica Mortgage in Uniondale, L.I., has been offering a program similar to Universal's since March 1992, but only to residents of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Delaware.
Gift-givers should know that none of the programs require couples to use the money in the accounts for a down payment on a house. They can withdraw the money whenever they want and use it for whatever they want.
The bride and groom should also know that if they decide to buy a home with the money, they are under no obligation to apply for a mortgage with the lender offering the registry or the designated banks holding the registry accounts.
BankAmerica offers $100 off closing costs for those who do. It's part of the marketing gimmick, to be sure. Romantics, however, can consider it a wedding present.

Pay Bills Early? Now It Can Pay

BYLINE: By MARTHA NOLAN McKENZIE 

 BODY:
GE Capital made waves recently when it announced that people who pay off their bills completely each month would have to start paying an annual fee for the GE Rewards Mastercard.
The rationale is simple: Card holders who do not carry a balance just do not generate as much profit. Card issuers have long pointed to this when explaining why they offer sweeteners to people who revolve some debt month after month, though GE Capital is the first major card issuer to penalize those who do not. 
 So it comes as quite a surprise to find a bank that is taking the opposite stance. Key Bank U.S.A., based in Cleveland, last week began offering a credit card that rewards people for being fiscally prudent. Customers who make big payments on their bills each month will pay a lower interest rate than those who pay only the minimum.
The Key Bank program has won accolades from consumer advocates, who have criticized the new GE policy and similar disincentives for people to dig out of debt. "I have nothing but praise for the Key Bank card," said Ruth Susswein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group in Salem, Va. "It is working to assist consumers and rewarding them for paying off their debt."
The Key card, called Key Smart, assesses its top interest rate, 16.9 percent, for a card holder who makes the minimum payment -- 2 percent of his balance. If the customer pays 3 percent of his debt, the rate falls to 14.5 percent, and if he pays 5 percent, his interest rate will fall to just 10 percent.
So what's in it for Key Bank? Steve Hucal, director of credit card services at the bank, says response has been strong and the card is attracting a desirable group of card holders. A mailing for the card resulted a response rate of 3 to 4 percent, three times the industry average, helping to reduce Key Bank's cost of acquiring new customers. Based on a test of the card since April, 90 percent of its users will carry a balance, compared with an industry average of about 70 percent, Mr. Hucal said. Furthermore, the balances are 20 percent higher than average, he said.
The secret to the card's early success may be that it encourages consumers to make substantial payments but not to shed their debt entirely.
Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a credit card research company in Frederick, Va., says it's easy to see why companies don't want card holders to pay the entire bill each month. Those who do would have to charge $45,000 a year to create as much revenue for a bank as those who carrying $2,000 balances, he estimated.
The big card issuers -- 10 companies control half of the market -- have been increasingly intent on improving their bottom lines. As the competitive pressures built in the early 90's, card issuers added rebates and other attractions in the hope of encouraging people to charge more, increase their balances and generate more interest income. Cards with such frills typically carry rates four to five percentage points higher than those on plain cards.
Consumers soon realized they could get the rewards, whether frequent-flier miles, points toward a car purchase or a cash rebate, and avoid the high interest rates by paying the balance each month.
Now card companies are encouraging card holders to carry balances. For existing card holders who don't carry a balance, GE Capital said last month that it would begin charging a $25 annual fee on its Rewards Mastercard, which provides a cash rebate of 1 to 2 percent of the amount charged.
Citibank now charges 15.65 percent for card holders who carry a balance of up to $2,500, and lowers the rate to 13.65 percent for those with bigger balances. Chase Manhattan, Household International and Fleet Financial Group have adopted similar rate structures to reward people who carry debt.
"The GE and Citibank strategy is probably going to win out over the nice-guy strategy" of Key Bank, Mr. McKinley predicted.
But there may be another benefit for Key Bank. People who pay only the minimum generate considerable interest revenue for the card issuer, but they are also more likely to fall behind on payments. People who make bigger payments each month, Key officials suggest, will be better credit risks.

When Your C.D. Is in Francs or Pounds

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN 

 BODY:

Q. I want to diversify my portfolio by investing in foreign currency. Will any United States bank sell me a certificate of deposit in Australian dollars?
 
B. LACEY
Manhattan
 
A. I asked this question at my own local bank. "Foreign C.D.'s?" an assistant vice president replied politely. "No, definitely not here. Have you checked the import section of Tower Records or HMV?" 
 His humor wasn't unjustified. Because American banks have computers that are typically programmed to operate only in American dollars, "most don't want the hassle" of offering investments in other currencies, said Hanspeter Walder, head of private banking at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
But some American banks decide otherwise. Two that I found are Citibank (800 755-5654), which has a $25,000 minimum for such investments, and Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis (800 926-4922), a pioneer in the field, with a $10,000 minimum.
And though their minimums are often lofty, the American branches of European institutions like Swiss Bank (212 574-3000) and Deutsche Bank (212 474-8000) often offer foreign C.D.'s, as well as foreign bonds and money-market funds. Switching among many different currencies is no big deal for them; in Europe, they do it all the time.
The globalizing economy, however, may lead American bankers and others to rethink their reluctance to get into the foreign C.D. swim. "In 10 years," said Ira Weiss, a vice president at Merrill Lynch, "everyone will have multicurrency capability. They'll have to."
These currency investments may not be the next Macarena, but there are some signs of growth -- like Merrill Lynch's recently announced pilot program in which investors, for a $50,000 minimum, can buy C.D.'s in six major currencies.
Mr. Weiss also predicts that demand for foreign C.D.'s will rise sharply if there is another greenback tumble like the one in early 1995. The dollar is now 38 percent above its postwar low of 80.63 yen, reached on April 18, 1995.
Some foreign C.D.'s carry penalties for early withdrawal, while others, like Citibank's, do not allow removal before the maturity date. Like domestic C.D.'s, the foreign ones generally pay higher rates of interest for larger amounts. But the basic interest rate varies by currency.
Citibank offers foreign C.D.'s in maturities of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. It also has money-market accounts in the same currencies in which it sells C.D.'s. The countries are Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland; it also offers C.D.'s based on the new European Currency Unit.
Mark Twain has a broader menu, offering C.D.'s in any tradable currency in the world. There's no need to lose sleep anymore wondering how to get the Thai baht or Czech koruna into your account. Mark Twain can even get Russian T-bills denominated in rubles. (The untradable currencies, according to Neil J. George Jr., Mark Twain's chief economist, include the Hungarian forint, Chinese yuan, Vietnamese dong, Cambodian riel and Indian rupee.)
Mark Twain's $10,000 minimum applies to six common currencies; for less popular ones, the minimum is $20,000.
But, Edmund Hillary notwithstanding, just because an investment is there doesn't mean a person should buy it. Mr. Weiss stresses that foreign C.D.'s are not at all like the safe domestic variety. If the dollar strengthens or if your C.D.'s currency weakens, the movement may erase much or all of your interest earnings; you may even end up with a loss. Though they share the C.D. name with dollar-based C.D.'s, then, they are far riskier.
And currency fluctuations are very unpredictable -- even for professionals like George Soros, the billionaire financier. That's why banks try to deter smaller, unsophisticated investors with high minimums, and recommend that affluent investors put only a small part of their portfolios into the investments.
Still, foreign C.D.'s can provide diversification to a portfolio. They can also serve as a hedge against a falling dollar, or as a speculative play. And as long as American interest rates remain low, some foreign C.D.'s can give you more bang for the buck. Investors who were savvy enough to buy 30-day New Zealand certificates, for example, are now enjoying payments at an annual interest rate of 8.75 percent.
To make money on a foreign C.D., select a currency in the same way you'd choose a stock, Mr. George suggests. For instance, many people are now bullish on Ireland, and while some of them may buy stock in Waterford Wedgewood and other Irish companies, others may purchase Irish C.D.'s on the assumption that the country's growth will be reflected in the Irish pound.
"It's a calculated risk," Mr. George cautioned, "and one can lose."
Just look at the Mexican peso, which went from 3.5 to the dollar just before its devaluation in December 1994 to about 7.6 to the dollar today.
All in all, it's comforting to know that in these times of automatic teller machines, a few bankers are still working hard to better serve their clients. It reminds me of a form letter sent to Groucho Marx by his friendly Beverly Hills banker, ending with the traditional "If I can be of any service to you, do not hesitate to call on me."
Back came a note from Groucho: "Dear Sir: The best thing you can do to be of service to me is to steal some money from the account of one of your richer clients and credit it to mine."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Twice as Nice, or Double Trouble"
Foreign-currency C.D.'s pay a stated interest rate, but their returns also depend on currency fluctuations. Here is how much an American investor would have ended up with if the had invested $10,000 in these one-year C.D.'s on Oct. 10, 1995. (Source: Mark Twain Bank)

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Taking a Shine to Rust-Oleum

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
THE economy, as usual, is a sphinx. Job growth is weak and that calms inflation fears, but wages are up and that raises such worries. For some investors, these mixed signals are a call to start hunting for all-weather stocks.
One such prospect is RPM Inc., a holding company in Medina, Ohio. Founded in 1947 under the banner of Republic Powdered Metals, the company initially made a liquid aluminum coating for industrial roofing. Now it does much more, producing 100 coatings, sealants and specialty chemicals for industry, as well as for the hobby and do-it-yourself markets. The company peddles brand-name goods like Day-Glo fluorescent paints and Rust-Oleum, the rust preventive that many homeowners swear by.
RPM's hallmark, though, is steady and consistent growth: it has posted 22 consecutive years of dividend increases, in good economic times as well as in bad. One big reason: Sales of RPM's products rise in a prosperous economy, and they are cushioned in tough times when the do-it-yourself market picks up.
"Historically, this stock does quite well within a late cycle-early recession time frame," said Jerry R. Herman, who follows midsize growth companies at Everen Securities in Cleveland. "In 1990, for example, it was up 22 percent, 15 percent in 1991 and 32 percent in 1992."
Such historical performance, however, does not necessarily mean the stock is now a buy. But, for several reasons, bullish investors say it is. Pointing to RPM's recent hard times, as well as to stepped-up management incentives and its overseas expansion plans, they see RPM stock as underpriced.
RPM, which has $1.13 billion in annual revenue, has clearly hit a rough patch in recent years. Even for a company that can prosper in good and bad times, it has been hurt by the recent slowdown in consumer spending. Last winter's weather was so severe that there was a cutback in the use of maintenance products in general. And the Day-Glo brand took a washing in the last few years, as RPM's competitors were far quicker to jump into alternative markets for fluorescent dyes when neon-colored clothing declined in popularity.
RPM's earnings were hurt by these developments, rising only 10 percent, and 6 percent on a per-share basis, in the fiscal year ended May 31. In the previous decade, average earnings rose 17 percent annuallyand per-share earnings rose 12 percent.
Not surprisingly, with all this disappointment, RPM stock has languished, trading in the range of $15 to $17 over the last year and a half. At Friday's closing price of $16.875, the stock was selling at just 17.2 times earnings while the companies on the S.& P. 500 had an average multiple of 20.3. Moreover, RPM often trades at up to a 15 percent premium to the Standard & Poor's 500, analysts say. At that premium, RPM would be selling at $22.90 a share.
Some analysts see several reasons that this premium might return. Karen Lane Gilsenan, a stock analyst at Merrill Lynch, likes RPM's new management incentive plan, announced in June, which will give entire management groups -- not just a few individuals -- the chance to receive bonuses that are 25 percent bigger than before. "That's a pretty attractive carrot to performance," she said.
Then come the ambitious overseas acquisition plans of RPM, which has long been an active buyer of domestic businesses. "Right now, 17 percent of our direct sales are outside of the United States," said Thomas C. Sullivan, RPM's chief executive. "I'd like to increase that to 25 percent over the next five years."
The market potential is certainly there. "If you look at all of the markets that RPM competes in, you're looking at a $100 billion market," Mr. Herman said.
Moreover, Mr. Herman says he thinks RPM has a leg up on foreign acquisitions. "To many sellers of business," he said, "RPM is a buyer of choice because the company has demonstrated a willingness to pretty much leave an acquired operation alone, while supplying them with capital and other forms of infrastructure."
But RPM is new to international work, which is full of uncertainties even for veteran global players. Although no one company competes against the whole product line of this diversified enterprise, RPM faces many big rivals for selected goods. "They have competitors in every single market," said Mr. Herman, including names like Du Pont, 3M and Sherwin Williams.
Harry Millis, a managing director at Fundamental Research in Cleveland, says he thinks RPM is a good value but he cautions that its growing size means it must evolve. Acquisitions used to fuel two-thirds of its earnings, but as the company grows they will probably supply just one-third. Mr. Millis also foresees a more modest annual increase in earnings -- RPM's earnings are due out next week -- than the 15 percent that Mr. Sullivan forecast for 1997.
Nevertheless, RPM's advocates point to the strict cost-control plan that was instituted last fall, and the pent-up demand from last winter for RPM products like the Bondo line of automotive repair aids. And who knows? The Day-Glo paints are beginning to regain some of their former sales glory by finding new lives -- as tracers for use in farming and in fighting fires like those that have recently battered the western United States.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Small Businesses Find A Friend in Big Banks

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
WHEN Berc Calgicioglu of Los Angeles wanted a new $30,000 line of credit for his downtown jewelry store, his bank of 14 years put him through the standard rite of borrowing.
"They required a lot of formalities, a lot of collateral, plus they wanted all kinds of financial statements," said Mr. Calgicioglu (pronounced cal-gi-see-OH-glue). In the end, he was turned down. 
 "I was amazed," he said. "In 14 years I had never even bounced a check."
Angered, he answered an ad from a much larger bank, Bank of America, promising a credit line of $50,000. "I filled out a one-page form," he said. "It took five minutes." Fifteen days later, the money was his.
Formerly left to community banks, small-business loans of less than $100,000 are suddenly a fast-growing area for even the largest lenders. Wells Fargo, Fleet, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Barnett and Hibernia have all started courting the kind of borrowers they had mostly ignored, spurred by a change in banking laws and the technological ability to reduce the costs of making such loans.
"We were looking at a large, growing and underserved market, and we felt there must be a business opportunity," said Terri Dial, vice chairwoman of Wells Fargo, which in 1994 became one of the first large banks to expand its small-business lending.
The market is indeed growing. The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation listed a record 770,206 new incorporations last year, up 19 percent from from 647,366 in 1990. At the same time, banks say, big corporate loans and real estate lending have topped out.
While there are no reliable national figures on the number of small-business loans, Jerry Bowman, a vice president with the Bank of America, said the bank had increased its lending to small businesses. In California, for example, the bank made 33,000 small-business loans for the first seven months of 1996, compared with 14,700 for all of 1993.
Banks have also been pushed into small-business lending by a change last year in the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, the law that requires banks to lend money in the areas where they do business. Under the change, loans to small businesses carry more weight in the ratings that regulators give to banks. Those that fail to get a satisfactory rating or better can be blocked in attempts to acquire other banks.
"Small business lending is good politics and good business for a regulated industry," said Phil Lader, the head of the Small Business Administration.
IN the past, large lenders were unwilling to make loans of less than $100,000 because the costs of of evaluating the loans ate up the profit.
"It's very labor intensive," said Anthony Santomero, director of the Financial Institutions Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "When you get into smaller lending, it's harder to meet the bottom line."
But that was changed by credit scoring, a computer-based data system that assesses loans not by evaluating a business plan, but by looking at an applicant's past debt and weighing other risk factors. It reduces the number of costly in-depth reviews that loan officers must make. Filomena Soyster, director of small-business banking for Fleet Financial, said credit scoring had helped cut the bank's costs of underwriting and managing small-business loans by about 40 percent.
Credit scoring may be streamlining the loan process at banks, but the method is not perfect. A scoring model that works at one bank branch may not work at one in a different neighborhood.
For example, the models commonly favor people with a stable address. "For military personnel who move a lot, length of time at a residence might not be indicative of likelihood to pay," noted Sondra Harris, corporate communications manager at Fair, Isaac & Company, the largest provider of credit-scoring software and services.
Some members of minority groups have said that the current models treat them unfairly, by sometimes turning down customers who had previously received loans. Banks counter that credit scoring is just a first step in making a loan and that consumers who are rejected can still appeal to loan officers. But some critics say that is still a problem.
"We contend that minorities don't have the same access to branch managers and lenders as others," said Ardell Walcott, project manager for the NAACP Community Development Resource Centers in Atlanta.
Bankers say credit scoring allows more loans with fewer losses. Critics say the losses may simply be low because of the strong economy.
The Small Business Administration uses credit scoring in making its loans, but it isn't ready to declare the method a total success. There may be a change in the way the loan is processed and in the customer's relationship with the bank, said Mr. Lader of the agency, but it is too soon to tell if it is an improvement over older methods.

Handoff: Fish to Finkelstein

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Development pressures, from the Times Square revival to plans for Columbus Circle to a proposal to rezone Eighth Avenue, are likely to create a more contentious atmosphere between neighborhood groups and real-estate interests, says Lola Finkelstein, who will take over as chairwoman of Community Board 5 next month.
"There's not much noise about it now," said Mrs. Finkelstein, a 13-year veteran of the board, which deals with neighborhood issues from 14th Street to 59th Street, from Lexington to Eighth Avenues. "But as New York's economy revives, appropriate development and appropriate planning -- where will a project go, how big will it be and, most of all, what kind of impact will it have on the community -- will become very significant and very relevant issues once again." 
 For example, she said, the city's plans for Eighth Avenue and the theater district, due to be announced next month, are sure to be scrutinized carefully by Board 5.
"Eighth Avenue," said Nicholas Fish, the current chairman, "is going to be the mother of all zoning issues."
On Oct. 30, Mrs. Finkelstein will succeed Mr. Fish, whose tenure as chairman was marked by a successful fight to convert the Times Square Hotel, a dilapidated structure in bankruptcy at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue, into a mixed-use residence for the homeless and low-income working people. Mr. Fish also helped resist the influx of clubs, like the House of Blues, into the Flatiron and Union Square areas.
Mr. Fish, a labor lawyer, is the 38-year-old scion of a New York political dynasty dating back to the American Revolution. After being re-elected to a fourth one-year term as chairman, he resigned last week to join his wife, Patricia Schechter, a history professor in Portland, Ore., and their 3-year-old daughter.
Mr. Fish's resignation throws more of a spotlight on Mrs. Finkelstein, 70, who will finish the remainder of Mr. Fish's term, which ends in June. She got her start in neighborhood politics in the early 1980's after her frequent complaints about garbage in her 56th Street neighborhood elicited a suggestion from Andrew Stein, then Manhattan Borough President, "that instead of fighting us, you should join us." As a board member appointed by Mr. Stein, she helped win landmark status for Rockefeller Center.
Rosanne Haggerty, executive director of Common Ground Community, said Mrs. Finkelstein was instrumental in winning support for Common Ground's plan to renovate the Time Square hotel.
"What is striking about Lola," said Ms. Haggerty, "is here is someone who looks like Pamela Harriman or Brooke Astor chairing a meeting about homeless people and being a remarkably forceful advocate for them." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: DIAMOND DISTRICT;
New Shine for Diamond District

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The diamond district is important: at least three-quarters of all diamonds that enter the United States, some $4 billion worth last year, pass through the district.
It is crowded: more than 2,600 diamond-related businesses are shoehorned onto the narrow strip of 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. 
 It is loud: at noon on any given day, thousands of merchants, delivery people and tourists elbow past hawkers trying to coax customers into their stores.
All of which make the diamond district not a very pleasant place for pedestrians. But a new $900,000 project, financed by the Manhattan Borough President's office, is trying to make the bustling street more appealing.
While the improvements should benefit pedestrians, they are also an economic necessity for the district, said Jerry Polner, executive director of the Diamond and Jewelry Industries Development Corporation, a trade group that is organizing a business improvement district for 47th Street. He said foreign competition was threatening the district's dominance.
In addition to the established diamond centers of Antwerp and Tel Aviv, Mr. Polner said India, Thailand and China were becoming more important because they can operate more cheaply than New York.
"There's also the danger of the diamond district simply fading away, because of New York's high taxes, high energy costs and high rents," he said. "One purpose of this project is to keep the industry here by making the district memorable."
The memorable part comes in a plan to erect four 30-foot pylons, two apiece at the Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas ends. At the top of each pylon, the equivalent of a three-story building, will be a three-foot wide acrylic Plexiglas model of a 57-facet diamond, suitably illuminated. In artists' renderings, the pylons resemble solar death rays from the lost island of Atlantis.
Sidewalks will also be widened at the corners of 47th Street from 12 feet to 14 feet, in part to accommodate the pylons but also to accommodate the surge of pedestrian traffic rounding onto the block from the avenues. The widening will extend only for the equivalent of a parking space on the north and south sides of the street easing congestion.
"This way," joked Adam Friedman, an adviser in Borough President Ruth Messinger's office, "pedestrians will have more room before they're pushed off the curb." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Advice for Diana: Have a Royal Time, but Invest Wisely

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
YOU are 35, recently divorced and alone for the first time in your adult life. But your settlement has undoubtedly helped cushion the blow: Because you are Diana, Princess of Wales, you have just walked away with $22.5 million, tax-free.
What's a princess to do? How can Diana manage her assets to finance the things she covets -- the beauty treatments, the luxury vacations, the designer clothes -- and to live in the manner to which she is accustomed? 
 And an expensive manner it is. Estimates of Diana's spending vary (and neither she nor her former in-laws at Buckingham Palace have ever disclosed specific figures), but most royal-watchers say that before her divorce, her expenses were as high as $1.2 million a year. Estimates in 1994 that were reportedly leaked by the Prince of Wales's camp showed about $459,000 for a staff whose size sometimes ballooned to 20 full-time workers and $240,000 for personal grooming -- including more than $150,000 for clothing, $12,000 for personal-fitness trainers and health clubs, and $15,000 a year for psychotherapy, aromatherapy, colonic irrigation and other treatments.
It is true that Diana's housing, a five-bedroom, four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace, will continue to be financed by the state, as will, presumably, her health care and security. Also, Prince Charles will pay the bills of their two sons, William and Harry, as well as up to $600,000 a year in Diana's private office expenses.
But much of Diana's financial future is in her own hands now, and her new responsibilities, compounded by the trauma of divorce, are heavy. Managing new-found wealth involves careful planning and a long-term approach, say Robert C. Elliott, a senior executive vice president at Bessemer Trust in New York, and Tim Kochis, principal partner of Kochis Fitz Tracy & Gorman of San Francisco. Mr. Elliott and Mr. Kochis, who specialize in rich clients, were asked by The New York Times to come up with financial plans they might recommend to the newly unattached Princess were she their client.
The first priority, the advisers agree, would be to reassure the often-fragile Princess at a difficult, albeit suddenly cash-rich, time in her life. "There are emotional issues in these cases, the same as there would be if a widow had suddenly come into a lot of money," Mr. Elliott said. "It's a matter of working with the client so that she understands her finances aren't out of control."
Mr. Kochis said he would assure Diana that despite her divorce, she could go on living in style. "For most people, the fundamental objective is to be able to maintain their existing life style," he said. "Many times people are overwhelmed. They worry that they're going to have to make dramatic changes, and this is not always the case."
MR. ELLIOTT'S plan supposes that Diana has a life expectancy of about 50 more years, and that inflation in Britain will continue to hover around 3 percent a year. If Diana does what many overwhelmed newly rich people fantasize about doing -- shoving their cash under a mattress -- her fortune would dwindle from $22.5 million to $5 million, in real terms, by the time she reached 85.
"You've got to take a total-return approach toward investing, which emphasizes equity for appreciation to offset the impact of inflation," Mr. Elliott said.
Mr. Elliott's mattress example assumes Diana will spend nothing. But if she opens her wallet at the $1.2 million annual rate that some ascribe to her, she would be down to her last pound in her early 50's.
Under Mr. Elliott's plan, 32 percent of Diana's money would be invested in British Government bonds, known as gilts, to provide stability and an assured fixed income. A further 46 percent would be invested in equities -- half in Britain, and the other half divided equally between other developed countries and emerging ones.
"My assumption is that she would continue to remain a U.K. resident," Mr. Elliott said. "If she's going to be living there and spending pounds sterling you want to have more money invested domestically. Should she do what some have conjectured and become a resident of another jurisdiction, like the United States or Monaco, the orientation would have to be shifted."
For diversification, this equity portfolio would hold about 40 British stocks and 80 to 90 stocks from the rest of the world.
Thirteen percent of Diana's money would go into private investments that have high risk but carry the promise of high returns. "People with substantial wealth should have a 10 to 20 percent commitment to private investments," Mr. Elliott said.
He advised Diana to buy another house, and assigned it a cost of $2 million. "While she has use of her residence at Kensington Palace, she will need, from a personal perspective, to have another residence," he said, although some point out that past threats from the Irish Republican Army against the royal family would make such a house problematical or at least increase its cost because of security requirements. "We assume, as a general expectation, that the residence would appreciate at 5 percent a year," Mr. Elliott said.
The Bessemer investment plan would give Diana an after-tax income of $635,000 a year -- less, to be sure, than what she presumably was spending before. But some of her needs are certain to be more modest than they were while she was married; it hardly seems necessary, for instance, for her to retain 20 full-time employees.
Nevertheless, the question arises: Will Diana have to go on a budget?
"I think we would not use the term 'budgeting,' but 'cash-flow analysis,' " Mr. Elliott said. "This is something that anybody with or without money should do, because it adds some discipline to life. At the same time, we don't believe in preaching middle-class morality, telling wealthy people that they should curb their life styles inordinately. Diana is not middle class, and she should not behave like a middle-class person."
Should she earn some extra cash? Diana can't count on the divorced person's favorite moneymaker: marriage to an even richer spouse, Mr. Elliott said. "I don't know how many Aristotle Onassises there are," he said. "She has to assume she won't marry rich, and orchestrate her financial life accordingly." Moreover, much of the settlement is secret; it is not known what effect remarriage might have. Although the $22.5 million -- which she is believed to have in hand already -- may be safe, remarriage may jeopardize other aspects of the settlement, like her right to Kensington Palace.
One income possibility, Mr. Elliott said, would be for Diana to exploit her very high profile. "One of the things she ought to think about would be to be a spokesperson or image of a major clothing line or cosmetics company," he said. "She's not a royal anymore, and if she does it in an attractive, tasteful way it could add to her income."
Mr. Kochis's plan takes into account Diana's unique position as a royal mother. Not only will all of William's and Harry's needs be taken care of, but William's future job means her own future looks bright. "If her son is going to be king, she doesn't need to worry about accumulating for a comfortable retirement," Mr. Kochis said.
But in laying out specific investments, Mr. Kochis assumes that Diana will live self-sufficiently to 90 and that inflation will average 3.5 percent annually. His plan allows her to continue spending at the same rate as before -- $1.2 million a year -- although he figures she could spend less after age 70 by halving her staff budget.
First, Mr. Kochis said, Diana will need a small reserve of cash or cash-equivalent investments -- say, $1.8 million -- from which to draw her expenses.
"As she spends money from the cash reserve," he explained, "she would liquidate from the equity holdings to replenish the reserve so that it would always provide a roughly 18-month horizon of readily available, zero-risk funds. That would permit her to tolerate the high volatility that would exist in the remainder of her investments."
That remainder -- some $20.7 million -- would be invested in "globally diversified equities" under Mr. Kochis's plan.
"She may appropriately give a nod in the direction of the U.K. because of it being her home and because her son will be king," he said, "but under the appropriate diversification she would not permit U.K. equities to be a large part of her portfolio."
Whether Diana can follow this advice without criticism is unclear; many British citizens did not like her foreign cars and clothes early in her public career. Nor is enough known about the Queen's estimated $500 million portfolio to provide even an imperfect point of comparison. "It's easier to find out about M.I.5 and M.I.6" than to learn about the finances of the close-to-the-vest Windsors, said Philip Hall, author of "Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the Monarchy," referring to Britain's spy agencies.
In any case, under Mr. Kochis's plan, $8.7 million of the $20.7 million would be invested in small-capitalization companies in the United States, $2.2 million in small-cap stocks elsewhere, $6.6 million in large British, European and Asian companies, and $2.2 million in emerging markets.
The final $1 million, Mr. Kochis said, is "play money" for Diana to invest according to her insights or her desire for personal business involvement. "Most people of substantial wealth want to actively participate in the management of their money," he said.
This portfolio would earn an after-tax income of $1.2 million a year. Any sums Diana did not spend could be kept invested, protecting the assets from any inflationary increases, Mr. Kochis said.
Mr. Kochis's portfolio, almost entirely stocks, is riskier than Mr. Elliott's, and that is partly because Mr. Kochis is assuming Diana will keep her high level of spending, while Mr. Elliott is assuming she will cut back. "The main point of this portfolio is the growth opportunity," Mr. Kochis said. "She's a very young woman, and her rate of spending requires her to have a portfolio made up almost entirely of reasonably aggressive equities."
And now that the Princess has to worry about these things, Mr. Kochis concluded, she should get some good tax advice.
Mr. Kochis said he would tend not to advise Diana to accept a sponsorship deal. "If she plays it right, I'm envisioning someone who combines the roles of Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Onassis," he said.
But he would urge her to buy a second home. "It should be somewhere, whether in Switzerland or the South of France, that she could escape to," he said. "I would get as far away from the Windsors as I could."

Two ways for Diana to invest her $22.5 million divorce settlement in order to maintain her life style. One plan, from Robert C. Elliott of the Bessemer Trust, would produce an annual after-tax income of $635,000; the other, from Tim Kochis, a San Francisco planner, would earn about $1.2 million a year.

HEALTH CARE
 
A Job at Aetna? Later
"Over the long term," Aetna's chairman, Ronald Compton, said last week, "we believe this growth will result in more job opportunities." The growth in question is Aetna's big move into managed health care, but the job opportunities were nowhere in sight -- Aetna had just announced 4,400 job cuts, 1,000 of them in Connecticut. Managed care, you see, is an ever-tougher business these days, so if Aetna wants to be a leader in this blossoming industry -- and its recent purchase of U.S. Healthcare shows vividly that it does -- it needs to run a tight ship.
 
ENERGY
 
Nuclear Arithmetic
In the 50's, when America was grasping for ways to use the newly created nuclear monster, utilities hyped nuclear power as being "too cheap to meter." It didn't quite work out that way. Putting aside the fact that an accident could render vast areas uninhabitable -- true, a rather large matter to put aside -- this logic ignored things like the cost of disposing of all that nasty toxic waste. In addition, the last generation's planners did not foresee how competition and deregulation would transform the utility industry. So if the era of nuclear power ends, the main factor could well be economics, not concern for the planet's future. That calculus was clearly in evidence last week in the news that the Connecticut Yankee plant, now shut for safety reasons, may never reopen.
 
CORPORATE IMAGE
 
No More Tobacco. Really!
If you think it's hard for a person to quit smoking, think of a whole company. No, it's not addiction -- it's just that once people think of you a certain way, it's nearly impossible to change their minds. What if Coca-Cola, say, started selling nothing but lingerie. "Soft drinks?" they'd say. "What soft drinks?" Yeah, right. Well, American Brands had roughly that problem, because everyone knows it's been selling tobacco forever -- since 1864, to be exact. Trouble is, it sold American Tobacco -- maker of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall -- to a British company two years ago. But investors kept lumping the company with the tobacco merchants. Last week, American Brands said enough was enough: It announced that it would sell its last remaining tobacco business -- British-based Gallaher. And just to make crystal clear that it will be smoke-free, it's also changing its name, to Fortune Brands.

STREET VENDORS
 
Olympic Also-Rans
And you thought the Olympics were over. Not by a long shot. Some vendors, it seems, paid $10,000 to $20,000 for sites that they had been told would be packed with tourists just dying to spread their cash around. So confident were the vendors that these riches would flow, in fact, that some used their life savings. But the sites were duds, they say, and illegal vendors undersold them, so they are demanding their money back. It doesn't look good, for last week a judge refused to freeze the bank accounts that hold the disputed money.
 
ECONOMICS
 
What Makes People Tick?
Economics often seems an arcane, other-worldly science -- populated by tweedy souls scratching their heads and staring at reams of numbers. But at least two economists focused on decidedly down-to-earth matters: Why do people do what they do? What incentives do they need to act the way society needs them to act? How, say, do you get the rich to pay highly progressive income taxes without grumbling? One, William Vickrey, came up with a way to do that, "and still," he said, throw away two-thirds of the tax forms" -- an idea that never got off the ground "because it would have put the I.R.S. out of business." No matter. Last week he and his fellow master of incentive theory -- James A. Mirrlees -- were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and will share $1.12 million. A very nice incentive indeed, but Mr. Vickrey, alas, will not be able to enjoy it: He died three days later, at 82.
 
ALASKA DREAMING
 
Very Cold Comfort
Alaska bought Chris Behnke, who's 13, some bagpipes last year. Just a little "thank you" for staying around. The state, of course, didn't know it was buying the bagpipes -- it sends out an annual check to all Alaskans, to do with what they will. The only condition: live there for a year, through light and dark, through cold and really cold. And when this year's checks went out last week, they were the biggest since the Permanent Fund -- as the conduit for this largess is called -- started 20 years ago: $1,130.68 a person. And here's the odd thing: The fund started as simply a way to share oil wealth, but it now owns things like an Orlando industrial complex. So you, too, can own a piece of Florida: just move to Alaska. (Might as well wait till spring, though: it's too late to qualify for next year's check.)
 
THE STING
 
Penny Stocks Can Be Costly
How do you make a fortune in America? Simple: buy a stock for a few pennies a share, then watch it become the next Microsoft or Netscape. If it doesn't work out, no big deal -- you haven't lost much. It is on this lottery mentality that a huge, often shady industry is built. A penny stock, though, is no bargain when the company's worthless, so some small companies simply bribe brokers to buy their stocks for clients. Now you might well say that those clients are just being punished for their greed -- and should have known better. But that wasn't good enough for the F.B.I., which a year ago set up a sham brokerage office in a sting to trap crooked stock promoters. Last week, in what was called "the largest single set of securities arrests ever made," at least 36 people were arrested, including officers of three companies whose stock was being pushed. The moral: A penny stock not bought is usually a penny saved.
 
THE NATION'S BILLS
 
Northeast Picks Up the Tab
It's common knowledge that the Northeast and Midwest, with their decaying cities and welfare crises, are a drag on the national economy. New York, Newt Gingrich has said, cannot expect Washington to subsidize its "culture of waste." But a study out last week shows that the geographic effect is most decidedly the other way around: the North contributes more in taxes to Federal coffers than it gets in Federal spending, with the South running a surplus. To put it more bluntly, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is always willing to do: New York has been subsidizing Mr. Gingrich's home state of Georgia for years. And to put it in dollars, every resident of Connecticut -- which, willingly or not, is the most openhearted state -- sends more than $2,000 to sunnier climes. Of course, as one Southerner put it, many Northerners head south to retire -- and thus the extra contribution is justified.

HEADLINE: What Works;
Farewell, Welfare State

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
WHEN the deadline approached for states to file their plans for complying with the new Federal welfare legislation, Tennessee was ready. Submitting a 60-page plan that reflected its reputation for innovation in improving and cutting costs in programs for the poor, the state was one of only 25 that met the Oct. 1 deadline. Most others, including New York, are going to be late.
And it's not just those states that aren't ready. Seronya Bell, a 21-year-old mother of two in Nashville, sees denial all around her. "This welfare reform is for real, but some people are playing it off like it isn't going to happen." she said.
 
 
 
Anticipating the End
 
 Ms. Bell completed a program here, privately run and subsidized by the city and state, that trains welfare recipients to be cashiers and store clerks. It began three years ago, well before today's much-heralded brave new world without welfare as we know it.
The training project has not only been adapted and broadened for the new welfare law, but it has also been made a part of another new program: the Federal Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program, which channels funds to economic development in poor neighborhoods.
For some officials, Nashville, with its South Nashville Enterprise Community, is an advertisement for the Federal program, which both Vice President Al Gore and his opponent, Jack Kemp, lauded in their debate Wednesday.
Begun two years ago, the empowerment zone program challenged cities nationwide to compete for funds by bringing local money and businesses together to promote jobs and economic independence. The grand prize, $100 million in Federal aid that could be drawn over a 10-year period, would be earmarked for six urban areas to be designated "empowerment zones."
Cities that fell short of the big prize would be eligible for a $3 million prize that could also be spread over 10 years, although most cities would want to collect it far faster. Most of the cities that applied reasoned that, having already done the hard work of assembling their resources, they might as well go forward with a more modest scheme.
It was a decision that Federal planners hoped they would make. Even without the grand prize, Nashville and 94 other cities now have job development programs that run mostly on their own power with state and private funds and with just a little Federal grease.
"Nashville is getting $3 million in Federal money which they have leveraged into more than $30 million in funds for the enterprise community," said Andrew Cuomo, the assistant secretary for economic development in the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversaw the competition.
Tennessee has been a leader in programs for the poor. Its two-year-old TennCare program has received high marks for providing managed care to about 750,000 people, including many of the working poor as well as former Medicaid recipients.
In Nashville, the enterprise program brought together several ideas that had already proved successful. The local housing authority, which runs the enterprise community program, approached the directors of a job training and employment program for welfare recipients run by Dollar General Stores, the discount chain, and the Nashville Y.W.C.A. This program, which started out as a simple literacy program for residents in a public housing project who received welfare, had blossomed into a larger effort that had successfully trained 88 people like Ms. Bell, now a full-time employee of Dollar General.
Nashville also brought in a small-business training firm, Total Rededication and Commitment, which had a four-year-old program called "Working Smart." This program was already helping welfare recipients turn some of their homegrown and often illegal businesses -- hair braiding, baby-sitting and baking -- into legitimate operations.
Then the city relocated these programs to South Nashville, an area of about 14,000 people in the shadow of the elevated roadways of Interstate 40, where 42 percent of the residents live in poverty and 12 percent are unemployed. There, the city set up satellite branches of the police, fire and code enforcement departments, plus offices for the case workers from the Tennessee Department of Human Services.
It became apparent, after the city organized community planning meetings, that the enterprise center should also include locally owned businesses. The Dollar General Store, with its built-in training program for people on welfare, agreed to serve as an anchor for the center.
 
 
 
Like the Old Days
 Jesse Clark, a retired airline baggage handler who has lived in the community for 32 years, recently stood in Charles Jackson's newly opened dry cleaning store at the center, recalling neighborhood streets once alive with nightclubs, markets, clothing stores and even half a dozen dry cleaners to choose from.
"People started moving out because they got the opportunity to do better, and you can't blame them for that," Mr. Clark said. "But it looked like everything just went down, and the businesses just couldn't make it anymore. But this is good, this cleaners. I think a lot of people will start coming here instead of driving two or three miles to the next nearest one."
The new storefronts also house a graduate of the "Working Smart" program, Nella Pearl Frierson, who received help with business skills and in setting up a business and finding commercial space. Her business, Pearl's Pearl Braid Shop, is next to Mr. Jackson's shop.
For about 15 years before that, Ms. Frierson said, she was doing braids at home and depending on welfare payments so she could be with her young children. Recalling that time, she said that not only was it limiting "but there was hair everywhere in my house."

HEADLINE: Non-Starters;
A Missing Issue In the Big Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is possibly the most conse quential and the most neglected -- issue in the 1996 campaign: that the next President could shift the balance of the Supreme Court well into the next century.
Early this year, the Court seemed to be at the top of the political docket. In the Republican primaries, Patrick J. Buchanan lashed out at the Justices as asserting "centralized control over every moral, political, social and economic issue in the country." And in April, Bob Dole declared that President Clinton's judicial appointments had set off a "crisis" in the courts and that his re-election would undermine the judiciary with an "all-star team of liberal leniency."
 
 
 
Not a Word
 
 But since then, the High Court has essentially been abandoned as an applause line on the campaign trail. Although Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole uttered roughly 15,000 words between them in their debate last Sunday, the Supreme Court did not arise once -- despite the prospect of perhaps three of the nine Justices retiring in the next four years: William H. Rehnquist, the 72-year-old Chief Justice, may be ready to move on and write books; Justices John Paul Stevens, 76, and Sandra Day O'Connor, 66, have had health problems.
"What started out as a story during the primaries has become a non-story during the campaign but may be a major story after the election," said David M. O'Brien, a professor of government at the University of Virginia who is an authority on the Court. He said that sooner or later the stakes would draw wide attention: "If we retain Republican control of the Senate, we're probably going to get clearly moderate judges from Clinton. If Dole wins, you would have more right-wing judges -- a replay of the Reagan era."
As its term opened last week, the Court itself made clear that it would confront numerous issues that have serious political implications and could affect millions of Americans, from doctor-assisted suicide to gun control to English-only laws to voting rights.
But there have been no recent dramas to draw public attention to the Court's work or its members. In 1992, the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas was still a hot topic at kaffeeklatches; in 1988, memories of the fierce campaign that defeated Robert H. Bork's nomination were still fresh.
"For people who care about judicial appointments, this can be the deal-breaker," said Ann Lewis, deputy manager of the Clinton campaign, who added that most voters were more concerned with everyday pocketbook issues.
Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton, the first Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court, has been so careful to pick moderates that it was difficult for the Republicans, including Mr. Dole, to make them an issue. After all, Mr. Dole voted for the confirmation of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, as well as virtually every one of the President's appointees to the Federal bench.
"If Clinton had appointed the liberal equivalents of Thomas and Antonin Scalia, then he might have scared Republicans," said Robert A. Carp, a political scientist at the University of Houston and an expert on the judiciary. "But the main criticism of Breyer was that he had too many holdings in Lloyd's of London."
In a campaign season, raising the Supreme Court as an issue is often most useful for Democrats who want to energize their constituencies, notably feminists and homosexuals, who watch the Court closely on issues related to their personal lives. But the closest the Democrats have come this year to making such an appeal was Vice President Al Gore's declaration at the convention that Republicans "want a President who will appoint the next three Justices of the Supreme Court so they can control all three branches of Government and take away a woman's right to choose."
Right now, Mr. Clinton is so far ahead in the polls that he does not particularly need to take up the issue -- and invite the Republicans to attack him anew as a liberal. The President may also be reluctant because he was widely ridiculed for imperiling judicial independence last March when he hinted that he might ask for the resignation of Judge Harold Baer Jr. of the Southern District of New York, who was widely criticized for throwing out evidence in a drug case.
And if Mr. Dole has not focused on the issue, it is in part because many conservatives no longer view changing the Court as integral to their political strategy. Many foes of abortion, for instance, think it is fruitless, for now, to try to overturn the Supreme Court's decision permitting abortion and are instead pressing their causes legislatively -- like the effort to ban late-term abortions.
At times, the Court has been a prominent issue in Presidential campaigns dating back to Jefferson. Abraham Lincoln was carried to the White House in 1860 by hammering at the Dred Scott decision on slavery. Richard Nixon vowed in the 1968 campaign to remake a court that he accused of "strengthening the criminal forces." Ronald Reagan campaigned in 1980 and 1984 with a vow to work to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision permitting abortion, as well as earlier rulings forbidding officially sanctioned prayer in public schools.
Four years ago, Mr. Clinton campaigned vigorously for what he said was "an America where we have a Supreme Court which will respect our Constitution, protect women's right to choose and protect the rights of all Americans." He was lambasted by President Bush at the Republican convention in 1992 for dangling the prospect of naming Mario Cuomo as a Justice -- something Mr. Clinton would not dare do this year.
Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, said that his candidate's references to "liberal judges" in speeches in April and May had "clearly struck a chord" and that he continued to make the point in campaign appearances. But he said Mr. Dole had no intention of floating names of his own possible choices.
Both candidates are well aware that voters who struggle to name their representative in Congress are certainly not about to base their Presidential vote on a potential Supreme Court vacancy. As Mr. Carp put it: "The court is an amorphous blob to most Americans. More people know who Judge Wapner is than Chief Justice Rehnquist."

HEADLINE: L.A. Story;
What Is Made of Broken Promises

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOUR and a half years after an ambitious campaign was launched to revitalize the neighborhoods left smoldering by a three-day spasm of rioting here, the effort seemed last week to have come down to little more than a couple of sound bites in the Vice Presidential debate.
Jack Kemp used the disaster as an excuse to tear into the Clinton Administration for failing to make the poor, stricken area a so-called empowerment zone with large-scale Government financing. 
 That prompted Vice President Al Gore to counter that the Clinton Administration was instead underwriting a community development bank in Los Angeles that would provide $430 million in grants and loans.
The candidates then moved on, but the exchange was apt, turning as it did on abstruse policy distinctions and seemingly huge commitments of money that had an uncertain relationship to the struggle for rebirth in South Central Los Angeles.
In fact, the history of the efforts to rebuild the afflicted neighborhoods has been filled with frustration, symbolized by the announcement last Wednesday that Rebuild L.A., the organization hastily formed to bring jobs and hope to the city's poor areas after the riots in April 1992, would shut down. It was an announcement that carried a mixed message, however, bringing an unexpected glimmer of hope despite the continuing gloom.
Unemployment among young blacks is still estimated at more than 40 percent in some of the hardest-hit areas, while big corporations have come up nearly $200 million short of the $580 million in investments originally promised at well-attended news conferences. That amount is a fraction of the $6 billion that McKinsey & Company had estimated would be required to create the 90,000 jobs needed by residents in the neighborhoods. And only half of the 32 supermarkets that were supposed to bring convenience, lower prices and jobs to the area have been built.
But for small businessmen like Francisco Pinedo, standing in the bustling furniture factory he owns in South Central, the legacy of Rebuild L.A. brought with it a more important lesson: the larger business community had finally discovered that there was a little-known but vibrant manufacturing sector on which to build the area's future.
Mr. Pinedo said his company, Cisco Brothers Design, which has 118 employees and about $9 million in annual sales, would not have moved near the epicenter of the worst violence had Rebuild L.A. not opened his eyes to this simple truth.
"They persuaded me to look at the area in a new way, to see things you never read about in the papers," said Mr. Pinedo. "I can tell you, at first I really didn't even want to look. I said: 'I grew up there. I don't want to go back.' "
In addition to finding numerous other manufacturers and suppliers, he said, he found a large and willing work force eager for jobs paying about $8 an hour. He found, in short, an economic backbone that outsiders, including many of the city's political and business leaders never knew existed, but is now the quiet focus of a potentially more deep-rooted effort to bring new life to South Central and the other damaged neighborhoods.

 
 
A Failed Approach
 Most experts now agree that the original approach of Rebuild L.A., while well intentioned, was misguided because of ignorance about the local economy. The first chairman, the former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who quit after a year of criticism over a lack of results, was brought in partly because of his business contacts. He lined up commitments from big corporations like I.B.M. and Hughes Aircraft on the assumption that only major private investment from outside could transform the area, and he proclaimed that his program would be a prototype for the nation.
Some of those investments were quite successful in providing jobs and training, but within a year, some of the other companies denied ever making the commitments and the effort was clearly in trouble.
"Those announcements were window dressing," said Juanita Tate, head of Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles, which has been building low-income housing. "A lot of these companies would sing in the choir on Sunday morning, but at the Wednesday prayer meeting, they weren't there."
Rebuild L.A. hit on one of its first and, some argue, most enduring successes in 1994 when it brought in a new president, Linda Griego, a former deputy mayor for economic development, who proposed a survey of businesses in South Central, Pico-Union and other riot-damaged areas near downtown Los Angeles.
"When I asked about a survey, there was disbelief," Ms. Griego said. "People said I had to be a sort of Don Quixote. But it was clear that the original programs weren't working and all we had was just anecdotal stuff, like, 'We know there's a factory on this corner.' "
The surveys were conducted during the last two years, and the results astonished many people.
According to one report by two professors at California State University at Los Angeles, released early this year, there are about 317,000 jobs in the damaged areas, of which 222,000 are held by local residents -- an insufficient number, but a solid base that many believe can be built on. Those areas have 87,000 manufacturing jobs, or 10 percent of the county's total, mostly in shops with 50 or fewer employees. Nearly half of those jobs are in the garment industry, while many others are in the furniture, retail and metal fabrication industries.
"The conventional wisdom was that the factories had long since closed down and moved elsewhere," said Allen J. Scott, associate dean of the School of Public Policy and Social Research at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It took us a while to realize that there were a lot of jobs, perhaps not quality jobs, but jobs nonetheless."
Rebuild L.A. eventually refocused its work on two programs, one to bring retail stores to the areas by assembling large sites, and another to bring information and expertise to the thousands of small manufacturers so they could improve their product quality and wages. Those programs will now be taken over by a group of local community colleges.
Mr. Pinedo, for instance, said he realized his company could never undercut the prices of manufacturers in places like Taiwan, so he has focused quite successfully on original designs and more expensive couches, chairs and other furniture. Wages are rising.
There are still grave concerns about the poverty and hopelessness of these neighborhoods, and Ms. Griego, Professor Scott and several other civic leaders think rioting could break out again, given the right spark. Still, Ms. Griego said, there had been progress of a sort. "The point is to create upward mobility," she said. "You have to have a sense that things can get better, and that is happening on some scale.
"That never happened before because there was this wall of ignorance," she added. "It's almost like two people being introduced for the first time after just hearing rumors about each other."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
For Hispanic Poor, No Silver Lining

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS Federal agencies issued a torrent of cheery reports in the last few weeks about rising incomes, falling poverty rates and improvements in educational performance, one group bucked the trends: Hispanic people.
For the first time, in fact, a higher proportion of Hispanic people than of blacks were officially defined as poor -- a consequence, in part, of dramatic increases in the income of black households, but also of declining incomes among Hispanic households. Now, experts are wondering whether Hispanic people, who for years occupied a kind of socio-economic middle kingdom between the relative prosperity of whites and the relative despair of blacks, are tumbling to the bottom of the country's economic heap.

 
 
Bittersweet for Blacks
 
 Some blacks see the trends as bittersweet. They wonder whether, with so many blacks still mired in poverty, their plight will become even less visible if Hispanic poverty takes center stage. Yesterday, in what was billed as the first march of its kind, thousands of Hispanic demonstrators converged on Washington to demand more immigrant rights and a higher minimum wage.
Income figures help explain the demonstration. Recently, the Census Bureau reported that for the first time in six years, median household income rose for the country over all, increasing by 2.7 per cent in 1995. The 3.6 percent increase in median black income was particularly dramatic. Meanwhile, though, median household income among Hispanics fell by 5.1 percent.
The overall proportion of people living in poverty dropped last year; the percentage of blacks who are poor dipped below 30 percent for the first time since 1959. Yet, poverty rates for Hispanic people didn't change.
Economists say a surge in Hispanic immigrants may be one reason for the overall decline in income among Hispanic people, but not the only one.
This month the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of young black adults who had completed high school had reached about 87 percent -- reaching parity with young whites for the first time. But Hispanic youngsters lagged behind at 57 percent.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for Hispanic people, which was generally much lower than for blacks in the 1970's and 1980's, matched it in 1995.
So more spotlights are being focused on the Hispanic households that are lagging behind in economic and educational achievements. "When a group goes down in a relatively good economic year, I think more people tend to notice," said Chuck Nelson, assistant chief of the Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division of the Census Bureau.
And all the depressing news comes at a time of increasing Hispanic political agitation in the wake of legislation passed by Congress on immigration and welfare.

 
 
The Immigrant Question
 The key question is, to what extent are high levels of immigration pulling down the overall economic performance of Hispanic people? Given the current atmosphere surrounding immigration, the dispute is more than just a scholarly exercise.
"It's so politically charged," said Steven Camarota, a resident scholar with the Center for Immigration Studies.
The recent Census Bureau report indicated that median household income among all native born people increased last year by 3.7 percent, while the income for households maintained by foreign-born individuals remained unchanged. And several recent studies, including one by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicate that the large wave of immigrants has driven down wages among low-income workers, a segment of the population in which Hispanic workers -- native born and immigrant -- are heavily represented.
But other factors may be at work. Hispanic advocacy groups like the National Council of La Raza point out that, among Hispanic people, Puerto Ricans have one of the highest rates of poverty. They make up more than 10 per cent of the Hispanic population and, by definition, are native-born citizens.
Researchers also point out that while high school completion rates among Mexican-Americans, by far the largest group of Hispanic people, jump dramatically between first and second generation immigrants, the rates stagnate among third generation Mexican-Americans -- those whose parents were born in the United States. Indeed, for some groups, including those aged 25 to 29, the high school dropout rate is higher among third generation Mexican Americans than it is among their parents.
The current demographics of the Hispanic community also bring down the median household income. The Hispanic population is much younger than the rest of the country, and younger workers tend to earn less than older ones. And fewer Hispanic women work outside the home than white or black women.
What seems indisputable however, is this: For now, Hispanic people are stuck at the low end of the labor force and are subject to the chilling trends that buffet all low income workers in this country -- globalization of the economy, the loss of manufacturing jobs, poor performance of schools in low income areas and, yes, immigration.
"It's really easy to divert attention away from the issue of poverty because it's a hard issue, it's a complex issue," said Sonia Perez, director of the poverty project at the National Council of La Raza. "It's a lot easier to say, it's immigrants and it will go away in two or three generations. It's a lot harder to say it has to do with low wages and low education and high unemployment and how do you create jobs. Those things have policy responses. But they're hard and they're harder to talk about, especially in this climate."

HEADLINE: Log On and Chat About Shoe Polish

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
AT the dawn of the graffiti age in the 1970's, New York City teen-agers spray-painted subway cars as a way to reach a mass audience extending from, say, the Bronx Zoo to Brooklyn College in a single hour. Today, their curlicues can loom across entire continents many times faster than a bullet train, traveling on what could be called the Information Supersubway.
And the police keep on chasing. 
 Hundreds of graffiti Web sites have popped up on the Internet in the last couple of years in languages from Spanish to Serbo-Croatian. American graffiti painters and their promoters are leading the way with flashy Web pages complete with E-mail, radiant graphics and instructions for other vandals to create their own pages. But the British, Canadians, Germans, Hungarians, Japanese, Swedes and Swiss are not far behind.

 
 
Finland Heard From
 "The owner of these pages does not wish to encourage any illegal activity that may be shown on this site," states a disclaimer on the Helsinki Connection, one of several Finnish graffiti Web sites. "I'm only showing it to the rest of the world 'cus I like to look at it."
An Italian Web site called the Hip-Hop Zone shows walls full of graffiti amid a lush bed of orange tiger lilies. Norway Graf is grittier, with the initials of a graffiti vandal scrawled contemptuously across a vacant police car.
From its title, Bomb Australia sounds violent, but it may well show one of the prettiest images on the Internet: an old-fashioned train, its headlights and front bumper lightly adorned with golden graffiti paint, traveling through a shady, bucolic village.
Murales Populares Chilenos takes a revolutionary tone. It includes graffiti works with the titles "Raise Up Armed People!" and "Justice and Punishment for the Guilty!" as well as a list of the major economists who served Gen. Augusto Pinochet's old dictatorship for any potential harassers who may need it. Nevertheless, these radical Chileans also have a soft touch: their Web site includes a promotion for the Christian Singles Network of Greater Miami.
"I can visit the Louvre on the Net, or some defaced building," said Robert W. Lerner, a New York City detective whose efforts to track the comings and goings of international graffiti vandals on the Internet have contributed to several arrests by the New York transit police.
"The problem is the Internet is going to increase a person's ability to obtain information about graffiti," he said. "It's just like the gang member who once said he learned about drive-by shootings by watching 'The Untouchables' on television."
One morning last week, Detective Lerner found among the graffiti Web sites a detailed blueprint of the 207th Street subway yard on the northern tip of Manhattan -- a valuable resource for any vandal seeking to penetrate Transit Authority security. Clearly distressed, he said: "This is not something the Transit Authority would put out on their Web site. We'll have to get in touch with transit security."
Detective Lerner also clicked on to a bulletin board commonly used by graffiti vandals from around the world. It would take hours to read all the messages, but several of the subject titles interested him, including one headed, "Subject: re: homemade markers."

 
 
Try Walgreen's
 "Who has any recipes for homemade inks?" messaged "Tyler," who apparently lives in New York or some other city where merchants cannot legally sell spray paint to minors.
There was an answer below: "The recipe for destruction is at your local Walgreen's, and it's probably been right under your nose a few times." What followed was a recipe based on Griffin shoe polish.
"That's great intelligence," exclaimed Detective Lerner, who added that he would alert members of the transit police vandal squad to keep their eyes peeled for youths carrying unusual amounts of shoe polish.
"Re: where are the writers?" was another message title that interested Detective Lerner, since he is always on the lookout for vandal recruiters. When he scrolled down, the message read: "Does any one remember that Irish guy that was talking about bombing in Dublin? What's his address?"
Detective Lerner said dryly, "That's somebody else's problem."

Just What Is The Burmese Problem?

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
THE military rulers here, in what used to be called Burma, know they have a problem. Derided as thugs by Western nations, they recognize that even at home their harshest critic, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is the most popular personality in the nation.
Actually, that's only one problem. A bigger one -- for them and the rest of the world -- is that they don't seem to realize how big a problem they have. 
 Rather than accepting the clear preference of their people, the leaders say -- and they appear to believe -- that they have a "historic mission" to maintain stability and order while engineering a transition to a limited form of representative government that would institutionalize military rule. In the meantime, said a Government spokesman, Col. Kyaw Thein, recently, "there is no need for an opposition group in Myanmar."
The argument was made with unapologetic bluntness in a recent commentary in the English-language Government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar: "The existing government is not a weak political government which canvassed for votes by smiling at people, gave a lot of promises and collected votes here and there and came to power. It is a strong and firm Tatmadaw [Burmese military] government which came into existence according to demands of history."
All of which offends much of the rest of the world, even as it makes it very difficult for the rest of the world to figure out how to confront the Burmese military.
In Asia as well as the West, the clearly repressive nature of the Government, and its tendency to isolate itself, generates considerable criticism. Pressure is mounting in the United States to impose some sort of economic sanctions. But this is Asia, where the Burmese leaders' distrust of sanctions and rejection of foreign interference have strong echoes in such places as China and Singapore. And that makes it unlikely that Myanmar will ever go without trading partners.
Earlier this month, President Clinton signed a law that would allow him to impose economic sanctions on Myanmar in the event of "large-scale repression" by the military. It is a tactic advocated by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, to the fury of the military rulers.
Some supporters of an embargo argue that large-scale repression is already under way and say the time for sanctions has already arrived. Others warn that once sanctions are applied, Washington will lose the only leverage it may have to deter further repression.
Proponents cite the example of South Africa, where an economic embargo helped end apartheid. But analysts in Asia say the situation here is very different: most of Myanmar's trade is with its Southeast Asian neighbors, and those nations have made it clear they will not sever their fast-growing economic links.
Nevertheless, in recent days, the seven members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which opposes sanctions, have shown the first signs of applying their own form of gentle pressure, which they call "constructive engagement" -- on the theory that economic ties create greater leverage with which to press for changes. Myanmar was accorded observer status in the association in July, a step toward full membership. But in light of recent events there, both Thailand and the Philippines now say they may oppose the nation's early admission next year as a full member.
And even in Singapore and Malaysia -- firm advocates of "non-interference" in the internal affairs of other nations -- some officials have begun to express uneasiness over Myanmar's behavior.
"We view what is happening in Burma with some concern and hope the Government of Burma will be able to deal with it in a manner acceptable to all," said the Malaysian Foreign Minister, Abdullah Badawi, in a departure from his nation's stance of public support.

 
 
An Unbending Stance
 But constructive engagement, too, is likely to have only limited effect. Recent statements by Government officials make it clear that Myanmar has no intention of giving full freedom to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, or of allowing full and free-wheeling democracy in the future.
History is not encouraging. The ruling junta came to power in 1988 after crushing a peaceful pro-democracy uprising with a crackdown that took the lives of hundreds of people. Two years later, the generals annulled an election when Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory. She was kept under house arrest for six years -- until July 1995 -- and in recent months the military leaders have stepped up arrests of her supporters while choking off free speech and political activity.
"All the people do not like the Government," said a civil servant, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals. "Aung San Suu Kyi would win an election any time. But there is nothing we can do because they have the guns."
The continuing program of arrests appears to be aimed at eviscerating Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party organization, leaving her as a lone and politically powerless symbol. In a recent speech, the leader of the military Government, Gen. Than Shwe, called the arrests and a temporary blockade of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house "mild" actions. In the future, he said, "preventive measures and drastic action will have to be taken in the interests of the nation and the people against attempts to destabilize the nation." And at a press conference this month, Col. Kyaw Thein seemed to leave Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi little room for public activity. Among her transgressions, he said, were frequent meetings with foreign diplomats and reporters, including 13 press conferences since her release from house arrest.
A recent commentary in The New Light of Myanmar called democratic freedoms a Western notion that can retard economic growth. The paper seemed in awe of China, which it said had become "amazingly rich" by fostering capitalism without political freedoms. "To sum this up," it said, "if capitalism is to be continued, then there is need for a dictatorial government."

Follow The Money

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
A few days ago there was an intriguing article in Iraq's most influential newspaper, Babel, criticizing the Iraqi Government for lifting all the restrictions and roadblocks on trade between northern Iraq and the rest of the country. Why? Well, northern Iraq, when it was under U.S-allied control, had de facto open borders with the world and you could buy anything there. The rest of Iraq, though, was under U.N. economic embargo. So when Saddam Hussein's Kurds drove the pro-U.S. Kurds out of northern Iraq, and reintegrated it with the rest of the country, Iraqi traders went on a shopping spree. Suddenly, they could get all sorts of previously banned goods through northern Iraq. And how did they buy them? By selling their Iraqi dinars for dollars on the black market. And what happened to the Iraqi dinar? It dropped 30 percent, going from 1,150 to the dollar to 1,550.
Babel's front-page editorial thundered that while the recovery of northern Iraq has great "nationalist and political meaning that Iraq's land is one," integrating it economically was a disaster. But the best part of the story is this: Guess who owns Babel? Saddam Hussein's evil son, Uday. 
 Think about that: The U.S. is bemoaning Saddam's great victory in northern Iraq, while Saddam's son is running editorials complaining that this "victory" is costing a fortune and probably undermining his own monopoly on the smuggling of goods through northern Iraq for resale at exorbitant prices.
Which brings us to the point: The only way to hurt Saddam is not by setting up a bigger "no-fly zone," but by setting up a bigger "no-buy zone." Forget his radar. Go for his wallet. His regime is built on two pillars: the Republican Guards and money. If we're not going to attack the Guards, let's at least attack his cash flow.
Here's an economic war plan:
1. Print dinars. The U.S. should flood Iraq with counterfeit Iraqi dinars. It would wreak havoc. Because the U.S. has blocked the sale of money-printing presses, ink and paper to Iraq, Washington can already print better Iraqi money than Baghdad can.
2. Many oil traders believe Saddam is funding himself by playing the oil futures market. The world oil market has very little surplus right now. The only way it could loosen up is if Iraq, with its capacity to pump three to four million barrels a day, were to comply with U.N. resolutions and get out from under the U.N. oil embargo. That's why it is relatively easy for Saddam to manipulate the market. If he hints that Iraq will comply with the U.N., he can send prices falling; if he hints that Iraq won't comply, he can send prices rising. And if he does it in a calculated way, he can make a fortune on oil futures.
Ironically, the best way to rob Saddam of that power is by going ahead with U.N. resolution 986, which would allow him to sell $2 billion worth of oil that could only be used to buy food and medicine for his people. That oil would certainly loosen the market. No one knows that better than Saddam, which is why every time it seems as if 986 is going to happen, he does something to scuttle it. Saddam also doesn't want so much food flooding into Iraq under independent U.N. auspices. He prefers being embargoed, because he and his supporters control most smuggling into Iraq, from which they reap much cash.
3. According to U.S. intelligence, Saddam has used $2 billion of his covert income to build 50 palaces, for himself, his family and close supporters, since the end of the gulf war. One of the largest, near Lake Tharthar, is five times the size of the White House. The next time the U.S. bombs Iraq it should destroy them all. It would cost Saddam a fortune to rebuild them -- and their existence would be exposed to every Iraqi.
4. Many oil traders believe Saddam is also earning a steady income by shipping oil on small boats from Umm Qasr to Iran, where it is sold on the market. U.S. divers should arrange for some "accidents" to happen to those ships.
The best way to trigger fighting in Saddam's family is by shrinking the pie they feast from. The only people in Saddam's family who have ever been killed are his two sons-in-law, who were murdered by Uday's forces in a dispute that originated over money. Rumor has it that when Saddam got mad at Uday last year and decided to punish him, he did so by personally dousing Uday's antique sports car collection with gasoline and torching it.
Saddam really knows how to hurt a guy. So should we. Follow the money.

HEADLINE: Paris Blames U.S. Position For Setback Over NATO

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Prospects that France will rejoin NATO's military command structure have been seriously set back, French officials say, by Washington's refusal to consider putting a European officer in charge of the alliance's southern command, which includes the United States Sixth Fleet.
"Either the Americans give in or we don't go in," a high-ranking Defense Ministry official said, referring to the unified command structure from which de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 in protest against American domination. 
President Jacques Chirac softened that position a year ago, saying France would return to full military participation if the alliance was modified to reflect greater European military self-reliance in the post-cold-war era.
Mr. Chirac's pledge was warmly welcomed at the time by Clinton Administration officials, even though the three-decade estrangement has been as much symbolic as practical. France has continued to be a partner in the alliance and has contributed a large share of the NATO force now deployed in Bosnia.
Mr. Chirac did not challenge the right of the United States to name NATO's military chief in Europe, currently Gen. George A. Joulwan, or its naval commander for the Atlantic, based in Norfolk, Va.
But in August, diplomats from other European countries say, France surprised its allies by insisting on European control of the two main NATO ground commands that will be left on the continent when the alliance expands to accept new members from Eastern and Central Europe after next year.
Of these two commands, one, Allied Forces Southern Europe in Naples, has always been under the command of an American admiral. At a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Norway last month, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the United States believed that it was "essential" that this arrangement continue.
The French Defense Minister, Charles Millon, said France would "remain in its current position" in the alliance -- politically, but not militarily except in special cases like the peacekeeping force in Bosnia -- unless the United States changed its mind about the Naples command.
American and French officials said this week that neither side was likely to yield on the issue before the Presidential election in the United States.
"France will not go in if three out of four major NATO commands after reorganization remain in American hands," an official close to Mr. Millon said. "No hard feelings. We understand that the United States has its reasons to be particularly concerned about the Sixth Fleet, but we would have a political problem here if we gave in now."
Mr. Chirac's center-right parliamentary coalition is fragile, with the Government's unpopularity and unemployment both at record levels. There is no strong military or political lobby here for taking France's military back into the NATO command structure, and there have been periodic potshots from Mr. Chirac's Gaullist ranks at the marked improvement in relations with Washington since he was elected President last year.
If the United States insists on keeping the southern command, European influence within the alliance would be "very limited," one of Mr. Chirac's most influential parliamentary supporters, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said this week. "This would be rather far from what would be necessary for France to reintegrate" with NATO, he added.
Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels counter that the United States has agreed to give sweeping new powers to the alliance's European deputy supreme commander and is prepared to share command responsibility in subordinate commands. But most of the allies see little sense, one NATO diplomat said, in French proposals to give the southern command to a European, with a separate American command for the Sixth Fleet.
"The French have overplayed their hand," another European official said. "Most of the European allies won't say so publicly, but they're sitting on the fence, and if the United States insists on keeping the southern command, they will go along with Washington."
A summit meeting in mid-1997 would provide an opportunity for Mr. Chirac to settle the issue with whoever wins the American Presidential election, the French say. But with little support from any American quarter for putting United States forces under the command of foreigners, officials in Paris may have miscalculated.
Mr. Chirac would then be in the position of having to pursue his own ambitious program for cutting and reorganizing the 500,000-member French armed forces outside the NATO framework preferred by his principal European allies.

HEADLINE: Under New Law, Nursing Homes Might Reject Legal Immigrants

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
For the first time, nursing homes are checking the immigration status of applicants for admission, and they expect to exclude many elderly immigrants who will become ineligible for Medicaid because of the new welfare law.
Medicaid is unavailable to most immigrants entering the United States after Aug. 22, the date President Clinton signed the welfare bill. 
 Many nursing home residents have qualified for Medicaid because they received Supplemental Security Income, a form of cash assistance for the needy aged, blind and disabled. But the welfare law eliminates Supplemental Security Income for most legal immigrants, including many already in this country.
While no patient is known to have been rejected to date, Cynthia Rudder, director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of New York State, a consumer group, said she was deeply concerned about what would happen to those who lost Medicaid coverage. And Linda Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care Association, representing 11,000 nursing homes, said she shared that concern. Ms. Rudder said, "These are elderly, chronically ill people who would lose not only their health care, but also a place to live."
The Government does not have reliable data on the number of immigrants in nursing homes because the homes had no particular need to collect and update such information. "Up till now, Medicaid never distinguished between the legal resident and the citizen," said Lee Partridge, coordinator of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors.
LuMarie Polivka-West, policy director of the Florida Health Care Association, said the restrictions could affect 2,880 elderly immigrants in nursing homes in the Miami area. "Many have been in the United States for some time but will have difficulty obtaining citizenship because they have Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia," she said.
Martin E. Casper, executive director of Greynolds Park Manor, a 324-bed nursing home in North Miami Beach, said: "I don't want to put some poor elderly lady or gentleman in a gurney and wheel them out to the parking lot of my nursing home and say, 'You must stay there because I'm not being paid.' But noncitizens in need of skilled nursing-facility care will have a harder time being admitted. Nursing homes won't take them if there is no source of payment. I'm not going to admit them. No businessman would."
Gary D. Macomber, executive vice president of the California Association of Health Facilities, said that 12,000 to 15,000 of the 100,000 nursing home residents in that state were legal immigrants who had not become citizens. "We don't know what the State Legislature will do," he said, "but it's our impression that many of them will eventually lose their coverage. California health officials said that 200 illegal immigrants in nursing homes would also lose Medicaid coverage.
In New York, Edward J. Stafford, executive director of the New York State Health Facilities Association, said: "Nursing homes right now are very hesitant to admit anyone if they're not sure he or she is a U.S. citizen. Some noncitizens have been in nursing homes for years, and we've been caring for them without question. But the new law will put them at risk. If all of a sudden their Medicaid benefits are cut off, obviously health care facilities can't afford to provide free care."
Mr. Stafford said nursing homes in New York received an average of $160 a day for each Medicaid patient.
William J. Pascocello, administrator of the Florence Nightingale Health Center, a 561-bed nursing home in Manhattan, said: "Significant numbers of immigrants have never achieved citizenship but have been in this country for years and years. They could be 80 or 90 years old. Many are women. We have a pretty good melting pot here -- people from Romania, Russia, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Tibet. We have a whole floor of Chinese-speaking residents. I have no idea how to go about testing their eligibility. If they worked at all, it was probably in the cash economy of Chinatown, where there are no records."
Permanent-resident aliens are exempt from the ban on public benefits if they can prove that they or their spouses or parents have worked in the United States for 10 years.
The welfare law is expected to save the Federal Government $54.6 billion over six years. The Congressional Budget Office said that 44 percent of that would come from restricting immigrants' benefits. Congress, obviously anticipating legal challenges, has justified the restrictions as the best way to achieve "the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy."
Lawmakers were especially concerned about the increase in noncitizens on Supplemental Security Income, a number that more than doubled from 1989 to last year, rising to 785,000 from 370,000. The Government plans to tell them in February and March that they will be cut off.
The Federal Government and the states share the cost of Medicaid. Bruce M. Bullen, the Medicaid director in Massachusetts, said of immigrants that "states may face the prospect of having to pick up, at state expense, the cost of their care."
While the general intent of Congress is clear, the actual provisions dealing with immigrants are complex and ambiguous. Most noncitizens will be automatically barred from food stamps and the Supplemental Security Income program, but states have some discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny Medicaid to noncitizens who were in the United States before Aug. 22.
In a letter to state officials this week, Judith D. Moore, acting director of the Medicaid Bureau at the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, said immigrants arriving here on or after Aug. 22 were generally ineligible for Medicaid for at least five years.
And, she said, before terminating Medicaid for those already on the rolls, states must perform "a redetermination of eligibility" to see if they are entitled to Medicaid for any other reason.
Prof. Sara Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said: "In many states, it is unlikely that there would be any alternative basis of Medicaid eligibility. When elderly and disabled adults lose S.S.I., they may have no other way to qualify for Medicaid."
Professor Rosenbaum said it was unrealistic for Congress to assume it could change welfare radically without affecting Medicaid. "You can't end welfare as we know it without ending Medicaid as we know it," she said. "Medicaid lives and breathes on welfare. It's a creature of the underlying welfare programs."
Amy S. Fleishman, chief operating officer of the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington, a 558-bed nursing home in Rockville, Md., said she had no idea who would pay for 26 residents, most of them Russians, who are not citizens. State officials have promised to continue Medicaid for immigrant children but have not made a commitment for elderly immigrants, she said.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Dusts Off Its Claim To Glamour

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12

 BODY:
For years now, the fanny-pack-toting innocents who ventured a few steps from Mann's Chinese Theater on their tour have stumbled upon the discovery that in a close-up, Hollywood -- the place, the decaying chunk of northwestern Los Angeles -- has little in common with the booming industry of the same name.
As they followed the Walk of Fame trail of stars on the sidewalks east along Hollywood Boulevard, past the occasional boarded-up shop and the peculiarly loitering young men with beepers or women in stilettos, many shared the reaction of Marlene Keith, a mother of five from the Cape Cod town of Dennisport, Mass. What she had expected, she said, was "glamorous and glitzy." What she had found was "shoddy and seedy." 
 "And a little scary," she added.
But these days, city officials and local merchants say, that image is changing. The turnaround of Hollywood -- its face lift, injections of capital and image-polishing -- has begun.
"Hollywood probably is the most valuable trademark in the world," said Gary Mendoza, the Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles. "Times Square has a level of international cachet that may not rival Hollywood's, and if Times Square can go through the renovation it's gone through, there's no reason in the world why we can't do the same."
Of course, Hollywood has gone through even harder times than 42d Street, what with earthquakes helping to literally bring down landmarks like the Brown Derby, the lingerie looting of Frederick's of Hollywood during the 1992 riots and recent sinkhole problems on Hollywood Boulevard brought on by subway construction. And it has not yet attracted the mega-investments that the Walt Disney Company and others are putting into Times Square.
But boosters point nonetheless to new ground for optimism and the increasingly recognized development potential of a mecca for more than nine million tourists a year.
City officials count at least $100 million in public and private money on its way into the district for 69 new developments and 36 renovations and expansions of museums, theaters, retail stores, restaurants and other projects. This coming week, they added, the American Film Institute will hold its film festival at Hollywood Boulevard's theaters for the first time, and the first meeting will be held for developers who may want to bid on a multimillion-dollar complex around the Hollywood subway portal that is to open in 1998.
As in the transformation of Times Square, 41 owners in Hollywood have banded together to create a small Business Improvement District, which will collect $600,000 a year from members to pay for a private security force and other improvements starting in December. The California Highway Patrol began deploying officers last month along the boulevard to crack down on the young people who traditionally cruise in their cars on weekends. The city is offering special loans and tax breaks to developers in Hollywood, and Richard Riordan, Los Angeles's business-friendly Mayor, has declared the area an economic priority.
Plans are also in the works to better exploit Hollywood's identity as the childhood home of the movies.
The new, 33,000-square-foot Hollywood Entertainment Museum, a few steps from Mann's, opened full time this week, offering visitors a stroll around the Starship Enterprise bridge and the bar used in "Cheers," among other attractions. The shuttered Max Factor makeup museum is scheduled to become a Hollywood history museum, and the Chamber of Commerce plans to post nearly 50 explanatory signs on the district's buildings -- noting, for example, that Clark Gable and Carole Lombard hid away at the Roosevelt Hotel and that gossipmonger Louella Parsons broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel.
Fueling the overall Hollywood revitalization are projects to renovate landmark theaters. The Egyptian Theater, built by Sid Grauman before he built the Chinese, is expected to reopen within two years as a showcase for American Cinematheque's classic movies. The ornate El Capitan, the Art Deco masterpiece that becomes the nation's top-grossing cinema when it holds premieres of Disney movies, has already been made over at a cost of $5 million, and more millions are going into refurbishing its upstairs office space.
And the entertainment business itself is growing in Hollywood, officials say. Most big studios -- except Paramount -- moved out years ago, but there is so much small-scale production and other entertainment work in Hollywood that there is a shortage of work space, said Julie Kleinick, former president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
"Contrary to popular belief, entertainment people want to be here, but they want a clean and safe environment," she said.
It was in the 1920's that the studios of Hollywood had their heyday. Though the area itself was always somewhat seedy, it started to go seriously downhill in the 1960's, struck by urban blight.
John F. Drap, a resident and retired Army sergeant now volunteering at the Entertainment Museum, said that in the early 80's, Hollywood "was a pit."
"I would not walk down Hollywood Boulevard after sundown because it was just a really bad place," he said. "It had gone down as far as it could go -- but now it's a great story of the revival of the inner city. It's just like Cleveland."
The real-life Hollywood experience can still be unpleasant, as witness the recent travails of Daryl Kamin, a tourist from Wisconsin who said he had been threateningly accosted twice by locals as he tried to videotape the sidewalk stars on the Walk of Fame.
"I'm still a little queasy," he said. "The day was soured for me. The atmosphere is thick with thuggery."
But a stroll down the Walk of Fame these days also entails encounters with dozens of uniformed people, from a security force in Smoky the Bear hats paid for by the city and the subway authority to a crew of cleaners wearing yellow "Hollywood Beautification Team" T-shirts. New palm trees tower across from the Chinese Theater, and the enterprising owners of Grand Central Coffee have even dared put tables out on the street -- though solidly chained.
Hollywood has been ripe for this kind of revival for years, said Leron Gubler, executive director of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, but it was held back by the recession, which has been slow to lift in California, along with endless bickering among local business people. The failure of several planned mega-projects also held things up, he said.
But now, Mr. Gubler and city officials said, the Hollywood turn-around is taking on momentum because everyone stopped waiting for one Disney-like savior and went ahead with a collection of smaller projects.
"There's always been a lot of interest but there's been nothing for people to hang on to, to invest in," Mr. Gubler said. "That has changed."

HEADLINE: MAIN STREET, JAPAN: Heading to the Polls;
Family and Friendship Guide Japanese Voting

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: OMIYA, Japan, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Waiting for customers to buy his octopus dumplings, Yukihiro Hatta puffed on a cigarette and explained that elections never make a tad of difference, but that he always votes.
"I'm really not interested in politics," said Mr. Hatta, a grizzled 63-year-old snack peddler whose white smock was lightly stained. A cheerful man whose warm face is full of laugh lines, Mr. Hatta is interested in friendships, however, and as he sees it that is the true rationale for voting. 
 "I'll vote," he said enthusiastically, relishing the chance to do his buddies a favor. "I always vote. I vote for the people my friends tell me to vote for."
As Japan gears up for a national election on Oct. 20, in small towns like Omiya people like Mr. Hatta are preparing to vote for reasons that have little to do with the candidates' policies or personalities.
At bottom, politics here are not political. Rather, electoral politics in places like Omiya rests on much deeper concepts of Japanese behavior that long predate ballots or democracy: notions of group identity, of hereditary entitlement, and especially of "giri," the sense of owing someone a debt or obligation.
Japanese politicians often inherit their seats in Parliament from their fathers or grandfathers, forming a modern aristocracy like the feudal lords of 150 years ago. Then, as happens in the United States as well, the politicians help towns like Omiya by allocating funds for roads or bridges, and the commoners pay fealty in the form of votes -- their own and those of people connected to them with bonds of giri.
Here in Omiya (pronounced OH-me-yuh), a sprawling town of 5,700 surrounded by mist-shrouded hills on the Kii Peninsula, 200 miles southwest of Tokyo, people are preparing for the election by delicately testing the links of giri that are the arteries and veins of small-town Japan.
"I hear that in the cities, people vote on the basis of policies, or on the basis of the person running," said Yoshiaki Okuyama, 44, a post office worker in Omiya. "But in local areas, it's not the policy or the person who counts, but the request from a friend or neighbor. A friend might tell me, 'I'm supporting so-and-so, and if you're not supporting someone, could you vote for him, too?' Then, if I owed my friend a favor, I'd support his candidate."
 
The Process
When Duty Calls, Votes Are Cast
People feel they owe giri to their bosses, and so in Omiya it seems natural to vote as the companies suggest. Not all firms endorse a candidate, but many do -- especially construction companies, which depend on pork-barrel projects.
"When there's a candidate who my company tells me to please support, then I'll vote for that candidate," said Yoshiharu Deguchi, a burly 39-year-old employee of a construction company, as he played with his young son in the living room of their home. "After all, I don't have any other candidate whom I'm supporting, and my thoughts are generally the same as my company's."
Mr. Deguchi then tells his parents and his wife, Michiko Deguchi, for whom he is voting, and they normally vote for the same candidate. "I listen to my husband," Mrs. Deguchi said, "because he works outside and knows a lot about the world."
Workers in unions get their directions not from their bosses but from their union leadership. It is not just that they believe the union is looking after their best interests -- the main reason why American union members tend to vote for candidates backed by organized labor. Another reason is loyalty to the union.
"I'll vote as the union tells me, which means for the Social Democrats in the proportional representation ballot," said Yoshimi Nishi, a 49-year-old post office employee, as he stood in a doorway during an evening drizzle. "If the headquarters orders people lower down to do something, well, this is an organization. We should obey orders."
 
The Arena
In Small Towns, Pork Barrel Rules
"I ask my family members -- my wife and my daughter -- to vote in the same way I do, because this is a decision that my job partners have reached," he said. "When my daughter can make independent decisions, she can vote on her own. But until then I'll ask her to vote my way."
When will his daughter be able to make independent decisions? Mr. Nishi thought about that for a moment. When she is married, he decided; then she is free to vote as her husband tells her.
One of the busiest people in Omiya these days is Teigo Okuyama, a 68-year-old rice farmer who laughs often, revealing a mouthful of gold interspersed with gaps. Mr. Okuyama is putting up a fence to keep wild boar out of his rice paddy, but these days he is also busy as the local representative for one of the parliamentary candidates.
Mr. Okuyama's giri to the candidate, Takao Fujinami, goes back two decades, to a time Omiya needed a tunnel.
"They had built a small road nearby, but it was rather dangerous," Mr. Okuyama recalled, as he sipped green tea in a friend's home. "When we crossed the road with our cultivators, there was a risk of an accident. So we wanted a tunnel to go under the road for our farm equipment."
Mr. Okuyama and other farmers asked Mr. Fujinami, who was in Parliament from the area, and the tunnel was promptly built.
Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill's famous axiom about America, "All politics is local," is even more true of Japan, particularly the small towns. In the cities, giri and pork-barrel politics are less important, but in the countryside they are just about all there is on election day.
Americans may bemoan the lack of issues in modern campaigns, but a visit to Omiya during election season leaves one thinking that by comparison Americans are policy wonks. The people of Omiya are more likely than Americans to vote, and the tone of political debate is far more civil than in America, but there is almost no attention here to issues.
"I'm not really knowledgeable about politics," Mr. Okuyama said as he deflected questions about Mr. Fujinami's policies. The only issue for him, beyond discharging his debt to Mr. Fujinami, is whether a member of Parliament can divert budget money for local projects.
"Then people will be very happy," Mr. Okuyama said, beaming. "National policies are too huge, and they don't really touch people."
One person after another in Omiya made the same point. There is little sense here that anything good or bad might come out of an election.
Economic policy is seen as largely the domain of Government bureaucrats rather than politicians, and while some voters complained about the governing parties' plans to raise the sales tax, they said that they doubted the opposition would keep its promise to cancel the increase.
When a half-dozen people in their 20's and 30's gathered in a room in the Omiya Town Hall the other night, staying after an English class to meet a reporter, it was striking how apathetic they were about politics. They mostly expressed no interest in the election and said that it would make no difference who became Prime Minister.
Of course, that may be not just apathy but also shrewd observation. Politicians are rarely agents of change in Japan, and the real decisions are typically made by bureaucrats in government ministries. Even then, the decision-making process tends to be based less on leadership than on consensus.
 
The Legacies
Where High Office Can Be Inherited
Many districts in Japan are very competitive, but in a deeply conservative area like Omiya it is almost a foregone conclusion that the Liberal Democratic candidate -- Mr. Fujinami -- will win. Indeed, this year Mr. Fujinami's only opponent is a Communist Party candidate who stands virtually no chance of winning.
Voters will get a second ballot when they go to the polls, to vote for a party so additional seats in Parliament can be assigned on the basis of proportional representation.
Given that Mr. Fujinami is considered a shoo-in, that ballot for the party is the one that really matters this year.
Mr. Fujinami's father was not a member of Parliament -- although he was a local politician -- but it is becoming increasingly common for people to inherit their seats in Parliament.
People in Omiya are watching this year as the politician with the biggest local machine, Hajime Tamura, tries to have his nephew elected as his successor. "If I didn't have that relationship, I probably wouldn't be running for office," the younger Mr. Tamura said.
"People say that to run for office you need the three 'ban,' " Mr. Tamura said earnestly. These are the "ji-ban," the party machine or network; the "kan-ban," or brand name, such as the surname of a retiring politician, and the "ka-ban," or moneybags.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE FIRST LADY;
On the Trail, She's First Mom And Wife

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WILKES-BARRE, Pa., Oct. 10

 BODY:
For a few fleeting minutes here today, it seemed as if the Hillary Rodham Clinton of old were back.
"Health care is just too expensive for the vast majority of American families to be able to afford on their own," she said in a commanding voice, revisiting the issue that brought her so much political grief and helped force her out of the spotlight. 
 But the setting was not a meeting hall or ballroom in Washington; it was here at a center for the elderly. Her listeners were not lawmakers or hospital executives pondering national policy; they were retirees thrilled by their brush with political celebrity.
And the intentions she touted were were those of her husband, whom she invoked with affection.
"Tomorrow is our 21st wedding anniversary," Mrs. Clinton told the crowd here, saying she was going to surprise her husband with a copy of a poem to the Clintons that someone in the audience had read aloud. "Nobody tell him about it!"
In a week that began with the first Presidential debate, and ushered in the home stretch to Nov. 5, Mrs. Clinton remained on the fringes of the race, avoiding overly partisan comments and presenting herself as a respectful wife, a devoted mother.
With Mr. Clinton far ahead in the polls and questions about Whitewater still dogging her, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be taking no chances.
She traveled to four different states in three days -- Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Wisconsin, which are pivotal battlegrounds in a Presidential election.
But for every conventional rally, she visited two or three schools. For every political appeal, she offered half a dozen expressions of her concerns as a mother for America's future. And her appearances were marked by a minimum of fuss. Reporters were not allowed to travel with her, which all but guaranteed local but not national coverage and that she would be chronicled with less skepticism.
Moreover, she visited Democratic strongholds like inner cities, union halls and liberal university towns, where loyalists greeted Mrs. Clinton with unfettered applause.
When she is not talking policy, she is taking a page from so many First Ladies before her, coming across as a national guidance counselor beckoning Americans -- and children in particular -- toward civic virtue.
Defining the importance of the election for hundreds of students in a high school auditorium in Madison, Wis., on Wednesday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton struck a favorite theme and tone. "If each of you individually is successful, that is good, that is important," she said.
But, she added, "it is not enough for individuals to be economically and educationally secure if they care nothing about the larger community responsibilities that are always a part of life, if they don't respect people who have different backgrounds or different points of view."
Time and again, she drew attention to her status as a parent with a child still at home and still in school, implicitly underlining a difference between herself and Elizabeth Dole, who does not have children.
"As the parent of a child who will go off to college next year, I particularly like my husband's proposal that we allow every family to deduct up to $10,000 a year for education expenses," she said in Madison.
That assertion of herself as an average American, rent by the same frustrations and riveted by the same dreams as everybody else, was a motif in all her remarks. In the past, when she said "we", she often meant her husband and herself. This week, it meant the American people, and any talk of programs and policies was attributed solely to "the President" or "my husband."
"We have a President who understands clearly that one of the great conflicts we face is between time and money," she told several thousand Democrats at the rally in Chicago on Tuesday. "We don't have enough of either in lots of cases, do we?"
Just about everyone who turned up to see Mrs. Clinton said they noticed that she had undergone a makeover, but reacted differently to it.. George Yanchuk, who stood on a street corner in Wilkes-Barre to watch her motorcade, applauded the change.
"A lot of people were getting fed up with the way she kept poking into the President's business," said Mr. Yanchuk, 67, a retired carpenter. But while he said he found Mrs. Clinton's current incarnation more attractive, he said he did not believe it would last past Election Day.
Others were saddened by Mrs. Clinton's relative reticence, because they said the negative approval ratings that precipitated it were the product of an archaic national resistance to outspoken women.
"People just can't handle a strong woman," said Tricia Allen, 24, a school psychologist in Chicago who attended the rally there. "I think she's absolutely wonderful. I would vote for her, if she was running."
Clinton-Gore campaign strategists said Mrs. Clinton was not deliberately shrinking from a high-profile role. They said her schedule was as busy as it was four years ago and that she had been appearing with Democratic candidates for Congress because it was felt that her support would help them.
Some political scholars argued that Mrs. Clinton's changed manner might have to do with incumbency. "She's the First Lady now," said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a historian who has written several biographies of First Ladies. "I think that puts her in a different position from the 1992 campaign, where she was advocating and promising. Now she's reflecting and hoping."
But the focal points of those reflections and hopes were mostly noncontentious: education (she cherished it), drug abuse (she deplored it) and interracial harmony (she embraced it). And her tone of voice was compassionate, nurturing.
A fairly typical event was her appearance on Tuesday at a Y.W.C.A. in downtown Detroit, where she instructed 60 schoolchildren, sitting cross-legged in front of her, about how to avoid violent confrontation.
One child chimed in that his school had a "problem-solving area" to which sparring children retreated before any punches could get thrown.
"What a good idea!" Mrs. Clinton said. "I think we should have one of those in every grown-up place -- you know, in every business, in every Congress."

HEADLINE: Lobbying at Murdoch Gala Ignited New York Cable Clash

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The party under the tent on 48th Street in Manhattan was festive, but the host, Rupert Murdoch, was also a little bit angry. There he was, ballyhooing the debut of his 24-hour cable news channel, while the very viewers he most needed to establish this $165 million expansion of his media empire had almost no way to see it.
Time Warner had repeatedly refused to carry the channel, Fox News Channel, on its cable systems in New York City, preventing it from attaining a presence in the nation's communications center. So Mr. Murdoch and his lieutenants used the gathering on the night of Oct. 1 to make some discreet pleas for help to three prominent Republicans who had come to toast him: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Dennis C. Vacco, the State Attorney General. 
 "By the time of the party, it was pretty clear that we wanted any assistance that we could get," recalled Roger Ailes, a former Republican political consultant who is now chairman of the new channel. "I said, 'Hey, how are you doing? We need your support.' "
The three officials responded the next day by pressing a strenuous campaign on behalf of Mr. Murdoch, one that has injected government into a fierce clash between two corporate leviathans and that has raised questions about whether politicians are playing favorites with media companies.
It has also touched off complaints from some other media conglomerates.
Mr. Murdoch has not spoken publicly about the battle since it began, and his aides referred questions to Mr. Ailes, who vigorously defended Mr. Murdoch's lobbying. Mr. Ailes said Mr. Murdoch had acted after Time Warner, last month, suddenly backed out of a crucial deal to put the channel on its cable systems. Both men have accused Time Warner of violating anti-trust laws in an attempt to shield CNN, which it recently acquired, from competition.
Time Warner, which transmits to every borough but the Bronx, has 1.1 million customers. The other major cable operator in the city, Cablevision Systems, has 450,000 customers in the Bronx and Brooklyn. It has agreed to carry the Murdoch channel, though it has not yet found space for it.
Executives at Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation had begun turning to city and state officials for help even before the Oct. 1 party, but the effort did not appear to pick up steam until afterward.
The next day, the Giuliani administration sent a letter to Time Warner requesting permission to transmit Mr. Murdoch's channel on one of the five city-run cable stations, a proposal that the company eventually contested in court. On Friday night, a judge granted Time Warner a temporary restraining order barring the city from going forward with the plan.
The judge, Denise Cote of Federal District Court, said she believed that the administration had improperly tried to place Mr. Murdoch's channel and another commercial channel, Bloomberg Television News, on the city's noncommercial cable stations.
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had not decided whether to appeal the restraining order, which is in effect until a hearing on Oct. 23. He criticized Judge Cote, saying that his aides had not had an adequate chance to rebut Time Warner's charges.
"In fairness, she should have given us the opportunity to put our side on the record before her," Mr. Giuliani said after marching in the Queens Columbus Day Parade.
On the same day that Mr. Giuliani's aides were sending the letter to Time Warner, Mr. Pataki was calling the company's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, urging him to reconsider his rejection of the channel. The Governor told Mr. Levin that Mr. Murdoch had personally asked him at the party to intercede, the Governor later said.
Mr. Vacco had his own conversation at the party with Arthur M. Siskind, the general counsel for Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, people there said. Mr. Siskind told Mr. Vacco that the state should pursue an antitrust investigation against Time Warner for not agreeing to transmit the channel, and soon after, Mr. Vacco began one, subpoenaing documents from the company.
"Our concern was voiced to the officials who were there," Mr. Siskind said, declining to comment further.
At about the same time, the most powerful Republican in the state, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, also called Mr. Levin, trying to persuade him to reach an accommodation with Mr. Murdoch, people involved in the dispute said.
Big companies often seek help from politicians over business disputes. But Time Warner executives assert that the swiftness of the moves by the four Republicans is not a testament to the merits of Mr. Murdoch's case, but rather to his standing as a well-known conservative who can deploy his media outlets, particularly The New York Post and WNYW (Channel 5), to aid or damage officials.
"This is the most frightening exercise of political power that I have seen in my entire career, and I have been in politics and government for 40 years," said Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner's local cable subsidiary.
"This is strictly an effort to endear themselves to somebody who has not only endorsed them in the past but continually supports them with biased coverage," he said.
In court papers, Mr. Aurelio said that Mr. Giuliani's aides tried to bully him into undertaking a scheme that would have put the Fox channel on in violation of Federal law. Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani called that contention false.
All four Republicans vehemently disagree with Time Warner's charges. They say Mr. Murdoch's politics are irrelevant and emphasize that they are helping a businessman who contributes to the city's economy and is being victimized by Time Warner. They say that if the channel, which is based in Manhattan, is not available in much of the city, then it might not be successful, threatening jobs.
"My concern is 1,400 jobs in New York City and damn it, I am going to fight for those jobs," Mr. Giuliani said last week, referring to the number of new jobs that Mr. Murdoch has promised to create through the Fox News Channel and other ventures. The channel already has 600 workers in the city.
Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the Liberal Party and one of the Mayor's closest political advisers, also insisted that the administration was not seeking any political favors from Mr. Murdoch, but he did not deny that the actions could work to the Mayor's advantage.
"Sometimes when you do the right thing, it may also turn out to be good politically," Mr. Harding said.
On Friday, Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner Inc., resigned as an economic adviser to Mr. Giuliani over the dispute. Mr. Parsons said the Mayor was being "politically expedient" by trying to help Mr. Murdoch.
Mr. Pataki, who benefited from a $100,000 contribution that Mr. Murdoch's company gave to the Republican state party for his election in 1994, said there was nothing inappropriate about helping him.
"The day the Governor can't speak out on any issue is a very sad day," Mr. Pataki said. "Fox is a tremendous addition to the range of news coverage that people around the world are going to be able to see. And it's just wrong that they cannot see it in New York."
Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Vacco declined to comment. Chris Staszak, a spokesman for Mr. D'Amato, said, "The Senator hopes the situation is resolved for the benefit of all the people." Christopher McKenna, a spokesman for Mr. Vacco, said there was nothing unusual about the Attorney General talking to Mr. Siskind.
"That is standard operating procedure for any law enforcement body," Mr. McKenna said.
Aides to the four Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity, did acknowledge that there was another factor, separate from the lure of any endorsements they might continue to receive from the editorial pages of The New York Post. They said the officials resented what they saw as a liberal bias in the news media, so by helping Mr. Murdoch, they were protecting what they believed was the only media conglomerate with a conservative voice.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, noted that the Governor thought that it was curious that there had not been a greater outcry from journalists about what he charged was censorship by Time Warner.
"If the shoe were on the other foot, he was wondering if there would be the same type of reaction," Ms. Mucha said.
Mr. Ailes said that within the last two weeks, he had spoken with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki, but he said his political ties to the two men had nothing to do with his ability to get them on the telephone. Mr. Ailes was a leading adviser to Mr. Giuliani when he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor in 1989.
Mr. Ailes played down the importance of the conversations that the News Corporation executives had had with the three Republicans at the party, calling them brief and informal. And he said that if Democrats had been in control of City Hall and the Statehouse, he would have made the same requests.
As Time Warner and Mr. Murdoch continue to skirmish, other media conglomerates have been watching with annoyance, saying that they are upset about Mr. Giuliani's involvement. Some have noted that they, too, have not got their programming on the Time Warner system because of lack of space, and have pointed out that they account for more jobs in the city than Mr. Murdoch.
"We believe that it's a dangerous precedent for the city to become involved in content decisions of this kind," said Philippe P. Dauman, a deputy chairman at Viacom, which has its headquarters and 8,500 employees in the city.
Instead of putting on Fox, Time Warner chose to transmit another 24-hour news channel, MSNBC, a joint venture of NBC and Microsoft. At NBC, some executives questioned whether had the situation been reversed Mr. Giuliani would have been an advocate for NBC.
The Mayor has made "an enormously significant, potentially frightening and unprecedented set of actions by a government official," said Richard Cotton, an executive vice president of NBC.
Speaking yesterday at the parade, the Mayor dismissed such talk.
"Disagree with me, fine, say you have a different philosophy," he said. "But don't start demeaning me with the cheap kinds of things that are being done here because people are involved in business rivalries."

HEADLINE: Imperiled Species In Jamaica Bay: The Eel Men;
Industrial Pollution Helps To Crowd Out a Way of Life

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
On the southern shore near Hook Creek, a crane noisily scooped up rocks with its claw, rumbling back and forth at an asphalt plant spewing thick smoke. To the east, scores of gleaming white spherical fuel tanks waited for trucks to deliver their contents to Texaco and Amoco stations.
Westward, beyond Kennedy International Airport's control towers and the jets landing every few minutes, beyond the A train shuttling between the Queens mainland and the Rockaway Peninsula, across the vast salt marshes and waters of Jamaica Bay, the World Trade Center's twin towers rose into the morning sky, the only hint of Manhattan's existence. 
 In the shadow of a barge beside the asphalt plant, a father and son in a small fishing skiff pulled up a cage from the bottom of Jamaica Bay: a dozen eels squirmed inside the trap. Wrapping his massive fingers around a three-foot silver eel, the father kissed its mouth.
"That's your future here, sonny boy!" Larry Seaman cried with relish, holding up the eel to Larry Jr.
Long after most people have forgotten that New York is surrounded by water, the source of many men's livelihoods in another time, the city immortalized by Herman Melville boils down to this -- the Seamans of Queens, two of the last city residents the census lists as "commercial fishermen."
Within a few years, the Seaman family will move to Virginia, where it has already bought land off Chesapeake Bay. There, the Seamans expect to pursue a calling that is vanishing in New York because of industrialization, pollution and stricter environmental regulations.
For now, though, two generations of Seamans live on a sliver of land on the southeastern edge of Kennedy Airport, a stone's throw from a runway. Squeezed in by Rockaway Boulevard and a shopping strip on one side and Hook Creek on the other, this nameless hamlet of two-story shingled houses is officially part of, but a mile away from the rest of, Rosedale. It is possibly the remotest outpost of the nation's largest urban empire, with the Queens county line abruptly looping southward to add the neighborhood's 17 houses to its territory.
Because the city will not have title to the neighborhood's streets until year's end, the private streets still lack a sewage system. They flood during heavy rains and the houses drain untreated waste into Hook Creek.
More than a generation ago, half a dozen families fished commercially out of boats docked in their backyards. Nowadays, only two of the families still fish, the Seamans and, up the block, the Kirchners -- five fishermen in all. The Kirchners also trap the muskrats favored by recent Russian and Chinese immigrants, and they chop wood to heat their house.
"It's like the land that time forgot," said Bob Seaman, 50, Mr. Seaman's brother. "You expect dinosaurs to be crawling around here."
The Seamans say a combination of factors is pushing them to extinction, most recently a $100 million storm sewer being built in neighboring Brookville Park. The underground pipes, intended to relieve flooding in southeast Queens, will release storm water into nearby Thurston Basin by the year 2001. Government officials say the project will cause no ecological damage, although the fishermen and some environmentalists believe it will pollute the bay.
For the Seamans, the airport, the State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge have such authority over their lives that the fishermen's powerlessness is captured in a village adage: "Next to God is the Port Authority." Regulations forbid them from erecting bulwarks, using rope with lead or venturing into corners of the bay the fishermen know like their living rooms.
"They teach them in college," said Larry Seaman, 53. "They come out here and try to change our way of life. This net's too big -- this and that."
Hook Creek was at half tide and a neighbor's dog was baying at the rising sun as the Seamans prepared recently for a day of trapping eel.
Mr. Seaman's daughter, Kim Zatto, 30, came down a wooden plank connecting their backyard to a pier. A regular customer had called for eel. How much should they charge him? she asked her father, who answered: $4 a pound.
The son raised an eel tank from the creek, picking out a few dead ones and throwing them into the water so that rats would not come scavenging during low tide. Atop the roof of the house across the creek, a sea gull, alert to the morning drill, gazed down at the floating carcasses.
After Bob Seaman's boat drifted by downstream, the father and son followed in their 24-foot skiff.
The brothers steered their boats through the creek, alongside Rockaway Boulevard and a Pizza Hut. They passed by Thurston Basin and headed toward the shore of Inwood, L.I., stopping awhile near the asphalt plant and fuel tanks. Then the captains gathered speed toward the open water, through Grass Hassock Channel, the waves breaking behind them like diamonds under the clear sky.
 
Silence Broken Only by Concorde
Near Silver Hole Marsh, the father and son searched for the ropes attached to their traps as the sun warmed their coats and boats, the silence broken only at 8:15 A.M. by a Concorde taking off.
The eel men use the intersection of two distant structures to mark the spots where they left their traps. But the smog clung to Manhattan because of the windless sky, and one of their reference points, the Empire State Building, remained hidden.
In Norton Basin, not far from Edgemere's towering housing projects, they found some traps near a sunken, stripped car -- full of writhing silver and green eels. After freeing them into a tank in his boat, the father placed fresh bait, half a crab, into the trap and threw it back into the water. Eels enter the trap, the size of two milk crates, through a small hole.
At the height of the season, around November, the father and son set 200 traps throughout Jamaica Bay. Eels reach their fattest then, as they prepare to hibernate from December to April by burrowing at the bottom of the bay.
Freshwater eels were always popular with Italian immigrants, and recently demand has risen because of Chinese newcomers, Bob Seaman said. But the eel supply has fallen over the years, he added, and the eel men are lucky if they make half of the $300 or $400 weekly profits they cleared three decades ago.
Bob and Larry Seaman learned eel trapping from their father, who drove a Mobil truck for 27 years and supplemented his income as a part-time eel man. Back then, it seemed every boy who grew up around the bay knew how to catch eel.
It was perhaps natural that Larry Sr., as the oldest son, became an eel man. But for Bob, the eel was his last chance. After serving a tour as a sergeant in Vietnam from 1968 to 1971, he came back suffering from nightmares and, two dozen job rejections later, found himself unemployable.
"That's why I went back on the water again," he said, discarding a cigarette that hissed in the waves.
 
A First Date Taken To Jamaica Bay
By then, Larry Sr. was already married. On their first date in the early 1960's, he had taken Lois Sterzenbach out into Jamaica Bay -- he pointed vaguely toward Jo Cos Marsh, looking a little embarrassed in front of his son and brother. "We didn't have cars when we were young," he offered by way of explanation, "so we took our boats."
The couple bought a house -- paying $4,000 "in hard-earned eel money," Mr. Seaman said -- in North Woodmere, L.I., just east of the hamlet. Their community was made up of about 20 houses on a handful of islets, linked to the mainland by footbridges and surrounded by marshes where the inhabitants fished and hunted pheasant and rabbit.
"It was all family," said Doris Sterzenbach, Mr. Seaman's mother-in-law, who lived on Queens Avenue in North Woodmere from 1945 to 1965. Her daughter and son-in-law lived down the road.
Some maps still list Queens Avenue and the other streets in that neighborhood, but plans to extend the Nassau Expressway, never realized, got all the residents evicted.
"My aunt, Violet Myers, used to live here," Mr. Seaman said, stepping off his skiff onto a pile of rotting wood on an islet with overgrown weed, near blackened pylons forlornly standing by themselves in the water with no pier to support.
"Over there, they built a golf course so that the rich people can bat balls around," said Mr. Seaman, who still has disturbing dreams, three decades later, about losing his house.
The Seamans found their way to the hamlet, where they now live in three adjoining houses and own a bait-and-tackle shop.
The hamlet was a tight community of fishermen. The head of the other surviving fishing family, Karl Kirchner Jr., 62, remembered that the villagers used to gather at the neighborhood restaurant and bar, Bertrum's, where they watched Jackie Gleason and Sid Caesar on the first local television. Now Bertrum's is an International House of Pancakes catering to the Five Towns.
Mr. Kirchner and his son, Karl 3d, fish for crabs during the summer and eels in the fall.
"It's a father-and-son thing passed down," the son said.
The other fishermen moved or died, leaving many dilapidated houses and bringing new residents who were startled to find commercial fishermen as neighbors in New York City. The traffic on Rockaway Boulevard is sometimes so dense that it is almost impossible for the villagers to merge into it. Twice last year, when Bob Seaman tried doing so at rush hour, motorists threatened him, once with a machete and once with a gun.
Larry Seaman talks constantly of Virginia, where his wife just got her real estate agent's license and where she waits for her husband to move for good. He plans to, in a few years, once they finish paying for their property off Chesapeake Bay. His brother, Bob, expects to follow shortly. His daughter will wait until her husband, a city sanitation worker, retires with a pension.
His son, Larry Jr., 21, said he would also go south but a couple of years after his father so he can "tie up some loose ends here." Unlike his Uncle Bob, who has not been to Manhattan in more than a decade, he enjoys the urban landscape, particularly the area around St. Marks Place in the East Village.
"I've always told him I won't stop him from pursuing his dreams," the father said. "If you want to be a fireman or a cop, go ahead. Don't ever think, when you're 35, that I held you back."
But only fishing was on the son's mind as they returned home in their skiff, carrying 50 pounds of eel.
"We've been together since I was 16," the son said. "We're a cohesive unit. He'll feel lost without me, and I'll feel lost without him.
"This isn't the most glamorous job, but it's something that I can feel proud about. I like the big city, but I also like quiet. If something gets me apart, I go on the water and I feel at peace. That's my one salvation in life."

HEADLINE: A Leader of '89 China Protest Held on Subversion Charges

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Wang Dan, among the most prominent student leaders of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, has been charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Government, a capital crime.
The activities for which Mr. Wang, 27, was charged included publishing anti-Government articles abroad, raising money to support needy dissidents and accepting a scholarship from the University of California. 
 Prosecutors disclosed the charges on Friday to Mr. Wang's parents, who were summoned to a Beijing court a day after they had been told to hire a lawyer to defend him.
Mr. Wang has spent the last 17 months in detention at a secret police center, where he was not allowed visits from his family. He served four years in prison for his leadership role in the 1989 demonstrations, which ended in a bloody military crackdown.
Legal experts say the filing of the charges makes his conviction virtually certain, and although the death penalty is seldom applied in political cases, Mr. Wang can expect to be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison.
The decision by leaders of China's Communist Party to bring capital charges against Mr. Wang, the most recognizable icon of the Tiananmen era, appears certain to draw a new round of international condemnation against China.
For the Clinton Administration, the prospect that the youthful Mr. Wang could receive a new and lengthy prison term presents a difficult foreign policy challenge. Earlier this year, Mr. Clinton privately signaled Beijing that if re-elected, he would like to bring to a permanent end the campaign of sanctions and trade pressure that Washington has used to win improvements in human rights conditions here.
To go forward with this plan, Mr. Clinton urged Beijing to show compassion to those who had been harassed or locked up for expressing political views.
Now, in the midst of a Presidential campaign in which his foreign policy is under assault, Mr. Clinton will be under greater pressure to explain how his position toward Beijing has garnered any results and how the United States can influence the deteriorating conditions under which many intellectuals and political dissidents live in China.
Most of the political prisoners on whose behalf Mr. Clinton has interceded with Chinese leaders are now back in prison or in permanent exile.
Tonight, Mr. Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, said the family had not been notified of a trial date, but under standard procedures, it should begin within a few weeks. "We have not seen him in the 17 months since he was taken away, and we have never known where he is being held," Mrs. Wang said.
Only a year ago, China brought charges against the country's most famous political dissident, Wei Jingsheng, and sentenced him to a 14-year prison term. Mr. Wei helped launch China's "democracy wall" movement in 1978 and drew a 14-year prison term for his trenchant rebukes of Chinese leaders who had promised to establish democratic rule after the death of Mao in 1976.
With these two cases, President Jiang Zemin and the six other members of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo have reaffirmed their determination to silence all dissenting voices and to scorch the pathway of dissent.
The cases have emerged in a season of harsh crackdown on all forms of dissent as the Communists begin preparations for the return of Hong Kong next year and a major party congress that is most likely to cement President Jiang's pre-eminent role as the successor to Deng Xiaoping, the ailing paramount leader of China who turned 92 in August.
But beyond the season of insecurity, President Jiang, now in his seventh year as leader of the party, has demonstrated an increasing intolerance for dissent and for the kind of creeping freedoms that marked the 1980's in the arts, film and the press.
Earlier this week, Liu Xiaobo, a literary critic and dissident, was arrested and sentenced without trial to three years at hard labor for co-signing a biting criticism of President Jiang. His co-author, another veteran dissident, Wang Xizhe, is missing and presumed to be in detention also.
When reports began circulating in Beijing this week that Mr. Wang was to be charged and tried, the Clinton Administration called on Beijing to free prisoners "languishing and suffering in Chinese jails solely because of their political views." The State Department spokesman said the Administration was "seriously concerned" about Mr. Wang's health and the conditions of his detention.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to come to Beijing next month for talks with top Chinese leaders, the first time he has ventured back here since March 1994, when he clashed with Chinese leaders over their human rights record.
Days after Mr. Christopher's visit, Mr. Clinton is to attend a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in Manila with the Chinese President.
Though the indictment against Mr. Wang has not been made public, a New York-based human rights organization, Human Rights in China, issued a statement containing a summary of the charges.
Mr. Wang is accused of publishing critical articles in overseas newspapers and magazines in the three years since he was released from jail.
One of Mr. Wang's overseas articles appeared in The New York Times months after he emerged from prison in 1993. He was also accused of taking part in home-study courses organized by the University of California and for accepting a scholarship to finance his study, part of the authorities' case that he was conspiring with foreigners against China.
Also included are Mr. Wang's efforts with others to raise money to ease the lives of dissidents who have been thrown out of jobs, denied diplomas or rendered unemployable by heavy surveillance.
Finally, Mr. Wang is accused of accepting donations and economic aid from overseas organizations.

HEADLINE: Special Tax Breaks Enrich Savings Of Many in the Ranks of Management

SERIES: RUSHING AWAY FROM TAXES: Executives Who Earn Now, Pay Later -- First of two articles

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Even as the Presidential candidates debate sweeping tax breaks, American businesses have beaten them to the punch. Companies large and small have been signing up executives and other top employees for a generous tax break not available to other Americans. Hundreds of thousands of people have become eligible, most in the last few years, at more than 24,000 businesses.
The deal is simple: Rather than take all their pay, and pay taxes on it, executives let the company hold on to some. The company invests the money, and the executives do not pay taxes on any of it until they take the money years later. 
 It sounds like the I.R.A. or 401(k) savings plans used by tens of millions of Americans. Except this deal excludes the rank and file and has special benefits: there are no Government limits on how much can be put away, and many top executives have put away millions. A lot of companies guarantee them high interest rates on the money and throw in a matching contribution.
Just like that, the executive is able to build a much bigger nest egg than people who have to pay taxes immediately, taking greater advantage of the magical compounding power that makes all these plans so attractive.
Take John F. Welch Jr., chief executive at the General Electric Company. By deferring taxes on $1 million last year, he stands to have $263,000 more within five years than he otherwise would have had.
This executive privilege is known as deferred compensation. Once rarely used, it has soared in popularity in recent years -- an unintended consequence of Government moves to raise tax rates for high-income Americans, clamp down on executive pay and limit the benefits that executives can receive from regular company pensions. And it is spreading quickly, even as half the private work force has no retirement benefits and many companies have been trimming pension benefits for rank-and-file workers. Indeed, its growth represents a threat to a prime tenet of the nation's retirement policies: that companies offer benefits as fairly and to as many workers as possible.
Consider these facts:
*The amount of deferred compensation can be staggering. In 1994-95 alone, the chairman of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, J. F. McDonnell, deferred $2.5 million in pay, and Michael H. Jordan of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation deferred $1.8 million. John L. Clendenin of the BellSouth Corporation has close to $10 million in his deferral accounts.
*There is no ceiling on how much money can be sheltered. One executive alone, Roberto C. Goizueta, the chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, has accumulated $936.4 million, most of it in company stock that will not be taxed until after he retires.
*No longer are just a chosen few capitalizing on this tax break. A growing number of large companies, including Merrill Lynch, I.B.M. and Tenneco, have recently expanded their plans to include hundreds or thousands of prized employees. Other companies have included middle managers and salespeople making as little as $55,000. Even nonprofit organizations as diverse as Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and the Boy Scouts of America Greater New York Councils are signing up.
*Owners of small businesses like Ollies Station restaurant in Tulsa, Okla., are now setting up deferral plans, allowing them to save for retirement without including their workers, who by law would have to be part of any pension or 401(k) plan.
*In most cases, because the money remains in the business's coffers, the company and its shareholders pay taxes on it instead of the executive, and therefore effectively subsidize the tax breaks.
*The Government's rationale for allowing special deferred-compensation plans for executives is that they typically do not cost the Treasury. But a lot of companies, following the advice of an army of consultants, are reducing their own tax bites by buying life insurance policies on the executives. Under Government rules for insurance, this allows the deferred money to grow for years without being taxed. An analysis for The New York Times by Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, shows that the Government would typically lose half of the taxes it would have collected. About 300 of the 1,000 largest public companies are now using life insurance to finance their deferred compensation, according to one survey.
*All this is happening with no attention from the Government. Top officials at both the Treasury and the Labor Department said they were not aware that there was much growth in the deferral plans or in the use of life insurance to underwrite them.
*The Government has no idea how many billions of dollars are being deferred, or how much this might cost. In most cases, it requires companies to write a letter informing the Labor Department that deferred compensation is being offered. Many companies never bother to file anything with the Labor Department. And its list is riddled with inaccuracies. For example, it does not include Exxon, Ford and Wal-Mart -- though they all offer deferred compensation.
*Companies are not required to disclose to their shareholders how much their top executives are deferring, even though Federal rules require disclosure of almost every other element of executive compensation. A review of the public filings of more than 300 companies shows that only a few disclose how much of an executive's pay is deferred. Critics say deferrals can amount to a stealth pay raise that should be reported to shareholders.
*In theory, the money promised to executives can be lost if a company runs into financial trouble. But in many cases where a company has gone bankrupt, top executives ended up getting their deferred money even as less powerful managers and rank-and-file workers lost some of their savings.
Deferred compensation is perfectly legal and always has been. Like awards of stock and supplemental pensions, it is one of a growing number of techniques that companies use to attract, reward and retain executives. Still, its growth troubles some people familiar with the arrangements, who say such plans are widening the gap between the American manager and the American worker. Deene Goodlaw, a San Francisco lawyer who teaches pension law at the University of California at Berkeley, has prepared hundreds of deferred-compensation plans. And she says that some companies are paying for these plans partly by cutting retirement benefits for the rank and file.
Ms. Goodlaw said she quit the tax department of a prestigious law firm after she was directed to prepare a lavish deferred-compensation plan for one company's executives on the same day she was told to draft a plan that let it cut most of its low-paid workers out of its pension plan.
"That is where they are getting the money to pay for what the executives get in their deferred compensation," Ms. Goodlaw said. "If you quote me on this I'll probably never get another job drafting deferral agreements. But that's the truth, what is going on is wrong. It's immoral."
Of course, many companies are not slashing benefits for their rank and file. But experts say that exclusive benefits like deferred compensation are a significant departure from the way things used to be. In 1980, executives at large companies derived 90 percent of their retirement benefits from regular company pension plans -- the ones offered to most employees -- according to corporate consultants. But today, only 30 percent comes from the company plan; the rest comes from deferred compensation and supplemental pensions.
"You sever that linkage between executives and the rank and file, and you are going to have a problem," said Jack Vanderhei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group. He said that any executive whose company was failing to place enough money in its pension plan would "start to worry if he's expecting to get most of his benefits from it." But if most of his benefits came from other plans, he said, then the executive might think, "What do I care?"
Executives say the Government created these problems by imposing regulations that have made it impossible for companies to offer pension plans and 401(k)'s that can satisfy their highest-paid employees, leaving companies with no choice but to expand the deferral plans. And the Government's attempt to rein in multimillion-dollar executive salaries encouraged companies like General Electric, McDonnell Douglas and Westinghouse to shift from cash compensation to a much greater reliance on deferrals, which are exempt from the new limits.
Deferred compensation is off-limits for the vast majority of workers. Federal law allows employers to include only "a select group of management or highly compensated employees" in deferral plans meant to provide retirement savings. That generally means less than 3 to 5 percent of the work force. The reason is that such plans do not have the safeguards required for pensions and savings plans for the rank and file. Unlike the funds for pensions and 401(k)'s, deferred money is subject to claims by a company's creditors if a company fails. Also, the deferral plans are not backed by the Government's pension insurance fund.
But to judge by the numbers, that risk has not frightened many business leaders.
 
Why Delay Pays
A Business Response To Government Limits
Since the Government created the income tax in 1913, wealthy Americans have always found ways to avoid or delay paying taxes. Deferring income can be as simple as a real estate broker shifting the collection of a fee from one year into the next.
Many companies began letting executives defer pay as the highest tax rate surged from 7 percent to 94 percent during World War II. But even though the top rate stayed at 70 percent or higher through 1981, the deferral programs at most companies remained limited, and they were mainly used by a handful of executives nearing retirement.
One reason was that in the 1950's and 1960's, most large companies had basic pension plans that offered adequate benefits to both executives and the rank and file. But in 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which included measures to expand and protect the retirement money of regular workers.
That law set the first limits on how much executives could draw from basic company pension plans. And it said that if they wanted to save more, they would have to use other vehicles that did not have the same safeguards. These were mainly the special deferred-compensation plans and supplemental pensions.
But deferral plans did not take off until Congress made more changes. This happened even as the top tax rate was being slashed, to 50 percent in 1982 and then to a low of 28 percent from 1988 through 1990.
Two big changes involved I.R.A. and 401(k) accounts. Shortly after the Government introduced Americans to the impressive compounding power of tax-deferred savings, Federal officials became alarmed by how much revenue the Treasury was losing.
The Government allows individuals and companies to deduct immediately their contributions to I.R.A.'s, 401(k)'s and company pension plans that include the rank and file, but the workers do not have to pay taxes on that money until they receive it many years later. This gap between the tax deduction and the tax collection has long been one of the single biggest tax breaks, now costing about $70 billion a year.
So in 1986, Congress eliminated some of the generous deductions. It ruled that most employees covered by other pension plans could no longer deduct their contributions to an I.R.A. (a maximum of $2,000 a worker a year, plus $250 for a nonworking spouse). It also slashed the cap on an individual's annual contribution to a 401(k) plan from $30,000 to $7,000. (Inflation adjustments have since lifted that to $9,500.)
Then, in 1988 and in 1993, Congress again tightened limits on what executives could get from regular pension plans. Before these changes, the pension benefits paid to top managers could be based on no more than $200,000 to $250,000 of annual salary. But Congress cut this to $150,000.
Congressional leaders said they were trying to be fair, by aiming the cuts at people who could afford to save without help. Their main motivation, however, was not to adjust the nation's retirement policies but rather to increase tax revenue by billions of dollars and lower the Federal budget deficit.
For executives, the new limits felt like "a multiple nuclear warhead attack" on their retirement security, said Bill C. Wilson, of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche.
There was one other fusillade. President George Bush signed a bill in 1991 lifting the top tax rate to 31 percent, from 28 percent. President Clinton raised it further in 1993, to 36 percent on all taxable income over $140,000 for married couples, and to 39.6 percent on any portion over $250,000.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton and Congress took a swipe at sharp increases in executive pay -- a trend that had been angering many people as pay soared even for the chief executives of companies that were laying off thousands of people. New measures banned companies from deducting basic salary and bonuses that exceeded $1 million for any one executive.
But there were exemptions. Companies that tied an executive's compensation to his performance did not have to adhere to the $1 million cap. A company could also defer pay above $1 million and still take a deduction on its taxes once the executive took the money. So now the rush for alternatives was on.
 
An Irresistible Deal
Tax Advantages And Secrecy, Too
Among the evidence that deferred compensation is spreading are surveys of the 1,000 largest public companies by Compensation Resource Group Inc. They found that 74 percent offered such programs for at least their top executives in 1995, up from 62 percent in 1994. The consulting firm expects that number to rise to more than 80 percent in a survey being conducted now.
In a new poll of executives by The New York Times and CBS News, 52 percent of top executives at large companies had been offered deferred compensation. And 85 percent of that group had signed up for it.
Many large companies let executives defer as much as half their salary and all of their bonus. A growing number of plans also allow executives to save for short periods, rather than just for retirement. They can take the deferred money in as little as two or three years with no penalty, while I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s require a 10 percent penalty on withdrawals before age 59 1/2. That is a big advantage in saving for a child's education or a car, a boat or a house.
Deferring pay could reap larger benefits -- at the Treasury's expense -- if Congress lowers income tax rates as Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, has proposed in calling for a 15 percent cut.
Deferred-compensation plans provide one other benefit for many executives: published tallies of how much executives make almost never disclose how much of that pay is being deferred. Few companies will disclose anything about executive pay they are not required to, and none of the chief executives mentioned in this article would discuss their deferrals. So it is impossible to make a comprehensive list of who deferred what.
Deferred compensation "is at times used to hide the true income of executives," said Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official.
"I've been reading proxy statements for 20 years," added Stephen Selbst, a New York lawyer, "and I have trouble finding information about deferred compensation."
But a review of corporate filings and numerous interviews provide a sense of how lucrative the programs have become. Many deferral plans pay 8 to 12 percent interest and some go higher. BellSouth has paid interest rates from 8 to 22 percent on deferrals since the mid-1980's.
General Electric promised Mr. Welch, one of America's most successful chief executives, an interest rate of 14 percent when he deferred $1 million of his $2 million base salary last year. It also gave him a $35,000 matching contribution, the same 3.5 percent rate that the company gives other employees on their 401(k) savings.
At 14 percent, his money will nearly double within five years, to $1.88 million. After taxes, he will have $1.07 million.
If Mr. Welch had not deferred, he would have paid Federal and state taxes last year on the $1 million. So he would have been left with $571,680. Even if he could receive 14 percent interest in a safe investment, within five years he would end up with $810,000 -- $263,000 less than with the deferral.
Time Warner Inc. offers Gerald M. Levin, the chief executive, and other top officers this perquisite: a portion of what the company saves through tax deductions when the executives get the money. Over the last three years, Mr. Levin has deferred at least $1.05 million. If that were to grow to $4 million by the time it was paid out, Time Warner would give Mr. Levin not only that amount but also an extra $1 million under the formula involving the tax deduction.
Some who defer, like Mr. Clendenin and Mr. Levin, are mainly bolstering their savings for retirement. But others, like Mr. Welch, Mr. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas and Mr. Jordan of Westinghouse, have an added motivation: They are helping their companies hold on to tax deductions on their pay in excess of $1 million.
Norm LaFlamme, General Electric's manager of executive compensation, and officials at McDonnell Douglas and Westinghouse all said their companies encouraged the executives to make the deferrals. Under the 1993 law that capped salary deductions at $1 million a year, the companies would have lost any chance to claim the deductions if they had paid out more than that. But by deferring the rest of the money, the companies can preserve the deductions for later.
For the companies, which pay taxes on their profits at rates of up to 35 percent, the deductions are valuable, saving them up to $350,000 on $1 million in salary.
Mr. LaFlamme said General Electric had also given 3,000 other executives a chance to defer money in recent years and that the company used high interest rates as a "hook" to keep executives from leaving. If Mr. Welch or any of the others were to quit within five years of a deferral, the interest rate would drop to 3 percent.
Mr. LaFlamme said the aim was a "win-win for the employer and the executive." But he also said that "we don't like to manage our executive-compensation programs based on tax law."
Other companies are using the deferral programs to link their executives' pay more closely with their performance. Over the last two years, for example, the Ford Motor Company has deferred $5.4 million in bonuses for Alex Trotman, its chief executive. The amount will rise or fall with the value of Ford's common stock, and he will be paid in Ford shares when he retires.
In a new twist, companies like Chrysler and American Home Products plan to allow executives to defer gains when they exercise options to buy their company's stock at discount prices. Normally, executives owe income taxes on any gains from exercising stock options. But the new method allows them to transfer the gains into deferral accounts and delay the taxes.
Some companies also pick up the cost of insurance that eliminates the risk of deferred compensation. Last year, the CSX Corporation, a giant transportation company, spent $421,000 to reimburse its chief executive, John W. Snow, for insurance that guarantees his deferred compensation if the company is taken over.
 
Trickle Down
Expanding Ranks Of the Chosen Few
Who else can qualify for deferred compensation? The answer is like some ancient riddle. It depends on whom you ask.
Most large companies are expanding their programs to include lower-ranking executives and, in many cases, middle managers and top salespeople. Federal law states only that a select group of managers or highly paid employees is eligible. And the Government has never defined that rule more precisely. So the dividing line is blurry, and each company is setting its own cutoff point.
Compensation Resource Group found that 32 percent of the 1,000 largest companies set the eligibility line at salaries of $150,000 or higher and 24 percent set it at $100,000 or higher. But 19 percent of the companies included people making $80,000, and at least 16 percent dropped that to $66,000 or lower.
A quarter of the companies have expanded their investment choices to allow employees to peg their return to that of mutual funds. Merrill Lynch has extended deferral to 3,000 managers and brokers earning $200,000 a year or more. They can choose from investment options that mirror the returns in 30 stock and bond funds.
Last year, I.B.M. began allowing 1,350 executives earning $150,000 or more to defer up to 12 percent of their salaries and all of their bonuses. They can choose among five funds. Edward R. K. Prohl, I.B.M.'s director of executive compensation, said 75 percent to 80 percent had signed up. And the Dow Chemical Company lets 1,200 executives and plant managers defer.
The New York Times Company, in its "Executive Tax Saver" plan, allows the 307 employees who receive stock options, mostly managers, to defer all of their bonus and up to one-third of their salary.
But other companies are venturing farther down the ranks. At Lockheed Martin, the aerospace company, about 2,500 managers earning more than $80,000 can defer bonus money. The Campbell Soup Company created a salary-deferral program this year for managers making $70,000 and up. And on occasion, the Walgreen Company has given managers making as low as $55,000 a chance to defer up to 10 percent of that year's pay.
Still, at companies like Dow Chemical and Lockheed Martin, only half of those eligible have signed up. Participation dropped at lower salaries because many employees cannot afford to save more.
Younger managers are hesitant to tie up their money for long periods. So about half the plans at large companies now allow short-term deferrals, typically three to seven years. This makes it easier to save for something big, like college or a house.
At Imperial Bancorp in Inglewood, Calif., the senior vice president for human resources, J. Richard Barkley, is saving through his deferral account to help meet some of the $22,000 or so in annual college expenses for his daughter.
Mr. Barkley said one advantage of the deferral program was that his company contributed a match of 10 percent to 50 percent, depending on how the company performed. Each account also earns interest, now 7 percent.
Given such advantages, Mr. Barkley said Imperial had found that the deferral plans were "an excellent hiring tool."
Alan Lebowitz, a Labor Department official, said the department had not received complaints about deferred compensation. So, he said, the idea of setting a "bright line" to rule people in or out "has never risen to a very high level of priority for us."
But tensions over the changing balance in benefits are becoming apparent at some companies, like the Kmart Corporation. Last year, the retailer, which has had big losses, decided to freeze the benefits that 180,000 workers could receive from its Government-guaranteed pension plan and set up a profit-sharing arrangement, where employees share in the company's risks.
In bringing in a new chief executive, however, Kmart handed out millions of dollars in deferred stock grants and left its supplemental pension benefits for executives intact.
The company also has a 401(k), and it said it wanted to use the profit-sharing plan to spur workers to help revive its fortunes.
But Lewis Hubble, a warehouseman in Illinois who received only $475 in profit-sharing this year, said that among the workers at Kmart, "There are a lot of harsh feelings."
 
Washington's Loss
Use of Insurance Costs the Treasury
As the deferral plans extend to more people, many companies are looking for ways to lower costs and make participants feel more comfortable that the money will be there when they retire. A growing number are turning to life insurance as a way to do both.
But while saving money for the companies, this technique is passing on some of the costs to the Government. It also is undercutting some of the revenue gains that Congress expected when it limited pension and 401(k) benefits for high-income workers.
This is because the companies are combining their deferral programs with one of the oldest, and most controversial, tax breaks on the books: the tax-free buildup of investment gains in life insurance policies.
"If the new interest in deferred compensation is leading employers to use life-insurance-based savings vehicles, then there are almost certainly going to be losses to the Treasury over time," said Joel Slemrod, a tax economist at the University of Michigan.
The original reason for this tax break was simple. It was meant to help families cope with the death of a breadwinner. Congress has also long allowed companies to take out insurance policies on executives out of concern that they could face major costs in replacing anyone who died.
But over the years, some companies expanded this concept and took out insurance policies covering tens or even thousands of employees to finance a variety of activities, including employee benefits. And now many companies -- from Southern California Edison, a utility company, to Avery Dennison, which makes office labels and stickers -- are using this approach in their deferral or supplemental-pension programs.
Compensation Resource Group found that 30 percent of the 1,000 largest companies use life insurance to underwrite pay deferrals. And most of the plans for small businesses are essentially life insurance policies.
Here is how it often works: A company takes out the policies on its employees, paying the premiums and naming itself the beneficiary. The company can peg the policy's investment returns to fixed interest rates or to mutual funds.
Once the employee is ready to take his deferred money, the company can pay him by borrowing from the policy or cashing it in. But some large companies prefer to pay the deferred amounts out of their own coffers and hold on to the insurance policies until the employee dies.
Then the company can take advantage of one final break: It collects the death benefit without owing any taxes.
The analysis by Coopers & Lybrand shows what can happen. If a manager started at age 45 and deferred $15,000 a year for 20 years at 7 percent interest, the company would owe him $658,000.
If the company had let the money grow tax-deferred through life insurance, the Government would not have received $119,212 in taxes on the gains until the payout, reducing their value by half. And if the company held the policy until the executive died at 78, it would collect a $2.3 million death benefit tax-free.
Congress voted this year to phase out some large tax deductions when companies borrow money from the policies. But Senate and House staff members said lawmakers had not examined the basic use of life insurance policies to finance deferred-compensation plans and supplemental pensions.
Corporate officials say they think such use will continue to expand.
"There really is no tax-advantaged way to provide these benefits except with company-owned life insurance," said LaMont Keen, the chief financial officer at Idaho Power and Light.
But Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a taxpayer-advocacy group, said this was "a particularly egregious example of life insurance being abused to accumulate money without being taxed."
Others worry about the message that a large tax break for an exclusive group can send. "One of the problems with these kinds of tax gimmicks," said Jeffery L. Yablon, a lawyer at Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge in Washington, "is that they erode people's trust, turning them into cynics about the tax system and the Government in general."
 
Spreading Way Beyond the Giants of Corporate America
Across the country, financial planners, insurance agents and mutualfund companies are promoting deferred compensation to one group that had made little use of it before: small-business owners.
From Ollies Station Restaurant in Tulsa, Okla., to Bubba's Produce in New Orleans, thousands of small-business owners are creating plans to defer compensation for themselves or a few prized employees.
The owners say the plans give them a measure of security in a part of the economy where it can be hard to build much of a cushion. But many also are embracing pay deferrals as an easy solution to a ticklish problem -- how to save for their own retirements without having to set aside money for the rest of their workers.
"Is it the best mechanism? I don't know," said John Gray, the owner of Ollies Station, who created a deferral plan for himself and his wife, Lin, last year. Their restaurant has about 20 employees, who have no retirement benefits. "In a small company, you can't afford to set up a pension plan because then you have to do it for everyone," Mr. Gray said.
No law requires employers to provide a retirement program, and only about 15 percent of companies with fewer than 100 workers offer them, Labor Department figures show.
If a company does set up a pension, 401(k) or profit-sharing plan, it has to adhere to Federal rules that require it to include most workers. But because the law limits deferred-compensation plans to select groups of the best-paid employees, business owners can leave the rank and file out of those plans.
As the plans spread, critics fear that many small businesses -- the types of companies that create the most new jobs -- will become less likely ever to offer savings plans to their rank-and-file workers. "This is a very significant policy concern," said Karen Ferguson, the director of the Pension Rights Center, a worker-advocacy group in Washington.
Indeed, the lack of savings plans at small businesses is by far the largest gap in the nation's retirement system. Just two months ago, President Clinton signed a law creating a new type of simplified savings plan intended to make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to offer benefits.
But even that new plan requires employers to include any workers who want to participate. And some business consultants say the Government's effort could be undercut by the deferral plans.
For instance, Leonard Masonry Inc. in St. Louis created a deferred-pay program last summer for six top employees, leaving out a handful of others who have no retirement plan. Under the deferral program, the company plans to pay each of the six workers $25,000 a year for 10 years after they retire. "When you get good help, you want to do what you can for them," said Donald Leonard, a co-owner.
Other businesses are also using deferred-compensation plans to create "golden handcuffs." The Commercial Bank of San Francisco, which has 48 employees, set up a plan for just one of them, its chief credit officer, to encourage him to stay.
The Mansfield Hardware and Supply Company, an industrial wholesaler in Mansfield, Ohio, did the same thing for its sales manager, Craig Copeland, one of nine employees. Mr. Copeland, who is 40 and has two children, said he wanted to save more than he could through his I.R.A. "They came to me and offered it," Mr. Copeland said of the deferral program. "I didn't ask."
Nonprofit organizations are also setting up deferral plans. Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City uses one to pay bonuses to 58 managers. The Boy Scouts of America Greater New York Councils is using its plan to enhance the retirement benefits of its executive scout.
At heart, most of the deferral plans at small businesses and non-profit groups are simply life insurance policies. The businesses or groups take out the policies on the lives of top employees. Like large companies, they can choose whether to invest the premiums at fixed interest rates or in mutual funds, and they can let the investment grow without being taxed. They can also borrow against the policies or cash them in at any point.
Over the last two years, some of the biggest stock brokerage firms, mutual funds and life insurance companies have begun promoting simple deferral packages tailored to small businesses. Merrill Lynch, which sells its plans through its stockbrokers, said the demand had been so great that it had not had to advertise. Among small companies, "there's been an explosion," said David A. Kossak, a financial planner in Tulsa who helped the Grays create the plan for their restaurant.
Still, other financial experts question whether the deferral plans make sense at many small companies, where the life insurance premiums can eat up a lot of cash. Ollies Restaurant is paying a total of $1,000 a month in premiums on policies for the Grays, and the money is invested in mutual funds. But Mr. Gray seems satisfied. "So far, it's worked like a dream," he said.
 
Putting Aside $936 Million While Making Coke Thrive
To investors, Roberto C. Goizueta, the chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, is a hero. A thousand dollars invested in the company when Mr. Goizueta took over, with dividends reinvested, is now worth $52,000.
Mr. Goizueta, born in Cuba and educated at Yale, is also a hero to other chief executives. That's not only because he streamlined the soft-drink giant to sharply increase sales, profits and its stock price, but also because he exemplifies how it is possible to be paid exceptionally well for producing exceptional results. Since 1979, when he first appeared in the company's proxy statements, Mr. Goizueta's compensation -- salary, bonuses and grants of stock -- has totaled more than $1 billion, a remarkable figure even by today's stratospheric standards of executive pay. And that's without counting stock options.
What is also remarkable is how little Mr. Goizueta has paid in taxes on that compensation. Only about 5 percent has gone for Federal income and payroll taxes. By contrast, a typical middle-class family with two children and a $50,000 income paid 17 percent of its income in such taxes, according to the Tax Foundation, a private research group.
How did Mr. Goizueta do it? After all, his pay package, while unusually large, is similar to many of the sophisticated executive-compensation plans popular today.
Most Americans are paid a simple salary or wage, which is taxed immediately. Mr. Goizueta negotiated to take most of his pay in Coca-Cola stock, which carries significant tax advantages.
The company has given Mr. Goizueta 11.2 million shares on the condition that he not sell them -- or borrow against them -- before he retires. If he quits, he forfeits the shares, although the board has the power to lift that restriction.
These restrictions do not affect Mr. Goizueta's power to vote these shares or to collect the dividends, which are taxable; last year the dividends totaled more than $4.9 million. (He also owns another 4.5 million shares outright, the company says.)
So long as the restrictions remain, Mr. Goizueta does not face taxes on the shares, worth $559 million at Friday's closing price of $49.75 per share.
On the first 5.2 million shares he received, Mr. Goizueta arranged for Coke to pay him enough to cover the Federal and state taxes he will owe on those shares when the restrictions lapse. At today's prices, this cash payment amounts to $116 million.
After paying taxes on that cash and the stock itself, Mr. Goizueta will be left with $208 million. Had he paid taxes on the stock when it was given to him, and then sold the stock when he retires, he would not have fared as well. After taxes, he would have been left with $190 million.
For a Coke shareholder, finding any mention of Mr. Goizueta's stock grants requires a careful reading of the company's proxy statement. In the 22-page statement Coca-Cola sent to its shareholders on March 6, 1992, for instance, the tables describing pay make no mention of them. The only indication is in a thick paragraph of legalistic text: "Mr. Goizueta received one million shares from the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan which does not provide for reimbursement from taxes."
Add six million additional restricted shares and two cash payments based on the price of Coke stock, and his tax-deferred fortune grows to $936 million.
And that's not even counting Mr. Goizueta's 401(k), two other deferral accounts and a pension worth $3 million a year.
The following reporters for The New York Times participated in the preparation of these articles: Steve Lohr, Peter Passell and Melody Peterson.

GRAPHIC: Charts: "WHO DEFERS: THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY"
The amount of compensation on which taxes are deferred sometimes reaches seven figures. Most companies disclose nothing about such compensation. Here is a sampling of executives with significant salary and bonus deferrals that have been disclosed.
 
DOING THE MATH: MR. WELCH'S MILLION
John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of General Electric, illustrates how deferring pay helps savings accumulate much faster. Mr. Welch deferred $1 million of his salary during 1995; the company added a 3.5 percent matching contribution and promised him 14 percent interest on his account through 1999. The chart shows Mr. Welch's balance at the end of each year for the money he deferred, and what the balance would be had he taken the same $1 million as taxable pay in 1995 and invested the net amount after taxes at the same 14 percent interest rate, forgoing the tax deferral and the matching contribution.
 
JOHN L. CLENDENIN
BellSouth
Has close to $10 million in deferred-compensation account. Last year alone, the company credited him with interest on his balance at the market rate of about 8.6 percent, as well as $415,700 on top of that.
 
JOHN R. STAFFORD
American Home Products
Required by company to defer the portion of his $1.185 million salary that was above $1 million and thus not tax deductible. Also deferred not just half of his $1.185 million bonus, as required by the company, but the rest as well.
 
ALEX TROTMAN
Ford Motor
Required by company to defer $5.4 million of 1994-95 bonuses of $9 million. Value of payout will depend on price of Ford's stock when he retires.
 
MICHAEL H. JORDAN
Westinghouse Electric
Deferred $1.8 million in bonuses in 1994-95 that earns interest at a rate equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate. But if the same amount invested in Westinghouse common shares produces a higher return, he can convert the investment to that stock. (pg. 36)
 
"ONE MAN'S FORTUNE: ROBERTO C. GOIZUETA"
 Just how handsomely the Coca-Cola Company has paid its chairman is very hard to discern from the company's published reports, and it would certainly be impossible from his tax returns.
 That is because, as generous as his taxable salary and bonuses have been over the years, they pale beside his tax-deferred equity compensation: grants of restricted shares, stock-like "performance units" and "incentive units" that have appreciated hugely since Mr. Goizueta was awarded them. Plus, the company will reimburse Mr. Goizueta for the taxes he will eventually owe on some of the grants, increasing their value to him by nearly half again.
 (On top of all this, Mr. Goizeuta has been given thousands of stock options over the years. He has made $54.5 million since 1979 redeeming some of them; at the end of 1995 he held others now worth $66.7 million before taxes.)
 Here is a reckoning of Mr. Goizueta's compensation other than stock options from 1979 to 1995, based on Coca-Cola's published reports and, where necessary, some conservative estimates. (Source: Data from Coca-Cola's public reports or estimated by The New York Times based on company reports.)(pg. 36)
 
"DEFERRED COMPENSATION: I.B.M. AS A CASE STUDY"
I.B.M.'s deferred compensation plans are typical of those at the largest companies. Executives and managers may delay paying taxes on pay, bonuses and stock awards far beyond the $9,500 a year that ordinary workers may now save through the company 401(k) plan. Many companies camouflage details of deferred-compensation arrangements in their public documents, and decline to provide more data. I.B.M.'s disclosures are clearer and more detailed than most. (Source: Company reports)(pg. 37)
 
"WHO DEFERS: EVERYBODY'S DOING IT"
No longer are just a chosen few capitalizing on deferred compensation. Businesses large and small are setting up their own deferral plans, sometimes just for the owners and sometimes for top employees. Nonprofit organizations are also signing up. (pg. 37)

To the Editor:
I would like to express my appreciation for your Oct. 9 front-page article on the young immigrant family from Mexico. As an attorney representing Mexican immigrants, I have been greatly disappointed by the lack of understanding as to why undocumented Mexican immigrants come to the United States. For many, it is as if immigrants are seeking a life of crime because they enter the country illegally. 
 Your article is a reminder that this is a choice driven by the desire to improve one's economic circumstances, made with great sacrifice and often resulting in isolation from one's family, culture and basic support system. It is not criminal behavior.

HEADLINE: Housing Crisis Imperils Quality of Life for All;
What Is the Real Crisis?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was struck by how much your "Housing's Hidden Crisis" series (Oct. 6-11) was not about housing. In fact, the last article noted that New York City's housing crunch was unique among older American cities because of the "unusual burden of an increasing population, due largely to immigration." 
 The many anecdotes reported to describe housing conditions, as often as not, featured illegal immigrants. Their housing was almost incidental to their stories of lives on the economic and legal fringe. Notably, much of the "housing" itself was on the legal fringe -- illegal rooming houses, illegal conversions of single-family homes, illegal uses of apartment building basements and alleyways.
Paradoxically, if the people profiled could afford decent housing, they would still be stuck. Legitimate property owners wouldn't rent to them. How could you check credit histories for people with no bank accounts, Social Security numbers or, in some cases, even a believable record of their names?
"Housing's Hidden Crisis" is actually about what some call the underclass. It is about the underground economy (and jobs in the aboveground economy), and it is about legal status in American society. Looking at housing solutions is putting the cart before the horse.

HEADLINE: THE RACE FOR CONGRESS: New Jersey's 12th District;
Two Relative Unknowns Try to Make a Name

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 9

 BODY:
These are strange days in central New Jersey, where sightings of political giants, movie stars and anyone else who might stir up interest in the 12th District Congressional race are suddenly common.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle surfaced at a deli here the other day, showering praise on the Republican candidate, Mike Pappas. The Democrat, David M. Del Vecchio, is expecting visits from William Baldwin, the actor, and Jim Brady, the former press secretary to President Ronald Reagan, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt and now champions gun control. 
 The candidates -- who are fighting for the seat that Representative Richard A. Zimmer, a Republican from Delaware Township, gave up to run for the United States Senate -- are hardly prominent figures on the state's political scene. And the district, smack in the middle of New Jersey and suburban to the core, almost always votes Republican. So why all the fuss?
Democratic Party officials are drooling over the 12th District seat because for the first time in years, they believe the opponent is vulnerable. A victory in the 12th, which is one of New Jersey's largest and wealthiest districts, would help balance the state's Congressional delegation, which now has eight Republicans and five Democrats. The reason the Democrats have any cause for hope is that Mr. Pappas, a Somerset County freeholder, is a conservative Republican in what has long been a moderate Republican district.
And the Democrats take every opportunity to tell voters something else about Mr. Pappas: that he is adamantly opposed to abortion.
"The bottom line is that if most voters know something about both candidates on Election Day, I think Del Vecchio wins," said B. Thomas Byrne Jr., chairman of the Democratic State Committee. "He is more in line with the district's values."
The Republicans say they will have no problem holding onto Mr. Zimmer's seat. Mr. Pappas has played down the abortion issue, choosing to focus on fiscal reform. He has promised to fight tax increases and says he wants to shift responsibility from the Federal Government to states and towns.
"Fiscal matters are what the people of this district care about most," said Paul Pisano, a spokesman for Mr. Pappas's campaign. "That's what unites Republicans, and that's what Mike has focused on since the day he announced."
But both candidates have a major hurdle to overcome: they are not well known outside their home counties, but are running in a district that stretches from the Delaware River to the Jersey Shore, including all of Hunterdon County and parts of Somerset, Mercer, Middlesex and Monmouth counties.
Because the district covers so much ground, advertising is especially difficult. To reach every voter, the candidates would need to advertise in both the New York City and Philadelphia television markets, something neither can afford. So both are focusing on radio spots, mailings and as many campaign appearances as they can squeeze in.
Before this year, Mr. Del Vecchio, 39, was virtually unknown outside Hunterdon County, where he has been the Mayor of Lambertville since 1991. He was an aide to former Gov. Jim Florio, and he is on leave from a job in the State Treasury. Mr. Pappas, 35, a partner in a family-run insurance business, has held public offices since 1982. He became the Mayor of Franklin, Somerset County, at 22, and he has spent 12 years as a county freeholder.
A poll commissioned by the Del Vecchio campaign put the candidates in a dead heat as of late September, but found that nearly half the voters were still undecided. A poll conducted for the Pappas campaign in late August gave the Republican a 12-percentage-point lead. No independent polling has been done in the district.
Democrats like to point out that although the district is considered a Republican bedrock, the majority of its 342,485 registered voters are independents. Although George Bush was the favorite here in the 1992 Presidential election, President Clinton trailed by only 3 percentage points. And this year, Mr. Clinton is leading in local polls.
Several dozen interviews with residents of the 12th District in the last week suggested that the low profile of both candidates is indeed their biggest obstacle. When asked their opinions of Mr. Del Vecchio and Mr. Pappas, many said they knew nothing about the race. Others said the Senate race between Mr. Zimmer and his Democratic opponent, Representative Robert G. Torricelli of Englewood, has overshadowed the Congressional campaigns so much that they did not even know who the candidates were.
"Zimmer and Torricelli are outdoing them, there's no question," said Don Stancavish, who owns a variety store called the One Stop Shoppe in Flemington, Hunterdon County. "Those guys are going nuts, and as far as I'm concerned, they're stealing the spotlight."
Down the road in Branchburg, Somerset County, Gale Voigt stood behind the counter in the Bagel smith, a sandwich shop she has owned for 10 years, and said she did not plan to vote. She knew that Mr. Del Vecchio was the Mayor of Lambertville, but beyond that, she said, she had not followed the race.
"I wouldn't vote for Zimmer, either," said Mrs. Voigt, who is trying to sell her shop and move out of state. "As a small-business person, not one of our Congressmen over the last 10 years has helped me at all."
Mrs. Voigt, who said that taxes and government regulations were forcing her out of business, was pleased to learn that Mr. Pappas wants to reduce the size of government. But when she heard the candidate was against abortion, she winced. "That would be a minus point for me," she said.
Such words are music to the ears of Mr. Del Vecchio, who takes every chance he can get to showcase Mr. Pappas's views on abortion and gun control. (Mr. Pappas has said he would support a repeal of the Federal ban on assault weapons.) During a debate in Flemington last Tuesday, Mr. Del Vecchio brought up abortion several times, even though no question addressed the issue.
"It's important for people to know that I am the mainstream candidate and he is the extreme candidate," Mr. Del Vecchio said later.
But Mr. Pappas has said repeatedly that he is not a "single-issue candidate." Although he remains firmly opposed to abortion, he said, his main goal is to shape up the economy.
"The central issues I have worked on in the three years I've spent preparing for this campaign are economic," he said in an interview. "My opponent has spoken about these things peripherally, but he has made some of the more hot-button social issues some of the first things out of his mouth."
Mr. Pappas has often pointed out that Mr. Del Vecchio used to work for Governor Florio, who fell out of favor when he raised taxes by $2.8 billion. But Mr. Del Vecchio says that taxes in Lambertville have dropped since he was elected Mayor, and that he would work to cut Federal taxes without touching the budgets for Medicare, education and the environment. He wants to cut the capital gains tax, and he supports the death penalty.
"The old labels don't mean anything anymore," Mr. Del Vecchio said in an interview. "The Republicans can't stereotype us into a little box anymore."
Still, Mr. Del Vecchio's centrist approach might lose him some traditional Democratic support. Gertrude Dubrovsky of Princeton said she would not vote for Mr. Pappas because of his support for abortion rights. But she said she would not vote for Mr. Del Vecchio, either, because he was not liberal enough.
"Del Vecchio is not enough of an old-style Democrat for me," Mrs. Dubrovsky said. "We've got to stop this drifting of Democratic candidates toward the right."
Others say that Mr. Del Vecchio's brand of conservatism is not enough for them. Norma Bee of Jamesburg, Middlesex County, said she would support Mr. Pappas even though she favored abortion rights.
"The abortion thing does bother me," Mrs. Bee said, adding that she might write to Mr. Pappas to express her concern. "But I like his aura and I like his ideas about taxes and government. I'm hoping it will turn out to be a non-issue."
 A picture caption with the article misidentified a school visited by the Democratic candidate, David M. Del Vecchio. It is the Desmares Elementary School, not the Desmares Elli School.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 14, 1996, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the congressional race in New Jersey's 12th District misstated a voter's reason for opposing the Republican candidate, Mike Pappas. The voter, Gertrude Dubrovsky, said she would not vote for Mr. Pappas because he opposes abortion (as the article stated elsewhere), not because he supports abortion rights.

HEADLINE: Growing Red Tide Imperils Shellfishing Along Texas Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEADRIFT, Tex., Oct. 11

 BODY:
An outbreak of red tide that has already killed more than 1.5 million fish and that scientists thought was dissipating last week, is instead expanding and threatening the fishing and tourism industries along two-thirds of the Texas Gulf Coast.
In disclosing the red-tide expansion this week, state health officials extended a harvesting ban on shellfish to include all bays from Galveston Island south to the Mexican border at Brownsville, which covers nearly 300 miles of coast. 
 State health officials predicted that the oyster season, scheduled to open Nov. 1, would also be canceled, though no announcement of that has been made. For dozens of tiny fishing communities along the Texas coast like Seadrift, a village of about 200 homes and house trailers nestled around ramshackle fishing docks, the events could be devastating.
"This may be the one that finally just runs us right out of the business," said Jerry Amason, 60, a weathered fisherman who has plucked an uncertain living from the nearby oyster beds of San Antonio Bay for more 30 years. "If it's not floods, it's hurricanes. If it's not droughts, it's oil spills. If it's not oil spills, it's the damned red tide."
Red tides result from a growth spurt, or bloom, of single-cell algae that add a reddish tint to seawater and bear a neurotoxin that paralyzes a fish's ability to breathe. Oysters and other filter-feeding mollusks collect the toxins in concentrations that can be harmful to humans, state officials said, and that was why the ban on shellfish was imposed. There is no ban yet on shrimp or fin fish, state officials said.
Red tides, described as "wildly unpredictable" events by research scientists, usually last from 1 to 18 months. A red tide along this coast in 1986 continued for 4 months and killed an estimated 22 million fish.
"Water and temperature conditions are nearly ideal," Dr. Dean Stockwell, a marine biologist at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, said of the current bloom. "There are plenty of nutrients in the water, and it has everything it needs now to grow. I would say this particular red tide is probably going to be with us for a while."
Thus far, the coastal ecological systems most affected by the red tide include the large bays of Corpus Christi, Aransas, Nueces, San Antonio and Matagorda and the smaller bays of Hynes and Espiritu Santo. But signs of the red tide were reported in nearly every estuarial system from Galveston south to the Rio Grande.
On Wednesday, large numbers of dead fish could be seen floating in the Port Aransas Ship Channel. Earlier in the week, researchers counted 12,000 dead bull redfish, a highly prized game fish, on the gulf beaches of Matagorda Island.
"We're getting dozens of calls daily from tourists or sports fishermen reporting or inquiring about red tide-related events," said Dave Busan, director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's spills and kills division. "Fishermen have reported fish swimming crazily, sidewise or upside down, and a lot of bait fish dying at the surface."
Airborne particles of the tide can cause eye irritation or difficulty in breathing for people with respiratory problems, Mr. Busan said. He said his office had received complaints of such symptoms from tourists on gulf beaches at Port Isabel, on the southern end of Padre Island.
In 1994, more than 4.4 million pounds of oysters were harvested from Texas waters, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's coastal fisheries division, with a total economic impact on the state of almost $24 million.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
In a Debate, It's Themes, Not Facts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO the untrained ear, the debate last Sunday night between President Clinton and Bob Dole and the one Wednesday night between Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp must have sounded like people reciting gibberish.
What they kept saying was so clearly repeated by rote (10 1/2 million new jobs, risky $500 billion tax cut scheme, cut taxes 15 percent across the board, balance the budget, Family and Medical Leave Act) that it was difficult to sort out their actual intentions. 
 But the fact is, if you disregard all the memorized statistics and carefully rehearsed one-liners, you can get a sense of the differences between the candidates and the parties. This much seems clear:
If they get elected, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp can be expected to do their damndest to get Government out of people's hair. "We're going to give them a tax cut," Mr. Dole said, "so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That's what America's all about." Bill Clinton and Al Gore, if elected, would stress the ways the Government can improve people's lives. "How can we help people," Mr. Clinton said, "to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children? That's what I focus on."
Of course, Mr. Dole might not be able to pull off his plan to cut taxes and balance the budget. To do so, he would have to accomplish a seemingly impossible task: reducing the Government's nonmilitary operating costs, which include everything from the F.B.I. to hurricane tracking to air traffic control, by about one-third.
And as a lame-duck President, Bill Clinton might not stick to the peanuts he tossed out in the debate, like giving parents time off without pay to attend school functions, and instead push big new social programs.
But Mr. Gore's litany of "protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment," and Mr. Kemp's mantra of "lower tax rates across the board on working and saving and investing" draw as good a distinction as this campaign has provided about where the two camps differ and where the debate may resume in four years. For all the candidates' efforts to cast themselves in the center of the American ideological orbit, they represent the essential views that have dominated their parties for most of the century. Like every Democratic President since Woodrow Wilson, Mr. Clinton favors an activist Government. Like every Republican since William Howard Taft, Mr. Dole wants to rein the Government in.
That having been said, it is impossible to watch the debates -- including, undoubtedly, the final face-off this Wednesday -- without trying to figure out who has got the facts straight.
Consider, for example, the Democrats' claim that Republicans would ruthlessly cut spending for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. And then consider the Republicans' rebuttal that their plan would actually increase spending on Medicare, merely slowing its rate of growth slightly, while Democrats would allow the program to go broke.
Somebody must be stretching the truth, right? Wrong. The truth about Medicare, and much else in the debates, is more subjective than straightforward.
Here are the facts about Medicare: In the fiscal year that ended last month, the Government spent $195 billion on the program. The cost has been rising by about 10 percent a year, much faster than private health-care costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the program is not changed, it will cost $329 billion in 2002, the year when President Clinton and Mr. Dole have promised to have a balanced budget. Put another way, the amount the Government spends per beneficiary would rise to about $8,400 in 2002 from $4,800 now.
Moreover, Government actuaries reported last summer that the trust fund that covers hospital costs under Medicare would run out of money by 2001.
The Republican plan is to hold down spending so that in 2002, the cost will be $244 billion and the cost per beneficiary $6,700. That would stave off bankruptcy, the actuaries figure, until 2007. Republicans say that taking spending from $195 billion to $244 billion is an increase.
Democrats respond that if, as the budget office calculates, it would cost an average of $8,400 to give retirees the medical services they receive now and if Republicans lower that to $6,700, the result is a cut.

 
 
Different Dollars
 The Democrats draw this analogy: In 1987, before the end of the cold war, the military budget was $282 billion. It was the same in 1994. But no one would say the military budget wasn't cut. With inflation, the same money bought less in 1994. The number of troops, for instance, declined to 1.6 billion from 2.2 million, and the number of Navy fighting ships fell to 387 from 568.
In the same vein, a case can be made for both the Republican contention that the Clinton tax increase in 1993 was the biggest in history and the counter by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore that the Democratic budget actually cut taxes for 15 million working families.
The Clinton legislation in 1993 raised taxes by $241 billion over five years. In 1982, a bill sponsored by Mr. Dole and signed by President Ronald Reagan raised taxes by $215 billion. But in 1993 dollars, the 1982 tax increase was worth $286 billion.
So in actual dollars, the 1993 measure was the largest tax increase in American history. But adjusted for inflation, it was smaller than the one in 1982.
The 15 million families who in the Clinton-Gore version got a tax cut were those who benefited from a 1993 increase in the earned-income tax credit. This is a program that reduces the taxes of low-income workers and gives cash payments to those who earn too little to take advantage of a tax reductions. Republicans consider this a welfare subsidy, not a tax break.
In the final analysis, establishing the truth in these debates is a futile exercise. It is too much like proving a religious doctrine. The best bet is to ignore the precise charges and countercharges and look for the themes.
 Under the budget approved by the Republican Congress in 1995 and vetoed by President Clinton, the Government would have spent $289 billion in 2002, or $7,118 per beneficiary.

In the 1996 fiscal year, the Government spent $195 billion on Medicare, an average of $5,200 for each beneficiary. With no changes in the law, the Government will spend $328.5 billion in 2002, or $8,091 per beneficiary.

When It Isn't Time to Build, It's Time to Upgrade

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE oddly truncated building between Madison and Park Avenues and 24th and 25th Street has been given a $300 million new lease on life. The Depression-era building, which was never built to its full planned height because of the economic slump of the time, has been stripped down to the frame and exterior walls and rebuilt with upgraded elevators, electrical and mechanical systems and a cleaned limestone facade.
The building, which is owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and will soon be the home of the investment firm CS First Boston, is the largest renovation project in the city but by no means the only one. 
 Although the city's market for office space has improved since the dog days of the early 1990's, rental rates have not increased enough to justify new construction. Instead, many buildings are changing hands, with new owners investing in them to attract tenants from less-favored structures. "Renovations are a precursor to new construction," said Michael T. Cohen, president of the Williams Real Estate Company. "You can't build for rentals of less than $55 a square foot and we are not there yet. But you can renovate and get $45 a foot in the right locations."
A good example, he said, is 245 Park Avenue, the east-side blockfront between 46th and 47th Streets, where the lobby recently received a $10 million upgrade. "That is a top-of-the-market property in one of the best locations in the city," Mr. Cohen said. "People are willing now to take the risk of putting capital into properties because they are confident of getting a return on the investment."
There is some question about whether cosmetic improvements like a new lobby or renovated elevator cabs will be more attractive to prospective tenants than behind-the-scenes improvements like updated electrical and communications services.
Some say both have to be considered. "Old buildings have to compete with new ones, so you have to think about esthetics and infrastructure, depending on who your tenants are," said Joseph A. Costabile, who is a property management specialist with Cushman & Wakefield.
"You need extra cooling to take care of all the machines that are used in offices today and you need more electrical power," he said. "We used to put in four or five watts per square foot, but now it is a minimum of six watts a foot and if you are doing a trading floor, it is 12 watts a foot."
When the company renovated 100 Wall Street for clients in the financial industry, it added a generator and a fuel tank to provide emergency power in case of a blackout. "The people in the financial business do not want to go down," Mr. Costabile said. "This way we can provide at least minimum ventilation, lighting and elevator service."
BUILDING managers also know that they need to meet building codes regarding fire safety and access for people with handicaps. "To meet the fire safety code," Mr. Costabile said, "you have to be able to communicate using voice and code and to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act, you generally have to modify the toilet areas for handicapped access."
Some renovations can lead to cost savings. One leading candidate is cooling. Many older buildings have cooling systems with only two switch settings: on and off. That was fine when almost everybody worked from 9 to 5.
But now work days have lengthened and more companies operate around the clock, so the system cannot simply be turned off in the evening. But keeping a whole building system operating for just a few floors that need the service increases operating costs.
"You have a spectrum of alternatives you have to analyze," said Mitchell Rudin, an executive managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company. "You have to decide what is needed to maintain a building's competitive position. One possibility is to convert constant-volume air-conditioning to variable-flow to achieve some economies."
Robert S. Shapiro, executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis, New York, said: "People are paying more attention to making it possible for their tenants to work more effectively, not like in the 1980's when everybody was focusing on gold door handles and elaborate moldings. If one building has a dual communications system and another does not, as a broker I would be foolish not to point that out to my clients."
Renovation has apparently become more popular as the real estate market has improved, but for some the test is a willingness to invest in properties when times are bad. "You differentiate yourself in the bad times by continuing to invest," said Anthony Malkin, the president of W&M Properties, which is completing a five-year, $67 million renovation of the Empire State Building.
"By continuing your programs while things are bad, you let the brokers and tenants know that you are there for the long term." Mr. Malkin said. "You make money in real estate after you have survived your first down cycle."
Many buildings need improvement simply because of their age; nearly 70 percent of office buildings in Midtown Manhattan were built before 1969, according to a report by LaSalle Partners. And some owners were unable or unwilling to invest while rental rates were falling and vacancy rates rising.
"A lot of property went back to institutions," Mr. Rudin said. In many cases their approach was to drive down operating costs of a building, lease as much space as possible and offer it for sale, without doing much else, he said.
But new owners have an incentive and a market opportunity to improve properties that have not seen much in the way of investment capital for years. "A lot of buildings are changing hands and new owners are coming in with a strategy of driving them from B status to A-minus or A," Mr. Rudin said. Although the figures vary from location to location and building to building, A space usually commands higher rentals than B space, Mr. Rudin said.
A good example is 540 Madison Avenue at 55th Street, which, he said, has "languished" on the market despite a good location, layout and views. "With the right program, that building could be an A+," he said. Mr. Rudin, whose company is the leasing agent for the building, said the Macklowe Organization, which recently purchased the property, has plans for a major renovation.
Mr. Shapiro said that in the Grand Central area -- from 32d Street to 50th Street and from the Avenue of the Americas to the East River -- some 730,000 square feet of office space was absorbed from the market so far this year, while there was 40,000 square feet more of "B" space on the market than there was in January.
"The 'A' space took it all," he said. "The message is simple: if you do not upgrade, you are going out of business."
RENOVATION may be as much needed as a defensive strategy for holding on to existing tenants as an offensive one to attract new ones, said James E. Meiskin, president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage firm. "There has been a flight to quality over the past five years," he said. "So building owners who do not spend the capital to remodel risk losing their tenant base."
He said there had been a steady flow of tenants from "B" buildings to "A" properties and that there was no indication the trend was about to change. Besides, with only one building under construction -- the Durst project in Times Square -- renovation is the only game in town.
"The reason we are seeing renovation, is that it makes sense," Mr. Meiskin said. "There is so little new product on the market."
He said rents had only inched up recently, but that concession packages were shrinking and that significant rises might come soon, particularly in the best buildings. "It is becoming an owner's market," he said. Landlords willing to spend $70 a square foot to adapt space for tenants a few years ago, are down to the $25-a-foot-range now, he said.
Not every building is a candidate for high technology or eye-grabbing renovation. Some buildings are filled with small tenants who value a reasonable rent more than a marble-splashed lobby or fiber-optic communications.
"If a building has a niche on the low end of the rent scale, and is filled with small service tenants," then it probably does not justify much in the way of renovation, Mr. Rudin said.

HEADLINE: Running Against Hillary

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Bumiller; Elisabeth Bumiller is a reporter for the Metro section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
"ELIZABETH DOLE SALUTES WORKING WOMEN," SAYS THE BANNER AT an insufferably humid picnic in Bowling Green, Ky., where the star attraction, in a long-sleeved silk blouse buttoned high up her neck, is massaging the crowd. "You know something?" Mrs. Dole says, seemingly delighted, drawing out the vowels in her creamy North Carolina drawl. "I'm just so glad to be in Kentucky, where I don't need an interpreter!" It's a line she uses all over the South, and as usual it gets a big, friendly laugh.
"Bob Dole's vision speaks directly to what women in this country want," she begins, her wireless mike clipped to her blouse. She has come out from behind the podium and, as she did at the Republican convention, is beginning to stroll toward the crowd. She is excellent theater, speaking without notes, and the 500 people, mostly women, seem riveted to their blankets and lawn chairs. 
 At 60, Elizabeth Dole is still a beautiful woman, thinner than she was a decade ago, with smooth skin flushed prettily in the heat. Up close you can see she has freckles. She is wearing stockings and three-inch pumps with her slim, confining black skirt, as if a Washington career woman air-dropped into the land of baseball caps and beer T-shirts should be impervious to the climate.
She tells the crowd that her husband is surrounded by women "whose careers he has boosted" and that as Senate majority leader he had female staff members who handled "health care, environmental issues, foreign policy and taxes." Her tone is comfortable and sunny. "I think that's a pretty good record, don't you?"
This is the campaign of Bob Dole's other running mate. She is, of course, his popular wife -- feminist in hiding, two-time Cabinet member, former White House official, president of the American Red Cross, the take-charge Southern blossom who had the network anchors in awe after her dazzling if saccharine Oprah-style "Why I love Bob" speech at the Republican convention. While Hillary Clinton campaigns gingerly as the committed mother and wife, Elizabeth Dole has become a partisan star of her own wholly separate campaign -- her husband's biggest asset in America's medium-size television markets. Since the convention, when the strapped Dole finally got $62 million in Federal matching funds, his wife has acquired her own staff of 30, a travel budget of $1.5 million and a leased 14-seat Challenger 600 jet.
"This is the first full-time on-the-road operation for a First Lady candidate," says Bob Davis, Mrs. Dole's senior adviser, and he's probably right. Even Mrs. Clinton was on the road only three or four days a week in 1992, and did not travel full time until the final month of the campaign. She did not have her own 12-person advance team to set up events, as Mrs. Dole does, and aides say she rarely answered questions on foreign policy, as Mrs. Dole has on Iraq.
For three days in September I squeezed onto Mrs. Dole's plane, assigned to a seat near a perfectionist known for her lovely old world manners and her rock-candy-hard armor. To a large extent I observed that persona: a copious underliner of briefing books, a scrupulously prepared speech giver, an immaculate executive with a shoe-coordinated, ladylike handbag in public and a masculine, no-nonsense attache case that she takes out in private.
But I also saw glimpses of a sense of humor underneath the bright Republican power suits. One day on the plane, when everyone thought Mrs. Dole had dozed off for a nap, Bob Davis began holding forth about the differences in the landing style of the Delta shuttle and Mrs. Dole's much-spiffier jet. Suddenly, Mrs. Dole opened her eyes across the aisle and said, slyly, "Did you ask Bob when he flew his last flight?" Davis, a corporate lawyer, squirmed as his boss moved in. "Very authoritative," Elizabeth Dole said with a wicked smile. "Very macho."
Not once on the plane did I hear the name Hillary Clinton. But then I didn't have to. Elizabeth Dole will never say so outright, but she is running this fall against the First Lady, presenting herself as the spouse with the 30-year Washington career, a woman who will be too busy at her own office to meddle in the West Wing. At each stop, Mrs. Dole pointedly tells her audience that she will be the first First Lady to work outside the White House, and that she will return to her job at the Red Cross -- managing a $1.8 billion annual budget and 32,000 employees -- whether or not her husband wins in November. In interviews she is even more to the point. "I wouldn't have taken on one-seventh of the gross domestic product," she says, referring to Mrs. Clinton's failed effort to overhaul the nation's health-care system. "You're not elected, you're not confirmed by the Senate and you've got one of the most volatile, high-visibility issues."
Oddly, the wife who was supposed to help bring a new look to a moribund campaign, and to attract female voters, is rarely in the national press, although she did ride a motorcycle with Jay Leno on the "Tonight" show last month. This is partly because there is little room for reporters on her plane, but also because her husband's advisers are running a traditional campaign, in which Elizabeth Dole, as the chief "surrogate," is used everywhere he is not, especially in the smaller markets. Dole's advisers also seem wary of using her so aggressively as to prompt comparisons to Mrs. Clinton. Above all, they believe she should not overshadow the candidate. "We have never had her out breaking new ground on policy," says Scott Reed, Dole's campaign manager. "She never would."
But Elizabeth Dole will still be remembered for redefining the role of the political spouse. "More elections are going to be partnerships in the future," says the G.O.P. pollster Frank Luntz, who does not work for Dole. Luntz credits Mrs. Dole's Republican convention walk-and-talk for swaying more undecided voters toward her husband than his own acceptance speech. Clinton aides assert that the biggest surge in opinion polls for Bob Dole occurred the night Mrs. Dole spoke, not the night the candidate did, a claim the Dole campaign dismisses as propaganda. But Mrs. Dole is better liked by voters than either her husband or his real running mate, Jack Kemp -- 39 percent rated her favorably in the latest New York Times-CBS News poll, compared with 29 percent for her husband and 33 percent for Kemp.
Admittedly, Mrs. Dole is not nearly as well known as either, and people have rarely voted for a Presidential candidate because of his wife: Barbara Bush had a 72 percent favorable rating just after her husband was defeated in 1992. But Elizabeth Dole may be different. "This is the first time a First Lady candidate actually has political appeal of her own," Luntz says. "She tells Bob Dole stories better than Bob Dole. She could actually encourage people to take a second, third or fourth look at him. And that's exactly what he needs right now."
In many ways, Elizabeth Dole represents both the last gasp of the traditional First Lady, the ultimate helpmate ratcheted up to running mate, and a bridge -- to use the campaign metaphor -- to a day when America will have a woman in the White House. "I really believe this country's ready for a woman President," Mrs. Dole says in her office at Dole headquarters in Washington. "It'll probably happen through a woman running for Vice President, rather than someone just jumping in and running for President. Although that could happen too. I think we'll see it fairly soon."
She is asked the question everywhere: Will she herself ever run? She adamantly says no, as etiquette now demands, but in the past has left the door open, saying as recently as January that "if, at some point," she had the option to run for public office, "I've always said it could be something that I would consider doing." There was speculation that Bush would make her his running mate in 1988, and there were jokes this year about a Dole-Dole campaign. "If I weren't the candidate, she might be on the ticket," her husband says, as he has said before.
One thing is certain: At least one Dole has a political future beyond the 1996 election, and at this point it may not necessarily be the candidate.
 ELIZABETH DOLE'S ASSIGNMENT IN THIS ELECTION IS TO get women to vote for her husband. He cannot possibly win without them, but swaying them is a gargantuan task. Elizabeth Dole has been aware of the gender gap since the early 1980's when she was a Reagan White House official, and knows better than most that the gap is now a chasm. The latest New York Times-CBS News poll shows that women prefer Clinton over Dole, 57 to 32 percent. Men prefer Clinton, too, but by a smaller margin, 44 to 42 percent.
Here in Kentucky, Mrs. Dole is working hard. "Sometimes I feel that we don't express as well as we should the values which really drive our policy decisions," she says, going into an explanation of why her husband's proposed tax cut is what these working women need. "One earner is just earning enough to pay the taxes that the Government requires. The other earner is earning the funds to keep the family going. That's not right." Mrs. Dole tells them her husband wants to cut "excessive Federal regulations" for women who own businesses -- "Women are employing more people than all of the Fortune 500 corporations put together, isn't that incredible?" She briefly deplores crime and increased drug use in America, then segues toward a finish. "I want to visit for a moment on the safety net as I conclude," she says. She offers a Republican version of last year's Medicare fight, attacks the White House for offering no alternative "except $22 million in ads designed to scare our senior citizens" and neglects to mention that her husband voted against Medicare in 1965.
She winds up with a drum roll: "Ladies and gentlemen, we need your help, we need your votes. . . . This is a defining moment in the history of this country. . . . You have a man of character who exemplifies the best in America."
Her reviews are excellent and consistent.
"Very classy lady," says Diana Duncan, 39, a hairdresser who calls Hillary Clinton "a little hard core."
"She's just more of a lady," says Bess Shanks, 76, a retiree who says Mrs. Clinton is "more of a false, put-on thing."
I hear much the same sentiment everywhere we go, even though Elizabeth Dole's stump speech -- she has several versions, all memorized, which she mixes and matches to suit the crowd -- is similar to the partisan, unladylike speech her husband makes. But something happens when attacks on the President are made with a girlish smile in a North Carolina lilt. Elizabeth Dole makes it all sound so, well, fun. At every stop she likes to take out a doll-size wooden rocking chair, the Clinton rocker, as she calls it. "It does not rock front to back," she says, grinning, holding the rocker in her hand. "It rocks left, right, left." And it does too. The crowd never fails to roar.
Two days later in Memphis, I ask Regina McKinney, a 38-year-old foster mother of two children and a registered independent, to compare Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. McKinney is watching Mrs. Dole tour St. Jude's Hospital, where McKinney works as an administrative assistant. She says that she is leaning toward voting for Dole and that Mrs. Dole "just seems more family-oriented to me." I point out that Mrs. Clinton is the one with the child, 16-year-old Chelsea, and that Mrs. Dole is childless. "I know," McKinney says. "But you don't have to have a child to be family-oriented. Where is Chelsea the rest of the year? She's with nannies. I just don't see Hillary Clinton in the kitchen, staying up until midnight making cupcakes for the P.T.A. even though you have to work."
How has this happened? Friends of the First Lady insist that she would have been strung up on the White House lawn if she had publicly finished her husband's sentences, as Mrs. Dole did in July on "Larry King Live." For one thing, Mrs. Dole avoids several crucial things that voters, especially conservatives, don't like about Hillary Clinton. She does not lecture people about higher responsibilities. She does not talk about government as a force for good. And if Elizabeth Dole is seen as artificial and programmed, she does not project the far more irritating quality -- sanctimony -- that Hillary Clinton's enemies ascribe to her. Then, too, Elizabeth Dole has been under far less scrutiny than Hillary Clinton. There have been questions raised about Mrs. Dole's investments, but no counterpart to Al D'Amato, New York's Republican Senator, to start up Congressional hearings.
"Somehow Elizabeth Dole is able to convey that more traditional role," says Jean Baker Miller, a psychiatrist who is an authority on sex roles and the director of education at the Stone Center at Wellesley College. "She's able to appear as if she's not rocking any boats."
Feminists argue that Mrs. Dole is in fact not rocking any boats at all and that this is the nature of her appeal. They say that in campaigning for a man who has a legislative legacy on guns, abortion and tobacco that is abhorrent to many women, she is supporting the male-dominated household and the comfortable status quo.
Mrs. Dole says she fully supports her husband's criticism of the Family and Medical Leave Act, popular among women, which was passed in 1993 to allow up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the care of a baby or for a family medical emergency. "The problem is, it's a mandate, a one size fits all," Mrs. Dole tells me in her office. "It makes more sense to me to have the opportunity for employer and employees to determine what's in the best interest of that set of employees. It may be that they need health care, pensions, other things."
I realize I am now talking to a former Labor Secretary, not a political wife, who at this moment seems headed for a 15-minute overview of flex time and mandates. To interview Elizabeth Dole is to interrupt her (she has not spent three decades in the Washington bureaucracy for nothing), so I break in to ask if she thinks it was a good idea politically for her husband to attack the act.
Mrs. Dole is puzzled. "I don't know what speech it was," she says. "I'm going full steam. There's no way I'm going to know everything he's saying in every speech." Dole in fact unexpectedly complained about the act in a forum outside Pittsburgh on Sept. 7, astonishing and frustrating his aides and setting off some news ripples.
 "I think we're making too much of it, honestly," she says.
SEPT. 3, KNOXVILLE, TENN.: ELIZABETH DOLE'S PLANE IS FLYING smoothly over the Tennessee River, heading west in the pink-tinged sky toward Memphis. The cabin is cozy. Mrs. Dole gives up on her briefing book and picks up a newspaper, reading a front-page article about the Dole campaign's Labor Day kickoff in St. Louis the day before. (She was on the podium with her husband, but made no remarks. Afterward the Doles took off in opposite directions across America -- Mrs. Dole east to Kentucky, Dole west to Utah. This was Monday. They would see each other again on Sunday.)
"Would you like something to drink?" asks Jeff Ramsay, a 20-year-old Colgate University student -- mercilessly called "cabin boy" by the four Secret Service agents on board -- who is the steward and baggage handler for Mrs. Dole and her staff. The plane is a civilized corporate retreat: soft gray-leather seats, hand towels in the bathroom. Yesterday, Ramsay served boxed chicken-salad sandwiches, tomorrow he'll serve Memphis barbecue, and always first to Mrs. Dole. His initial day on the job he found himself listing toward her with an overflowing bowl of soup, terrified it would spill in her lap, and indeed the rest of the staff also seems intimidated by the boss. When a driver of the staff van gets separated from Mrs. Dole's six-car motorcade en route to her Memphis hotel, there is so much consternation among her aides about the slip-up that it's as if the President himself has got lost. Mary Ellen Tomlin, Mrs. Dole's traveling budget director, who writes checks for the lighting, sound and balloons at each event, cheerfully tells me that Elizabeth Dole is a very important woman and that things need to be done right.
Staff members have a group dinner with their boss about once a week, but most nights Mrs. Dole exercises on a treadmill in her hotel, orders in alone and talks to Bob -- if they can find each other. "Last week we had trouble," Dole says, talking in Washington. He says they compare notes: " 'Did you have good crowds? Were they enthusiastic? What are people saying?' You know, this sort of general stuff." They also communicate by fax. In Memphis, after Mrs. Dole answers questions from local reporters about Saddam Hussein (her husband, she says, "wants to free those Kurds who are prisoners now"), I ask if she has spoken to her husband about Iraq. "We haven't had time to have a real conversation on that," she says simply. "So I'm just going off his press release."
She seems sequestered in her separate world, cut off from the daily political crises of the Dole campaign. Flying into Florida, I was struck that she couldn't remember who carried the state in 1992, Clinton or Bush. (Bush. This year, Dole could be the first Republican to lose the state since Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford in 1976.) "Dole would have known it county by county," says one of her husband's former advisers, and when I catch up with the candidate one recent Sunday in Washington, he does.
"I think Clinton would probably win Dade County," he says, talking about 1992. "But what happened, I think Broward County was where the problem was." It is a gorgeous September Sunday, and the Doles are in Washington, Elizabeth Dole in meetings in her 10th-floor office at the campaign headquarters just behind Union Station, Bob Dole a few floors above her on the roof, where he is soaking up the afternoon sun in a lawn chair.
The point here is that while Dole is a political junkie -- "It's like knowing somebody's batting average," he says of the Florida statistics -- no one would ever confuse his wife with one. Dole's managers say Elizabeth Dole is her husband's closest adviser, but unlike Hillary Clinton, who operated as a political strategist for her husband in 1992, Elizabeth Dole's role in her husband's campaign is more of an enforcer, an editor and a coach. This is hardly to call her traditional. Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona and a close friend of the Doles, remembers watching Elizabeth Dole prepare her husband for the primary debate in South Carolina earlier this year. "She wasn't talking down to him, but it was very straightforward," he says. "She was saying: 'Bob, you've got to smile and relax. You don't want to fight back at these guys. You're above them.' It was very obvious she was giving advice as a political partner. It was not like a wife. It was like a peer discussion."
John Buckley, Dole's communications director, says that Mrs. Dole felt that the section on defense in her husband's acceptance speech was "too dense" and so made "minor editing changes." She also insisted that the campaign hire a speech coach for her husband this spring and made sure that Dole's anti-crime address in Colorado in May included language that treated crime as a women's issue. She is not in on the staff meetings, but Scott Reed, Dole's campaign manager, says he talks to her every few days.
Downstairs, I ask her what she has in common with Hillary Clinton. "Educational background," she says, and pauses. "That's about it." She laughs. "Philosophically we're like night and day. We really have different views on the issues. And she is a true liberal. And I'm a mainstream conservative."
In fact, they have far more in common than Elizabeth Dole likes to admit. Both were raised as Methodists in affluent families -- Elizabeth Dole as the daughter of a flower wholesaler in Salisbury, N.C. -- both are Ivy League lawyers, both made enormous professional compromises for their husbands' political ambitions, both have fought feminist battles. But it is Elizabeth Dole, born 11 years earlier, who has been at the frontier: Duke University's May Queen but also Leader of the Year for the men's and women's campuses. One of 24 women in a class of 550 at Harvard Law School, where on her first day in the fall of 1962 a male student told her: "Don't you realize that there are men who would give their right arm to be in this law school? Men who would use their legal education?"
Then it was on to three decades in Washington, from the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, to a spot on the Federal Trade Commission in 1973, through two Cabinet appointments and then to overseeing the Red Cross. (In 1981, at the age of 45, Mrs. Dole found a pastor, joined a prayer group and underwent what she calls a spiritual reawakening. "It was just a feeling that there's something missing here," she says, adding that it had nothing to do with not having children. Mrs. Dole now spends 30 minutes each day with the Bible or in prayer -- which she calls her devotional time -- and is a favorite of the religious conservatives who do not trust her husband but whom he needs to win the election.)
I ask Mrs. Dole if she had learned any lessons from watching Mrs. Clinton. There are none, apparently. "I don't think she set a precedent," she says. "I don't think each First Lady coming after her has to do what she has done. I wouldn't. Because I'll run the Red Cross." She dismisses critics who see a conflict of interest.
Not that she will spend all her time at the office. Elizabeth Dole tells her audiences that she will somehow find time to take on a traditional First Lady project: increasing charitable giving in America, an idea she says she has been thinking about for nearly a decade. "I was ready to do it full time before Bush asked me to go with the Cabinet as Secretary of Labor," she says. "I'd already met with a lot of people. It's a massive job, you've got to organize the humanitarian groups, but, being at Red Cross, that will not be so hard to do."
ELIZABETH DOLE HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FULL TIME FOR her husband for nearly a year now. I ask if she worries about what will happen if she goes back to work and has an unemployed husband at home. Bob Dole has said, after all, that if he loses he'll walk the dog.
"Oh, that's absolutely a joke," she says, as if it needs to be pointed out. "With that energy level, he'll be doing 10 different things." She adds that "also, it may mean a little more time to be together. We might be able to do a little bit of traveling -- that would be wonderful when it's not all oriented toward getting those trade agreements with China while he's doing his thing." She is referring to a joint trip they took to Beijing, she as Secretary of Transportation, he as Senator. "We had two staffs, the Senate staff and my transportation staff," she says. "And it was unbelievable that trip. Not much time for sightseeing or just enjoying a good meal somewhere."
If Bob Dole loses next month, it will be the third and last time that this 73-year-old man has run for President. But his wife is 60, and the question is now: Will this most disciplined and driven woman try to drive herself up to the ultimate prize? If Dole's campaign ends in repudiation, will she be willing to face a race of her own? In the past, Elizabeth Dole was approached to run for governor of North Carolina or a Senate seat. Either one could have positioned her for the Vice Presidency.
It is impossible at this point to know what she would stand for as a candidate on her own. Although Elizabeth Dole has served five Presidents, she has never held political office or sponsored legislation. Once a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, she angered feminists by promoting Ronald Reagan's alternatives when she worked in his White House. And yet as recently as 1984, Elizabeth Dole dropped by Ms. magazine to pay her respects, and startled the editors when she told them -- as they remember it -- that their publication had been an inspiration to her. Michael Pertschuk, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, remembers Elizabeth Dole as "the most consistently liberal vote of all of the commissioners that I worked with."
When I ask Mrs. Dole about her personal views on abortion, she hastily replies, "I'm where he is -- I'm pro-life." I press for more. "I think on the specifics, you know, I'm going to let the candidate carry it," she says, then changes the subject. Here, as throughout the campaign, she has remained the dutiful and dependable surrogate, never staking out her own positions, always taking what her husband says and pitching it to her audiences.
Whatever she does want, Elizabeth Dole will surely have a line of Republican political consultants at her door when this election is over. And next time, they will tell her, she won't have to run against Hillary Clinton.

THE UFA STORY
A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918-1945.
By Klaus Kreimeier.
Hill & Wang, $35.
UFA (for Universum-Film AG) was Europe's largest and most famous film company. Founded by the German military during World War I to make propaganda films, it triumphed artistically as a private company while struggling economically during the Weimar era, then fell under Nazi control after 1933. Its directors and stars offered the only serious challenge to Hollywood's world supremacy in the 1920's, while the visionary designs and subtle camerawork of its films surpassed anything American movies had to offer. From its enormous Berlin stages came such classics as "The Last Laugh" (1924), "Metropolis" (1926) and "The Blue Angel" (1930). Klaus Kreimeier's history of UFA is as much about German society and politics as it is about cinema. Serious but lively, and marked by vivid judgments, "The UFA Story" (smoothly translated from the German by Robert and Rita Kimber) challenges what Mr. Kreimeier, a German journalist, describes as a prevailing historical viewpoint that UFA was a reactionary, nationalistic, militaristic monopoly dedicated to manipulating public opinion. Among its film makers, he says, were artists who were sincerely trying to form a new culture of perception and who should not be blamed for the betrayal of their hopes and the Nazi liquidation of the company's past. Hollywood began raiding UFA's talent in the 1920's, when Ernst Lubitsch became the first key figure to depart. After the Nazis seized power, the exodus became a rescue mission. Billy Wilder and Fritz Lang are but two names from among scores of film artists who fled Germany and brought their talents to American movies. UFA's legacy appears in retrospect at least as meaningful to the United States as to Germany. It's hard to imagine the shape of American cinema without the contribution of UFA's exiles. Robert Sklar

HEADLINE: The Saints of Servitude

BYLINE: By Patricia Williams; Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University.

 BODY:
There's a lot in the press these days about "the lessons of hard work."
I'm thinking of the pictures of those women sweating rivers as they tote those bales on the newly equal-opportunity chain gangs in Arizona. No romantic dew of perspiration upon their sopping brows; they atone for their sins in a way that all of the viewing public can enjoy. 
 Elsewhere, welfare recipients are channeled into workfare programs insuring that the poor never sit around twiddling the thumbs of their otherwise idle hands -- surely the prelude to reproductive devilment. Make work, not babies, is the message to those on welfare -- and indeed make-work is the best the poor can expect from this most wealthy nation's most recent welfare package.
Meanwhile, children in gutted inner cities are told that all they have to do to improve themselves is to work hard, just stop complaining -- and a smile now and then wouldn't hurt -- and then try harder, harder, harder.
Now, I'm a fan of work as much as the next person, but I do wonder what lessons are being imparted. In New York City, the poor -- many of whom are the descendants of hard-working slaves, or the grandchildren of hard-working sharecroppers, or the children of coal miners, dirt farmers and sweatshop laborers -- are to be uplifted from their purportedly lazy ways through the rehabilitative effort of cleaning the subways. Subways in which some of them are living. Their instructors will be unionized workers who have spent decades organizing to improve their own lot, yet whose livelihoods are threatened by workfare's nonunionized, below-minimum-wage pools of labor.
The use of work as "lesson" in an economy that offers the least skilled few options is quite troubling. Is it significant, I wonder, that the rush to embrace the least attractive norms of the Industrial Revolution is occurring at a moment when Americans are working harder and harder and harder and harder? Deep resentments are developing toward those who are not busy every single moment of the day. The resentment is deepest, perhaps, among baby boomers who grew up thinking of themselves as the leisure class yet whom Charles Reich has aptly renamed "the anxious class" -- overworked, overwrought, so overwhelmed by debt that even real prisoners in real prisons seem like they're enjoying a vacation just because they have time to sit down and have dinner together.
While much publicity has focused on teaching the poor "discipline" and exposing them to "real work," much of this labor bears little relation either to saving taxpayer dollars or to the lessons of any labor market. The Governor of Alabama, for example, ordered prisoners' vegetable gardens to be plowed under and then imported rock for chain gangs to crush -- even in the absence of any need for crushed rock.
Alabama's chain gangs were recently abandoned in the face of pending lawsuits, but the theme of display labor has played on in the several states where chain gangs persist. I begin to wonder if there is not some theatrical stake in the phenomenon of a public excited by stereotyped and overwhelmingly fictional images of luxurious prisons and indolent welfare recipients, lounging about watching cable TV. I grow concerned about a thirst for hard labor.
Not long ago, there were news reports abut Oseola McCarty, a woman who had "taken in wash" for more than 75 years and who, having no family, had saved some $150,000 from wages that never exceeded a few dollars a week. At the age of 87, desiring to put her affairs in order, she donated the money to the University of Southern Mississippi for a scholarship fund for black students.
The media made much of the marvel of a poor black woman of sufficient sacrificial thrift to amass a small fortune -- and then to hand it on to others. "There was nothing I wanted for myself," she was quoted as saying time and again, patiently, to reporters who seemed awestruck and slightly appalled by the simplicity of her life and by her humility. "I just wanted to do nice . . . something for the children to get an education. Because I didn't get mine, but I want them to have theirs."
Many hailed Ms. McCarty's story with a kind of nostalgia for the good old days when blacks valued a real work ethic, eschewed having babies and didn't go to white people for a handout. Jeff Jacoby, a newspaper columnist, wrote: "No one ever notified her that she was one of life's losers, unable to survive without help from Big Brother. It never occurred to her that she was fit only to receive, not to give; to be assisted, never to assist. For that matter, it never occurred to her that she had a claim on the taxpayers for the money she hadn't earned. Or that washing clothes was a 'dead-end' job. Or that society owed her anything except respect, and the freedom to make herself useful."
It's a doozy, this phrase: "the freedom to make herself useful." This oddly expressed "freedom" of servitude is, I suppose, a twisted reference to the notion that underlies the common law concept of employment-at-will and much historical resistance to organized labor. The premise is a simple -- dare I say simplistic -- one. The employer hires a worker. The employer can fire the worker at any time. The worker can quit at any time. Employment at will.
But assume that there comes a moment when there is little movement of wealth, when mobility is considerably more limited than this ideal economic model.
Assume that poisonous work environments and Dickensian labor conditions exist in a world of free trade zones, of manufacturing islands whose operations can shift almost overnight from North Carolina to Mexico, Thailand or the Philippines.Assume further that the problem of labor is overlaid with unparalleled migrations from rural to urban locations, immigration across national boundaries and the general suspension of civil rights laws.
With all these complications in mind, I'll turn to Oseola McCarty, whose genuinely heroic story is so overlaid with easy finger-shaking bromides about self-discipline. It is probably worth asking just a few questions.
Do we really want to romanticize a system of indentured servitude that left the vast majority of black women in Miss McCarty's generation actually envying those who did laundry because it was a better job than most? And before making generalizations about what Miss McCarty may have "not earned" in benefits from the Government, isn't it worth asking what she ought to have earned in the private sector, given the great likelihood that she was grossly underpaid? Forgive my naivete, but are there really people in the world who believe that it never occurred to Oseola McCarty that washing clothes was a dead-end job?
Why the rush to declare 75 years of washing other people's dirty drawers a blessing? As though never getting "mine" were the answer to every one else's prayers?
We are faced today with a challenge not to forget the insights of those who worked to create the occupational protections that many of us take for granted and that many more struggle to retain. Perhaps if we listened closely to the voices of so many who slaved their lives away, we might find not only the tenaciously held faith that there was, at the end of the line, a heaven for them but also a vision of a future that would be different for us all, the children of their inconceivably generous aspirations.

HEADLINE: Aloha to the GTE Party Line

BYLINE: By MARLENE WERNER 

DATELINE: KA'U DISTRICT, Hawaii, Oct. 8

 BODY:
When Barry Neal, a consulting meteorologist specializing in the Hawaiian Islands' air quality, decided he wanted to move a few years ago, he knew what he wanted: a home away from busy Oahu, in rural Ka'u, and the chance to telecommute to work.
Finding the home was not hard, but telecommuting was impossible. When he tried to send his air-quality data, the calls were interrupted. 
 No one had told him he was moving into one of the few remaining areas of the United States served only by party lines. He couldn't use the Internet, his fax or his answering machine without neighbors picking up the phone.
"I wondered why in the 1990's we were stuck with party lines," he said. "It was a constant aggravation."
Mr. Neal's frustration soon became outrage, when his telephone company, GTE Hawaiian Telephone, said he had no choice. And his outrage, and that of other clients, led to a five-year battle that recently culminated in an order by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission that GTE Hawaiian Tel turn over its networks to Telalaska, a small competitor from Alaska.
GTE Hawaiian Tel is fighting the order in court. The commission has already fined it $225,000 for noncompliance, and is adding an additional $15,000 a day as long as the utility refuses to go along. The utility is paying the fines, pending a final judicial resolution.
GTE's troubles with the state go back at least to 1991, when the Public Utilities Commission decided to investigate the charges that rural phone service was inadequate. Mr. Neal, financed by nickels and dimes from dissatisfied neighbors, presented evidence of inadequate service throughout Hawaiian Ocean View Estates and surrounding areas, known collectively as the Ka'u District -- the southernmost tip of the United States.
GTE argued that the area involved, with its 2,400 customers spread out over 400 square miles of lava fields, abandoned sugar cane fields, desert and black and green beaches was so remote that improving service was not worth the cost of new switching equipment and replacing existing lines.
Alan Okinaka, the Hawaii Island manager of GTE, said, "We must economically justify upgrading service, so we wait until density increases in remote rural areas."
The standard telephone monthly fee for the big island of Hawaii, where Ka'u is situated, is $15 for residential customers and $31 for business customers, whether they have private or party lines.
After almost three years of investigations and hearings, the commission agreed with the disgruntled customers and in 1994 ordered GTE to install private lines in the area within three years.
The total cost of that project, according to GTE's estimates, would be $20 million, or as high as $10,000 a subscriber in the most inaccessible area. The utility offered five-year payment plans that averaged $35 a month, but would have cost the most remote subscribers as much as $166 a month in an additional surcharge.
Half the total cost, under the utility's plan, would be paid by the subscribers involved. The other half would be taken from a surcharge that all GTE customers on the big island would pay.
Very few people signed up.
The commission then held hearings on whether an alternative phone provider should be licensed. It heard from Mr. Neal and from others and decided to allow competitors to bid to serve Ka'u. Telalaska's new subsidiary, Telhawaii, GTE and two other companies bid; the commission selected Telhawaii, which promised to install private lines, freeze rates for at least three years and reimburse all surcharges that had been paid to GTE by Ka'u customers.
"We serve areas in Alaska so remote it makes Mr. Neal's area look urban," said Dan Gordon, vice president and general manager of Telhawaii. His company furnishes some of the most remote areas in North America with state-of-the art digital switching technology and computer-compatible service and offers private lines exclusively.
Telalaska has customers above the Arctic Circle, on Little Diomede Island just two miles from Russia and in Dutch Harbor at the very end of the Aleutian Islands. Of all the areas that Telalaska serves, only one can be reached by car; all others are accessible only by plane or boat.
In addition, "we will qualify for funds from the Universal Service Fund for upgrading rural phone service," Mr. Gordon explained, referring to a national set-aside fund, to which all long-distance carriers contribute. The fund is intended to assure adequate rural phone service across the country. This money is not available to GTE since it is predominantly an urban service provider.
On July 15, the commission ordered GTE to sell its physical assets in Ka'u to Telhawaii and to turn over business records and technical information within 30 days. GTE decided to pay the fine "under protest," contending it should not take effect while it has an appeal pending before the State Supreme Court.
GTE says in court filings that the commission does not have the authority to make it sell its facilities in Ka'u and that ordering an "involuntary transfer" of GTE's private assets violates constitutional guarantees.
"It doesn't matter if it involves only 2,500 subscribers," said Kevin Payne, vice president of external affairs for GTE, "if the order is not lawful and it violates our company's constitutional right."
Mr. Neal believes GTE is not so concerned with keeping its Ka'u subscribers as it is fearful of the precedent this decision could set for phone service in other GTE service areas.
"GTE is doing everything they can to block this," said Mr. Neal, who has since joined the board of Telhawaii. "With all the money they are spending on attorneys, they could have rebuilt the Ka'u District several times."

HEADLINE: Rats and Squalor, at $800 a Month

 BODY:
New Yorkers are understandably appalled at the squalid and dangerous conditions exposed last week in "Barely Four Walls," The Times's series on the scarcity of livable housing for poor families. The series documents case after case of children growing up in dilapidated, rat-infested buildings that violate nearly every applicable housing code. Meanwhile, the city's housing authorities stand helplessly by, hamstrung by a shortage of inspectors and a housing law that exempts even the worst landlords from serious punishment.
The conditions rival those uncovered in the 1890's by the crusading photographer Jacob Riis, whose book "How the Other Half Lives" awakened the country to the grim realities of tenement life. Like their predecessors in Riis's time, today's new immigrants often live without toilets and several to a room in illegal apartments carved out of basements and gangways. In addition to the obvious health hazard, this steerage-style housing contributes to family breakups, poor performance in school and delinquency by adolescents who choose the streets over the cramped hovels they call home. 
 One of the most horrific cases in the series was that of a Bronx woman named Janet Carcano. Her family of six lives in an apartment whose rotting walls and floors grant easy access to legions of rats. Ms. Carcano stays up at night to beat them away from the sleeping children. Not long ago, her infant grandson was bitten in his crib. Still, the building's owner collects $800 a month for Ms. Carcano's "home," most of it from a Federal subsidy.
New York City's Housing Commissioner, Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, says the city has less power over law-breaking landlords than it does over drivers who double park. Motorists can be fined without court proceedings; their licenses can be suspended if they decline to pay. Landlords cannot be forced to repair buildings or pay fines without first appearing in housing court. The proceedings are slow, the penalties light.
There are too few housing inspectors with too little authority. Over the last six years the number of housing inspectors has been cut in half, leaving fewer than 200 to inspect the city's 140,000 apartment buildings. There is now a backlog of more than three million violations to be cleared. Like previous housing commissioners, Ms. Barrios-Paoli suggests that the State Legislature create an administrative tribunal to enforce housing violations. The idea is opposed both by landlords and tenant groups and has gotten nowhere in Albany. This is one area where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might profitably apply political energy.
But the dearth of housing for the poor is mainly an economic problem. Poor New Yorkers earn too little money to cover the cost of decent housing. Sometimes buildings deteriorate because landlords cannot raise enough revenue to maintain them. Rent control and rent stabilization laws keep rents low, discouraging residential building of all kinds.
Mayor Edward Koch increased the supply of housing for the poor with a $4 billion initiative in which the city and not-for-profit groups combined to produce 50,000 apartments and houses. The Koch plan rebuilt the blighted South Bronx and parts of several other neighborhoods as well. But as the city's fiscal condition worsened, the money for the program dwindled. Not-for-profit groups continue to reclaim blighted buildings all over the city. But their principal tool is now the Federal tax credit for corporations that invest in low-income housing. That program can produce only 2,000 units a year in New York City, far short of what is needed.
The Mayor cannot alter economic reality. But he can do something to revitalize enforcement. He can also rally the private sector and intensify efforts to get city-owned properties into the hands of not-for-profits that specialize in housing for the poor. In short, Mr. Giuliani could do a great deal of good by making low-income housing a priority in an administration that has thus far ignored it.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Rangers' Slow Start Brings Talk of Changes

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y., Oct. 13

 BODY:
For the first time in his three seasons as coach of the Rangers, the job status of Colin Campbell is a valid topic of doubt, debate and discussion. His team, with its marquee names and its high payroll, is off to an alarming start of 0-3-2 following Saturday's 5-2 defeat in Montreal.
Counting last season, when they finished 0-5 on the regular schedule and went 5-6 in the playoffs, the Rangers have won only 5 of their last 21 games since April 7. 
 Campbell said he wasn't the target of Neil Smith's rage Saturday when the president and general manager entered the coach's locker room with a loud, profane tirade that was punctuated by several slams of a door.
Smith was merely venting, Campbell said. They remain friends and mutual supporters.
"He slams a lot of doors," Campbell said of Smith. "Nothing between he and I. We're in this together."
And it's not that the captain, Mark Messier, was hinting about Campbell when he warned today that "the dark side" of professional hockey is that "when you're not winning, jobs are on the line."
When asked for clarification, Messier said he was speaking of players' jobs and not that of the coach.
But the coach, as is his way, was blunt and candid when the subject came up today at Playland Ice Casino after a long session of work on what was supposed to be an off day.
Following a brisk practice and serious one-on-one conversations with several players, Campbell held a long news conference that began with him, eyes down, rubbing both hands up and down a weary face.
"You can shout and stamp your feet," Campbell said when asked what he could do to motivate the team. "Some people would like to see that." He said he and his assistants considered benching players and working them to exhaustion in practice and juggling the lines again and again.
"Is it going to work?" Campbell asked. "Anything I do has to be real. It can't be an act. I'm not going to fool these guys by coming in and breaking a TV.
"The responsibility falls on the coach to win games. I've been around long enough to know if coaches don't win, you get changed."
Among the unemployed coaches now available are Pat Burns and Jacques Demers. Burns, working in broadcasting in Montreal, was dismissed by the Toronto Maple Leafs last season. Demers, dismissed last season by the Canadiens, works for them as a pro scout.
But it would be unlikely for Smith to move with haste in this area. His loyalty to Campbell goes back to their days in Detroit, when Smith was the chief scout and Campbell an assistant coach.
And many of the problems with the current team are beyond Campbell's control. Because of the World Cup tournament that ended Sept. 14, the Rangers never played together as a team in nine exhibition games and practiced for only a week as a full group before the regular season.
With 20 games in the first 40 nights, they have little time for the long practices needed to adjust to Wayne Gretzky, the free agent acquisition whose many creative skills still seem to baffle some teammates.
As he left the locker room today, Gretzky paused to discuss the emotional state of the Rangers and the teams that beat or tie them.
"Hatred is a strong word," Gretzky said, "but teams don't like us and want to knock us off. We have to get that same meanness. I'm not panicking. That's the good news. Obviously, we're disappointed. Maybe even embarrassed. We've hit rock bottom. We've got to win tomorrow."
That would be Monday's game with Calgary, the first of three this week at Madison Square Garden. Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh Penguins visit on Wednesday. Then it's Mike Keenan's St. Louis Blues on Friday.
Messier, who also offered his thoughts, said the Rangers "have made enough mistakes for half a year in the first five games."
Some are caused because the team, he said, is "caught in between playing a real forecheck system and pulling back a little." A speedy, forceful attacker, Messier has long favored the forecheck approach.
Although Gretzky isn't as fast or powerful as Messier, he, too, is a gambler on the attack, creating scoring chances with risk and imagination. But most of their teammates don't seem in sync. The stars, the coach and everyone else around the team is groping for an explanation, wondering if things will get worse before they get better, and what changes might be coming.

Privatization Program Is Canceled by Mexico
Abandoning a central pillar of its economic modernization program, the Mexican Government canceled its prolonged, troubled effort to sell portions of the state-owned petrochemical industry to private investors.
The scheduled privatization of 61 plants had prompted months of protests from oil workers and even many businessmen; the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party formally announced its opposition last month. Still, President Ernesto Zedillo had pledged repeatedly during his 23-month administration to go ahead with the selloff. [Page D2.]
 
Executive-Plan Bankruptcy Shield
Special tax-deferred savings and supplemental pension plans for corporate executives get favorable treatment under the law, in part because the money is supposedly at risk if the company gets into financial trouble. But even when companies file for bankruptcy, such plans often survive while the retirement funds of rank-and-file workers remain in jeopardy. [A1.]
 
Wooing Internet Gamers
No one has yet made a fortune marrying multiplayer games to the Internet. "But over time there will be," an analyst says. Businesses trying to profit from Internet gaming must meet player expectations while overcoming the restrictions of slow modems and other technological obstacles. [D5.]
 
A More Competitive Medium
A coalition of 38 computer makers and software publishers led by Netscape Communications plans to announce a new audio and video data standard today that will permit companies using the Internet to compete more directly with traditional radio and television broadcasters. [D4.]
 
Aloha to a Party Line
When GTE Hawaiian Telephone told its customers in a rural section of Hawaii that they could only use party lines, their outrage led to a five-year battle that recently culminated in an order by the state's public utilities commission requiring GTE to turn over its networks to a small competitor. [D5.]
 
In Ireland, the British Are Coming
The Irish Times, the most prestigious and influential newspaper in Ireland, is advancing, as its circulation sets new highs and its ability to sway and infuriate politicians increases. But as fast as it grows, the Irish editions of British papers are growing faster. [D7.]
 
Europe Rate Gauge for Finland
Finland, the newest member of the European Union, has taken another decisive step westward, linking its currency to the European exchange rate mechanism and possibly qualifying for participation in the forthcoming single currency. [D2.]
 
Hollywood's Weekend Wars
Every Friday night, only hours after a new film has opened across the country, the faxes pile up in the offices of nervous studio executives and producers detailing the box-office grosses of the movie. Judgments are set by Sunday. A studio film, opening nationally, that takes in at least $10 million at the box office is considered successful. Any highly promoted film that doesn't is a disappointment. Bernard Weinraub: Entertainment. [D7.]

Cable Access as Urban Resource
 
Like many disputes that mix politics and commerce, the showdown between Time Warner and the Giuliani administration is ultimately about control of a precious resource: in this case, cable TV access. Just how precious can be measured by the other media companies wading into the dispute in hopes of turning the furor to their advantage. News analysis. [B3.]

No Thanks! And You Can Tell It to the Marines

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PETITE MARTINIQUE, Grenada Oct. 10

 BODY:
The jetty that links this isolated Caribbean island to the outside world is a simple wooden structure in obvious need of repair. So when the United States offered to send a detachment of marines here to build a base for the Grenada Coast Guard and to repair the local school and clinic, residents might have been expected to welcome the proposal.
Instead, the dockside site chosen for the project, which is intended to strengthen drug interdiction efforts in the Caribbean, is now festooned with graffiti demanding "No Base." And when Prime Minister Keith Mitchell traveled here recently in an attempt to convince this island's 800 residents that the base, whose construction costs would be entirely covered by the United States, would enhance Grenada's national security and spur economic growth, he was greeted with boos, placards and children chanting anti-base slogans. 
 "One hundred foreign soldiers here for even a short time would completely change our life style," said Michael Caesar, Grenada's former delegate to the United Nations and a native of this island, as he stood at the jetty watching the twice-weekly mail boat take on cargo. "Our little island is less than three square miles, so a facility like this can only be detrimental to the entire island community."
Accustomed as they are to going it alone, many here also seem convinced that the proposed base is part of an American effort to gain a permanent foothold in a place where even the authority of Grenada's central Government has always been minimal.
"It's a Trojan horse, and we don't want it here," said Martin Clement, who makes his living selling ice and gasoline to local fishermen and visiting yachtsmen.
Although the monetary value of the project is small, about $250,000, in strategic terms, something much larger is at stake. American officials describe the "satellite base" here, still scheduled to be built next spring despite the local protests, as the first of a series throughout the Caribbean, with similar American-built installations contemplated for local coast guard operations in Barbuda, Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago by the end of the century.
"This caught all of us off guard," one American official conceded. "Everyone viewed this as a positive development, as a gift. And no one realized there would be any opposition."
But as people here are quick to point out, any mention of an American military presence in the nation of Grenada, an island group with 120,000 people, involves sensibilities found nowhere else in the English-speaking Caribbean. In October 1983, the United States, alarmed at signs of Cuban influence, invaded this former British colony after a power struggle between two left-wing factions led to the assassination of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
"Certain things trigger memories, and talking about Americans and a military base has reopened those memories," said Ivelaw Griffith, an expert on Caribbean security issues who teaches at Florida International University in Miami. "That is why the Grenadian Government should have paved the way with communication and seen as its special mission to tell the people what this is all about and allay their fears."
In reality, however, people here grumble that they were not consulted about the location of the base, which as currently planned would take away their only cricket ground and children's playground and would abut their only school. They would much prefer, they say, to see the base moved to the nearby island of Carriacou, which is much larger and has idle land owned by the Government, or to any of several uninhabited islets in the area.
"The first we ever knew about this was when some American soldiers showed up and started measuring the wharf and playing field and planting stakes," complained Matthew Blair, owner of a grocery store that fronts on the site chosen for the base. "We had no idea what was going on until we went up and asked them."
In an interview in the capital, St. George's, Prime Minister Mitchell said that objections to an infringement of national sovereignty are being "used as a smokescreen" by what he described as "elements profiting from illegality and drug activities." This island, he suggested, is a hotbed of smugglers who see the base as a threat to their livelihood.
"If you benefit from wrongdoing, you don't want to see legal institutions established," Mr. Mitchell said. "You will use all sorts of innuendo and catchy phrases to get people on your side so that you can continue to do what you have been doing all along."
Local people acknowledge that many here are engaged in what they delicately call "barter trade," sailing up to the French territory of Martinique to swap fish for beer, wine and cognac, which they then sell to passing yachtsmen and to the American residents of condominiums in nearby St. Vincent. But they deny any involvement in drug trafficking and say that any other business dealings they might undertake are simply none of Washington's concern.
"If the Americans are coming in for a domestic problem, as opposed to an international matter like drug trafficking, then we have even more right to oppose this base," argued Mr. Caesar, the former United Nations delegate. "For the U.S. to interfere in the internal affairs of Grenada and Grenada's domestic problems is wrong."
But Prime Minister Mitchell said that the American offer to build the base is not only welcome, but is also essential, and that he would be derelict in his duty if he did not accept it. With only two vessels, fewer than 40 men and a tiny budget, he said, Grenada's Coast Guard cannot by itself protect the country's coastline from the encroachments of drug traffickers.
"Since we don't have the resources to build the facility ourselves, I will take help from any and all of our friends," he said. "In fact, I only wish we could have gotten other bases built, so that we can protect the people as a whole and the integrity of our country."

'Flat-Out Wrong'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Asked directly about a charge made in this column that President Clinton had been personally involved in the solicitation of an illegal $250,000 campaign contribution, press secretary Michael McCurry replied, "That's flat-out wrong."
Flat-out, rooted in the auto-racing metaphor of pressing an accelerator flat against the car floor, has come to mean "totally committed." What the President's spokesman meant was flat -- "plain, stark, unadorned." 
 Now to the wrong, Clintonese for "mistaken," but connoting moral condemnation. Let's examine the facts:
1. We know that Democratic finance vice chairman John Huang, "the $4 million man" from Indonesia's Lippo banking empire controlled by the Riady family, this spring asked South Korea's Cheong Am Company for money to re-elect Clinton.
2. We know that a Cheong Am executive -- a foreign national working for a foreign corporation that just set up a U.S. subsidiary -- insisted on first meeting Clinton in person.
3. We know that in April, Lippo's Mr. Huang arranged for Cheong Am's James Lee to shake hands and chat with Clinton at a fund-raiser.
4. We know that subsequent to that meeting, substantial money passed: a Cheong Am check for $250,000 was paid to the Democratic account designated by Huang.
5. We know -- as the Democratic Finance Committee chairman admitted to me -- that the contribution solicited by Lippo's Huang, using the President himself as the closer, broke our law forbidding foreign funding.
6. But only when The Los Angeles Times questioned this illegal transaction did the Clintonites return the money. If not caught red-handed, Democratic admen would be using that hot-soft money to help saturate California's TV market today.
How, then, can my demonstrably accurate charge be called "flat-out wrong," or even "flat wrong"?
The Clinton way: total denial. Yesterday Vice President Al Gore inserted his office into what should be the purview of the election crimes branch of the Justice Department by declaring the Asian influence-peddling scandal nonexistent: "there have been absolutely no violations of any law."
Gore went even further to distance the Democratic ticket from its spreading foreign-money ethics mess, insisting to NBC "there is nothing that has been done that's wrong."
If that were true, why did the Democrats give the tainted money back?
Why did an Indonesian gardener with a green card, related to a Lippo partner, pass along $425,000 and then race home, avoiding inquiries?
And about John Huang -- in 1992 a Clinton Asian fund-raiser, in 1993 the recipient of a million-dollar payment from Lippo on the eve of being appointed by Clinton to a sensitive foreign economic post, and in 1996 wringing more campaign money out of Asian executives through fronts here -- why is he hiding from reporters?
I think wrongdoing is why. Because the Gore blanket denial is palpably untenable, a new story is being spun in the Clinton White House: You see, um, John Huang has no way of knowing the source or purpose of all this Asian money. As for Clinton, who publicly hailed Huang's "aggressive" efforts, he closes on contributions by shaking hands with strangers all the time -- how is a busy President to know clean from dirty money? Another Filegate-like "honest bureaucratic snafu."
But this time, an unforeseeable break has gone against Clinton's Asian connection. The Nobel committee just awarded this year's Peace Prize to two of the leaders of the movement to stop Indonesia's near-genocidal oppression of East Timor, territory it invaded two decades ago.
This fresh media focus on Indonesia should trigger a hard look into advice the Riadys gave Clinton about U.S. trade pressure on labor abuses in East Timor -- and into how Clintonites, despite human-rights lip service, delivered for their donors at the expense of millions of Asian dissidents.
No wonder Mr. McCurry refused to answer a query from here 10 days ago about the Indonesian millionaire James Riady's dealings with Clinton in the Oval Office and in Jakarta. The White House pretends that these Lippo meetings, one as recently as a month ago, were mere "drop-bys."
Do you believe that? A Clinton policy payback for the longtime Riady campaign largess would not only be evidence of corruption but would be, as the press secretary likes to say, "flat-out wrong."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: INDIANA;
A Tight Race For Governor In the Midwest

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: EVANSVILLE, Ind., Oct. 12

 BODY:
Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, who is running for governor, won Bryan P. Norman's vote here at the West Side Nut Club Fall Festival, a weeklong carnival in the far southwest of the state that attracts visitors from all over the region.
"I was kind of on the fence," Mr. Norman said today as he waited in line with his wife and two children to ride a roller coaster. But Mr. Norman, an independent, said he was impressed with the Mayor, a Republican, after meeting him at the festival. "He has done a nice job outsourcing things in Indianapolis," Mr. Norman said. 
 Although Mr. Goldsmith has won a national reputation as an advocate for putting city services out for competitive bid, he needs all the friends he can get this fall in Indiana.
In what may be the tightest governor's race in the nation, Mr. Goldsmith is neck and neck with Lieut. Gov. Frank O'Bannon, a Democrat, to replace Gov. Evan Bayh, a popular Democrat who is barred from seeking re-election to a third term.
The most recent poll, taken last week, showed 45 percent of voters favoring Mr. O'Bannon and 44 percent preferring Mr. Goldsmith. The poll, taken by the Indiana University Public Opinion Laboratory for WISH-TV, a CBS affiliate, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.
"It is going to be close," said Brian S. Vargus, the director of the polling center, which is the statewide survey research arm of Indiana University.
Peter J. Stein, assistant editor of The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said the only other neck-and-neck governor's race is in West Virginia. "Of all the gubernatorial races," Mr. Stein said, "Indiana is going to probably be the closest."
While Mr. Goldsmith is a rising star in the Republican Party and is a more dynamic speaker than Mr. O'Bannon, the Mayor has an uphill fight here in part because the healthy economy has left even Republicans voters here more content with the Democrats now running the state.
Carol S. Cusic, who watched her two children take aim at a target shooting game here at the festival, said she had not yet decided whom to vote for next month. "I keep going back and forth," she said. "Normally, I do vote Republican, but I like the way things have been going."
Mr. O'Bannon, 66, has also been greatly helped in the last month by none other than Mr. Goldsmith, 49. Almost everything that could go wrong in a campaign has recently gone wrong for the Mayor.
In just one week in mid-September, Mr. Goldsmith began running negative ads that backfired when the popular Lieutenant Governer cried foul, then Mr. Goldsmith told newspapers that he would be doing better if Bob Dole were a more popular candidate, and the police chief of Indianapolis resigned after a brawl by drunken off-duty policemen.
"It would have been hard to configure as many absolute bad things happening in such a short period of time," Mr. Goldsmith said.
Last Monday, Mr. Goldsmith faced Mr. O'Bannon in their first debate in the campaign. Mr. Goldsmith focused on policy matters while Mr. O'Bannon read parts of his opening and closing statements and fumbled with some numbers he recited.
Recalling President Clinton's lines about building a bridge to the 21st century, Mr. Goldsmith insisted that "Indiana needs to be better prepared for the 21st century." Mr. O'Bannon portrayed himself as the candidate to trust. He repeatedly criticized Mr. Goldsmith's efforts to put government services out to bid as risky.
The outcome for the Presidential race in Indiana also seems to be a tossup. Hoosier voters still prefer Mr. Dole to Mr. Clinton, but only by 44 percent to 42 percent, according to the Indiana University poll. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, Mr. Vargus called the race "a statistical tie."

HEADLINE: Mechanic of Japan's Machine Politics Stalls a Bit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 13

 BODY:
This should be Ichiro Ozawa's big moment, a chance to begin packing his bags for the move into the Prime Minister's residence.
Mr. Ozawa, the burly 54-year-old opposition leader who is a legendary mechanic of Japan's political machines, was first elected to Parliament at 27 and has spent half his life building to the general elections that will be held on Sunday. But these days Mr. Ozawa is facing the distasteful task of explaining poll results that make Bob Dole's look positively inspiring. 
 More broadly, Mr. Ozawa's difficulties underscore the weakness of opposition politics in Japan. A two-party system seems as far away in Japan as ever.
The Liberal Democratic Party dominated Japan for most of its postwar history, and it remains by far the biggest party in the country. The Liberal Democrats are widely expected to win the largest number of seats in the coming elections, although probably not a majority that would enable them to form a Government without a coalition partner.
These days there is great dissatisfaction with the Liberal Democrats, but the opposition is fractured into several parties and more factions.
One recent survey found that only 13 percent of voters plan to support Mr. Ozawa's New Frontier Party, although many are still undecided. So Mr. Ozawa is being forced to contemplate not only the possibility of power but also the prospect of losing and giving up his job as head of the New Frontier Party.
"We are not thinking about any such eventuality," Mr. Ozawa said in a television interview program. "But I have to take the responsibility should the party fail to gain power."
To be sure, Mr. Ozawa is regarded as a wizard of a strategist, and some experts say he might conceivably end up Prime Minister as part of a coalition. But it is at least as likely that his party will collapse after the election, with some defecting to the Liberal Democrats and others joining various other parties.
Mr. Ozawa's plummeting fortunes have disappointed many Americans, who see him as a reformer who would turn Japan on its head -- opening up the country in ways that would facilitate trade and generally please the United States. In a book, in speeches and in interviews, Mr. Ozawa has called in unusually specific language for major changes in Japanese politics, economics, administration and even education.
"We may require not just reform, but revolution," Mr. Ozawa said in an interview earlier this year. He went on to emphasize the need to change the education system, along with company entrance examinations, "indeed, the whole system of employment."
But one of the problems with the New Frontier Party is Mr. Ozawa himself: while Americans have seen him as a fresh force for change, to many Japanese he epitomizes the old machine politics they are trying to put behind them. Even when he makes points that resonate with the public, people criticize him as an opportunist.
"The New Frontier Party has utterly failed to deliver," said John F. Neuffer, a specialist on Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. One result, Mr. Neuffer noted, is that disgruntled voters may now be inclined to support a brand-new group, the Democratic Party, which insists that it is the real supporter of far-reaching reform.
Some sympathetic experts say that one problem is that Mr. Ozawa is a strong leader, and that Japan is uncomfortable with strong leaders. Certainly, Mr. Ozawa's dictatorial style has alienated many members of Parliament within his own party.
Mr. Ozawa and the New Frontier Party were also criticized this spring for a number of political missteps. Many voters agreed with the New Frontier's opposition to a bailout of financial institutions this spring, but the party lost points for bickering and seeming to engage in old-style machine politics.
Now Mr. Ozawa seems to be trying to recover political ground by turning to a classic American-style approach: a promise to cut taxes. He is pledging to cut income taxes and local taxes by half, abolish a property tax and delay an increase in the sales tax.
The income tax proposal has been met by such skepticism so far that it has triggered little serious discussion. The proposed delay of the sales tax is a common topic -- and very popular -- but it is unclear whether it can energize Mr. Ozawa's campaign in the final days.

HEADLINE: 25-Year Low In a Measure Of Well-Being

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The nation's social well-being has fallen to its lowest point in almost 25 years, and children and young people are suffering the most, according to an index developed by researchers at Fordham University.
Of the six problems concerning Americans younger than 18, four -- child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug abuse and the high school dropout rate -- worsened in 1994, the most recent year covered by the index. 
 It was the first year that four issues involving children and teen-agers have fallen in the index in a single year. A fifth, children in poverty, improved slightly but remained at its fifth-worst level since 1971.
"The decline in the social health of children and youth tells us something about the future shape of our society," said Marc L. Miringoff, director of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at the Fordham Graduate Center in Tarrytown, N.Y. "It's a warning sign."
Mr. Miringoff said there was a widespread pessimism among youth today, as well as more isolation and less sense of community. "The teen suicide rate is 95 percent higher than it was in 1970," he said.
He added that the report, "The 1996 Index of Social Health," does not make suggestions for solving these problems, nor does it call for more or less Government involvement. "My job is just to give the data," he said.
The report looks at Federal Government statistics on 16 social problems, comparing each annual measure with the year in which it was at its best level. It then derives an index figure on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 the best score. The score for 1994 was 37.5.
The report was first produced in 1985 with statistics dating back to 1970. The nation's best year, as measured in the report, was 1973, when the index stood at 77.5. Before 1994, its worst year was 1991, when the index was 38.1. In 1993, the index was 38.8, down from 41.2 in 1992.
Other concerns that worsened in 1994 were food stamp coverage and the gap between rich and poor, which have fallen in the index at a faster rate in the 1990's than any other problems.
Other issues that improved during the year were infant mortality, unemployment, average weekly earnings, homicides and poverty among those 65 or older, things that have improved more than any other problems in the last 25 years.
The category of alcohol-related traffic fatalities has improved more than any other in the 1990's, but it remained about the same in 1994 as it was in 1993, as did health insurance coverage, health costs for those over 65 and access to affordable housing.

HEADLINE: Closing the Book on a Saloon for 'Drinkers With Writing Problems'

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
In more than a quarter-century behind the bar at the Lion's Head, Paul Schiffman forced more than a few drinkers out onto daybreak's doorstep at the close of a long and sorry night. "We call them the lingerers," he said, a mixture of pity and affection in his old seaman's voice. "The hangers-on, the lonely people who have nowhere to go and no one to go home to, who don't want to leave."
But Mr. Schiffman did not work the last shift on Saturday night, and as 6 A.M. approached, he had become something of a lingerer himself. Still perched atop a stool at the end of the bar more than two hours after last call, the wrenching reluctance to raise the parting glass was his as much as anyone's. 
 The Lion's Head, the history-soaked writers' saloon where a generation of New York's newshounds, novelists, poets and playwrights quenched their thirst for spirits and companionship with politicians, actors and anyone else who happened to stop by, closed yesterday morning. It was 38 years old and for the last 30 years had made its home at 59 Christopher Street in the West Village.
The cause was financial collapse, brought on by increasing rent and dwindling profits, the bar's owner, Michael Reardon, said.
On Saturday night, however, there were scant signs of the financial distress. A teeming crowd filled the bar and its adjacent dining room and spilled into the street as the regulars, current and former, came to pay their last respects.
A miniature coffin with a guest book attached lay on a table at the back of the barroom. Posted on the wall nearby was a roster of the regulars who died before the bar did.
The growing crowd pressed together in a smoky haze under the legendary wall adorned with the framed jackets of books written by the bar's patrons. By 2 A.M., the place was sold out of beer. "If we were going out of business every week, we wouldn't have to close," said Peter C. Doherty, one of three bartenders who were filling glasses as fast as they could.
But only a small core of regulars remained from the old days, and while a small group of younger patrons from the West Village had come to regard the Lion's Head as their favorite neighborhood pub, there was not enough business to pay nearly $10,000 a month in rent, Mr. Reardon said.
The financial difficulties had been going on for a while when Mr. Reardon, a former bartender, took over about three years ago. When Mr. Reardon found out he had lung cancer, things got even worse. His health rebounded ("I don't have my drinking legs back yet, but we're working on it.") but business did not.
"There's just not enough money to pay the rent," he said Saturday night outside the bar. A panhandler came up the block and Mr. Reardon gestured at homeless people across the street in Sheridan Square and trash on the ground. "That's not conducive to tourists stopping, looking at your menu and saying, 'Let's go in for dinner,' " he said. "The rent didn't reflect this. The rent kept going up."
Much of the old bar's furnishings are being auctioned off. The treasures -- the book jackets and the wood-carved lion's head over the bar -- will be put in storage, Mr. Reardon said, in hopes he can reopen in a new location within a year. He said he had been buying extra lottery tickets.
But there was general agreement among patrons on Saturday night that the Lion's Head they knew was never coming back.
Above all, they said, it was a place of friendship, where richly textured conversations lasted into the small hours and where disputes were often settled by pulling a baseball encyclopedia from a shelf behind the bar. They remembered the Clancy Brothers coming in to sing and a woman once asking, "Is this the place where writers with drinking problems go?" only to be told it was a place for drinkers with writing problems.
"Where are we going to go?" Diane Ouding, a writer, said. "I found this place when I'd been in town for three days, in 1966. It was a huge part of my life. This is the end of an era. This is the end of a generation."
Kristin White, a science writer, said many people she thought had died turned up at the bar's finale. "It was a nexus of people who lived by the word," she said, lamenting bygone days. "Engineers, mathematicians, physicists, if you brought them here, they just didn't get it."
The Lion's Head opened at Hudson and Perry Streets in 1958 and was moved to Christopher Street in 1966 by Wes Joice, a former police officer. Mr. Joice was there on Saturday. So was James P. Willse, the editor of The Star-Ledger in Newark and former editor of The Daily News, who admitted that he had not been to the bar in years.
"That's probably part of the problem," he said. "People like me haven't been here lately. The world changed a little bit around the place."
But Pete Hamill, the newspaperman and author who was once one of the bar's most famous regulars, was noticeably absent. Mr. Hamill, who quit drinking 23 years ago, said he was haunted by conflicting emotions.
"Like any good saloon it was a way to deal with the peculiar kind of loneliness that comes in cities when you are in the middle of seven or eight million people and you don't know who to talk to on Friday nights," he said.
But he also said he had lost many friends over the years. "One of the problems I had with going down last night, aside from the fact that I had to work, was that there's too many ghosts in the place," he said. "I always thought of those book jackets as looking like our Vietnam Wall."

HEADLINE: Smuggled Aliens Now Cross Mohawk Land

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

DATELINE: CORNWALL, Ontario, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Mohawk Indian reservation along the St. Lawrence River here has long been called Smugglers' Alley, an easy path to sneaking contraband into or out of the United States.
In the 19th century, that meant the occasional cow going whichever way prices were higher. During Prohibition, the contraband was an endless stream of liquor to the United States, and in recent years, it has been huge quantities of untaxed cigarettes heading north. 
 Now, a new form of contraband is being smuggled: people. Hundreds of illegal immigrants are using the Mohawk territory as a pathway to their American dreams. This new traffic became starkly apparent on the pitch-black night of Oct. 2, when a makeshift smugglers' boat overturned, killing a Pakistani woman and, it is believed, a man whose body has not been found, as well as endangering nine other would-be immigrants from the Indian subcontinent.
These victims represent the tip of the iceberg. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, the United States Border Patrol says more than 300 illegal aliens were caught after apparently passing through the Mohawk territory, up from 130 in the previous year and 72 the year before that. And the patrol admits it is lucky if it is catching 1 of 10.
"You can about bet they've been smuggled," said Ed Duda, assistant chief of the Border Patrol's office in Swanton, Vt., which polices 261 miles of the border.
These desperate seekers, from Koreans to Poles to Jamaicans who had found it relatively easy to get visas into Canada, pay $500 to $3,000 apiece for the boat ride of less than 10 minutes from Cornwall Island, part of the Indian territory in Canada, to Indian territory on the American mainland, border officials say.
Most are bound for New York City. Some have arrangements to be picked up by limousines sent from New York by those who arranged their passage. Others wander off on their own to buses or planes. Some try to hitchhike. Some try to walk until they dissolve into America.
All face immediate deportation or, for anyone who claims refugee status, a long wait in a detention center while his or her claim is considered. Smugglers, who are seldom caught, can be fined $25,000 per alien. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 15,000 people illegally enter the United States along the largely unpoliced, 3,500-mile border with Canada each year, compared with more than a million along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. In the area overseen by Mr. Duda's section of the Border Patrol, the number of illegal aliens captured annually has hovered around 2,000.
"People not from the area cannot fathom the uniqueness of the situation we're up against," Mr. Duda said. Concerned Border Patrol officials have in recent years installed seismic, infrared and other sensors and cameras along the American side of the reservation and have shared information with the Canadian authorities about people and other forms of smuggling. The Canadian authorities have seized guns and drugs they say have moved north through the reservation.
 
Complex Territory Helps Smugglers
The Mohawk land, called the Akwesasne Reserve in Canada and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in the United States, are conducive to smuggling in part because of their geographic complexity: many islands, big and small, as well as a large swath of mainland on the American side. The fact that they are under the jurisdiction of so many governments -- the United States, Canada, New York State, Ontario and Quebec -- means that often no one is truly responsible. The situation is further complicated by the Indian contention -- largely realized -- that they rule themselves. Moreover, the Indians' demand for even clearer sovereignty, sometimes delivered with gunfire, has often encouraged outside governments to leave the reservation to itself.
In recent years, there has been armed confrontation against the Canadian Government at a nearby Mohawk location over a golf course which threatened to encroach on an ancient burial ground. The Akwesasne Reserve has also seen a civil war, at times involving armed confrontation, over casino gambling.
Signs on the reserve proclaim the area off-limits to the F.B.I., the New York State Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the provincial police and all revenue authorities. Huge banners depicting khaki-clad warriors wielding automatic weapons reinforce the point.
People smuggling is still a small-scale phenomenon next to the illegal importation of untaxed cigarettes a few years ago. The police say that under this scheme, Canadian cigarettes were shipped to American wholesalers who were not required to pay taxes levied by the Canadian Federal and provincial governments. Indians would then buy the cigarettes from the wholesalers and smuggle them into Canada, where they sold for half the official price of $40 (United States) a carton.
Until Canada drastically cut taxes in 1994, more than $1 billion a year worth of cigarettes was being smuggled, according to the Canadian revenue authorities.
 
Tax Cuts End A Tobacco Trade
Those smuggling cigarettes -- and usually alcohol as well -- became rich fast. Big new homes went up and stretch limousines became a common sight in area towns. But with the tax cuts on cigarettes, some limousine owners can no longer afford even oil changes. A sign posted on the bulletin board of the Bear Den, a reservation restaurant, now advertises a six-door Cadillac limousine for $6,500 or the best offer.
Equally relevant is that a tradition of illegal border business has been firmly established. "The most damaging aspect of life on Akwesasne is that it was turned into a relatively unpoliced area that became a haven for other activities besides cigarette smuggling," said a report by the MacKenzie Institute, a Canadian research organization.
The police and others thus suggest that the smugglers have moved from tobacco to people to shore up their flagging incomes. "Necessity is the mother of invention," said Donald Johnson, a former provincial prosecutor and lawyer for the boat operator charged with manslaughter in the Pakistani woman's drowning. "It does seem logical that something like that would happen."
 
Nighttime Journey Turns Tragic
 Mr. Johnson said he would not comment on the case because prosecutors had not provided him a specific description of the charges and the evidence.
The new importance of Smugglers' Alley as a conduit for humans became dramatically -- and tragically -- apparent on the night of Oct. 2. Eleven people from Pakistan and India were crowded in a homemade, 16-foot-long, flat-bottomed boat powered by a 20-horsepower motor. A storm came up, rain pelted down and the inky waters of the river roiled menacingly. The boat began to take on water.
Passengers screamed for the operator to go back to shore, and when he attempted to turn back, even more water poured into the boat, witnesses on board told the police. People sat with icy water up to their chests. About 15 minutes after being called by Indians who had heard the screams from their homes on the shore, rescuers arrived.
The rescuers, members of the Mohawk fire department, found seven people in the boat. Six were members of a family from Lahore, Pakistan. These included Tariq Chaudri and his wife, Zahida, along with their three children: Faraz, 8; Semal, 7, and Ahmed, 3. The other family member was the wife's mother, Naseem Taj, 51. Ms. Taj died in a local hospital. The police said her death appeared to have been caused by ingestion of water and hypothermia.
The boat's operator, Arthur Joseph Yops, 30, was found the next day near his home on the reservation at St. Regis Island, Quebec. He was charged with manslaughter by the Ontario authorities. A bail hearing has been postponed until Oct. 29. There are no American charges because the boat never left Canadian waters.
Rescuers recovered three other men from the boat. A fourth was presumed drowned after several days of searching. There is, however, speculation among Montreal's Pakistani residents that the missing man was the organizer of the expedition, and that he went over to the American side first by himself.
The passengers are in police custody at unidentified locations in Canada, except one who had an immigration hearing in Ottawa on Oct. 7.
The police suggested that this man, Masood Khan, 34, was the only passenger who had not been granted some sort of official permission to be in Canada. The family, for example, was said by the immigration authorities to have lived in Montreal for 11 months as landed immigrants. Such status or simple visitors' visas are easier to obtain for Canada than for the United States. As a result, American and Canadian border officials say it is typical for immigrants to enter Canada legally, and then be smuggled across the border.
At his immigration hearing, Mr. Khan said he had not applied for such status, but he asked for admission as a political refugee. He said he paid a smuggler from New Delhi $3,700 to be hidden in a cargo boat that sailed from Goa, India, to somewhere near Toronto. He said he fled India because of dangers from his involvement with separatists in his home state of Kashmir, leaving a wife and two children behind.
To be allowed to stay in Canada, Mr. Khan, who had been in the country less than a week when he tried to cross the border, must prove he had "a well-founded fear of persecution." The process usually takes a year.
 
Manslaughter Case Reignites Debate
The tragedy has reignited debate in this industrial city of 47,000 over the issue of smuggling. Since cigarette smuggling stopped pouring money into the local economy, more people appear to have joined Mayor Ron Martelle in actively opposing smuggling in general.
Until the Oct. 2 incident, "people considered smuggling a victimless crime," Mr. Martelle said. "If I could use a lower word than scum to describe these individuals, I would."
The Mohawk police have insisted that they are also eager to stop human smuggling. "The access here is so easy," said Sgt. Roger Mitchell of the Akwesasne Mohawk Police. "If we had more assistance, maybe we could do something about it."
But other Mohawks feel the resentment over smuggling activities represents another manifestation of racism. They say fewer than 10 percent of the 10,000 Mohawks were ever involved in any kind of smuggling, and that far fewer smuggle people.
"Generally, the community is against smuggling," said Diane McDonald, editor of The Indian Times, a reservation weekly. "It's a negative activity that promotes an unfavorable image of the Mohawk territory."
But others maintain that Indians are not bound by customs laws, because they were here before there was a country. "The border is just an inconvenience," said Cynthia Smoke, owner and editor of The People's Voice, another Mohawk weekly. "We think they put it there to make our life difficult."
This argument is being pressed by Michael Mitchell, who in 1988, in his capacity as grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, deliberately violated what he calls "the imaginary international border" by taking a truck of American goods across the Canadian border without formally declaring it.
The case is now being heard by Canada's Supreme Court. At issue is whether England in the Jay Treaty of 1794 gave the Mohawks perpetual border-crossing rights, a position Canada denies.
The chief says he does not want to ignore the border to engage in any illegal activity. But others see no such distinction. Robert Skidders, who owns a luncheonette selling Native American food, contended that charging a fellow Mohawk, Mr. Yops, in the death of Ms. Taj is blaming the wrong person. "The poor guy running the boat is just being told what to do," he said. "But they want to hang him because he's native."
Meanwhile, people from all over the world find themselves at a pizza parlor in Massena, N.Y., about seven miles from the reservation. They stop there because it is where the long-distance buses stop. Some sit all night on the cold ground waiting to buy a $63.96 ticket for the 9 A.M. Trailways bus to New York City.
"It's been going on and going on and going on and going on," said Matt Hurlbut, the owner of the pizza parlor. "Finally, people are beginning to take notice because somebody had to die."

HEADLINE: Pennant Elates Yankee Fans in an Almost Spiritual Fashion

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The bus carrying the triumphant Yankees arrived at Yankee Stadium shortly after midnight, greeted by more than 4,000 fans celebrating their arrival and camping out to buy World Series tickets. An exuberant Wade Boggs jumped off the bus, dropped his bags and ran to the crowd dispensing high-fives.
The city's celebration began hours before, on the corner of West 160th Street and Broadway even before the final, sweet throw disappeared into Tino Martinez's glove and landed the Yankees their first spot in the World Series in 15 years. 
 "Yankees! Series! Yankees! Series!" chanted more than 50 men who jostled on the sidewalk around a dusty 11-inch television that someone inside Comedor Economico Restaurant in Washington Heights had mercifully placed in the window above the hero rolls.
"I can't hear the game but I can see it, and that's enough," said Rafael Belgrove, a 48-year-old house painter and former minor-league second baseman who remembers that his son was born in 1977 only because that was the next-to-last time his team, baseball's most storied franchise, won a World Series.
He had waited patiently, loyally, through the lean years, Mr. Belgrove said, and now he was really going to enjoy a fat one.
"You don't even understand," Mr. Belgrove said, as he offered beer-can toasts to the crowd of die-hard Yankees fans, most of them Dominican immigrants. "This is not just baseball to me. This is good for my soul!"
It was the kind of almost spiritual rejoicing, born of agonizing anticipation, that erupted on countless other street corners, in sports bars and in living rooms around the city last night as the team headed to the World Series by taking the American League championship from the Baltimore Orioles, 4 games to 1.
And even with lingering memories -- of the heart-wrenching weeks in August when a 12-game lead all but disappeared, of the nail-biting come-from-behind rallies, of a game snatched from defeat by an unwitting seventh grader -- the fans swore that they had never doubted.
Even the city's First Fan, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a man not usually given to gushing, gushed. "This is absolutely wonderful," said Mr. Giuliani, who stopped by Mickey Mantle's Restaurant on Central Park South to catch the end of the game. "The Yankees are a team that proves anyone can overcome their problems. They didn't quit."
In Times Square early this morning, a crowd of about 150 fans gathered outside the Official All-Star Cafe, where the Yankees had scheduled a post-game celebration. The manager, Joe Torre, and the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson were the first to show up, at 12:25 A.M. About 20 minutes later the players began to arrive; among the first were catcher Jim Leyritz and shortstop Derek Jeter, who shared a limousine.
The celebrations took even louder forms in other neighborhoods. Just seconds after the pennant was clinched, green, red and white fireworks burst into the night sky on the corner of Smith and Union streets in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Motorists honked their horns in solidarity, disrupting the calm of the usually quiet neighborhood of brownstones.
Frank Giuffre stood across the street from the fireworks, basking in the glow. "It's sort of a nostalgia from when I was younger," he said. "When I was 11, it was the last time they won a pennant, 15 years ago. That's a long time to be waiting."
World Series tickets, will go on sale today at 9 A.M. at the stadium's advance ticket windows and by phone through Ticketmaster, (212) 307-1212.
There will be a limit of four tickets per person for any one game, the Yankees announced. Tickets at the stadium can be purchased with cash only, while credit cards will be permitted through Ticketmaster. Tickets cost $70 for box seats, $45 for reserved seats and $25 for bleachers. Games 1 and 2 will be played on Saturday and Sunday nights. If necessary, Game 6 will be played Oct. 26 and Game 7 on Oct. 27.

HEADLINE: Ignorant Investors Can Build Capitalism Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The economist James Grant takes a dim view of United States monetary attempts to mitigate the effect of herd behavior on capital market efficiency (Op-Ed, Oct. 9). His view is justified since government policy, essentially by definition, is incapable of causing market prices and intrinsic values of assets to converge. 
 However, rather than finding the impact of uninformed traders' activities on market prices distasteful, he ought to point out the opportunities that informed investors are afforded by such activity when they short the economy and force assets to be valued fairly.

Russian Opportunities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 9 article on shifts in foreign language study at the college level emphasizes the drop in Russian. It is paradoxical that during that same period, job opportunities for undergraduates who combine Russian with another marketable skill have been increasing and are unlikely to decrease soon. 
 Colleges that refrain from immediately gutting programs but ask that these programs adapt to changes in Russia will find the current low numbers rising again. Like the Russian economy, Russian studies is a very good long-term investment, and one that colleges would be foolish to drop for a short-term financial gain.

HEADLINE: The Riches of Cable

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Like many disputes that mix politics and commerce, the battle raging between the Giuliani administration and Time Warner is ultimately over control of a precious resource. In this case, it is a relatively new and utterly man-made one: access to cable television distribution.
Just how precious that access is at the moment can be measured by the number of media companies that have waded into -- and complicated -- a situation that began as a simple fight between one cable distributor, Time Warner, and Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Channel. In the last week, Cablevision Systems Corporation, Bloomberg Information Television and Nick at Nite's TV Land cable network have jumped into the fray. 
 In Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign to force Time Warner to allow Fox a home on New York City's cable system, each company sees a chance to increase its own access and control.
Bloomberg and TV Land see the dispute as a way finally to gain a slot in the package of 75 channels that Time Warner transmits to 1.1 million subscribers in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. (Currently, Bloomberg leases what little access it has from other channels; TV Land has no local distribution.)
And Cablevision Systems, itself a distribution network with 450,000 subscribers in the Bronx and Brooklyn, sees the struggle as an opening to regain the five channels it, like Time Warner, was contractually required to turn over to the city for Crosswalks, its public service programming.
"This is like the newsstand wars of the turn of the century, when publishers threw each other's papers off the newsstand," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center.
The basic problem -- wiring and analog signals that make it physically impossible for a cable to carry more than 75 channels -- will disappear as new technology is installed. Innovations that will allow 150 channels and more are tantalizingly near -- so near, in fact, that cable services already outnumber the available channels.
So the debate over who gets a channel can quickly become heated. Frictions that had been building recently as Time Warner repeatedly turned down Fox's requests for a channel exploded last week, when the distributor got a restraining order to stop the city from carrying Fox on one of its five Time Warner channels.
Mayor Giuliani said yesterday he was weighing whether to appeal the restraining order.
Cablevision also turned down Fox's requests, and the city's. But last week, instead of a legal fight, it offered the city a new deal.
In a letter last Thursday, Cablevision proposed that city simply return all five of its public-affairs channels. Cablevision would then survey subscribers about what they would like to see in place of the city's mix of educational and public-affairs programming.
If viewers voted for the Fox channel, Cablevision would carry the Fox channel; if they preferred TV Land, the company would carry TV Land. James L. Dolan, the president of Cablevision, who wrote the letter to Mr. Giuliani, said that a meeting with city officials had been scheduled for this week.
"We think the Mayor astutely recognizes that the city's channels are being underused," he said. "In this election year, we want to give viewers the opportunity to vote for what they want."
What would happen if the city agreed to give back its cable channels, as Cablevision proposed? Several cable executives said news channels like CNN and CNBC tend to rank low in surveys of viewers. The most popular channels tend to be ESPN 2, the History Channel, and movie channels like TNT.
Mr. Dolan said that any channel would almost certainly draw more viewers than Crosswalks. But he said his company would not necessarily make more money, because it would have to pay fees to those channels to carry them.
Still, Mr. Dolan acknowledged that Cablevision would benefit because its subscribers would presumably be more satisfied with their cable service. "We like people to use our product," he said.
Michael Bloomberg, the chairman of Bloomberg, also wants viewers to see his fledgling news service. But like Fox, the Bloomberg company had been refused a channel by both Cablevision and Time Warner, and its programs were appearing irregularly on leased-access cable channels and on USA Network, for two hours in the early morning every day except Sunday.
When Mr. Bloomberg returned from a trip to Singapore on Thursday, he heard about Mr. Giuliani's efforts on behalf of Mr. Murdoch.
Mr. Bloomberg placed a call to Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Planning and Development, from the taxi that was carrying him into Manhattan.
"It's perfectly appropriate for the Mayor to push Fox," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I just think it wasn't right for him to push one New York-based news channel over another New York-based news channel."
Mr. Giuliani agreed, and the service was sent out on one of the city's Cablevision channels as well as one of its Time Warner channels.
That same night, Cablevision blocked the distribution of Bloomberg. Time Warner pulled the plug on Friday after it obtained the court order.
Mr. Bloomberg said that his company made no money from its brief run, but that the exposure helped to increase public awareness of the Bloomberg company, which also owns radio stations and a business-news wire service.

The Bean Show Must Go On

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: WEST CAPE MAY

 BODY:
Nothing, it seems, can dampen the spirits of what organizers call the nation's only lima bean festival -- not even the sudden collapse of the local bean economy. Earlier this year, Hanover Foods, longtime buyer of nearly all of Cape May County's Ford Hook lima beans, announced that it would take its business elsewhere, forcing farmers to stop growing the beans. But though the beans in the soup and the bean-toss were store-bought, organizers of the West Cape May Lima Bean Festival reported that Saturday's jamboree was the biggest ever, drawing more than 7,000 bean lovers. 
 And a farmer, Les Rea, who converted 500 acres to soybeans, corn and pumpkins this year, said yesterday that his two remaining acres of lima beans were selling as fast as his fieldhands could pick them.

HEADLINE: The New Isolationist?

BYLINE: By William Kristol and Robert Kagan; William Kristol is the editor of The Weekly Standard. Robert Kagan is a contributing editor.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Republicans love to re member 1980 the only time this century they beat a Democratic president. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have been trying to reprise that campaign with their tax cut plan and their assault on liberalism.
Now we hear echoes of the 1980 campaign in foreign policy as well. But Mr. Dole sounds more like Jimmy Carter than Ronald Reagan. Back then, the Democrats believed they could paint Mr. Reagan as a trigger-happy cowboy who couldn't be trusted to keep America out of war. Their strategy failed when the American people decided they needed a President willing to lead the world. 
 The parties have now reversed roles. In last week's debates, Mr. Dole accused President Clinton of haphazardly deploying troops abroad. Mr. Dole expressed concern about lost jobs in California because of cuts in military spending, but neither he nor Mr. Kemp made the case for ballistic missile defense.
Neither man challenged the Administration for reacting too meekly to Saddam Hussein's attack on the Kurds. Instead, Mr. Kemp called the bombing of Iraq "precipitous" and said the President should have tried "diplomacy first." When Mr. Dole chastised the President for inadequate consultation with the United Nations, he gave Mr. Clinton a golden chance to sound Reaganesque: "Sometimes," Mr. Clinton declared, "the United States has to act alone . . . we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy."
When Mr. Kemp blamed the Administration for Mexico's financial crisis, Mr. Gore warned Republicans not to "blame America first."
Bill Clinton as Ronald Reagan. Al Gore as Jeane Kirkpatrick. What's going on? The Republican Party has lost its way. The party is so bereft of a compelling vision for American foreign policy that its candidates don't know how to attack the President's record.
It should not be that hard. Bob Dole is not another Jimmy Carter; he has always been a genuine internationalist. Last year, he supported sending troops to Bosnia, bucking many party members wishes.
In contrast, Mr. Clinton evaded the draft; his relationship with the military has been problematic; and his occasional unsteadiness at the helm has invited challenges from the Saddam Hussein and Radovan Karadzic. Republicans should be able to depict battle-tested Bob Dole as more trustworthy than the President especially when it comes to defending American interests and principles abroad.
That's why Mr. Dole's campaign is unfortunate. Ultimately, a governing Republican Party must stand for strong and assertive world leadership. And if Republicans lean toward isolationism, the next four years under President Clinton could prove dangerous. America is about to take on new obligations with the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe. We will have to keep our troops in Bosnia well into next year. We will have to continue confronting the dangers posed by Iraq and Iran. We will have to keep a careful watch on China and Russia.
President Clinton may or may not be up to these challenges, but with a Republican opposition singing choruses of "Come home, America," and "Don't bomb before breakfast," the odds of successfully fulfilling our essential role in the world will diminish.
There's one more debate to go. Mr. Dole should read the transcript of the Reagan-Carter showdown of 1980. He will find Mr. Reagan affirming that "we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the free world, because we are the only one who can do it." Then Mr. Dole should go out and win one for the Gipper.

HEADLINE: Let Private Sector Help Solve Housing Crunch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am amazed that your six-part series on low-income housing ("Housing's Hidden Crisis," Oct. 6-11) never focused on the strengths of New York's housing market, the important role played by poor immigrants in revitalizing the city or the significant role the private sector plays in providing low-income housing. 
 It is still possible to shoot photographs reminiscent of the days of the photojournalist and social reformer Jacob A. Riis, and as the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest trade group representing rental property owners, I deplore any situation in which owners fail to maintain housing standards or abuse tenant rights.
But the deplorable housing conditions and associated public health emergencies disclosed by Riis in the 1890's do not compare to conditions today.
Most New York renters now enjoy safe, sanitary and comfortable accommodations, with just over 1 percent of apartments considered to be dilapidated.
And decent housing is available at reasonable rates, with half the apartments in the city renting for less than $560 a month and more than a third of all apartments for less than $400 a month.
Most of this low-rent housing is provided by private owners, mostly mom-and-pop operators who own fewer than 20 apartments each.
The private sector can play a larger role in providing low-income housing if government would only allow it to do so.
For example, about a third of the cost of operating apartment buildings results from real estate taxes and water and sewer charges, which could be reduced to make housing more affordable. And single-room occupancy buildings, which have been virtually eliminated by government rules, could serve to house many of the individuals featured in your series.
Instead of imposing more regulations, the city and the state need to review and overhaul the constellation of housing, zoning and building rules, the most burdensome in the nation. A good place to start is by eliminating rent control and rent stabilization laws when they come up for renewal next year.
As an Oct. 6 article in your Real Estate section noted, as soon as Massachusetts eliminated rent controls, new housing began to be produced in Cambridge for the first time in 25 years.

HEADLINE: Earth's Dominant Life Form Is Also Its Smallest: the Microbe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
DEEP in the heart of the Amazon jungle is a famous gold field known as Serra Pelada that lies far from the usual regions where the rare metal is mined. Discovered in the early 1980's, the find prompted many thousands of poor Brazilians to rush into the wilderness and, often digging by hand or with crude tools, to extract more than 100 tons of the precious metal. The episode is often referred to as history's biggest gold rush.
Surprisingly, scientists who later studied the site concluded that the rich lode was produced not by the accepted mechanisms of ore formation but by swarms of microbes that over millions of years concentrated the gold from jungle soils and rivers and rocks. 
 "There's lots of evidence that microbes played a critical role," Dr. William A. Fyfe, a leading environmental geochemist, based at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, said in an interview. "You find fossil bacteria and organic compounds all over the place."
Today Serra Pelada is seen as an example of a revolution that is quietly sweeping the earth sciences.
In hundreds and perhaps thousands of cases, scientists are discovering that microbes dwelling up to miles deep in the planetary crust are responsible for creating and arranging the rocks, seas, oils, soils, gases, metals and minerals that make up the earth's surface.
The implication -- considered likely but so far unproved -- is that this hidden biosphere of trillions of microbes and their ancestors has played a dominant role, perhaps the dominant role, in forming the planetary skin over the ages. Put irreverently, it is the rise of the shower scum.
"We're still at the very beginning" stages of understanding how microbes shaped the planet, said Dr. Henry L. Ehrlich, a biologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., who is the author of "Geomicrobiology," a college text published by Marcel Dekker in Manhattan.
This new view of how the earth's surface was shaped, which stresses the importance of subtle biological processes over the more overt ones of chemistry and physics, is supported by a growing body of evidence and is shaking up the traditional disciplines of geology and microbiology. The hottest earth sciences today are exotic hybrids of the two, with names like geomicrobiology, microbial geology and environmental geochemistry.
Hundreds of scientists in these fields are producing a wave of new findings and clues about how microbes do things like generating fossil fuels, catalyzing geochemical reactions and concentrating valuable metals like iron and gold.
"It's becoming a flood," Dr. Fyfe of the University of Western Ontario said of the recent discoveries. "The main conclusion is that if you don't understand the biosphere, you don't understand our environment."
As an example of the field's growth, Dr. Fyfe said that two decades ago scientists knew of 30 or 40 compounds and minerals that were made or amassed by microbes, often as excreta or body parts, much as humans concentrate calcium to make teeth and bones. "Today the number is hundreds," he said. "Every time we look harder, we find more."
Dr. Grant F. Ferris, a microbiologist at the University of Toronto, said swarms of tiny microbes had proved to be adept at forming "an enormous variety of minerals -- carbonates, phosphates, oxides, sulfides and silicates as well as silver and gold."
Dr. Debra S. Stakes, a geochemist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif., said the microbial revolution was often hard for physical scientists to accept and fathom because it undercut so many old beliefs and tenets.
"This is a huge challenge for geochemists," she said. "What it says is that most geological processes at their more fundamental stages could be biologically mediated, which challenges our models for inorganic thermodynamics, for driving reactions."
Dr. Stakes added, "It undermines our capability to predict what minerals should precipitate under what conditions because biological mediation changes the conditions."
On the positive side, the microbial revolution is seen as giving scientists not only new insights into the workings of the earth's environment, both today and in the past, but powerful agents of influence as well.
For instance, studies are under way to see whether carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels could be pumped underground into rocky formations where microbes would turn it into carbonates, which occur naturally and widely as limestone. And microbes injected into wells might clean up polluted water and stimulate the production of natural gas. Mining with microbes is also under study, including the tapping of gold ores normally too dilute for recovery.
Another use attracting wide interest is studying the earth's microbial ecology as a tool for understanding faraway places like Mars, which was recently in the headlines with a report by scientists that the planet may have once harbored primitive microbes. Insights into terrestrial microbes and their effects, scientists say, can only aid Martian explorations that seek to find extraterrestrial life or evidence of its workings long ago.
"To read the fossil record more intelligently on Mars, you have to understand it here," Dr. Fyfe said.
In general, scientists say, the microbial revolution is a key to understanding the universe and the earth's place in it.
"It's a hot field," said Richard J. Leveille, a graduate student studying with Dr. Fyfe. "The discovery of microorganisms in the earth's crust is very recent. Their influence has been overlooked."
Although individual microbes are largely invisible to the eye, in general they are the oldest, most numerous and most diverse forms of life on the planet. Some of their habitats and effects are obvious, like microbial rusts that speed the weathering of rocks and microbial slimes that form mineral precipitates around ponds.
But in the last decade or so scientists around the globe have discovered that microbes thrive in an even wider range of habitats. In essence, scientists are discovering them wherever there is water at temperatures from about 20 degrees to 250 degrees Fahrenheit, including the icy poles, the deep sea, hot springs, volcanic fissures and, most recently, deep underground, in some cases miles down.
Experts say the enormous range of microbial life was often overlooked in the past because the tiny creatures -- so small that up to millions can inhabit a drop of water -- are easy to miss and hard to investigate, especially when found deep in the earth's rocky pores and cracks.
Much of the recent discovery of deep microbes has been done by governments exploring the practicality of storing nuclear wastes underground and trying to understand what effects microbes could have on metallic waste canisters and their contents. So far, the world depth record for the finding of microbes appears to be 2.6 miles, where diverse colonies thrived at a temperature of 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
So great is the aggregate bulk of these microbial organisms throughout the earth's crust that over the billions of years of geologic time, their cumulative biological mass is now seen as probably exceeding that of the planet as a whole -- all 6 sextillion, 588 quintillion tons of it.
"It could be several times the mass of the earth," Dr. Fyfe said, cautioning that such estimates were extremely crude given the current state of microbial knowledge.
A gripping example of microbial handiwork is Serra Pelada, which Dr. Fyfe and his colleagues have carefully investigated, concluding that the rich lode was produced by microbes. Among the bits of evidence, he said, were not only fossil bacteria and organic compounds in the field but careful demonstrations in the laboratory of how microbes can concentrate gold.
Such work was pioneered by Dr. Terence J. Beveridge of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, one of Dr. Fyfe's former students. Working with microscopes and chemical enrichments in a laboratory, he found that microbes easily crystallized a variety of metals on their cellular surfaces in pure form, including iron, magnesium, copper, sodium, potassium, manganese, zinc, calcium and gold.
"Tiny crystals of pure gold," Dr. Fyfe emphasized. "So we know they do these things." Photomicrographs published in The Journal of Bacteriology by Dr. Beveridge show microbes encircled by dense, growing crystals of gold.
The range of natural deposits tied to gold-microbe interplay is on the rise, said Dr. Gordon Southam, a geomicrobiologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Ariz. His research links the life factor to gold placers, deposits found around the globe that are traditionally seen as formed by weathering and the separation of rocks of differing densities in places like swift-running rivers.
But his studies of placer nodules suggest that the process of gold concentration is catalyzed by microscopic miners. "The transformation is organic," he said. "It's mediated by microbes."
Scientists say that this generic process, which is known as biomineralization, can be passive or active. In the former case, the cell walls of microbes simply bind dissolved minerals, speeding precipitation and often completely encrusting cells.
Dr. Ehrlich of Rensselaer Polytechnic noted that such crystallization, once started biologically, can often continue on its own. "It can act as a seed or a nucleus for crystal formation," he said, much as salt crystallizes out of sea water.
In the active case, a microbe's metabolism prompts the making of minerals inside or outside its cellular walls, often by something as simple as excretions that change the acidity of surrounding solutions. For instance, blue-green bacteria living in naturally alkaline waters produce even higher alkalinity, precipitating carbonate minerals like calcite, the basic ingredient of limestone, chalk and marble.
Microbes can also seek out metals and chemically process them to release energy for their growth, often concentrating the metals in the process, for instance, diverse oxides of iron and manganese.
In many cases, scientists say, the physiological role of the metals, minerals and compounds processed by microbes is poorly understood and represents a research frontier.
In addition, the ties between the living and the nonliving realms are often fuzzy and represent areas of intense study.
"There are times when the biological connections are obvious, as with the great sedimentary carbonate or phosphate deposits," said Dr. Fyfe. These include the White Cliffs of Dover in the former case and an important ingredient of fertilizers in the latter case.
"But in other cases the connections are more tenuous," he added, "as with uranium in phosphate deposits or molybdenum in coal."
Beyond minerals, scientists are studying realms like microbial influence in the formation of gases. An example of such work appears in the Sept. 12 issue of the journal Nature.
Scientists from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the Chevron Petroleum Technology Company in La Habra, Calif., studied a big natural gas field in Michigan that was thought to have been made as the earth's heat cooked rich organic remains in a bed of shale about 370 million years old. Shale is a fine-grained rock made of ancient silt and clay.
But it turned out that the gas was actively produced by billions of microbes, as revealed in part by high concentrations in industrial gas wells of carbon-13, a kind of microbial excreta and a sign of active life. Carbon at the earth's surface occurs in a variety of isotopes, or forms, including carbon-13 and carbon-12, which most plants and animals prefer.
The finding is "economically important and unexpected," said Anna M. Martini, an author of the Nature paper at the University of Michigan, adding that it pointed to new sources of natural gas globally.
Another area of microbial studies centers on fossils. In an article in the September issue of Geology, published by the Geological Society of America, British and French scientists suggest that microbes are responsible for the preservation of ancient soft tissues, their powers of mineralizing turning them into rock.
Microbes found in the earth's crust, while studied mainly to elucidate their hidden natural roles, are also increasingly being put to work on a host of projects. The Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver is studying whether microbial miners can eat the sulfur and iron out of gold ore, releasing the gold from its mineral bonds and making it easier to leach out.
And Dr. Fyfe of the University of Western Ontario is working closely with the Chinese to investigate the possibility of pumping microbes and carbon dioxide from the burning of coal into China's exhausted oil fields, forming mineral precipitates.
"We've had numerous discussions," he said. "They're very interested because they know they have a problem" with rising releases of carbon dioxide from burning coal, which many scientists believe is helping trap heat in the earth's atmosphere.
In preparation for Mars explorations, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is studying earth microbes and their mineralogical effects as possible models for Martian ones. The studies are taking place at Mono Lake in California, a highly alkaline body of water whose floor is covered with hot volcanic vents and microbial communities. It is considered an alien environment much like what existed on early Mars.
Dr. Stakes of the Monterey Bay institute and her colleagues at NASA, Stanford University and the Naval Postgraduate School explored the lake last year with a robot and plan to do so again next year.
Reflecting on the recent explosion of microbe studies, Dr. Stakes said the belated understanding of the wide influence of the tiny organisms was a lesson in scientific modesty.
"These processes have gone on for billions of years and we just didn't know about them," she said. "And there are probably other processes -- the earth's primary regulating processes -- that we haven't discovered yet. It's pretty amazing and humbling."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips as Finland Acts To Join European Rate Plan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark yesterday, after Finland agreed to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, enhancing the prospect of a unified European currency.
In other trading, the British pound continued the run-up it began on Friday, gaining against the dollar on expectations of higher interest rates in Britain. The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen. 
 Trading in the United States was light because banks were closed for Columbus Day. But Finland's decision stirred some buying of European currencies, traders said. The Finnish action was seen as enhancing the possibility that Italy and Sweden might also join the E.R.M. Officials in both countries have been debating such a move.
"It puts a little pressure on the Swedish Government, and probably on the Italians as well" to join the European Union, said Roger Chapin, foreign exchange manager at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5289 marks from 1.5307 late Friday. The dollar eased to 111.55 yen from 111.60 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.5785 yesterday from $1.5750. The pound touched an 11-month high against the dollar and a yearly high against the yen on Friday, after higher-than-expected September inflation data suggested that the Bank of England would soon raise rates.
Yesterday, the pound received an additional boost after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, said he was not concerned about the strength of the pound. "We allow the markets to judge the value of sterling," Mr. Clarke said, according to Bloomberg Business News. The pound has risen 9 percent against the mark so far this year.
In Japan, the dollar was mired in a trading range as traders lost hope that the Japanese Government would soon take the unpopular step of lowering interest rates further. Lower rates are unpopular in Japan, where many have money tied up in low-yielding savings.
John Beerling, chief dealer at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said that "Japan is in a position where they have no choice but to try and depreciate their currency from here," which would be bullish for the dollar versus the yen.
"They have lowered interest rates as far as they can be lowered, and there is nothing else left to stimulate their economy," he added. "They've been in a recession for quite some time now that hasn't responded to easings."
On Friday, the dollar rose against the yen after Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report that the economic recovery was gradual and that interest rates should remain low. The Bank of Japan's key discount rate has been at a record low of half of 1 percent for more than a year.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Some junk bond issues are outperforming many stocks.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado 

 BODY:
EVEN with the horde of low-rated companies rushing to sell debt, some junk bond issues may offer investors better value and more promising returns than stocks, according to some Wall Street professionals who follow the securities.
Investing in high-yield debt instruments, however, requires a practiced eye to assay whether the issuer will be capable of meeting the terms of the indenture, or legal contract between the borrowing company and the bondholders. The woeful experiences of the late 1980's, when many junk bond issuers filed for bankruptcy and countless investors paid dearly to learn why some bonds do not win investment grade ratings, should temper investors' enthusiasm for the higher yields that some of these bonds offer. 
 Nevertheless, the junk bond market may provide an investment opportunity, if certain guidelines are followed. Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist of Gruntal & Company, suggests checking for these critical signposts:
*Assess whether the issuer's cash flow is sufficient to meet the bond's interest payment schedule.
*Scrutinize the call provisions to insure that the current price is sufficiently below that at which the issuer can redeem the bond prior to maturity.
*Gauge the total return -- the interest rate to maturity and, where applicable, the discount price of the bond.
"Applying these guidelines to high-yield investing can produce an enhanced return on investment while reducing risk," Mr. Battipaglia said. "And because many of these junk bonds trade at a discount to the underlying assets, there exists a tangible opportunity to purchase more investment value as compared to many stocks, whose prices remain relatively high."
In addition, Mr. Battipaglia pointed out, the junk bond market is currently averaging a yield of about 9.55 percent, a 300-basis-point, or three percentage points, spread over Treasury securities with a comparable maturity and 700 basis points, or seven percentage points, above the inflation rate.
Among the junk bond issues meeting Mr. Battipaglia standards are those offered by the Calenergy Company, the Revlon Worldwide Corporation and West Point Stevens Inc.
Calenergy, formerly the California Energy Company, was founded in 1971 and is a growing electric power company and the world's largest independent producer of geothermal power.
Mr. Battipaglia said about 35 percent of revenues and 58 percent of operating income were expected to come after 1997 from its Asian ventures, much of which are still under construction. He said he liked Calenergy's 9.875 percent senior notes due 2003, which are priced at 103 to yield 9.26 percent. The note are callable beginning June 20, 2000, at a price of 104.94.
The zero-coupon bond is also recommended. It converts to senior discount notes due 2004, and pays an interest rate of 10.25 percent starting Jan. 15, 1997. Callable as of Jan. 15, 1999, at a price of 105.125, the issue last traded on Friday for 103 for a yield of 9.66 percent. Both the senior and zero coupon are rated Ba-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by Standard & Poor's.
The Revlon holding company and its consumer products operating unit have four separate junk bond issues that Mr. Battipaglia terms "attractive" investments, Reviewing the operating company, he finds Revlon competing for market shares against larger international rivals, including Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Avon. Although highly leveraged, Revlon is "throwing off sufficient cash to manage debt," he said.
One of the debt issues he likes is Revlon's $260 million of 9.375 percent senior notes due 2001, currently trading at a price of 102 to yield 8.82 percent, and callable in 1998. The issue is rated B-2 by Moody's and B by S.& P.
West Point Stevens, a leading maker of bed and textile products, is benefiting from capital investments that have enabled it to become the industry's lowest-cost producer. In addition, its customers include large, high-volume merchandisers, like Wal-Mart, Kmart, J. C. Penney, Sears and Target, with the top seven accounts representing 43 percent of its $1.6 billion in 1995 sales.
Mr. Battipaglia recommends the company's 9.375 percent senior subordinated debentures due 2005, currently priced at 101.50 to yield 9.13 percent. Callable after Dec. 15, 1998, the debentures are rated B-2 by Moody's and B+ by S.& P.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE GOVERNORS;
North Carolina Incumbent Finds Recipe for Success

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBEMARLE, N.C.

 BODY:
He is a Democratic Governor from the South. Sensing shifts in the electorate, particularly after Republicans took control of the House in 1994, he has moved purposefully to the right. He now embraces tax cuts, time limits for welfare recipients and more prison time for violent felons, along with increased spending on education. He has alienated a few liberals, but they have nowhere else to go. And the polls show he is cruising toward re-election on Nov. 5.
Comparisons to Bill Clinton are anything but coincidental. Just as the President seems to have found a recipe for Democratic success on the national level, so is Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina demonstrating that Southern Democrats may yet be saved from extinction. 
 Despite serving for 12 years as a Democratic Governor in an increasingly Republican state, and despite being one of only three Democratic governors in the 11 states of the Old Confederacy, Mr. Hunt is one of the nation's most popular governors.
A poll of North Carolinians taken in July by a group of news organizations found that 86 percent held a favorable view of his performance, 87 percent admired his moral values and 91 percent liked his personality.
In Mr. Hunt's quest for a fourth term (he served from 1977 to 1985 and again from 1993 to the present), he held a mid-September lead of 26 percentage points over his Republican rival, State Representative Robin Hayes, according to a poll taken by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research. The silver-haired Governor, who is 59, says this is his final race for elective office.
Mr. Hunt's political formula mixes conservative stands on welfare, taxes and crime with heavy government backing for children's programs, an avoidance of divisive social issues, a defiant stand against Mr. Clinton's call for strict regulation of tobacco, and an infectious, cheerleading style.
Mr. Hunt rejects the notion that his ideology has changed markedly since his first two terms, when he was considered slightly left of center.
He said, for example, that his decision to propose the largest tax cut in the state's history in late 1994 -- a $343 million reduction in personal and corporate income taxes -- was inspired not by that year's Republican takeover of the state House of Representatives, but by the state's economic prosperity. This year he has proposed additional cuts in the corporate income tax and the sales tax on food.
"Democrats ought to be willing to give people their money back when you have enough and can still do the things you need to do," he said in an interview while campaigning in the central part of the state.
But Mr. Hunt also suggests that his experiences as a corporate lawyer from 1985 to 1992 and his loss to Jesse Helms in their 1984 Senate race helped make him a more pragmatic politician.
"I may be more conservative, but the real issue is what are we doing?" he said. "And I think we're doing what needs to be done in North Carolina, what our people want us to do. I'm focusing on how you make things work. That doesn't necessarily fit the ideological test that a lot of people like to apply."
A number of governmental analysts in North Carolina say Mr. Hunt has moved astutely with the times.
"Like Bill Clinton, he's going where the voters are, or where he perceives them to be," said Thad L. Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
David Flaherty Sr., Mr. Hunt's Republican opponent in his first gubernatorial election, said he found Mr. Hunt to be more conservative and less partisan than in their 1976 campaign. A former chairman of the state Republican Party, Mr. Flaherty declined to say whether he would vote for Mr. Hunt this year, but said he would not campaign against him.
"When a man is doing all the things you expect and want of a Republican, how do you oppose him?" Mr. Flaherty asked.
Mr. Hayes has criticized the Governor for shifting positions, for failing to raise the state's low rankings in areas like teacher pay and scores on Scholastic Assessment Tests, and for presiding over increases in juvenile crime and teen-age drug use. But even Mr. Hayes's operatives find themselves complimenting Mr. Hunt's abilities, albeit left-handedly.
"He is a better politician than Bill Clinton," said Andrew Duke, a spokesman for the Hayes campaign, "and Bill Clinton's probably one of the best in terms of being able to find the middle and squeeze through it."
The Governor's campaign events highlight his new agenda. He began one recent day by opening a new prison near Vanceboro -- the number of state prison beds has increased to 28,111 from 18,925 since 1993 -- and then toured a middle school in Shallotte to emphasize school safety measures.
Last week, he helped open a job training center in Greensboro by ripping up a ceremonial welfare check. (His Work First initiative places a two-year limit on cash benefits and requires welfare recipients to get a job or job training within 12 weeks.)
From Greensboro, he traveled to Albemarle, where he visited a child care center financed by his $58 million Smart Start program, which seeks to provide education, health and nutrition services for low-income children in their first five years. A longtime authority on education, Mr. Hunt believes that government's inattention to children's early years has left them "destined to fail."
Even the Smart Start program, while Democratic in its instincts, is Republican in its structure. Like this year's Federal welfare law, it is essentially a block grant program that allows counties to spend money in a wide variety of ways to achieve its health and educational goals. Here in Stanly County, for example, county administrators have chosen to give subsidies to new parents so that mothers can stay home from work during a baby's first year.
"Not everybody would think that's the right thing to do," Mr. Hunt said. "The point is that they thought it was, and they're finding out it works."
On many social issues, the Governor seems more of a traditional Democrat. He supports abortion rights and affirmative action, for instance, but maintains that North Carolinians spend little time thinking about such matters.
Chris J. Fitzsimon, executive director of the Common Sense Foundation, a left-leaning policy group in Raleigh, said many liberals were disappointed that Mr. Hunt had cozied up to business rather than using his political capital to move the state in a more progressive direction.
But any alienation felt by the left is unlikely to have much political impact. "He's turned some people off," said State Representative H. M. (Mickey) Michaux Jr., a Durham Democrat, "but he hasn't turned them off enough to go for the other person."

HEADLINE: Powerful Bull Market Sends Dow To Its First Closing Above 6,000

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Continuing one of the most powerful market advances in history, the Dow Jones industrial average rose past 6,000 yesterday, closing up 40.62 points at 6,010.
The Dow, by far the most widely watched gauge of the market, has risen 154 percent in the just over six years since the current run began after prices bottomed on Oct. 11, 1990, during the 1990-91 recession. 
 The move owes much of its strength to increasing purchases of stocks, directly and through mutual funds, by individual investors concerned about having enough money for retirement.
And it reflects the prolonged economic cycle. The relatively slow growth of the cycle has been criticized by Bob Dole in the Presidential campaign, but it has gone over very well on Wall Street.
"We call it the Silly Putty cycle," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs. "It is stretched out because things are developing more slowly." As a result, she said, neither inflation nor recession has appeared to be a significant threat, and stock prices have continued to advance. She noted that corporate profits had risen substantially over the six years.
During that entire stretch, the Dow has never suffered a 10 percent decline. Not in the history of the Dow, which dates back 100 years, has the average moved up so much without such a drop. Nor has a bull market ever lasted so many years without such a setback.
The rising confidence has helped make doubles in the Dow come much more quickly than they used to. It took the market more than 16 years to double from 500 to 1,000, and then took more than 14 years to make it to 2,000. But the double to 4,000 took just over eight years. And the 6,000 mark was reached only five and a half years after the index first hit 3,000.
The final lift above 6,000 came on Columbus Day, a holiday for many, including the bond market. Volume was light by current stock market standards, but trading on the New York Stock Exchange still exceeded 300 million shares, a figure that would have seemed very high only a few years ago. That in itself is a measure of how vigorous the stock market has become.
The advance was widespread, with the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Nasdaq composite index also setting records. But airline stocks were weak, in part because of rising oil prices, leading the Dow Jones transportation average to slip 17.84, to 2,058.05. Among the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, the one that contributed most to yesterday's rise was Texaco, which rose 3 5/8, to 101 3/4.
Although major indexes are at records, the recent advance has been more selective than the rise earlier this year, before a downdraft in June and July scared some investors and led to a brief period of withdrawals from stock mutual funds.
"The market now is being pulled up by large-capitalization growth stocks," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. Most of the gain in the Nasdaq index has come from large companies like Intel, which traded at a record high yesterday, closing at 107 5/8, up 2 1/4. It gained several points in after-hours trading, as a result of strong earnings. On the other hand, Netscape, the leading Internet company, rose 3 7/8, to 44 7/8, but is trading for about half what if fetched last December.
The Russell 1,000 index, which includes the 1,000 largest companies in the country, ranked by the value of their stock, rose 1.65, to 375.02 yesterday, and is 3.5 percent above the peak it had set before the summer slip. But the Russell 2,000 index, which includes the next 2,000 stocks, is still 4.3 percent below its spring high, despite rising 1.11, to 349.
Since the last recession ended, in March 1991, traders have occasionally worried about excessive growth, which could ignite inflation, but those fears have always abated. The most recent concern led to widespread speculation that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would raise interest rates last month. But it did not, and since then there have been enough indications of weak growth that many no longer expect an increase after the election.
At the same time, the minority on Wall Street who fear an imminent recession -- and with that a plunge in corporate profits -- have gained few converts. The term "Goldilocks economy," neither too strong nor too weak, was coined in scorn by bearish analysts a few years ago, but seems to describe both how the economy has turned out, and how many investors expect it to continue.
The combination of strong financial markets and less-than-vigorous economic growth is not limited to the United States. "On the margin, the global economy is weakening," Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs said. But British stocks hit a record yesterday, and German stocks are only a bit below the peak they reached last week.
The rise in American corporate profits in recent years has meant that the market does not appear to be exceptionally overvalued, when measured as a multiple of current profits, although it is near the upper end of historic ranges. For the moment, there is general confidence that profits will continue to grow for the rest of this year and into 1997.
Mr. Shulman of Salomon Brothers, who forecasts the Dow will get to 6,200 and the S.& P. 500 gauge to 720, up from yesterday's close of 703.54, cautioned that at that level it would be at about 18 times this year's profit levels. He said that the market peaked at 18 to 19 times profits in 1968, 1972 and 1987.
By some other valuation measures, stock prices long ago grew excessive. The dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 -- the income an investor would earn by buying all 500 stocks in the index if they did not go up or down in price over the next year -- is now 2.1 percent, a record low. By contrast, in 1987 the yield bottomed at 2.6 percent, which was then the lowest ever.
But such valuation measures have largely been discounted, with explanations that they no longer apply in an era in which companies can use excess money to buy back stocks, and by a widespread belief that the stock market is the only place to make long-term investments. Mutual funds saw record amounts of cash put into stock funds early this year, and while they have slowed a bit, they remain very high by historical standards.

HEADLINE: Moscow Sends Homeless To Faraway Hometowns

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Behind the iron gate, in a squat red-brick building with barred windows, Viktor Ryazanov sits imprisoned in Social Rehabilitation Center No. 2.
He is allowed to shower once every 10 days. At night, his toilet is a chipped ceramic pot shared with nine other men. For nearly a month, he has been locked in a dingy cell. And soon Mr. Ryazanov, a 47-year-old Russian laborer, will be deported from this city against his will. 
 He is not a criminal. He is a homeless man.
In a measure condemned by human rights advocates and applauded by local citizens, this city has begun to deport thousands of homeless people, rousting them from railway stations and vegetable markets, detaining them for up to 30 days without charge and loading them onto trains to distant villages where they grew up or were last registered as permanent residents.
President Boris N. Yeltsin and Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov have described the deportations as a potent weapon in the war on crime. But none of the 6,000 people deported so far have been charged with any wrongdoing, the police acknowledge.
Rather, the measure seems intended to clear the streets of poor Russians and immigrants from the former Soviet republics who have flooded the capital in a desperate, often futile, search for jobs and housing.
"We don't want our city to look like the streets of New York or the shantytowns of Latin America," Aleksandr V. Zolin, one of the Mayor's legal advisers, said in an interview.
"We're not saying there should be an iron curtain separating Moscow from the rest of the country, but we don't need homeless vagrants or beggars here," he said.
The police in Moscow estimate that 20,000 people, one-fifth the number in New York City, are homeless in this city of eight million. In Moscow, with hardly any shelters, most live on the streets. The debate over how to deal with them reflects Russia's struggle to cope with a social ill that has spread since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The new, post-Communist Russian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of movement and forbids detention without charge for more than 48 hours. And in the city's new policy, some rights advocates say they hear echoes of old Soviet decrees, which tried to close the capital to virtually all but the most politically connected newcomers.
"As a whole this contradicts our Constitution and our law," Vladimir A. Kartashkin, chairman of Mr. Yeltsin's Commission on Human Rights, said of the new policy. "This is a very serious issue."
Mr. Kartashkin said his commission would study the matter and present its findings to Mr. Yeltsin in a few months.
Undeterred by such criticism, city officials readily acknowledge that they are trying to close the city to the poor. "If people can afford to live here, they are welcome," Mr. Zolin said. "If they cannot, they should stay where they are. In our view, there is no freedom without financial means."
Mayor Luzhkov outlined the city's deportation policy seven weeks ago, after a decree from President Yeltsin gave city officials broad power to detain and deport the homeless.
The deportations, which have cost the city about $4.5 million so far, help ease the strain on its already overwhelmed transportation and social service network and protect the public from disease, Mr. Zolin said. He scoffed at the idea that the measures might be unconstitutional.
"Their idea of freedom of movement is the freedom to sleep in the streets," Mr. Zolin said, "and what kind of freedom is that?"
Some of the deported have managed to come back, the police say. But outraged human rights advocates say they may still carry their complaints to Russia's highest court.
"This is terrifying," said Sergei A. Kovalyov, a human rights advocate who is also a member of Parliament. "We are all children of the Soviet era, the Stalin era. We have seen deportations before. We must raise our voices against this."
But on the bustling streets here, there is little sympathy for the beggars huddling in subway stations, the vagabonds lurching past gleaming new shops and the wrinkled women pleading for rubles.
Some are alcoholics, ex-convicts or prostitutes. Some are old people who were swindled out of their homes when real estate was privatized, or immigrants whose dreams of a better life in the big city have crashed around them.
There are few homeless children in Moscow, and none have been deported, the police say. Ninety-three percent of the people forced to leave the city have been men, mostly between the ages of 30 and 60.
"They are lazy bums who make begging a way of living," said Larisa, 47, an engineer who was hurrying home from work and would not give her last name. "I work hard to get by. Why don't they?"
But Mr. Ryazanov, the grizzled man imprisoned in Social Rehabilitation Center No. 2, which is run by the police, said deportation would worsen his already precarious situation.
"In Moscow at least I have a job," said Mr. Ryazanov, who loaded vegetables in a local market before he was detained. There is little work in Frolovo, the town in southern Russia where he grew up and where he will soon return, he said.
"There I have no job, no family, no home," he said. "There I will be homeless and a thief. How else will I survive without stealing for food?"
It is not that homelessness did not exist during Soviet times, although fewer people slept on the streets then. But Communist leaders prided themselves on their country's guarantee of employment and housing for all. Homeless people who threatened that image were considered criminals.
Article 209 of the Soviet criminal code defined vagrancy as a crime punishable by at least one year in prison, the police say. That law, along with others restricting movement from the provinces to the city, helped prevent the homeless from surfacing in large numbers here.
But with the collapse of Communism, those laws were abolished. And as tens of thousands of people poured into the capital, fleeing ethnic strife or seeking economic opportunity, city officials found themselves unprepared to deal with the growing population of street people.
Today, New York City has 25,000 government-provided shelter beds, a number that homeless advocates consider woefully inadequate. Moscow has 25.
"We need more shelters," said Vladimir L. Bychkovsky, who runs Social Rehabilitation Center No. 2. "We'd like to do more for these people, but we can't. We have to send them to the streets."
By the end of 1997, city officials hope to have more than 800 beds. But those will be reserved for the homeless from Moscow, who are detained but not deported.
Outsiders -- even Russians from other cities -- will continue to be shipped out unless they are granted permanent residency here, a privilege reserved for the very lucky or the very rich.
Temporary permits are available for vacations or studies or medical treatment. But the only people from outside who are allowed to live here permanently, city officials say, are those who can persuade a Muscovite to give up his or her home -- in effect swap residences -- or those who can afford to buy an apartment here, which cost anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000.
Human rights advocates say this, too, is unconstitutional. These requirements prevent most average Russians, who earn about $100 a month, from living legally in the nation's capital.
Without a permanent residency stamp in the internal passports that all Russians carry, most people are barred from finding on-the-books jobs, from renting government-subsidized apartments, from attending public schools and from receiving free, routine medical care, city officials say.
"Without this stamp, they're entitled to nothing," said Siobhan Keegan, an Irishwoman who is the medical coordinator of Doctors Without Borders, the international relief organization that treats the homeless here. "The lucky ones find temporary work. The rest, they beg."
Social Rehabilitation Center No. 2, one of 12 detention centers, holds 100 people in 10 small cells that smell of unwashed bodies and steamed cabbage.
The homeless are detained and deported, but rarely rehabilitated, Mr. Bychkovsky said. The police buy tickets and load the prisoners on the train. Some accompany the homeless to their destinations. Others do not.
In either case, the homeless people usually return to a life without homes, without steady work and with dim prospects of finding either.
"We, the police, we can't solve this problem," Mr. Bychkovsky said. "Half the people we send out find their way back. Poor people will always come to Moscow, because it's easier for them to find jobs here."
Mr. Ryazanov came to Moscow and found off-the-books work in the vegetable markets. Rashid Safin of Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia and Viktor Sosnovsky from Ukraine found work building country houses. They slept in gardens, under bridges, in alleys before they were detained. Soon they will be sent home.
So they listened jealously as Vitaly Mladchenkov, 28, an ex-convict, told his story. He is from Moscow, so he can live legally in this city and is entitled to a shelter bed and subsidized housing.
But entitlements mean little these days. More than 20 million Russians wait on city lists for housing, officials say. Mr. Mladchenkov says he slept on the street for three years while he waited for an apartment. And since the city's 25-bed shelter is usually full, he doubts that he will find a spot there either.
"So when I get out of here," he asked, "where will I go?"
No one said anything, not the homeless men sitting next to him, nor the watchmen guarding the door.
Mr. Mladchenkov shrugged. He knew the answer. They all knew the answer. "I will live in the street again," he said matter-of-factly. "We will all live in the street again."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Earnings Top Forecasts, Lifting Auto Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation reported third-quarter earnings today that were considerably above analysts' expectations, as ever more Americans have been choosing sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, which have high profit margins, over cars. The report produced a broad rally in auto stocks.
The shift toward light trucks and away from cars, on which auto makers are offering larger rebates and other sales incentives, helped Chrysler earn $680 million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $14.4 billion. 
 Analysts had predicted that Chrysler would earn 71 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call. In the corresponding quarter a year earlier, Chrysler earned $354 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $12 billion.
Investors responded by bidding up the shares of not only Chrysler, which rose $1, to $32.75, but also of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. G.M. stock rose $1.75, to $51.875, and Ford stock closed at $32.875, up 87.5 cents.
"All the autos are up as a result of Chrysler," said Kenneth A. Blaschke, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The Street is a little more optimistic about Ford and G.M.'s earnings potential."
David B. Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities Inc., agreed. "The market is expecting some pleasant surprises from Ford and G.M. as well," he said, cautioning, however, "I wouldn't bet the ranch on it."
G.M., which had lackluster sales in the third quarter, is expected to report its earnings on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting earnings of 75 cents a share. Ford is due to release earnings on Wednesday, and analysts expect it to earn 52 cents a share, according to First Call.
In response to Chrysler's report, several analysts raised their full-year earnings estimates for the company. Mr. Healy raised his 1996 earnings estimate to $5 a share from $4.65. Mr. Blaschke raised his estimate to $5.14 from $4.74 for 1996, and his estimate for next year to $5 a share from $4.25.
Chrysler's earnings in the third quarter included a one-time, after-tax charge of $55 million to pay for early retirement buyouts for 576 salaried employees in the United States and Canada, said Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer.
Analysts were hard pressed to find any bad news in the company's report. Their only offering was that Chrysler's current strength could beget future weakness. More than other auto makers, Chrysler has profited as buyers have traded in their cars for mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups.
Chrysler officials said that next year they would be able to build 190,000 more utility vehicles and pickups than this year. The company is adding a new utility vehicle for the 1998 model year, called the Dodge Durango. But other auto makers are also scrambling to build more trucks, a trend that analysts worry could create a glut.
As Chrysler's fortunes have improved in the United States, the company has started to look further afield. More than Ford and G.M., Chrysler has traditionally focused on selling its cars and trucks in North America, but it is increasingly looking abroad for sales and production.
In the last two months, it has announced plans to build a pickup truck assembly plant and an engine factory in Brazil, to set up a vehicle distribution subsidiary in South Korea and to open a regional headquarters in Singapore for Southeast Asian operations.
Chrysler has also set aside a nest egg to help it get through the next economic downturn. The cash hoard for Chrysler's automotive division had grown to $7.5 billion by the end of September, while it stood at $6.4 billion a year earlier.
That could signal a higher dividend soon. In response to the hostile takeover bid last year by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, Chrysler promised to raise dividends or buy back additional stock when its auto-related reserves reached more than $7.5 billion.
Chrysler also announced that as a result of the pact it reached with Mr. Kerkorian in February it had bought back $452 million of its stock in the third quarter. It expects to buy back another $400 million in the fourth quarter, bringing its buyback total for the year to $2 billion, Mr. Valade said. It has promised to buy back $1 billion more in 1997.
Chrysler also had good news today on its labor relations. It said the United Automobile Workers union had ratified a three-year labor contract with Chrysler, with 73 percent of workers voting in favor.
Chrysler has also reached a labor pact with the Canadian Automobile Workers, but G.M. faces a 12-day-old strike by 26,000 of its Canadian workers. Because of ripple effects from the strike, G.M. announced today that it had laid off 1,350 workers from the second shift at a Cadillac factory here and 1,661 workers at 11 parts factories in the United States and Mexico.

HEADLINE: As Zoning Debate Rages, Giant Stores Settle In

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City is engaged in a great civics debate about whether to revise its zoning rules to encourage the development of big-box superstores like those in the suburbs. The stakes, both sides say, involve everything from the character of neighborhoods to the city's ability to set its own economic agenda.
Real life, meanwhile, has not waited. The big boxes are here. The arrival of Kmart in Manhattan is a case in point. 
 The second largest retailer in the nation after Wal-Mart and a crown prince of big-box style, Kmart waltzed into Manhattan for the first time early this month, opening the first of two giant stores. Because the stores are in commercial retail zones, they are opening without being subjected to a public hearing, let alone a review of what impact more than 280,000 square feet of new discount retail trade might have on the city's business or residential environment.
In Queens and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx, the large-format invasion is even more pronounced. Altogether, more than two million square feet of new shopping space has opened there in the 1990's or is now under construction. Home Depot and Toys 'R' Us, in particular, have used loopholes in the existing zoning law to build giant stores in areas zoned for manufacturing.
So what gives here? The answer, in a word, is the market: the business niches and the chinks and loopholes of the old law are fueling a retail invasion, even as politicians debate how to direct the city's retail destiny.
The growth in retailing has become a part of the debate itself. While opponents contend that loosening development rules will wreck neighborhoods and shatter small businesses, city officials say the growth underlines the need for revisions in the zoning code. Existing restrictions, especially in the old manufacturing zones, are being twisted and distorted, they say, with some businesses forced into legal contortions to fit loopholes while others are frozen out entirely.
"The clear signal is that the market wants to come in, and where you provide opportunities, it comes," Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, said. "But it's a very confusing climate. Right now you have a whole segment of stores that are not regulated at all, or not regulated appropriately, and some that are completely barred, and it makes no sense."
For the last two years, the Giuliani administration has pushed a rezoning proposal -- now being revised by the City Planning Commission in preparation for a vote in the next two weeks -- that would allow more retailers in the city's old manufacturing areas, large tracts of which were abandoned by industry over the last two decades. The plan would allow stores in many cases to open "as of right," meaning without special permits or community approvals.
The zoning code was last revised in 1974, when New York's economy appeared to be teetering on the edge of the abyss and manufacturers were fleeing the city. The code was changed to prohibit large stores from manufacturing zones because it was felt that those retail uses would pay higher rents that would drive out factories. But among the loopholes that have allowed stores to rush in is the fact that hardware, stationery and toy stores are allowed, even as they have grown to supersize in the modern format of a Home Depot, Staples or Toys 'R' Us.
Opponents of the rezoning proposal say that the Planning Commission and the administration have winked at the exploitation of loopholes, then used it to further their argument that the code must be changed.
"The reason a Home Depot is able to open is that the city wants the store and so it tortures itself into thinking it's a hardware store, when it's certainly more than that," said Stephen DiBrienza, a Democrat City Council member from Brooklyn. "And the reason there's a Staples is that they twist themselves into thinking it's a stationery store, when it's more than that. You can't be lax in the categorizing of stores, then say that because some exist and some don't, it's a good reason to do a massive revision under the guise of making it more uniform."
Adding to the confusion is disagreement over what the laws are about in the first place: the city may see zoning as a lever to encourage development, but some believe that it should be a brake, used to preserve and protect neighborhoods.
Preservation-minded residents around the new lower Manhattan Kmart say that neighborhoods like theirs are being forgotten as the city focuses on manufacturing zones. Kmart -- already open at 34th Street and Pennsylvania Station and opening next month on Broadway between Eighth and Ninth Streets -- chose to locate in commercial retailing zones, which do not require community review.
The store, to open in mid-November, will be housed in a building with a venerable retailing history -- from the late 1890's through the 1950's, it was home to Wanamaker's, and was one of the anchors of a 20-block shopping strip called Ladies Mile, which extended from Union Square to Herald Square. Some residents say the neighborhood is no longer suitable for giant retailing. Today, it is a mix of residences, businesses and manufacturers, but the high-density commercial zoning -- an echo of the Wanamaker's days, and thus amenable to a 140,000-square-foot Kmart -- remains.
Leaders of the local block association say they had one meeting, last month, with Kmart officials, who answered questions for about two and a half hours.
"We have been left out of the process," said Arlene S. Koenig, the president of the East Eighth-Ninth Street Block Association. City Hall has sent a signal that New York is open to these types of stores, Ms. Koenig said, setting off a kind of land rush. "It sets an atmosphere where businesses can come in regardless of the impact," she said.
Jesse Masyr, a lawyer who represents Kmart and Home Depot, said he does not believe retailers are rushing in before a City Council vote potentially changes the rules to a more level playing field for all retailers. But he said that by aggressively pushing the idea of rezoning, the Giuliani administration has sent a clear message that has not been lost on his clients. "It was a positive signal to my clients about the administration and its feeling toward large-scale retail users," he said. "If it fails, the loser is the city."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SENATE;
Four Western Senate Races Are Too Close to Call

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 11

 BODY:
The West, land of wide-open spaces, is also the land of wide-open Congressional races this fall, especially races that could help decide which party ends up in control of the Senate.
Within the 13-state region, where issues like the environment and gun control can be as important to many voters as the economy and health care, four of the seven Senate contests to be decided on Nov. 5 appear too volatile to call. 
 Poll takers and political experts say that here in Oregon, as well as in Colorado, Wyoming and Idaho, only a few points separate the candidates and that the dynamics of each race could easily change as money and resources are poured in, not just by the candidates but increasingly by outside interests like the national political parties, labor unions and environmental groups.
"There's still a lot of play in a number of Western contests, and a lot could happen over the next three weeks," said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that monitors Congressional elections.
Three races are notably volatile because the incumbents -- Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Hank Brown of Colorado and Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming -- all Republicans, are retiring.
In Idaho, the incumbent, Larry E. Craig, a freshman Republican, has run afoul of environmentalists and is struggling a bit in a state that his party usually takes for granted.
In two races, the Republican incumbents -- Ted Stevens of Alaska and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico -- face no serious opposition.
In another, the incumbent, Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, seems assured of re-election after trimming his ideological sails a bit and spending copiously to fend off a concerted Republican campaign to paint him as one of the most liberal legislators in the country.
The Republicans control the Senate, 53 to 47, with 34 seats being contested this fall. If Democrats can hold their own and pick off as few as three Republican seats -- and they think they might get some in the West -- they will regain control, providing Vice President Al Gore hangs onto his job, which carries the power to break Senate ties.
The race here in Oregon, as wide open as any in the West this fall, pits the President of the State Senate, Gordon Smith, a conservative Republican with a knack for legislative consensus, against Tom Bruggere, a mainstream Democrat who made a fortune in computer software and is making his first elective bid.
Earlier this year, Mr. Smith, who is 44 and has made millions in the food-processing business, almost won a special election to replace Senator Bob Packwood, the Republican who resigned after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Given the visibility gained in that earlier race, along with the high visibility he enjoys as Oregon's highest ranking State Senator, Mr. Smith probably has an advantage over Mr. Bruggere in name recognition.
But Mr. Bruggere, 50, can offset that somewhat through a small Democratic edge in Oregon in party registration and also, he hopes, by hitching a ride on the coattails of President Clinton, who is running very strongly here.
The contest sounds ideologically like what it is: a conservative Republican who opposes gun controls and believes in a free market economy and fiscal restraint versus a mainstream Democrat who favors abortion rights and believes government should play a large role in helping the needy and the aged.
"My opponent is your classic, extremist Democratic liberal," Mr. Smith said at a Rotarian luncheon the other day in Salem, the state capital. "He believes big government should run your life."
Mr. Bruggere, speaking the next day in East Portland at another Rotarian luncheon, countered that his opponent had a "callous concern" for Oregonians and argued that "government isn't the enemy when it isn't overbearing."
Most of Mr. Smith's support can be found in rural areas, especially along the eastern side of the Cascade Range, where Republicans have long predominated. Mr. Bruggere's strength, by contrast, lies mainly in the state's urban enclaves, especially in the northwest in Portland, the biggest population center and long a Democratic stronghold.
But ultimately, political experts say, the race could be decided by the 20 percent of the Oregon electorate that is independent, particularly those living in and around Portland.
Mr. Smith has recently been trimming his conservative sails to try to win over those voters, who tend to be moderate, generally with a strong interest in protecting Oregon's reputation as one of the nation's most environmentally sensitive states.
Mr. Bruggere, sensing an opening, has accused his opponent of being a polluter, noting that the Smith family's frozen-food company has been cited for runoff violations. And a number of national environmental groups, among them the League of Conservation Voters, have run radio and television advertisements that portray Mr. Smith as environmentally insensitive.
Mr. Smith has countered by asserting that Mr. Bruggere is a tool of radical environmental groups.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which plans to spend at least $10 million for television and radio advertisements in contests around the country, has made the race here a target, as well as those in Colorado and Wyoming.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee says it plans a similar campaign in many of the same states. But its last finance report indicated that it had only $5 million to spend, and thus far none of its advertisements have shown up here or elsewhere in the region.
Throughout the fall, most polls have rated the Smith-Bruggere race a tossup, with Mr. Smith and Mr. Bruggere alternately ahead, though seldom by more than five points.
"This race should go down to the wire," Tim Hibbitts, a leading Portland pollster, said the other day.
The Colorado race is also a tossup between a conservative Republican, Representative Wayne Allard, who represents the state's eastern quarter in Congress, and a moderate Democrat, Tom Strickland, a Denver lawyer.
Mr. Strickland has long been an active member of the state's powerful environmental movement, which has given him a base of support. But the Rocky Mountain state, with most of its residents now living in and around booming Denver, is also a pro-growth state in many ways, and Mr. Allard, who has frequently voted in Washington to ease environmental requirements, has much support in that part of the voter spectrum.
What is more, the Congressman has thoroughly embarrassed Mr. Strickland politically by uncovering a number of instances where, as a lawyer, Mr. Strickland represented clients caught up in pollution suits.
In Wyoming, normally a safe state for Republicans, the closeness of the Senate contest is a surprise.
The Democratic candidate, former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, has managed to stay within half a dozen or so points of her Republican opponent, State Senator Mike Enzi of Gillette, by portraying herself as a moderate on environmental issues, especially on land use, and by portraying Mr. Enzi as too closely allied with the religious right. She has also run an advertisement in which she toted a shotgun to underscore her opposition to gun control.
"She'd be a Republican in most states," said Larry Hubbell, a political scientist at the University of Wyoming.
In one of its most concentrated advertising campaigns against a Democrat running for the Senate, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has broadcast numerous spots showing Ms. Karpan standing next to President Clinton. She has countered with an advertisement that shows her holding a pair of hip waders to be used to make her way through "Republican mud."
In Idaho, as in Wyoming, the Republican, Senator Craig, should be an easy favorite, given that Idaho is one of the nation's most Republican states. But this being a 1996 contest in the West, his Democratic opponent, Walt Minnick, a businessman who in a previous political incarnation was an aide in the Nixon White House, has thus far managed to stay almost within striking distance by repeatedly reminding voters that Mr. Craig once supported a Federal plan to store nuclear waste out in Idaho's wilderness.
In the remaining three Senate races in the West, while neither Senator Stevens of Alaska nor Senator Domenici of New Mexico has been seriously challenged, Mr. Baucus of Montana was given a bit of a scare early in the year.
With plenty of help from Washington, again from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Mr. Baucus's opponent, Lieut. Gov. Dennis Rehberg, narrowed the race by painting the Senator as just about the most liberal legislator in Washington. But then Mr. Baucus countered, using his incumbency to raise a multimillion-dollar war chest and pointedly adopting some ideologically moderate positions, including support for a balanced budget and welfare overhaul.
The latest polls show him out front by a dozen points.

HEADLINE: A Drug and Sports Scandal Swirls Near Argentine Chief

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 14

 BODY:
When his re-election campaign was slipping last year, President Carlos Saul Menem called on his good friend, the soccer star Diego Maradona, for an endorsement.
Maradona, the international soccer star whose appeal with voters is undiminished by his repeated brushes with drug charges, gladly agreed. The two appeared together in campaign advertisements and at rallies, and Mr. Menem won the election by a large margin. 
 Today, however, Maradona is a friend whom Mr. Menem probably could do without. The world-renowned soccer player and his associates are enmeshed in a drug scandal that threatens to taint the Pink House, the presidential palace where Maradona and his friends were frequent guests.
So far, neither Mr. Menem nor anyone in his administration has been directly linked with the scandal, but his close association with those involved has prompted new questions about the integrity of the President among a populace that had grown accustomed to his socializing with international celebrities and the Buenos Aires jet set.
At the center of the scandal is Maradona's manager, Guillermo Coppola, who was arrested on drug charges last week after police uncovered more than 500 grams of cocaine in a large vase in his apartment.
Mr. Coppola, a well-known sports agent who has been linked to organized crime, is a close friend of the President's private secretary, Ramon Hernandez.
Maradona and Mr. Coppola were at the presidential palace the night of Mr. Menem's re-election victory party in May 1995, and the two were present to console the President when his son Carlitos died in a helicopter accident last year.
Judge Hernan Bernasconi, who is handling the Coppola case, said Mr. Coppola was a notorious drug trafficker, and Gregory Phillips, head of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Argentina, told local news agencies that Mr. Coppola is on the agency's list of drug traffickers.
Since his arrest last week, Mr. Coppola, who has said he is "totally innocent," has dominated local television and newspaper coverage, while Government officials have tried to play down any connection between the sports agent and the President.
Vice President Carlos Corach said there were no links between Mr. Coppola and top Government officials, and Raul Delgado, the President's spokesman, said: "There has been no discussion of the Coppola case, nor any worry. Nor should there be."
But Mr. Coppola and Mr. Hernandez were often photographed together at trendy night spots, and Mr. Menem's adult children, Zulemita and Carlitos, often sat with Mr. Coppola at his table in his popular disco.
Political analysts said that the scandal had greatly damaged Mr. Menem's image and that the President was upset, mainly because it comes at a time when his popularity is at an all-time low and he is trying to recapture political leadership by attacking corruption.
On Friday, television stations showed Maradona pushing through crowds of reporters and onlookers as he tried to visit Mr. Coppola in jail. Unable to get through the crowds, a weeping Maradona, who recently admitted that he is addicted to cocaine, gave up and went home.
Many soccer fans blame Maradona's drug habit on Mr. Coppola, who was charged with dealing cocaine to his teammates when Maradona played for Napoli in the Italian league. The charges were later dropped.
The Coppola case is not the first time that people close to Mr. Menem have been associated with the drug trade. In 1991, Amira Yoma, the President's sister-in-law and appointments secretary, was one of several Government officials indicted on drug-related money-laundering charges.
Although a judge later dismissed the charges for lack of evidence, the scandal shook the Menem Government, forcing those involved to leave their posts.
Manuel Mora y Araujo, a leading pollster, said that depending on the outcome, the scandal could further erode Mr. Menem's approval rating, which is currently at 18 percent.
"People are waiting to see if Coppola will go trial and be convicted, or if this is just a scam," Mr. Mora y Araujo said.
Juan Pablo Baylac, a Congressman from the opposition Radical Party, even went so far as to say the drug scandal had been concocted by the Government as "smoke screen" to hide Argentina's recession, unemployment, and labor unrest that Mr. Menem is struggling to resolve.
"Even if Coppola has close links to the President, we're not talking about major international drug organizations," the politican said. "You can't imagine Pablo Escobar leaving 500 grams of cocaine inside a flower base at his apartment for the police to find. It's like a bad third-rate narco movie."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
Two Approaches to Repairing Cities

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
When Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp skirmished during last week's debate, Mr. Kemp accused the Democrats of not doing enough to improve the plight of American cities. Mr. Gore said the Democrats had done plenty.
With a volley of statistics, the Vice-Presidential candidates seemed to contradict each other, leaving listeners to wonder what they were talking about. 
 At the heart of the exchange was not so much a difference in numbers as it was a difference in philosophy about how to regenerate depressed urban areas.
Stated simply, Mr. Kemp advocates making tax incentives available to any business willing to move into a Federally designated depressed area. His is a free-enterprise approach that envisions little government involvement and assumes that neighborhoods will improve naturally as commerce takes root.
Mr. Gore and the Clinton Administration like tax incentives, too, but they say government should be more involved, first by tying tax breaks to the hiring of workers from the depressed area. And they say tax breaks are not enough. They want the Federal Government to provide grants to help communities near the new businesses in various ways, including job training programs to improve the labor pool.
"The approach combines the best of all present and past theories," said Andrew Cuomo, the assistant secretary for economic development at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "A business isn't going to move into Harlem just for the tax breaks. The neighborhood has to be safe and there has to be a trained work force."
In the Republican view, that approach involves too much meddling by the government, particularly in doling out grants, said John C. Weicher, who was a top aide to Mr. Kemp when he was the HUD Secretary. "I don't think the Federal Government should be running around deciding who is the best qualified person in New York or any neighborhood," Mr. Weicher said. "You leave those decisions to people with money of their own at risk."
The Clinton-Gore program was, in large part, borrowed from Mr. Kemp, who proposed in 1980 that "enterprise zones" be created in decimated urban and rural areas. The zones, which would offer tax advantages to businesses, had been tried with some success in Britain.
But the Republicans were never able to get the proposal enacted. A somewhat different proposal finally made it through Congress and was signed by President Clinton in 1993. The Democrats had changed the name to "empowerment zones" and had added grants and social programs. The legislation authorized the creation of only six urban and three rural empowerment zones, in contrast to the 300 zones that had been proposed by Mr. Kemp.
In the debate, Mr. Kemp said the Administration had "abandoned the inner cities."
"There's a socialist economy," he added. "There's no private housing. It's mostly public housing." He complained that there were only nine empowerment zones and "a few little tinkering with tax credits around the country for inner cities."
Mr. Gore defended the Administration, saying that it had created 105 "empowerment zones and enterprise communities around the country."
In fact, a Federal panel chose six cities as empowerment zones in December 1994 from among dozens of competitors. Three rural zones were also designated. To appease the losers, the Administration created 95 "enterprise communities," 65 urban and 30 rural areas that received $3 million grants and smaller packages of tax incentives.
The cities named as empowerment zones were New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Atlanta, Detroit and Philadelphia-Camden, N.J.. Each received $100 million in grants and the right to $250 million in tax incentives for businesses over 10 years.
There is little data yet available to demonstrate whether the program will work. Democrats say anecdotal evidence is positive. Republicans are skeptical.
Some of the cities, like New York, have had trouble getting started, largely because of local politics and rivalries. In New York, the program was delayed for more than a year and nearly died in a bitter dispute between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, who was involved because the grant money is passed to the states from the Federal Government. Also, some civic leaders in Harlem voiced reservations because it would bring outside businesses -- particularly businesses that might not be black-owned -- into the neighborhood.
New York's zone includes part of upper Manhattan and part of the lower Bronx. The board for the Manhattan section has received more than 180 applications, from local businesses to the Gap, the national clothing retailer. The Bronx section is still in early stages of organization.
A number of cities and states created economic zones in the past, using only tax incentives, but the results have been mixed at best, Mr. Cuomo said.
"We think we took the best lessons from enterprise zones, improved upon them and added the elements that were lacking," he said. "We learned from the shortcomings and linked the tax incentives to hiring within the zone."
A business that moves into the area and hires local residents can deduct $3,000 from its annual tax bill for each local employee. The grants would help pay for local infrastructure improvements and for security to make the areas more attractive.
The aid package also contains incentives for construction of low-income housing, a provision squarely at odds with the Kemp approach.
"The last thing some of these areas need is more low-income housing," said Mr. Weicher, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a moderately conservative research group. Further, he said, the incentive to hire employees from the zone may be impractical, because many blighted urban areas are lightly populated.

Travelers Earnings Increased 23% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Travelers Group Inc. said yesterday that earnings rose 23 percent in the third quarter as profits surged from its Smith Barney brokerage unit and property and casualty insurance businesses.
For the quarter, the company earned $591.8 million, or $1.18 a share, up from $481.4 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. All figures reflect a 3-for-2 stock split in May. 
 The results were sharply higher than Wall Street's estimates of $1.09 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. Shares of Travelers surged $1.125, to $53, on the Big Board.
The most recent quarter included a $15 million gain from the sale of investments, while the 1995 quarter included a $32.1 million gain from investment sales. Travelers' revenue in the quarter rose to $5.62 billion from $4.51 billion.
Travelers joins other finance companies benefiting from a surging stock market, low interest rates and a record year so far for corporate mergers that helped bolster investment banking profits over last year.
"It seems to be a pretty good report over all," said Ken Menke, senior equity manager for the Florida State Board of Administration, which held 1.07 million Travelers shares in June.
Travelers said earnings at Smith Barney, the second-largest retail brokerage firm in the United States, behind Merrill Lynch & Company, rose to $208.7 million, from $177.9 million a year earlier.
Travelers' total life insurance earnings rose to $159.1 million, from $126.5 million a year earlier. Property and casualty earnings from its 82 percent stake in Travelers/Aetna Property Casualty increased to $201.8 million from $106.7 million, on a rise in insurance sales.
Travelers Group formed Travelers/Aetna by merging its property and casualty insurance subsidiary with Aetna's unit that insures homes, autos and businesses. The combined insurer, based in Hartford, began trading publicly in April.
Travelers/Aetna also reported results yesterday, The company earned $247 million, or 62 cents a share. Revenue totaled $2.46 billion. The company's insurance operations excluding Aetna recorded a profit of $109.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Primerica Financial Services' profit rose to $67.7 million from $57.8 million. Consumer finance fell to $54.1 million from $65.3 million a year earlier primarily because of higher loan losses.
Travelers' chairman and chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, said, "Smith Barney demonstrated earnings strength in the quarter, despite the traditionally slower summer months for the securities industry."

Crush Is On for Yankees Tickets
Billy Crystal got World Series tickets, but as a famous Yankee fan who served as master of ceremonies for the unveiling of Mickey Mantle's monument, he had connections. A scalper named Willie managed to get eight bleacher seats. But for many others, it was no sure thing. It was, predictably, a ragged, hectic scene in the Bronx as tickets for up to four World Series games to be held in New York went on sale at 9 A.M., instantly becoming the most valuable currency in town. [Page B1.]
 
Questions in Officer's Death
An off-duty police officer who was fatally shot on a Brooklyn street Sunday night may have been conducting an unauthorized hunt for someone who mugged his friend, officials said, and two of his fellow officers were suspended for their role in the incident and the subsequent investigation. Brian Jones, 27, a four-year veteran housing officer assigned to lower Manhattan, was shot in the back of the head -- most likely by a fellow officer -- during a gun battle in East New York. Police officials said they had arrested Antoine Windley, 25, of Long Island City, Queens, in the incident. [B1.]
 
Crew Survives Freshman Year
For Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who arrived in New York City a year ago talking passionately of the need for a campaign like the civil rights movement to improve public schools, it has been a sobering year. After a freshman hazing that only New York can offer, Dr. Crew concedes that his achievements have been modest, but says that just surviving the first year has been no mean feat. [B1.]
 
The Aftermath of a Verdict
Few felt their hearts sink more than Nathaniel and Mary Gaines when Police Officer Francis X. Livoti was acquitted in the choking death of Anthony Baez. When a Bronx judge set Officer Livoti free, the Gaineses could not help asking what now lay ahead for them. Their son, Nathaniel Gaines Jr., was fatally shot in the back on a subway platform last July by a transit officer who was later charged with manslaughter. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Scrutiny for Union Dissidents
A few weeks after Cecile Clue, a subway conductor, began urging other transit workers to sign a petition to recall their union president, Damaso Seda, she was dismissed. But an arbitration board reinstated her, with full back pay, using words like preposterous to describe the charges against her. Ms. Clue is a leader of New Directions, a hard-line dissident group in the 32,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 100, and she is one of many prominent members of her faction who have had to fend off disciplinary actions. [B3.]
 
Blue Skies for Columbus Parade
The unexpected summery weather, with a high of 74 degrees in Central Park, was a gift from nature for thousands of Columbus Day Parade-goers along Fifth Avenue. [B3.]
 
A Bus James Bond Might Love
Engineers have unveiled something new for the daily traffic battles on city streets: a prototype bus that uses cold-war-era technologies developed by the Pentagon. The vehicle is made of structural materials similar to those used in Stealth bombers and may incorporate the electronic suspension that allows Army tanks to fire accurately while racing across rough terrain at 40 miles per hour. New York City is hoping to bring a test model here, although there is no formal agreement yet to do so. [B4.]
 
Kmart Ushers In a New Era
New York City is engaged in a great civics debate about whether to revise its zoning rules to encourage the development of big-box superstores like those in the suburbs. The stakes, both sides say, involve everything from the character of neighborhoods to the city's ability to set its own economic agenda. Real life, meanwhile, has not waited. The arrival of Kmart in Manhattan is a case in point. [B7.]
 
The Surprise of Times Square
Times Square and 42d Street are turning into one of the hottest entertainment and shopping zones of any downtown in the United States. But what is most remarkable about this area is that it bears no resemblance at all to the scenarios laid out by planners, civic activists and politicians for most of the last two decades. The Arts.

Candidate Offers His Vision
New Jersey needs a Senator who will work for a balanced budget while protecting Government programs that help the state the most, Representative Robert G.

Referring to his view of the role of government as "the real philosophical difference" between himself and his Republican opponent, Representative Richard A.

HEADLINE: Torricelli Accepts 'L' Word, But Also Says He's Moderate

SERIES: NEW JERSEY'S SENATE RACE -- Tomorrow: Richard A. Zimmer.

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Oct. 14

 BODY:
New Jersey needs a senator who will work for a balanced budget while protecting Government programs that help the state the most, Representative Robert G. Torricelli said today in an extensive interview that detailed the case he has been trying to make to voters in the race for the open Senate seat in New Jersey.
Attacked as "liberal to a T" by commercials for his Republican opponent, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, Mr. Torricelli agreed that he supports liberal positions on some issues, like abortion, the environment and gun control. But he called himself moderate on other issues, including immigration. He spoke in favor of continued Federal benefits for needy legal immigrants, but said he favored excluding the children of illegal immigrants from public schools. 
 Referring to his view of the role of government as "the real philosophical difference" between himself and his Republican opponent, Mr. Torricelli said that both of them favored a balanced Federal budget, but that the choice for New Jersey voters was to decide which candidate they trusted to remain fair as deficits were reduced.
"I believe in a strong government activist role, but it is a limited role," said Mr. Torricelli, who met for more than 90 minutes today with editors and reporters of The New York Times.
"In my mind, the role of the United States Government in this economy is to insure that the work force is educated and trained, that there's a modern and efficient infrastructure, that the cost of capital is kept low, and then, get out of the way."
Mr. Torricelli, a seven-term Congressman from Englewood, took aim at Mr. Zimmer for supporting many of the Federal spending reductions included in House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. "People simply need to know the price of becoming this self-proclaimed deficit hawk," Mr. Torricelli said.
Mr. Zimmer, who during three terms in Congress has attempted to blend socially moderate views with a passion for cutting taxes and spending, met with editors and reporters later in the day in New York, and an article on that interview is scheduled to appear on Wednesday.
Seeming relaxed and confident, Mr. Torricelli threw his jacket over the back of his chair and chewed on a large muffin between explanations of why he thinks his positions on issues like Medicare, education, the environment and crime will appeal more to New Jersey's middle-of-the-road voters.
Politics have become too complex for a candidate to be unequivocally liberal, moderate or conservative, he said. He said that Mr. Zimmer's portrayal of him in television advertisements as "foolishly liberal" was not swaying voters.
"It's so simplistic and so absurd," Mr. Torricelli said. "It's not working."
Staking out what he said were moderate views on immigration, Mr. Torricelli criticized the limits on food stamps and other benefits for legal immigrants that are included in the new welfare law and said he would work in the next Congress to restore those benefits.
Mr. Torricelli added that public support of illegal immigrants, on jobs, health care and education, was too much of a lure and needed to be restricted. He said the current ban on work by illegal immigrants was ignored so often it "has no meaning."
In explaining his position against benefits, including public schooling, for illegal immigrants, Mr. Torricelli said: "The point is that at some point you've got to draw the line. This can't go on. We have up to a million illegal immigrants coming to the United States every year. It's estimated in Texas and California, 25 percent of local taxes are going to educate or provide health care for illegal immigrants. It can't be maintained."
The contest between Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli has received widespread attention, not only because it is one of 14 races for open Senate seats around the country, but also because of its extensive use of negative television advertising. .
A man known for his keen political instincts, Mr. Torricelli said he had been unaware of the bruising nature of a Senate race when he decided to pursue the seat opened up by the retirement of Senator Bill Bradley.
"I'm not a person who is usually associated with being naive," he said with a grin. "But I guess I was."
He said that much of the television advertising by his opponent has been based on misleading information, but he denied that his campaign had engaged in such tactics. "There is almost no issue on which half-truths can't be distorted," Mr. Torricelli said.
Mr. Torricelli said he would refuse to criticize Mr. Zimmer on anything other than his legislative record. "I'm going to get elected to the U.S. Senate, but I'm going to keep my dignity," he said.
But minutes later, Mr. Torricelli indicated that he planned to criticize the tone of Mr. Zimmer's advertisements. "I have bet this campaign on the fact that Mr. Zimmer's outrageous personal attacks against me will rebound to my benefit," he said.
As Representatives from New Jersey, where taxes have historically been high and recently, voters have rebelled against their high levels, Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Zimmer have both voted in favor of a balanced budget amendment and cuts in capital gains taxes. Mr. Torricelli's support for such programs, however, has been more recent than Mr. Zimmer's.
Mr. Torricelli said he supported Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's reduction in the state income tax, but he said he agrees with critics of the cuts, who now assert that property taxes are going up as a result. "My concern is that the state has only engaged in an income tax shift," he said.
The Congressman also criticized the Republican Governor's proposal to equalize spending and educational standards among poor and wealthy school districts in the state.
"I think the goal is to raise the floor to insure that every child is reaching some minimally accepted standard of education," Mr. Torricelli said.
"Somehow, that has been reinterpreted to put a ceiling on the quality of education that school districts want to meet in some of our suburban areas. The common denominator is being lowered, rather than simply lifting those who are not getting the quality of education."
A legislator known for sometimes taking views contrary to his party's leadership, Mr. Torricelli also criticized some aspects of President Clinton's budget plan. He said the administration had not done enough to end subsidies that encourage the use of public land for grazing and mining. "The ability of people to rape the natural resources of the United States without paying a fair price to the taxpayers is outrageous," he said.
A member of the House Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Torricelli also took shots at a familiar target when he condemned the level of spending on the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies. "It's out of control," he said. "It's unnecessary and it is extraordinary duplication, and enormous savings that are possible."
Asked if he thought his criticism of the C.I.A. had led the agency to try to provide his opponent with information intended to hurt his campaign, Mr. Torricelli responded, "I'm not going to comment on that."
The candidate defended the role he played 10 years ago in helping the daughter of a fugitive from a Federal investigation, Harvard Jee, a South Korean businessman who had fled the country. He said he never thought to explore the whereabouts of Mr. Jee and he did not think that his decision to assume responsibility for the 15-year-old girl was anything extraordinary.
"I cannot believe that anybody thinks because this child's father had legal problems, that she shouldn't have been deserving of help," he said. "She was abandoned by her family."
Mr. Torricelli attempted to reverse the criticism that the Jee case has prompted from Mr. Zimmer, whose campaign has called for a Federal investigation into Mr. Torricelli's relationship with Mr. Jee.
He said Mr. Zimmer "has now made clear that having gotten the same call, about the same 15-year-old girl who was not attending school and had no place to live, he would not have offered his assistance," he said.
"I did," Mr. Zimmer said.

HEADLINE: For Clinton and Dole, A Nobel-Level Query

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In honor of William Vickrey, who had just three days to savor his Nobel Prize in Economics before his death (front page, Oct. 12), President Clinton and Bob Dole should be asked in the Oct. 16 debate to reply to one of Vickrey's most critical (if counter intuitive) insights: that "the insane pursuit of the holy grail of a balanced budget in the end is going to drive the economy into a depression." 
 The seven times in history when our nation's budget was "balanced" (the last under Herbert Hoover) brought on depressions. As Vickrey wrote, "If households and businesses had been held to balancing their budgets in the manner proposed for the Federal Government, there would be no mortgages, no bank loans, no corporate bonds and many fewer houses, telephones and automobiles." His deep concern was that our society has sacrificed basic needs like social welfare in the name of a principle that makes no economic sense.
The candidates for President should explain why it is acceptable for us to borrow to make our futures better but our Government refuses to borrow to insure a brighter tomorrow for us all.

HEADLINE: A Thriving Fundamentalist Congregation Feels Most Comfortable in the Mainstream

SERIES: An American Place: More Prayers Than Politics.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 14

 BODY:
"In 1976 I prayed on it and felt that God would have me start a church," said the Rev. Joel Cochran, who at the time was a 28-year-old associate pastor for a conservative Akron congregation. So he returned to his home in nearby rural, northern Stark County, a place just beginning to suburbanize, and started going door to door.
"I'd say, 'Hello, my name is Joel Cochran and I'm with a group of people interested in starting a new, independent Christian church.' And I'd get these blank stares." He got 16 adults and 5 children to the first meeting. They held Sunday services at a local public school auditorium for three years. 
 The young pastor had little children, but was gone every night, making home visits to build a following. "It was self-exploitive," he said, "but my wife was willing. We had no choice, it was sink or swim. After three years we were established. We had 200 members. We could acquire real estate."
They bought five acres of Earl Day's farm along state road 619 for $15,000 and erected a modest church of 12,000 square feet, the Chapel in Marlboro. The new sanctuary held 350. Mr. Cochran stressed Bible study weekly, he started a youth program to appeal to young suburban families moving in and worked to broaden himself, reading three newspapers daily, two newsmagazines a week and two books each month. He practiced a moderate fundamentalism, condemning abortion and homosexuality, while accepting Halloween and Rotary.
By the mid-1980's he was running two Sunday services. Still, he felt there was more to do. "We just couldn't get above 470 on Sundays," he said. "We couldn't take it up to the next notch. I thought about it and prayed about it and realized if we could just build a new sanctuary." In the next few years, the church raised $1.2 million and in 1991 dedicated a 14,000-square-foot addition, featuring a handsome, airy sanctuary with a nave of walnut and red oak pews that can hold 1,250.
Today the Chapel in Marlboro is one of Stark's fastest growing churches. Its members tend to be conservative Republicans, part of the Christian Coalition constituency. These suburbanites are fueling the expansion of Stark's biggest churches and the Chapel is not the most dramatic example. In less than a decade, Canton Christian Fellowship, an independent charismatic church sitting on a hilltop overlooking Belden Village mall, has grown from a handful of organizers to nearly 1,500 members.
At the same time, mainline denominations are fighting to hold their people here. Membership at the Church of the Savior United Methodist in downtown Canton, where President William McKinley worshiped, has been shrinking and now stands at 370.
Because the Christian Coalition has emerged as such a formidable force in the national Republican Party and because politics is the principal context the media uses when reporting on these churches, there is a tendency for outsiders to think of their pastors as political activists. That is not so in Stark County. While religious leaders have strongly held conservative values that they seek to spread, and that their members search out, these pastors also know that being too political can undermine a congregation's growth.
Abortion is a good example. Mr. Cochran, who is 47, will forcefully make his view against abortion known through his biblical teaching, but he does not carry it into the political arena. He leaves it to his members to bring politics to the church and then sets limits, because, as one of his assistant pastors said repeatedly at a recent Sunday service, "Church is a place to put your daily life behind, a time for you and the Lord."
In late September, when National Right to Life Committee members were lobbying Congress to outlaw a late-term procedure they call "partial-birth abortion," one of the Chapel's worshipers, Sarah McGuire, who belongs to a local Right to Life chapter, asked Mr. Cochran for permission to distribute leaflets at church. Mr. Cochran agreed. "We put the leaflets in our adult Sunday school classes and asked the teachers to mention they were available," he said. "We did not put them in the sanctuary, we did not hand them out -- that would have gone over the line."
A week ago, when a group called Life Chain staged an anti-abortion protest vigil nationwide, including at several sites in Stark, there was no mention of it at the Chapel. "I was aware of it," Mr. Cochran said. "But no one from the church mentioned it to me, and it's not my place to take the initiative."

Politics
Conservative Beliefs, But No Partisanship
Too much politics, Mr. Cochran knows, divides people and that is the last thing he wants members to feel on Sundays. His top two priorities are to spread Christ's word and grow his church, which now has five pastors, owns 52 acres and must raise $11,458.19 a week at the offering to meet its budget. "If I don't have to, I don't want to alienate people," he said. "If a person believes Bill Clinton is wonderful and I say he's not, I've lost the opportunity to tell him the most important message of all, that Christ loves him."
Jennifer Hubbell considered joining the Chapel. She was impressed with Mr. Cochran's intellect, she loved the youth program -- she has three children and a fourth on the way -- and enjoyed the warmth of the Sunday services. "It's a very vibrant church, you leave feeling so good about the beliefs you hold," she said. But the Hubbells did not join, in part because she felt a bit out of step with the church's conservative values, calling it "a little too fundamentalist for me." While Mrs. Hubbell, a Republican, does not personally believe in abortion, she says she favors giving women a choice. "I'm fortunate to have a husband who supports me," she said, "but I'm not poor and I understand that things can be different for someone not as lucky as I am."
Abortion is something Mr. Cochran feels he cannot be silent on, but Presidential politics is different. And so, while Mr. Cochran's members assume he supports Bob Dole, they are not sure. As Paul Eldridge, a longtime worshiper says, "Joel doesn't get into the politics a big lot. I'd guess he's voting for Dole, but I don't know it."
While there is a small Christian Coalition chapter in Stark of lay people from these churches, it meets just a few times a year and its main task is providing the Coalition's national voters' guide to churches at election time.

The Pastor
God's Word Matters, And So Does Joel's
There are many reasons more important than politics that bring so many to the Chapel in Marlboro each Sunday. They come because it is a "Bible church" that emphasizes Scriptural readings and they enjoy the way Mr. Cochran supplements these lessons with an impressive knowledge of current events that comes from reading The Wall Street Journal daily, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report.
They like that he has a fundamentalist interpretation, but does not claim to speak for God. "He has humor and humility about it," Mr. Eldridge said. "He'll give his view, then say, 'Thus spoke Joel Cochran.' "
They notice his attention to detail. Brian Pol, a businessman, and his wife, Sheila, a nurse, are the church's newest members. "Our second Sunday we visited," said Mr. Pol, "Joel says, 'Good morning Brian, good morning Ashley, good morning Sheila' -- he has 1,000 members!"
Mr. Cochran works at knowing names. "When there's a new family, I pray for them all week and as I pray I envision them," he said. "Then when I see them, the name pops back. It's a discipline. But much of the Christian life is a discipline."
Rita Burke has belonged to more rural fundamentalist churches that have a sour view of much of the secular life. She was a little uneasy one morning as she took her boys out of Sunday school class early so they could get to an Indians-Tigers game. "Joel saw us leaving and he was so sweet," she said, "he was talking to the boys about the Tigers."
They come to the Chapel because of its flourishing youth program, which attracts 200 boys and girls every Wednesday night and is so well-run, even townspeople who do not belong send their children. The Awana program, a Christian version of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, complete with uniforms, is particularly popular. Instead of merit badges, children wear small plastic crowns on their chests. They earn red plastic jewels for these crowns when they memorize Bible verses, green jewels for doing chores at home, blue jewels for attendance.
The kindergarten through second graders are Sparks (Sparks for Jesus) and each week earn bonus Sparky Bucks to be redeemed for toys at the church store. When jewels were handed out on a recent Wednesday, Andrew Conner, a new boy, said to 6-year-old Ben Mihalik, "You can get jewels for making your bed? I didn't know that."

Theology
They're Confident, But Not Overbearing
They come because it is a young, independent, self-made and prospering church and they are upwardly mobile, middle-class suburbanites, Christians like Jeff Burke, a salesman at Terry's Tire Town who plays electric guitar with the Chapel's choir. "I like being around successful people on Sundays," he said.
And they come because they have conservative values, and get confidence from Mr. Cochran that those values will prevail. These are realistic people in many respects. They know this election does not look good for the candidate whose values most of them share, Mr. Dole. After the Vice-Presidential debate the other night, Mr. Pol said, "Gore won by far," and Mr. Burke said, "Did Kemp get his butt kicked or what?"
"I don't think we're going to get it," said Mr. Burke, who supports Mr. Dole because of his stand on abortion, his tax plan and "the kind of person he is." He thinks Americans are being lulled by a good economy. "It's like the Bible says, 'Their God is their stomach.' "
But they take Christ's life to heart and are quite sure they will win in the long run. The Chapel in Marlboro is one of a half-dozen flourishing offshoots in Ohio of the Chapel in Akron, which holds five services each Sunday, attracting 10,000 members.
When Mrs. McGuire gets discouraged that the political movement to ban abortion is stalling, she shifts her effort to a local crisis pregnancy center where she works to persuade one young woman at a time to save the baby for adoption.
They see themselves helping shape a conservative era that has forced a Democratic President most of them do not trust to announce the end of big government, to retreat on homosexuals in the military and oppose gay marriages, to sign a welfare bill that will scale back entitlements and emphasize self-reliance.
On a recent Sunday, Mr. Cochran used the weekly Bible reading, Genesis 19, Lot's life in Sodom, to discuss the President's signing of the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars Federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Mr. Cochran focused on aspects that the church's young families could relate to. He said what a relief it is that they will not have to explain to their children, and their public schools will not have to teach, that homosexual and heterosexual marriages have equal standing.
In an interview later, Mr. Cochran said when dealing with such matters, he takes guidance from St. Augustine. "He said we must always love the sinner and always hate the sin."
During his 20 years as pastor, Mr. Cochran has had one man confide about having homosexual urges. They spoke about two dozen times by phone over 18 months. "I said to him, 'Feelings you may not be able to help, but behavior you can. So let's focus on behavior.' " The pastor discussed the importance of self-discipline and recommended a Christian counseling group. "I told him, 'Your feelings will change as your behavior changes.' I've been around long enough," said Mr. Cochran, "to believe over time, the feelings will change."
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 30th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 19, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Chapel in Marlboro, a fundamentalist church in Canton, Ohio, misstated the size of the membership of another church in the city. Membership and weekly attendance at the Savior United Methodist Church in downtown Canton have been shrinking, but since the early 1990's the membership has declined from 1,103 to 987 members, not 370. Average Sunday attendance has declined from 420 to 370 in the same period.

To Thine Own Self Be True

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
At 73, Bob Dole is a little long in the tooth to play Hamlet.
But there he was in New Jersey over the weekend, trying out his latest to-be-or-not-to-be soliloquy. "Should I get tougher on Clinton?" he asked the crowd. "You won't get mad at me if I get a little tougher?" 
 By yesterday, after 24 hours of further vacillation, Mr. Dole had firmly decided that he would take off the gloves in tonight's debate (though the word "firmly" must always be used with caution in proximity to either Presidential candidate). Now he must confront Bill Clinton in the most inhospitable debate forum for fisticuffs -- a town-hall meeting where he'll be surrounded by 120 "real people." And he must do so on a night less than three weeks before Election Day in a year when the debates thus far have failed to draw audiences anywhere near as large as those of '92.
How did Mr. Dole paint himself into this corner? Conventional wisdom blames the press for intimidating him into silence until now by threatening to shout "Hatchet man!" the moment he "goes negative." But raising serious questions about Clinton Administration ethics, phrased precisely and respectfully, is not the same as railing about "Democrat wars" or crying "Liberal!" or invoking Paula Jones. The obvious questions Mr. Dole might ask tonight -- whether about the rifling of F.B.I. files, potential pardons for the McDougals or an influence-seeking Indonesian campaign contributor -- have been aired daily by the press itself. If Mr. Dole had articulately raised some of them weeks ago, he wouldn't so easily fit the Clinton/Gore playbook's current description of him as "desperate."
By being so indecisive about how to act on the Clinton character issue, Mr. Dole has not only given the President a free pass, he has dramatized a big character issue of his own. Mr. Dole's habit of equivocating and reversing himself has been a damaging pattern of his candidacy from the start on a variety of fronts, not just on the matter of challenging White House ethics. He's visibly wavered so often that his leadership capabilities are as much in doubt as who hired Craig Livingstone.
During the primaries, Mr. Dole waffled about how to go after Pat Buchanan's extremist views much as he has waffled about challenging Mr. Clinton, refusing even to criticize Mr. Buchanan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric. When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his "not negotiable" call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform. Most self-destructively of all, Mr. Dole abruptly reversed his career-long stands in favor of affirmative action and against supply-side economics to prove himself, as he put it, "another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want."
This recent history helps explain why so many Americans don't regard Mr. Dole as a leader, but as a split-the-difference Beltway legislative mechanic. If he can't stand up to fellow Republicans, not to mention his Democratic opponent, how will he stand up to a Saddam Hussein? If he can't command his own campaign, how can he run the country? Even his own conservative allies now raise the Dole character issue -- as typified by last week's Charles Kraut hammer column faulting Mr. Dole for lacking the "political courage" to match his "physical courage" of 50 years ago.
Mr. Dole's character failings hardly cancel out his opponent's, but they are devastating to his hopes of presenting himself as a plausible Presidential alternative. His equivocations, reversals and avoidance of confrontations fuel the polls in which voters doubt he is tough enough to push through a 15 percent tax cut and balance the budget at the same time. Dole admirers, by contrast, point out how appealing it is to find a politician who honestly expresses his ambivalence in public rather than sticking to a phony, robotic script. That's true enough. But while Hamlets can be appealing, their chances of inheriting the White House are by definition no more likely than their ascent to the Danish throne.

HEADLINE: More Insurers Balk on Breast Reconstruction

BYLINE: By SUSAN GILBERT 

 BODY:
LAST January, on the day before Mary McKilligan was scheduled to have the second phase of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, her insurance company told her that it would not pay for the operation. Although coverage had been approved several weeks earlier, the company, United Community Health Plan in Latham, N.Y., said it was reversing its decision on the ground that the procedure was cosmetic and therefore not medically necessary.
It took eight months of phone calling and letter writing for Ms. McKilligan, her surgeon and her lawyer, they said, to convince the insurance company that the operation was essential to restoring her appearance to what it was before her cancer surgery. Ms. McKilligan, 58, a social worker in Endicott, N.Y., is scheduled to have the reconstructive procedure on Oct. 21. 
 "If she hadn't pushed, and if my staff and I hadn't pushed, this wouldn't have been covered," said Dr. Lawrence Kerr, her plastic surgeon in Binghamton, N.Y.
She is not alone, according to the surgeons who do breast reconstruction surgery. In a survey of 2,000 surgeons around the country conducted by the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in June, 84 percent said they had had as many as 10 breast cancer patients who were denied coverage for breast reconstruction in the previous year. In recent interviews, several surgeons confirmed they had run into problems with reimbursement, saying that the problem had grown worse in recent years as insurance companies had become more cost-conscious. And they say that they are seeing denials from managed care plans as well as the traditional fee-for-service health plans.
"If we asked an insurance company in 1990 for permission to do a breast reconstruction procedure, they'd say, fine," said Dr. James Hoehn, a plastic surgeon in Albany. "All that's turned around now. We're having more problems getting breast reconstruction approved."
Dr. Garry Brody, president of the society, said the situation was worse for breast reconstruction than for other kinds of reconstructive surgery. "No insurance company would deny reconstructive surgery for an ear or nose that is lost due to cancer," he said. "There's something about the breast that they resist."
"It's probably economic," he added. "There's a lot more breast cancer than ear cancer." Breast reconstruction can easily cost $10,000 or more for the initial procedure and from several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for each follow-up operation, surgeons say.
Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America, said he did not know for sure about insurance policies on breast reconstruction because the association had not surveyed itsmembers about them. But, he said, "It's my sense that in most cases there is reimbursement for breast reconstruction and that it's not viewed as a cosmetic procedure."
The list of more than 100 insurance companies identified by the survey as having denied or restricted coverage for breast reconstruction reads like a Who's Who of the insurance industry. It includes Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey, Aetna, Cigna, Travelers, Metlife and Sanus (now NYLCare, a division of the New York Life Insurance Company).
"Our policy varies from state to state, depending on the regulations," said Dr. Samuel Wartburton, chief medical officer for NYLCare Health Plans in New York. "Reconstructive surgery is usually covered, but not all the time."
Dr. Harriett Steinert, regional vice president of medical care for Cigna Healthcare of the Tristate Region, could not explain why Cigna was named a dozen times in the survey. "Cigna pays for all of the reconstructive procedures," she said. "I have to wonder, could there have been a mistake?"
One problem confronting women with breast cancer is the varying interpretation of which surgical procedures fall under the category of breast reconstruction. The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons states that reconstruction can involve several operations, depending on the patient's needs and choices.
The initial operation to form a new breast is done either by inserting a prosthesis of silicone or saline beneath the skin or by transplanting tissue and muscle from the abdomen and back. Another operation is usually performed to construct a nipple.
Breast reconstruction may also entail surgery to reduce the size of the healthy breast in order to make the breasts look symmetrical. Surgeons say that this is the only option if the reconstructed breast cannot be made large enough.
Dr. Andrew Kleinman, a plastic surgeon in New Rochelle, N.Y., said he recently had a breast cancer patient whose insurance company refused to pay for an initial reconstructive operation that was performed immediately after her mastectomy. It was not until Dr. Kleinman threatened to file a complaint with the state insurance commissioner and a state senator that the company agreed to cover the procedure. He declined to identify the managed care company involved because he was afraid that it would drop him from the plan.
The survey found that most of the problems with coverage involved secondary operations for breast reconstruction. Women were denied coverage for these procedures even if they lived in states where coverage for breast reconstruction was mandatory.
Thirteen states require insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction, but only two, Maine and Maryland, specify that this must include the various secondary procedures, including reduction of the healthy breast. In the remaining 11 states, it is up to the insurance companies to decide which kinds of surgery are reconstructive and which are not.
In New York, which has no law requiring insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction, several surgeons said that insurers used to cover the various secondary procedures. "In the past, they were not questioned," said Dr. Richard Sleeper, a plastic surgeon in New Hartford, N.Y. "Now, insurance companies consider them cosmetic."
To Mary McKilligan, her planned breast reduction operation has nothing to do with vanity. The implant that was put in after her mastectomy in February 1995 created a new breast that was much smaller than the other one. Her doctor had told her ahead of time that this would be the case and that she would need to have the healthy breast reduced in order to have a normal appearance.
"It was part of the original plan," she said. "If I had thought I wouldn't be able to have the breast reduction, I wouldn't have the implant in the first place."
In the end, she convinced her insurance company to do more than just pay for her breast reduction. Community Health Plan has just rewritten its policy to include reduction of the healthy breast as part of breast reconstruction after mastectomy.
"We were not being as sensitive as we should have been to the patients," said Dr. Jerry Salkowe, medical director for Community Health Plan's Upstate New York region. "If you're going to cover reconstruction after surgery, it should give patient the maximum benefit. Other insurance companies should do what we're doing."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Revise Its Estimate Of Layoffs

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Acknowledging a flaw in a key statistic in the debate over economic insecurity, the Labor Department said today that it would revise upward its tabulation of the number of layoffs in the mid-1990's after an academic researcher found a problem with the Government's figures.
The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated in August that 8.4 million people had left their jobs involuntarily from 1993 through 1995, 7 percent less than the 9 million people found to have been permanently laid off in the bureau's previous analysis covering 1991 through 1993. The two surveys, based on responses from 50,000 households questioned by the Census Bureau in February 1994 and February 1996, overlap for the year 1993. 
 The figures appeared to show that the strong job creation and steady economic growth of the last few years had helped ameliorate the problem of job displacement, even as the nation grappled with feelings of economic anxiety.
But Henry Farber, a labor economist at Princeton University, has found an anomaly buried in the data that raises questions about the accuracy of the figures. Mr. Farber discovered that the proportion of people who did not respond to the most recent survey was far higher, at about 9 percent, than for the previous survey, which had a nonresponse rate of about 1.8 percent.
Mr. Farber informed the B.L.S., which agreed that it had made a mistake. To make the two most recent surveys comparable, the bureau said it would adjust the layoff figures for both of them.
Thomas Nardone, a supervising economist at the bureau, said today that the new figures were still being calculated, but that the revised layoff figure for the most recent survey would be higher. Mr. Farber said that the new numbers should show that layoffs in the most recent period were equal to or even slightly higher than during the previous period.
"It does look like job losses are going up," Mr. Farber said. "The anecdotal evidence we've been getting about this is now being supported by the data."
Mr. Nardone said the bureau had considered whether it needed to adjust for nonrespondents but decided not to do so in the mistaken belief that the percentage of nonrespondents had been the same in both surveys.
"We're being very careful in checking the numbers this time," Mr. Nardone said. "We feel it's very important, since these data are used so much."
The recalculation, which Mr. Nardone said should be complete before Election Day, would seem to weaken the Clinton Administration's argument that the worst of the job losses are over. And it could give more ammunition to the President's Republican challenger, Bob Dole, who has built his campaign around the argument that an underperforming economy is shortchanging most people. Mr. Dole's economic advisers had pointed out that although the layoff figures for the last few years were down, they were still high for this point in the economic cycle, compared with previous recoveries.
The threat of losing a job continues to worry many Americans, despite a general mood of economic optimism, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted from Thursday through Sunday. Twenty-seven percent of respondents said they were very concerned that they or someone in their households might lose a job over the next two or three years. Twenty-nine percent said they were somewhat concerned, and 43 percent said they were not at all concerned.
But the poll also found that 67 percent of respondents felt very or somewhat economically secure, with 32 percent saying they were somewhat or very insecure.
The poll, of 1,438 adults nationwide, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: On Homeless, Moscow Takes Cue From West

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Moscow Sends Homeless to Faraway Hometowns" (front page, Oct. 15): Who could stifle outrage at Moscow's deportation of its homeless? But who would expect less?
Given Moscow's former nomen klatura, who snapped up homes during the city's massive privatization, and given the soaring unemployment and poverty exacerbated by International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies, the deportation of 6,000 do-nothings seems minor. 
 In defense of Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov's plan, United States policy toward illegal immigrants seems different only in scale.
If other rich nations do it, why not fence out a Russian sea of rural destitution from an (envisaged) Muscovite island of metropolitan opulence?
In fact, Moscow could raise some desperately needed foreign exchange by inviting House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. Pete Wilson of California and their French counterparts, for example, for a seminar on how to keep those pesky immigrants/homeless from snatching our jobs, public housing, public schools and Medicare.
Long live Mayor Luzhkov! Vive le roi!

HEADLINE: PLAYOFFS;
Yankees Pitchers Take Swings as Strawberry Sits

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Darryl Strawberry looked groggy and sounded concerned as he limped out of the shower yesterday, the big toe on his right foot heavily wrapped. His teammates had just completed a three-hour workout at Yankee Stadium, but Strawberry missed it because he was lying on a trainer's table.
Although the Yankees called the injury a bruise and said Strawberry would be ready to play in Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night, the player offered a bleaker prognosis. Strawberry hobbled gingerly on his right foot and is anxiously awaiting more medical tests and more X-rays to be administered today. 
 "I kind of got a feeling it may be broken," he said. "That's what it feels like. I've had a broken toe before. It's not going to stop me from playing. I'll tape it up."
So Strawberry's terrible toe was the big news as the American League champion Yankees returned to baseball after one day of celebration and relaxation.
It was a strange scene: Kenny Rogers, Andy Pettitte and Ramiro Mendoza all poked more homers than the idle Strawberry as the pitchers took batting practice -- swinging practice, really -- to ready themselves for the World Series to be played in either Atlanta or St. Louis. No designated hitter will be used in the National League city, so Manager Joe Torre will have rusty pitchers flailing bats and either Cecil Fielder or Tino Martinez in the dugout.
Torre added to the intrigue yesterday by claiming that he prefers a four-man rotation and then suggesting that Rogers could be replaced by Brian Boehringer or Mendoza as the Game 4 starter if Rogers's inflamed left shoulder hampers him. Huh? As disappointing as Rogers has been in the post-season, with a 10.80 earned run average in two starts, going with one of the rookies in the World Series would be a risky move that could open Torre up to a torrent of criticism.
"It was a disappointment because I just don't think he's right," Torre said of Rogers's three-inning outing in Game 4 of the A.L.C.S. against Baltimore. "He looked out of whack physically. He's having trouble getting his arm up to where his release point should be. I was more concerned watching him the other day."
Torre expressed more optimism about Strawberry, who solidified his status as the left fielder with three homers in the last two games of the A.L.C.S.. But Strawberry fouled a 3-2 pitch off his right toe in the sixth inning of Game 5, felt pain immediately and said, "I knew something wasn't right." The Yankees will monitor's Strawberry toe and watch the calendar to see whether he will be on the roster and whether he will start over Tim Raines.
"If he can't play and he's not healthy, he won't be on the roster," Torre said. "I don't see that happening. I have played with a broken thumb. The whole thing is being able to function. As long as he can do what he can do, he'll be out there."
Surprisingly, Strawberry, who would be appearing in his first World Series since 1986, when he played for the Mets' championship team, was not depressed.
"If it gets better, that's great," Strawberry said of his toe. "If it doesn't and I don't play, then that's fine, too. We've got enough players to pick up the pace. I've got to be positive and see if I can help the team."
Despite his honesty and humility, Strawberry was not tossing in the socks on his season.
"Even with a broken toe, things can work out," he said. "You can tape it up. You can do things. I'm able to do things. With just a little bit of pain, I'm able to swing."
So can the Braves and the Cardinals, but Torre declined to set his rotation for the World Series. Since Torre spoke of the Cardinals as being more of a right-handed-hitting team and the Braves as being more of a left-handed-hitting club, the manager may have been hinting that he will start David Cone in Game 1 against St. Louis, but Andy Pettitte against Atlanta. The 24-year-old Pettitte, who is younger and more economical with his pitches, is the more viable candidate to pitch three times in the Series. But Torre supposedly favors a four-man rotation.
Rogers said he has no physical problems, feels fine and "just struggled" in his two post-season starts in allowing 6 earned runs and 10 hits. As long as he is healthy, Torre said, Rogers will be on the roster as a starter or reliever. If his toe does not stop him, Strawberry will be there, too.
"Heck, yeah, I want to start a game," Rogers said. "I'm capable of more than I'm doing. The last thing I want to do is hurt the team. I contributed to this, whether people want to believe that or not. I know I got one good one left in me."

One team official said the Yankees told their scouting and player development staff members that the team would not pay for them to attend any World Series games in New York or on the road. They can purchase their own tickets if they wish, but the Yankees will not provide room and board. Most teams that reach the Series treat their employees to the games, but the Yankee owner GEORGE STEINBRENNER instituted the policy to save money. . . . Manager JOE TORRE said he received congratulatory messages on his answering machines from friends who cried as they were speaking. YOGI BERRA phoned Torre and SANDY KOUFAX sent a telegram. . . . MARIANO DUNCAN was given permission to miss the workout because of a family commitment.

HEADLINE: In One Poor African Nation, Democracy Thrives

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BAMAKO, Mali, Oct. 13

 BODY:
At every dusty intersection in this sweltering city of red clay streets and smoke-belching motor scooters, beggars with clouded eyes blinded by water-borne parasites or with limbs gruesomely twisted by polio cluster around stopped cars, pleading for a small donation for food.
In the traffic nearby, vendors hawk a score of the newspapers that have blossomed here like mushrooms in a spring rain. But given the prevailing poverty, most of the reading is done by the knots of people who gather around the sidewalk stands to scan the headlines, saving their precious coins for more vital purchases. 
 In the space of four years, Mali has become one of this continent's most vibrant democracies. But as everyday scenes like this one in the run-down capital illustrate, the dramatic political transformation has only slowly begun to change the harsh facts of life for a country that is among Africa's poorest.
Countries all around it have begun to reverse the tide of democratic change that swept much of West and Central Africa at the turn of the decade. Elected governments have been overthrown and elections have been rigged, with the change of course justified by theories that democracy can only flourish when a country develops a middle class and sustains economic growth.
But like only a handful of other African states, Mali, with only modest natural resources, has resolutely clung to its democratic system. Despite the country's hardships, its leaders and people alike now describe democracy as one of their principal assets.
Malians of all stripes spoke proudly of their achievement when Secretary of State Warren Christopher made his first trip through sub-Saharan Africa last week after nearly four years in the job, explaining his choice of Mali as his first stop by calling the country "a democracy that listens to its people."
Largely because of its democracy, Mali is now host to the largest Peace Corps contingent in Africa and ranks in the top tier of the United States' aid recipients on the continent. Similarly, the Netherlands and Canada have chosen Mali as a favorite place to commit their aid. Foreign assistance accounts for about 20 percent of Mali's national budget.
More important, Malians say, their democracy has allowed them to make consensual decisions on the use of scarce resources, helped them limit corruption and favored stability in a region known for its coups.
"Democracy has given us social dialogue as a method of government," said President Alpha Oumar Konare, in an interview in his office on a hilltop overlooking Bamako, the capital. "The more people participate, the more importance they attach to the work of building our nation. With participation and transparency we have managed to limit the ethnic tensions that tear at so many African countries and avoid the waste that has ruined so many others."
Mr. Konare was elected in a multi-party election in 1992, a year after a popular uprising and a military coup that ousted a 23-year dictatorship.
To help prevent Mali's democracy from remaining a mere abstraction to a population that is overwhelmingly rural and uneducated, Mr. Konare's Government has introduced several innovations to the region. It has encouraged the spread of independent radio stations whose broadcasts reach the countryside and started an ambitious program of administrative decentralization.
Perhaps the most dramatic measure, however, was the creation last year of a sort of annual national open forum. During the event, which lasts for several days in December and is broadcast live on national radio, the Prime Minister and members of Government publicly answer the questions of citizens who come or write from all over the country.
"This may have all started to please the outside world," said Tore Rose, the resident representative of the United Nations Development Program, "but the important thing is that people have come to believe in their right to criticize and question their leaders, and that is a very powerful agent for change."
The basic realities of Mali could hardly be starker.
Two-thirds of this vast country consists either of desert or unusable wastelands, and most of the Mali's 10 million people eke out a living as farmers or herders on the banks of the Niger River, which cuts a broad swath through the capital on its arching path to the northeast. The per capita income is about $250.
Eighty percent of the country's women are illiterate, as are 70 percent of the men. And by almost any other common measurement, from life expectancy to infant mortality, Mali sits at or near the bottom of the list for Africa. Education and population control have become top priorities for the Government.
Nevertheless, foreign aid officials say that making careful choices now can make the difference between perpetual misery and slow but meaningful progress for Mali. They say that the transition to democracy was an important part of the process.
"You look at Mali, with an annual economic growth rate of about 5 percent and a population growth rate of about 3 percent, and if you project that into the future, it will take this country about 50 years to attain the standard of living that the Ivory Coast enjoys today, and 100 years to reach the level of present-day Thailand," said one senior Western aid official here.
"But if a country like Mali can raise its growth rate to seven percent and get its population growth down to 2.7 percent a year, in only 35 years they can reach the level of prosperity of a Thailand. Democracy is helping them get there, and that puts some light at the end of the tunnel."
Already, foreign experts say, the dramatic opening of the economy has begun to transform Mali's prospects. The privatization of state mining companies and changes in the investment code have encouraged major gold producers from the United States, Australia, South Africa and Ghana to prospect in rich fields in the west and south of the country, and production is rapidly rising.
Although Mali has long been touted as a natural granary for West Africa, because of the huge inland delta created by the Niger River, little of its potential has been exploited. Recently, both Malian and foreign investors have begun sinking money into projects aimed at increasing the amount of land under rice cultivation, with a goal not only of meeting the country's own needs, but also of becoming a regional exporter.
Similarly, French investors have recently begun exporting large amounts of green beans, grown mostly on small farms, to supply their country's gourmet market. Cotton and livestock production, meanwhile, have benefited greatly from a 1994 devaluation of the region's French-backed currency and from two successive years of good rains.
If Mali is to achieve the more ambitious growth targets, diplomats and aid experts say, it will take not only good policies, but a dose of continued good luck with imponderables like this arid region's fickle rains.
For the time being, many Malians say, even though they remain poor, they are proud of the chance democracy gives them to participate in a commonly determined future.
"As for me, I am very happy with the change," said Adama Sangare an 18-year-old patent medicine vendor in an open-air market. "No country can develop with only one person's thought and without a real discussion. Since Malians began discussing things, we have grown confident that we can find a way forward."

HEADLINE: In the Bronx, Welcoming the World Series as a Reflection on Home

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
The game of baseball is a muddle and a mystery to Karmelia Wilmot, who immigrated to America from Jamaica two years ago. The rules for stealing bases, the strategies that prompt a batter to bunt -- none of it makes sense to her, despite her repeated efforts to watch the sport on television.
But she likes the Yankees, and she is no less than ecstatic that part of the World Series will be played in Yankee Stadium. It means that television sets all around the country will be tuned in to the sliver of the Bronx that she calls home, and it makes her feel special -- like she is living at the center of something important. 
 "When my husband and I first came here and we told people back home that we were living in the Bronx, they said, 'Oh, that's the ghetto'," Ms. Wilmot, a 25-year-old college student, said as she stood with her dog atop a tiny bluff -- a bump, really -- overlooking the ramparts of the stadium and a section of blue seats in the upper deck.
"But when I told them that I could see into Yankee Stadium every time I walked my dog, they realized that it wasn't," she said.
On game days, fancy cars inch along the suddenly crowded streets; people wearing expensive sweaters and designer sunglasses wait at the corners for the stoplights to change.
"It makes me proud that they come here," Ms. Wilmot said. "There are even blimps up in the sky -- right over my apartment."
For Yankee fans throughout the region and elsewhere in the country, the team's journey into the World Series represents a heady cause for celebration. But for many residents of the borough in which the team plays, an area known less for the glitter of New York City than for the grime, the Yankees' triumph seems to represent something more complex and meaningful.
It is a vindication that good things happen in a place so often associated with the bad. It is even, for some people, revenge. George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, is considering abandoning the stadium, saying that its location discourages attendance. Others have also suggested the team would prosper better elsewhere.
And yet the Bronx Bombers have made to the World Series, and in recent days, people have ignored the neighborhood's reputation and have camped in the streets overnight just to lay claim to a remote piece of real estate in the bleachers.
"Everybody else has to come to us for a change," said Dudley Ballentine, 62, a mason who lives in a poor part of the Fordham section where no building is unsullied by graffiti and the brick row houses wear elaborate iron gates over doors and windows.
Mr. Ballentine donned a Yankees cap even though he was several miles from the stadium and simply going about his morning shopping. A friend happened by; he, too, sported a Yankees cap. A man standing half a block away ran to his van to snatch his own, then adjusted it with great care on his head. Several children passing by on bicycles shouted, "The Yankees are the best!"
Although they all lived in a neighborhood suffused with precisely the elements -- drugs, poverty, danger -- that Mr. Steinbrenner has cited in his complaints about the Bronx, few people expressed strong hostility toward him or the team. They seemed too wrapped up in feelings of pride over the Yankees' victories to ponder anything else.
Black and white, employed and unemployed, English-speaking and Spanish-speaking, residents of the Bronx said they felt, in ways they could not quite define, that the Yankees' accomplishments reflected well on them.
Their smiles and happy voices suggested that professional sport, for all its greed and terrible manners, still serves a touching and inspirational function for many people, taking them outside of themselves and encouraging them to revel vicariously in the triumphs of virtual strangers.
"I just feel like we're all getting a recognition that's overdue," said Anne Marie Siligato, 32, who was standing outside Concourse Plaza, within view of the stadium. Years ago, it was a fancy hotel used by many Yankee players. Now, it is a senior citizens center.
The Bronx has lost so much over the years, Ms. Siligato said, that keeping the Yankees is a special symbol to her that the borough still has great vitality. "We need this," she said. "It shows all of those people who are afraid to come here that's it not so bad."
Ms. Siligato said that she finds herself thinking optimistically about the Yankees' winning streak, which comes after a lengthy drought, as a metaphor for the Bronx and the way that its fortunes, too, could change with perseverance.
Olivia Guzman, 23, a waitress at a Puerto Rican restaurant a few blocks from the stadium, expressed the same sentiment, though on a more personal note. "It gives you motivation that hard work and hope pay off, if you just keep moving forward," Ms. Guzman said as she swept crumbs off the chipped red tiles on the floor of the restaurant.
She said there was another reason that having Yankee Stadium in the Bronx made her proud: It is an arena in which the sorts of diverse, disconnected people who sometimes live tensely together in New York City put their differences aside.
"In spite of all the stuff that's happening in politics, where everyone is beginning to look at everybody else in a strange way, we're all one, just cheering and having a great time."

Bond Prices Turn Mixed After Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday, as traders consolidated their gains after the recent rally and the market awaited today's data on consumer prices.
The market's next move is expected to be pegged to the Consumer Price Index, with analysts predicting a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent. If the figure comes in higher than expected, investors may again feel that inflation could accelerate and force interest rates higher. A figure below predictions could bring a rally, analysts said. 
 Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said the bond market had settled into a trading range based on the premise that economic growth had slowed and inflation was steady in the last quarter.
"The market is prepared for a three-tenths of 1 percent rise in the September C.P.I., both in the overall and core number, which would keep people guessing about what Federal Open Market Committee will do at its next meeting on Nov. 13," he said.
Mr. Hoffman said that a smaller rise would be welcomed by the market and the Fed, while a bigger jump could prompt the Fed to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates.
In yesterday's trading, the 30-year bond rose 1/32 , to a price of 9829/32 to yield 6.84 percent, unchanged from Friday. There was no trading Monday, the Columbus Day holiday.
Economic data yesterday had minimal impact on the market, with the September Atlanta Fed index painting a mixed picture, while the weekly Mitsubishi index of retail sales showed a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent for the week ended Oct. 12.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, estimated that today's price index would show a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, with the core rate up three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with August's gains of a tenth of 1 percent for both.
"While the immediate outlook for the Treasury market has clearly improved versus, say, a month ago," Mr. Delaney said, "the magnitude of any further price gains in the next week or two would appear to be severely limited."
Elsewhere in the government securities market, bids for yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills were weaker than expected and rates turned higher.
The rate for the three-month bill rose to 5.01 percent, from 4.96 percent a week ago, while the six-month issue increased to 5.11 percent from 5.07 percent. Traders said that the noncompetitive bids were average for the three-month bill, while weaker for the six-month. Tomorrow, the Treasury plans to announce the size of auctions for two- and five-year notes next week; rising supply will again affect pricing.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Japan Seeking Way to Evolve 2-Party System

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Political candidates are doggedly bowing and pleading for votes across Japan in anticipation of elections on Sunday, as Japan engages in a national experiment aimed at producing a more responsive political system.
The election is a landmark because it is the first using new electoral districts and methods of voting, conceived so as to lead Japan in the direction of an adversarial two-party system. 
 "This election will trigger drastic, far-reaching change in Japanese politics," said Takao Toshikawa, publisher of Tokyo Inside Line, a political newsletter. "But it will take time."
Many experts say that any change will be a very gradual process that will take several elections. Even then, some doubt that Japan will end up with anything looking much like a Western two-party system.
They say that in a consensus society, where issues are not much debated, where legislators want to be in the ruling party to dispense pork-barrel projects, a single party is likely to dominate for the indefinite future.
Issues are playing only a minor role in this campaign. The problem is not so much that there are no issues as that the major parties are on the same side of them.
There has been little discussion of foreign policy or trade or relations with the United States, and the focus instead has been on how to streamline and weaken the nation's bureaucracy. Each party insists that it is the only one that is really serious about eviscerating the powerful Government ministries.
The public mood is far more cynical and apathetic today than in the last general election campaign, in 1993, when there was a giddy enthusiasm that Japan was on the verge of a political revolution not unlike the one in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
For decades, Japan had been virtually a one-party state, for the Liberal Democratic Party had been about as certain to win elections as the Communists were in the old Soviet Union. And critics said the parallels did not stop there, in terms of the ruling party's corruption, authoritarianism and arrogance. But then in the 1993 elections the Liberal Democrats were ousted, and there were feverish expectations of a revolution that would transform Japan.
That revolution fizzled after its flag-bearer, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, resigned after just eight months in office, and by mid-1994 the Liberal Democrats had clawed their way back to power as part of a three-party coalition. Early this year, a weary and unpopular Socialist Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, handed power to Ryutaro Hashimoto, putting the Liberal Democrats back in the top post as head of the governing coalition.
Now Mr. Hashimoto is campaigning with a vengeance, hoping for a victory that will erase the humiliation of 1993 and restore the Liberal Democrats to their traditional role as titans of the Japanese political scene.
Mr. Hashimoto called the election for this month -- he had until next summer to hold it -- in part because he is riding high in the polls. By almost all estimates, his party will win the largest number of seats in the next Parliament, maybe even an absolute majority.
"We are aiming to win a majority of seats," Mr. Hashimoto said at a news conference on Monday. "But I don't exclude an alliance with individuals and parties who share our views on reform of the bureaucracy, reform of the economy and other important issues."
Most people expected Mr. Hashimoto to still fall short of a majority, forcing him to cobble together a coalition government. But some recent polls suggest that the Liberal Democrats may eke out an absolute majority, which would be a stunning achievement that would have seemed impossible in the party's dark days of 1993.
Such a victory for the Liberal Democrats, especially at time when the opposition seems fractured into many groups, might also mark a step backward, at least temporarily, to the old days when Japan seemed a one-party state.
"If the Liberal Democrats win a majority, it's like a turning-back of the clock," said Shigenori Okazaki, who follows Japanese politics for SBC Warburg, a securities firm in Tokyo. "It would be back to the old days, and we wouldn't be able to expect much in terms of Government reform."
Under the new electoral system, passed during the brief period when the Liberal Democrats were out of power and nursing their wounds, 300 members of Parliament will be elected from single-member districts around Japan. Another 200 will be selected by proportional representation, on the basis of a second ballot that the voter will cast for a party rather than a person.
This contrasts with the old system, where there were large districts that could each elect three to five members of Parliament. A small party used to be able to elect one of the members with just a small minority of the vote; now it needs to get more votes than any other party in the district.
The new electoral system is supposed to encourage small parties to merge so as to form larger parties that have a real chance of taking power, instead of remaining perpetually in opposition. For now, though, Japan is still a good distance from a two-party system.
The main opposition party, the New Frontier Party, includes many of the onetime revolutionaries of 1993, but their public support has eroded sharply because of a series of political missteps this year and because of their close ties to a Buddhist group that the Liberal Democrats hint is a dangerous religious cult.
A new party, the Democratic Party, emphasizes many of the same demands for far-reaching change but projects a fresher image.
Then there are the Social Democrats, who changed their name from the Socialists this year. They were once the reliable opposition party of Japan but are now expected to lose about half their seats in this election. The Social Democrats had to abandon virtually every position they ever held in order to gain the Prime Minister's job two years ago, so they are widely criticized as wishy-washy opportunists.
"The main debating point in this election is whether we can change the way politics operate in the broadest sense," Naoto Kan, a leader of the Democratic Party, said in an interview.
He emphasized that there is a growing public sentiment that the way to revive Japan as a whole is to cut the bureaucrats down to size and put politicians in charge of them.
Mr. Kan is perhaps the most popular politician in Japan today because he took on the bureaucrats in the Health Ministry, which he heads, and ultimately defeated them. Largely because of Mr. Kan's backing, the Democratic Party has emerged as a credible force and a wild card in the election.
Yet voters seem skeptical that anything will ever change. And some experts think this is not cynicism so much as realism.
"For all the hype and fanfare, this election is quite insignificant, especially when you think of the high hopes that politicians are building up with voters, saying they are going to break down the bureaucracy that is choking the country," Christopher Redl, a political analyst at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo, said. "That is not going to happen."
Mr. Redl and some other analysts, Japanese and foreign, say the fundamental problem is that in Japan, politicians do not matter much. Key decisions are made by career bureaucrats, and it has rarely made much difference who has become Prime Minister.
"Japan's Parliament is simply a rubber stamp organ for the bureaucracy," said Mr. Redl, who left the United States to work as an aide in Parliament.
"Japanese politicians are not lawmakers," he said. "Japanese bureaucrats, Japanese civil servants, are legislators, and they have been for the entire postwar history."
One issue where there is disagreement among the parties concerns a national sales tax that is scheduled to rise from 3 percent to 5 percent next April. The New Frontier Party criticizes the increase, while the Liberal Democrats say it is necessary -- and darkly hint that the New Frontier might try to raise the tax even higher.
In the past, the United States has sometimes felt a strong stake in Japanese elections.
This year, though, the United States does not seem to have a major stake in who wins the election, and trade or security relations with Washington are not an important theme in the campaign.

Voters in Japan will go to the polls on Sunday in the first elections under a landmark new electoral system, in which each district sends one representative to Parliament, instead of several as in the past, reducing the power of smaller parties. These are the main parties.
 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
Leader: Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
Seats in Parliament: 211 seats in what is currently a 513-member lower house of Parliament. (The lower house is the key body, and it will have 500 seats after the election).
 The Liberal Democratic Party is the dominant party in Japan, having ruled the country for most of its postwar history. The Liberal Democrats, contrary to their name, are conservative.
 
THE NEW FRONTIER PARTY
 Leader: Ichiro Ozawa
 Seats in Parliament: 160
 The New Frontier, the leading opposition party, is a coalition of forces that unseated the Liberal Democrats in 1993 and captured the public imagination with their promise of far-reaching changes. But the New Frontier's support has dwindled this year, and many voters now see it as emblematic not of change but of old-style politics.
 
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 Leaders: Yukio Hatoyama, the grandson of a Prime Minister, and Naoto Kan, the enormously popular Health Minister.
 Seats in Parliament: 52
 The Democratic Party, which was formed last month, has tried to edge the New Frontier aside to claim the mantle of the reform party. The Democrats are popular with disgruntled, apathetic voters.
 
 THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS
 Leader: Takako Doi
 Seats in Parliament: 30
 The Social Democrats changed their name from the Socialists this year and are expected to lose many seats in the election. Miss Doi, a former party leader who is one of the few prominent women in Japanese politics, has come back to lead the party during the campaign and try to save it.
 
 THE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Leader: Tetsuzo Fuwa
 Seats in Parliament:15
 The Communist Party in Japan is not at all red and only the slightest shade of pink. Indeed, the Communists have considerable support from small business owners, are campaigning against high taxes and are expected to gain seats in Parliament because of their image as just about the only party in Japan untainted by corruption and opportunism.

HEADLINE: Zimmer Says He's a Centrist Who'd Shrink Government

SERIES: NEW JERSEY'S SENATE RACE: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Differentiating himself from his Democratic opponent in the race for the open United States Senate seat from New Jersey, Representative Richard A. Zimmer says that if elected, he would emphasize cutting government spending and taxes and making government less intrusive.
In a detailed interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. Zimmer noted often that he favors limiting the cost and scope of the Federal Government. He also sought to distance himself from Republican leaders by describing himself as moderate on issues like environmental protection and abortion. 
 Mr. Zimmer, a Republican, and his opponent, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, have sought to position themselves as centrists in a state known for its middle-of-the road voters. But in separate interviews, there were clear differences in emphasis between the candidates: Mr. Torricelli advocated a more activist view of government, and Mr. Zimmer supported a more limited one.
"I am a pro-choice, pro-environment, pro-reform Christie Whitman Republican," Mr. Zimmer said, seeking to counter political attacks from Mr. Torricelli, who has characterized Mr. Zimmer as a conservative acolyte of Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, and a supporter of cuts to popular middle-class programs like Medicare, education and conserving the environment.
Mr. Zimmer said that he often agrees with Mr. Gingrich on fiscal matters like reducing spending and balancing the Federal budget, but that his views on many social issues are more moderate than those of the Republican mainstream in Congress. "I'm a New Jersey Republican," he said, reciting a list of occasions on which he had broken with Republican congressional leaders in recent years: on requiring companies to grant employees family leave, on increasing the minimum wage and on a woman's right to an abortion.
"The world looks different from New Jersey than it does from Arizona or Georgia," said Mr. Zimmer, who discussed the Senate campaign for 90 minutes late Monday afternoon at The Times. An article about a similar session with Mr. Torricelli, on Monday morning, appeared yesterday.
In addition to trying to highlight the ideological differences between himself and his Democratic opponent, Mr. Zimmer also attacked Mr. Torricelli personally. He questioned Mr. Torricelli's fitness to serve as a Senator, saying that he had voted in Congress to maintain Federal subsidies and other economic benefits to industries that had contributed to Mr. Torricelli's political campaigns, including the sugar, dairy, cotton, peanut butter and aerospace industries.
"Over and over again, Bob Torricelli has voted for this sort of corporate welfare," Mr. Zimmer said. "It showed that his loyalty was with the people who give him the campaign contributions."
Mr. Zimmer also accused Mr. Torricelli of having benefited financially from an initial stock offering by a mutual savings bank, which Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Torricelli had known about only because he was a member of Congress and was informed by a politically connected friend. "He got special preference," Mr. Zimmer said.
Mr. Torricelli, who has said he did nothing improper, has criticized Mr. Zimmer for such personal attacks. Mr. Torricelli said he had declined to challenge Mr. Zimmer on anything other than his legislative record. "I'm going to get elected to the U.S. Senate, but I'm going to keep my dignity,' he said.
Sitting at attention in a straight-back chair, Mr. Zimmer toyed occasionally with cookies on a plate in front of him, though he seldom paused to eat. His tone was earnest, and he looked intense and serious. Occasionally, he also seemed ill at ease in response to a stream of questions on everything from the overhaul of welfare to educational aid to negative campaign advertising. At one point, Mr. Zimmer was asked if he sometimes failed to connect with voters.
"That's what you seem to report, so there may be some truth to it," he responded.
The contest between Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli has attracted considerable attention nationally, because it is one of 14 races for open Senate seats and because of its extensive use of hard-edged, negative television advertising.
A recent editorial in The Star Ledger of Newark criticized the relentlessly negative nature of many of the commercials, and dismissed as "an abomination" a Zimmer commercial that simulates a newscast and refers repeatedly to a Torricelli "scandal." Each candidate has accused the other of misstating and distorting his voting record.
Mr. Zimmer, in the interview, firmly resisted the suggestion that his ads went beyond acceptable bounds. He said Mr. Torricelli was to blame for the tone of the ad campaigns, because a group supporting the Democrat had been the first to broadcast negative commercials last summer.
"TV advertising is hideously expensive," said Mr. Zimmer, noting that it was hard for people who are not well known statewide to introduce themselves to New Jersey voters. "You've got to break through the clutter."
He added, "Our ads have been, that we have put on the air, principally positive."
Mr. Zimmer defined a negative campaign commercial as one that was inaccurate, deceptive or focused on a candidate's personal life. By those standards, he said, his television ads have not been negative.
"I'm telling the truth about his record," Mr. Zimmer said. "It's important that the voters also understand the way that Bob Torricelli has performed in office."
Mr. Zimmer also contended that Mr. Torricelli's commercials, which say that Mr. Zimmer voted to reduce Medicare services, educational aid and environmental programs, were inaccurate. Mr. Torricelli has made similar claims about Mr. Zimmer's ads, and he has also derided them for being personal assaults and deceptive.
Throughout the interview, Mr. Zimmer emphasized the ideological differences between the candidates. He maintained that Mr. Torricelli was a liberal who had come only lately to appreciate the importance of reducing taxes, balancing the Federal budget and overhauling welfare.
"I've come to understand that when you raise taxes, elected legislators spend every dollar of the new revenue, and then some," Mr. Zimmer said. "And that's why I've become such a hawk on cutting spending."
Mr. Zimmer defined a liberal as "somebody who wants to spend more money, have higher levels of taxation, more bureaucracy, more intrusion in our lives."
"The liberal generally supports traditional forms of welfare and is not as aggressive in crime prevention," he said. "That's my definition of a liberal, and I think it fits Bob Torricelli pretty well."
At the core of his conservative political beliefs, Mr. Zimmer said, is the conviction that government must be made smaller, more efficient and less costly. He said he would not vote for any measure that would produce a net increase in taxes.
Mr. Zimmer said that the only Federal program that he would not consider cutting is Social Security. "The only way we are going to balance the budget is by putting the broad range of spending programs on the table," he said.
That would include spending on social programs favored by liberals, he said, as well as military and aerospace spending historically supported by conservatives. He proposed cutting the space station program, for example, as well as a number of subsidies and related benefits for the sugar, mining, cattle, dairy, cotton and peanut butter industries -- all subsidies that Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Torricelli supports because of campaign contributions that he has received from those industries.
Mr. Zimmer also contended that he himself was not subject to influence from campaign contributors, including the Republican National Committee and a national Republican Senate campaign committee. Mr. Torricelli has asserted that Mr. Zimmer had been heavily influenced in his bare-knuckle campaign tactics by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York.
"I have never been influenced by the people who contribute to my campaigns," Mr. Zimmer said.
Mr. Zimmer also disagreed with his Democratic opponent on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's plan to equalize spending and educational standards among poor and wealthy school districts in New Jersey. Mr. Torricelli said he was concerned that the proposal would in effect place a ceiling on how much some suburban districts would spend on education.
But Mr. Zimmer said that more affluent districts could vote to approve budgets that were higher than the equalized spending plans, and he said he approved of such local control. "If they can make the sale to the communities they serve, they'll have no problem," he said.
The Congressman also disputed Mr. Torricelli on the Democrat's contention that the new Federal welfare law would be too harsh on children and needed to be amended.
Mr. Zimmer said he had been troubled by the issue until he heard testimony at a Congressional hearing from a man who worked with abused children in Chicago and who described himself as a liberal Democrat. The man, whom Mr. Zimmer did not name, said that to improve the lives of children on welfare "you've just got to stop sending checks indefinitely to people, to teen-agers who have children before they're married, before they graduate high school," Mr. Zimmer said.
Mr. Zimmer also said that he supports giving states the option to decide whether to permit the children of illegal immigrants to attend schools.
"I believe that we should not prescribe to the states what they should do," he said. "Public education is principally a state responsibility."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
As Dole Weighs Tougher Image, Poll Finds He Already Has One

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Bob Dole and his advisers have agonized publicly over how hard to attack President Clinton in their second and final debate tonight, but a majority of Americans have already concluded that Mr. Dole is more combative than Mr. Clinton and is spending more time attacking than explaining what he would do as President, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll.
That finding is the latest complication for Mr. Dole, whose advisers view the 90-minute encounter in San Diego as their candidate's last hope for a dramatic breakthrough in a campaign that has been remarkably static from the start and, judging by the new poll, remains so. 
 Perhaps the most discouraging news for Mr. Dole is that voters' attitudes toward him and Mr. Clinton remain virtually unmoved since October 1995. Even after the first Presidential debate in Hartford, the Vice-Presidential debate in St. Petersburg, Fla., and tens of millions of dollars of dueling television commercials, Mr. Clinton remains ahead by 17 points.
That may be even less likely to change because voters say they are paying less attention this year than they did in 1992 -- and they find the campaign less compelling. Only 44 percent of registered voters described the 1996 contest as interesting, while 50 percent called it "dull." In early October 1992, 57 percent said that campaign was interesting, and that figure rose to 78 percent later in the month.
As Mr. Clinton holed up yesterday in Albuquerque, N.M., to prepare for the debate, Mr. Dole turned decidedly tough on the campaign trail in San Diego, "setting the tone," in the words of Scott Reed, the Dole campaign manager, for a newly aggressive posture tonight.
Shedding, at least for now, concerns about reviving his lingering "hatchet man" image, Mr. Dole recited a catalogue of every scandal that has touched the Clinton White House as he accused the President of presiding over one of the most unethical administrations in the nation's history.
The unusually public ruminations in the Dole camp over his newly negative tone is a consequence of the campaign's determination to redirect a campaign that seems stuck in an electoral groove, according to the Times/CBS poll, which questioned 1,126 registered voters nationwide.
The survey, which was conducted by telephone from Thursday through Sunday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, found that Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had maintained their double-digit lead.
Fifty-three percent of the probable electorate favor the Democrats, and 36 percent support Bob Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp. Ross Perot and his Vice-Presidential choice on the Reform Party ticket, Pat Choate, who were excluded from the debates, pulled only 5 percent from the probable electorate.
In the modern era of polling, no Presidential candidate has ever rebounded from such an overwhelming deficit as that faced by Mr. Dole this close to Election Day. Though President Harry S. Truman defeated Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 in one of the nation's most celebrated political upsets, a Gallup Poll taken in mid-October that year had given Mr. Dewey only a five-point edge.
The quandary for Mr. Dole is that the more negative he gets, the greater the chance that he could exacerbate the reputation he is trying to shake. Or he may figure that since he cannot shake the perception anyway, he may as well go all out.
Some Dole aides are concerned that the town-meeting format of tonight's face-off, featuring questions from people in the audience, may make it tougher for their candidate to pull off an attack successfully.
Although the Clinton campaign has waged a more sustained advertising drive critical of Mr. Dole, 50 percent of registered voters said it was Mr. Dole who had spent more time "attacking" Mr. Clinton, while 40 percent said he was spending more time "explaining" what he would do as President. By contrast, 68 percent said Mr. Clinton was spending more time explaining, while only 19 percent said he was spending more time attacking.
These perceptions reflect, perhaps, Mr. Dole's highly unfavorable public image. The former Kansas Senator's unfavorable rating is 41 percent; his favorable rating is 29 percent. The President's unfavorable rating is 36 percent; his favorable rating is 47 percent.
Mr. Reed, the Dole campaign manager, blamed the press for Mr. Dole's reputation as an attacker. "Bill Clinton has spent $45 million on misleading and false advertising linking Dole to Gingrich, but the media coverage has been the exact opposite," he said.
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, agreed, saying, "The media have failed to report that over 90 percent of the ads run by Clinton and the Democrats are completely negative attack ads, while at the same time letting him pretend to reject negative campaigning."
But George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said Mr. Dole was perceived as belligerent because he is. "All you ever see him doing on TV is carping, attacking, whining," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Despite all the talk of gutter-level oratory, the public perceives this campaign as far less negative than usual, at least thus far. But the findings could indicate that the public has become inured to candidates lambasting one another. Whatever the explanation, only 11 percent said this campaign was more negative than usual; in October 1992, 29 percent thought the campaign was more negative than usual.
Three weeks before Election Day, even some Dole advisers said privately that they were wondering if the contest would ever get closer. The horse-race numbers are reminiscent of Walter F. Mondale's campaign against President Ronald Reagan in 1984. A Times/CBS News Poll taken two weeks before that election found the candidates' standings almost identical to this year's nominees: Mr. Reagan had 54 percent, and Mr. Mondale drew 36 percent. Mr. Reagan won that election in a landslide, with 58.8 percent of the popular vote.
While Dole aides view tonight's debate as their best last chance, the poll found that the earlier debates had little effect on the candidates' standings. Sixty-two percent of the voters polled who viewed the first Presidential debate said they thought Mr. Clinton did the better job. But 74 percent of viewers also said it did not affect their opinion of the President, while 53 percent said it did not affect their opinion of Mr. Dole.
Similarly, 60 percent of the voters polled who watched the Vice-Presidential debate said they thought Mr. Gore had done the better job. But half the viewers said it did not affect their opinion of either contender.
One explanation for the public indifference toward the campaign is that the race has never been portrayed in the news media as close. Seventy-eight percent of those polled expect Mr. Clinton to win. Half the people who plan to back Mr. Dole said they believed that Mr. Clinton would win, and 96 percent of Mr. Clinton's backers said he would prevail. The President may be reaping the support of those who want to side with a winner.
Another reason for the low interest is that voters seem relatively content. On the economy, a classic barometer in Presidential contests, 72 percent of those polled said the national economy was good, and 58 percent said Mr. Dole would not deliver on his tax-cut package.
In an interview, Mr. Reed asked if there was "any good news" in the poll. The most hopeful finding for Mr. Dole is that he may have made some headway in selling his economic program. Forty-three percent of registered voters now prefer cutting taxes to reducing the Federal budget; last month, only 35 percent took that view. But 51 percent still put more priority on reducing the deficit.
Moreover, 50 percent said the Government could reduce the deficit and cut taxes at the same time; in August, only 41 percent said that was possible. Still, 45 percent said the Government could not accomplish both at once.
On the theme Mr. Dole is expected to emphasize tonight, Mr. Clinton's ethics, there is an unmistakable difference between the two candidates. Seventy percent of registered voters polled said Mr. Dole shared the moral values most Americans try to live by; only 55 percent said that of Mr. Clinton. Similarly, 52 percent said Mr. Dole had more integrity than most people in public life, while only 36 percent said that of Mr. Clinton.
The survey also found that the intense advertising campaigns had given no advantage to either candidate. Fifty-five percent of the registered voters polled said that in the past week they had seen some commercial on television that supported Mr. Dole, while 49 percent said they had seen one that supported Mr. Clinton. Yet, only 11 percent said that any Presidential candidate's advertising had helped them decide which one to support. A larger proportion, 26 percent, said they had seen some advertising that made them more confident that they had settled on the right candidate.
The poll also underscores how Mr. Perot has become a bit player in this campaign. Sixty-two percent of registered voters surveyed said Mr. Clinton was addressing issues that matter to them, and 55 percent said that of Mr. Dole. But only 31 percent said the same of Mr. Perot, whose emphasis on political reform and deficit reduction significantly influenced the campaign dialogue when he ran four years ago.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Sunday with 1,438 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 1,126 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age and education.
Some findings related to voting are reported in terms of an overall "probable electorate," which uses responses to questions dealing with voter registration, voting history, and the likelihood of voting in 1996 as a measure of the probability of particular respondents' voting in November.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for voters who said they watched or listened to the first Presidential debate it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Chase and Citicorp Register Solid Earnings for Third Quarter

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation and Citicorp, the nation's two largest bank holding companies, recorded solid if not spectacular third-quarter earnings results yesterday, and analysts said the industry remained on track for a third consecutive year of record profits.
"By and large, it was an O.K. quarter," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The broader trend we are seeing is a slowing of revenue performance and some leveling off in consumer credit costs. But commercial credit costs are still well under control, and that last factor is giving many banks room to cover a pattern of higher expense growth than we anticipated going into the quarter." 
 Lawrence W. Cohn, a banking analyst at Paine Webber, said that unless something "really odd" happened to the economy, "we would expect earnings to continue to grow."
"The economy is O.K., asset quality is still excellent and interest rates are cooperating," he said.
Chase, which passed Citicorp earlier this year as the country's biggest banking company following its merger with the Chemical Banking Corporation on March 31, said third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, to $858 million, or $1.80 a share, from $764 million, or $1.58 a share, during last year's third quarter.
Revenues were up nearly 4 percent, to $3.93 billion, Chase said, from $3.78 billion a year earlier. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the earnings include the combined results of Chase and Chemical as though the merger had been in effect for all periods presented.
Chase said revenues grew across its business lines despite some signs of weakness in its credit card portfolio.
Credit card payments delinquent by 90 days or more rose to $469 million from $440 million. But as a percentage of outstanding charges, delinquencies fell to 1.96 percent, from 2.04 percent.
For the nine months, Chase said it earned $1.62 billion, or $3.28 a share, after restructuring charges and merger-related expenses, down from the $2.13 billion, or $4.47 a share, it made in the first three quarters of 1995.
Chase also said that between now and 1998 it intended to buy back up to $2.5 billion of its outstanding shares. Stock buybacks tend to buoy share prices, but Chase's announcement and results left investors unmoved yesterday.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Chase shares were unchanged at $82.50 each.
Citicorp said good growth in corporate and consumer banking helped lift net income in the third quarter by 7 percent, to $935 million, or $1.85 a share, from $877 million, or $1.79 a share, a year earlier.
Citicorp said third-quarter earnings included a one-time $40 million after-tax charge related to the United States Savings Association Insurance Fund, created by Congress to recapitalize the savings and loan industry.
Excluding that charge, Citicorp said it earned $975 million during the period, up 11 percent from a year earlier.
Revenues at Citicorp totaled $5.36 billion, up 8 percent from last year's third quarter. Excluding the savings and loan charge, revenues grew by 9 percent, to $5.4 billion.
"Citicorp is the only one of this group that continues to make me smile," said Robert B. Albertson, United States bank research director at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Achieving 9 percent growth from their global franchise is an increasingly hard number for others to realize."
Profits from corporate banking, which provides loans and other services to clients, were up 34 percent during the period, to $520 million, from $389 million a year earlier.
But profits from the company's consumer banking business fell 10 percent, to $466 million, from $515 million a year ago, dragged down by the charge to help the thrifts.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Citicorp shares closed at $95, up $1.625.
Other banking companies reporting earnings included Nationsbank, the country's fifth-largest. It said net income jumped 18 percent in the quarter, to $625 million, or $2.12 a share, from $530 million, or $1.95 a share, during the third quarter of 1995.
Also, First Chicago NBD Corporation, the nation's eighth-largest banking company, said earnings were little changed at $358 million, or $1.09 a share, compared with $357 million, or $1.07 a share.

Conrail to Merge With CSX,In Biggest Rail Deal Yet
Conrail, the freight railroad that dominates the Northeast, said that it had agreed to merge with CSX, a far larger railroad that blankets the Southeast, Middle Atlantic and eastern Midwest. The $8.4 billion deal would be the biggest since the industry was deregulated in the 1980's, and it would leave most of the nation east of the Mississippi with just two big freight railroads.

HEADLINE: Born in Crisis, Conrail Defies Skeptics With Turnaround

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Since Congress created Conrail in 1973 to try to salvage something out of the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad and five other dying railroads, there have been numerous instances when it was close to being broken up and sold. Yet the railroad always managed to snatch another chance to demonstrate that it could become viable.
The rescuers were determined legislators on Capitol Hill, chief executives who refused to throw in the towel and union leaders who came through with crucial concessions. 
 Through the late 1970's and early 1980's, the Federal Government poured billions of dollars into rebuilding the carrier's tracks and equipment and providing the financial life raft that enabled the management, under the guidance of the Government, to turn the railroad around.
The turnaround was led by L. Stanley Crane, a longtime railway executive who, after finishing his career at the Southern Railway Company at age 65, took on what he later called the greatest challenge of his life in 1981. Despite widespread doubts, he believed that Conrail could be viable and profitable.
After shedding tens of thousands of miles of track, workers and outdated work rules and after gaining new freedoms under deregulation of the railroads, Conrail surprised even Mr. Crane when it began turning a profit by 1983. The profits began to mushroom in subsequent years.
Even after Mr. Crane, with the eventual cooperation of the many unions, put the carrier back on its feet, there were skeptics that it could stand by itself.
In 1985, the Reagan Administration sought to sell Conrail.
Elizabeth Dole, then the Secretary of Transportation, was convinced that the railroad needed a strong arm to lean on and picked the powerful and cash-rich Norfolk Southern railroad, with a bid of $1.2 billion, as a purchaser.
But Mr. Crane, who argued that the carrier should be sold to the public through a stock offering, dug in and ended up fighting a bitter battle with Mrs. Dole.
Mr. Crane mobilized his staff, members of Congress, shippers and even some Wall Street firms to convince the skeptics that Conrail could compete by itself and should be sold to the public.
The growing profitability of the railroad, the fact that its assets appeared worth much more than the $1.2 billion offer and strong support from labor, which feared that a takeover would lead to further job cuts, began to have an effect.
Eventually Congress agreed that the Government should sell Conrail to the public in a stock offering. In March 1987, Conrail returned to the private sector with an initial offering at $28 a share that raised more than $1.6 billion.
Those who invested were not disappointed. The stock was split 2-for-1 in 1992. Yesterday it soared $14.125, closing at $85.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Not only has Conrail survived, it has thrived, becoming a strong competitor that has been able to win back some of the traffic that it lost to the trucking industry, by shipping truck trailers on flat cars quickly and at low cost.
Its survival has been vital to the Northeast economy, which during the 1980's saw many industries leave the region.
In the process, though, the railroad has shrunk severely. In 1976 it had 96,000 employees. It has shrunk to about 23,500. The track network has decreased significantly, too.
But what is left is in good shape and efficient, analysts said. They added that Conrail was now in a position to take on the trucking industry even more aggressively.

GRAPHIC: Chart: Chart: "Heirs of Railway History"
Conrail and CSX are the modern descendants of many of the oldest and most famous names in American railroading. Here are some crucial date's in each line's history
 
CONRAIL
 
1831 -- Conrail's earliest ancestor, the Mohawk & Hudson Railroad, begins operating between Albany and Schenectady, N.Y.
 
 1846 -- The Pennsylvania Railroad begins operating between Philadelphia and Harrisburg.
 
 1853 -- Mergers of the Mohawk & Hudson and nine other lines creates the New York Central Railroad.
 
 1867 -- Cornelius Vanderbilt acquires the New York Central. Over the following years he obtains control of a number of other roads and folds them into the New York Central, building up both a vast Northeastern transportation empire and a formidable reputation as a ruthless tycoon. By 1914 the railroad's network stretches from New York to Chicago, and a far-reaching rivalry develops between the New York Central and the Pennsylvania for dominance in the Northeast, especially in passenger service between New York and Chicago.
 
 1946 -- After a century of expansion and nearly uninterrupted financial success, the Pennsylvania Railroad is the largest railroad by revenue and freight tonnage in the country. But after World War II, the line is beset by declining traffic and huge costs, and it omits a dividend for the first time in decades. The New York Central runs into comparable difficulties after the war.
 
 1957 -- The chairmen of the arch-rival Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads begin to talk about merging their ailing companies. The merger is finally consummated eleven years later, creating the Penn Central Corporation in 1968. But the companies' finances continue to deteriorate despite a near-monopoly in New York and southern New England, and the Penn Central declares bankruptcy in 1970.
 
 1976 -- The financial conditions of railroads in the Northeast reach such a chaotic state, with most major lines bankrupt, that Congress establishes two Government-sponsored corporations to take over their operations. The new Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conrail, takes over the freight operations and most track and facilities of a number of railroads, including the Penn Central, Erie Lackawanna, Reading, Lehigh Valley, Lehigh & Hudson and Central of New Jersey lines, giving it control of almost every mile of railroad in the Northeast. Intercity passenger service and ownership of some track is assumed by National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak. Conrail also inherited some commuter rail operations, which it soon sold to Amtrak or to local government authorities.
 
 1981 -- With Federal financing, Conrail spends heavily to rebuild aging facilities and severely prunes its now heavily redundant network, running up losses of more than $1.5 billion.
 
 1984 -- With the help of favorable legislation and labor concessions, Conrail turns a profit for the first time.
 
 1987 -- The government's 85-percent stake in Conrail is publicly floated in the biggest initial stock offering to date, raising $1.6 billion. The remaining 15 percent of Conrail's stock is owned by its employees.
 
 1996 -- After years of spurning merger offers, including from Norfolk Southern, its partner in an intermodal freight venture, and despite registering strong objections to other big railroad mergers like last year's Union Pacific-Southern Pacific combination, Conrail agrees to be acquired by CSX Corporation for $ TK billion.
 
CSX CORPORATION
 
1827 -- The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (the B.&O.), the first railroad in North America, is chartered to help Baltimore compete with New York and Philadelphia for export traffic from the rapidly developing Midwest, which at the time moved mostly by river or canal.
 
 1832 -- The Portsmouth & Roanoke Railroad begins operating in southern Virginia. After a number of mergers the company grows into the Seaboard Air Line in 1875, serving much of the Southeast.
 
 1836 -- The Louisa Railroad begins operating in northern Virginia. It combines with many other lines over the years to become the Chesepeake and Ohio Railroad (the C.&O.), a major railroad in the central part of the East Coast and Appalachians.
 
 1900 -- In the golden age of railroading, the B.&O. and C.&O. develop a rivalry almost as intense as that between the Pennsylvania and the New York Central. After World War II, the B.&O. becomes especially famous for the quality of its passenger service.
 
 1962 -- As passenger trains begin to be eclipsed by air travel and truckers gain ground against rail freight haulage, most major railroads face declining profits or rising losses. In the resulting wave of consolidations, the C.&O. acquires the rival B.&O. The two lines and another they acquired together are reorganized into the Chessie System in 1973.
 
 1967 -- Seaboard Air Line merges with the Atlantic Coast Line, another major Southern railroad, to form SCL.
 
 1980 -- SCL and the Chessie System merge to form CSX, which becomes one of two dominant carriers in the southeast (the other is the Norfolk Southern, formed by merger of the Norfolk & Western Railway and the Southern Railway in 19tk.)
 
 1996 -- CSX agrees to acquire Conrail, heir to the reorganized remnants of a number of Northeastern railroads, for $ TK billion.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: REGISTRATION;
20 Million 'Motor Voters' Increase Rolls

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Since a new Federal statute commonly known as the "motor voter" law went into effect last year, registration rolls have increased by nine million, a study made public today showed.
That represents 17 percent of the 54 million people who had been unregistered in states covered by the new system, according to the study, prepared for the League of Women Voters and the N.A.A.C.P. by Human Serve, a New York-based bipartisan voter registration organization. 
 For the 18 months from January 1995 to last June, some 20 million people either registered to vote for the first time, reregistered or updated their registrations using the law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.
"It shows that many more people will register if it is made simple," said Frances Pivin, Human Serve's co-director.
The law requires states to offer registration through state agencies such as driver's license offices, hence the name, motor voter.
About 8.8 million people, or 44.4 percent, registered at a department of motor vehicles, the report said. About five million, or 24 percent, of them registered through the mail. Voters also registered at other government agencies like unemployment offices, libraries or military recruiting offices.
The study used data from election boards in the District of Columbia and 43 states covered by the act.
Six states were exempt from the law because they either have Election Day registration or do not have voter registration. Vermont did not start complying with the law until August.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: CALIFORNIA;
Dole's Plan: Bet the Ranch on One Shot

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
A week ago, few people in the tight little world of big-time politics were talking much about California, despite its treasure trove of 54 electoral votes. After 27 Presidential trips to the state in less than four years, it seemed to belong to Bill Clinton, and Bob Dole was spending neither a lot of money nor a lot of time trying to take it away.
But then the weekend brought a new Field Poll showing Mr. Clinton only 10 percentage points ahead. That was followed by a decision by the Dole campaign to pour major resources, previously earmarked for swing states like New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, into a last-chance gamble on California, where the final debate of the campaign will take place in San Diego on Wednesday evening. 
 The experts could not have been more surprised if Mr. Dole had said he was running for Pope.
Most people here still consider the Republican nominee "just a terribly long shot" in California, in the words of Gerald Warren, the former editor of The San Diego Union Tribune, who worked in the Nixon White House. The man who took the poll that started the commotion, Mervin Field, said he thought the new tactics might constitute a feint of some kind, "because on our numbers, it's hard to see how Dole can make it."
In fact, the Field Poll has shown less progress for Mr. Dole than Republican strategists claim. In June, the President stood at 44 percent in a four-way race (with Ross Perot and Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate included). In July, he had 48 percent, in August 45 percent, and in the most recent poll, taken Oct. 7 to 9, he had 48. In September, after the Democratic convention, Mr. Clinton leapt to 55 percent, but that was a transient "bounce."
"The way we analyze it," Mr. Field said, "there's a hard-core Clinton vote of close to 50 points, enough to win easily in a four-way race, to which he can add some soft support from time to time. Dole has never reached 40 percent in our polls this year, and he continues to trail, 5 to 3, among women."
Steven Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer close to Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, pushed hard for a beefed-up Dole-Kemp effort here. He argued that Republican nominees have traditionally made up ground in the closing weeks, from George Deukmejian in the 1982 governor's race to George Bush in the 1988 Presidential race to Pete Wilson in the 1990 governor's race.
"Dole can do it, too," he said, "if he and Kemp spend four or five million on television and campaign hard in the great swing areas like the Central Valley and the Inland Empire running east of Los Angeles out toward Riverside. They need to be in here, one or the other, half the time these last three weeks."
The areas targeted by Mr. Merksamer were strongholds for Ronald Reagan, full of middle-class Democrats who crossed over to back him. They gave strong backing in 1992 to Ross Perot, who took nearly 21 percent of the California vote.
Like Mr. Merksamer, Mr. Wilson has pressed for a livelier Dole campaign. Last Friday, he told reporters in Southern California, "My advice to Senator Dole is to come out to California and spend time and money here because, frankly, California offers you a far more fertile ground, I suspect, than almost any other place in the country."
But a former aide said the Governor's real goal was "not the top of the ticket, because it's not going to happen for Dole, but farther down," meaning the close races in several House districts and for control of the State Assembly.
Bill Bradley, who publishes a California political newsletter, agreed.
"Dole is confronted with pretty bad choices across the country, whether Ohio, Indiana or Florida or here," Mr. Bradley said. "He won't win California, but a rip-roaring campaign in the last two weeks could save a half-dozen House seats and help the Republicans keep the Assembly, where they're in trouble."
Searching for an explanation for what seems to them an illogical decision, many in California see Speaker Newt Gingrich behind it.
A Democratic landslide in California, they reckon, could cost the Republicans a half-dozen seats or more, depriving them of control and Mr. Gingrich of the Speakership. Fear of such a debacle unless Mr. Dole worked harder, several said, lay behind his hopeful assertion on television Sunday that Mr. Dole would win here by 6 points.
There are other theories as well. Mr. Warren, for example, mentioned the Congressional argument but also suggested that California's ability to attract national publicity -- in a way Michigan and Ohio do not -- "gives Dole a chance to practice what you might call 'the politics of contagion,' whereby reporters out here see progress, even if it's limited progress, and their stories energize people in Florida and New Jersey, in Indiana, a lot of states."
Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, at first pronounced himself flabbergasted by the Dole move.
"They are charging up Hampburger Hill," he said. "If this works, I'm General Westmoreland and Dole's Vo Nguyen Giap. If it works, I'm General Custer and he's Sitting Bull."
After a night's reflection, Professor Popkin said he still gave Mr. Dole scant chance of carrying California. But he described the decision to campaign heavily here as consistent with earlier surprises, such as resigning from the Senate, embracing supply-side economics and naming Mr. Kemp as his running mate. All, he said, were "designed to ring the gong and get the tube to notice."
Mr. Dole's biggest problem in California, as in so many other big states, is Mr. Clinton's popularity, especially among women.
"The President never had the ups and downs here that he had in other parts of the country," said Bill Carrick, a senior adviser to the Clinton campaign. "He kind of fits California, on issues and in demeanor and personality, too. People see him focused on the state. Bush looked at it as a tacky place, lots of neon, in-and-out burger joints, but Clinton likes it just fine."
Since 1990, at least a quarter of the Republican women in the state have lost their partisan moorings, voting for Mr. Wilson but also for two Democratic senators, Mr. Clinton and many lower-ranking Democratic nominees.
Bob Mulholland, a top strategist at Democratic state headquarters, said that on other issues as well, Mr. Dole was a bad fit for "the most pro-choice, pro-environment, anti-tobacco, least religious, most Asian state in the union."
If Mr. Dole spends millions here, he said, "We welcome him. It's gift to the Clinton campaign, because he can't spend that money in closer states."
Kam Kuwata, one of the state's top Democratic consultants, conceded that "the President is not beloved here, certainly no Ronald Reagan."
"But the economy is moving in the right direction, and Californians give Clinton some of the credit," he said. "Clinton has a message -- moderate now, a New Democrat, whatever that means -- and Dole is running a tactical campaign, all about whether he attacks or not, where he campaigns and so on. Californians reward a candidate with a message."
Mr. Dole continues to be pictured as a loser here. The San Francisco Chronicle reported in a color-splashed front-page feature on Monday morning that residents of Leisure World, a big retirement community in conservative Orange County, found Mr. Dole uninspiring as a candidate and too old to be President.
Monday night, television stations reported that 20 California Republican leaders, headed by Mayor Lanie Wheeler of Palo Alto, had endorsed President Clinton.
"They're in the same boat we were in the '80's, running twice against Reagan," Mr. Carrick said. "You're behind in the big states, time's running out, and some desperate logic says, well, may as well try California."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Pound Remains Strong vs. Mark And Bolsters the Dollar, Too

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday, helped in part by the continued strength of the British pound and rising oil prices, currency traders said.
A rise in the pound tends to aid the dollar as investment flows out of the yen and other currencies in Europe, particularly the mark, dealers said. 
 "The start of this whole move in the dollar was the rise in sterling versus the mark," said Seth Garrett, chief dealer at CS First Boston.
The pound surged for the third consecutive session, as investors jumped in to capitalize on the rally. The pound rose as high as 2.4492 marks, its highest since Dec. 22, 1994.
"Right now, a lot of people have to buy sterling," said Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at the First Union National Bank.
"They are getting caught at these levels," Mr. Gargano added, "surprised at how fast it's moved up."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the pound advanced to $1.5870 from $1.5785 on Monday, its highest level against the dollar in a year.
The dollar also rose to 1.5407 marks, from 1.5289 marks late on Monday, its highest since May.
Against the yen, the dollar rose to its highest level since January 1994. It climbed to 112.18 yen from 111.55.
The yen was hurt by a surge in crude oil prices, coupled with increased expectations that Japan would hold domestic interest rates steady.
Japanese polls show that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is likely to lead the next coalition after the general election on Sunday, maintaining its present policy of delaying an increase in Japanese interest rates.
Also, Japan relies heavily on imported oil and is especially vulnerable to a rise in oil prices, which are denominated in dollars.
Currency traders also cited pent-up demand for dollars after the dollar spent the last several sessions in a very narrow trading range.
The dollar finally broke through stubborn technical resistance yesterday, attracting considerable interest.
Stocks and bonds in the United States ended little changed yesterday, but the recent strength of American assets continues to bolster the dollar, traders said.

The committee system as a way around rules against bribery.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH just 19 days until Nov. 5, political action committees are presumably eager to elect the best Congress that money can buy. But how can they be certain that legislators will deliver once they have taken the money? For that matter, how can politicians induce special interests to give them the wads of cash needed to get to Washington and stay there if they are barred from selling their votes?
In recent years economists -- notably those who studied or taught at the University of Chicago -- have begun to analyze "political markets" with the same bag of tricks they use to assay supply and demand for, say, lipstick or mini-vans. And one of the more striking recent contributions is from Randall Kroszner of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and Thomas Stratmann of Montana State, who explain the rise of the committee system in Congress as a way around all those inconvenient, market-inhibiting rules against bribery. 
 Clearly defined property rights and enforceable contracts are critical to successful capitalism. Once you sign on the dotted line, a vast body of law and tradition stands behind economic transactions. But paradoxically -- well, what seems paradoxical to many economists who eat, sleep and breathe their discipline -- is that the political system buttressing most successful capitalist economies works with very different rules.
Interest groups are welcome to buy what is euphemistically called access to members of Congress. But as Mr. Kroszner and Mr. Stratmann note in their paper published by the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, they cannot enforce "fee for service" contracts with elected officials: say, agreements to subsidize ethanol fuel or to protect consumers from low-cost, high-quality Mexican tomatoes that compete with Florida's finest. By the same token, elected officials cannot maximize their revenues because they cannot offer formal performance guarantees.
What to do? The Congressional committee system, the two economists argue, is a "second best" alternative that has evolved to serve buyers and sellers. Specialized standing committees offer opportunities for repeated interaction between lobbyists and legislators. This makes it practical to enforce implicit contracts: Congressmen who don't consistently further the fortunes of their benefactors can be denied campaign contributions in the next election cycle. Note, too, that committee appointments are based on seniority, giving interests the opportunity to invest in a whole Congressional career.
There is, of course, no way to prove the cause and effect here. But Mr. Kroszner and Mr. Stratmann have amassed some provocative statistical evidence from the House Banking Committee. For more than a decade this committee has been preoccupied with the turf battle between commercial banks and securities underwriters and insurance companies over the right of banks to expand into securities and insurance.
To no one's surprise, committee members get three to six times as much more money from the primary combatants -- banks and investment firms -- than other members of Congress. What may surprise, though, is that there is far less overlap in giving to committee members: where the typical Congressman will get modest sums from both bank and investment political action committees, contributions to Banking Committee members are highly specialized. What's more, the concentration of contributors as well as the amount contributed rises with committee seniority, presumably a response to their increased influence and credibility.
One straightforward implication, the authors suggest, is that legislative gridlock is no accident. "With competing interests hiring different committee members," Mr. Kroszner argues, "there is little willingness or ability to forge a consensus."
It also has implications for term limits. Limits would indeed interfere with special interests' efforts to cultivate relationships with individual legislators, making it more difficult to buy reliable influence.
But "term limits are a blunt instrument," Mr. Kroszner contends. They would make Congressmen less responsive to the wishes of constituents: elected officials who cannot be re-elected cannot be punished by the voters. Moreover, term limits prevent legislators from gaining experience, arguably making them less effective.
By contrast, Mr. Kroszner argues that limits on years served on individual committees would accomplish much of what is seen as good about term limits without the bad. It would still be harder to buy influence, and impossible to invest in a legislator for the long haul. "Congressmen would thus find it more valuable to cultivate constituents and less valuable to serve political action committees," Mr. Kroszner concludes.

Bond Prices Slip on Fear Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices ended slightly lower yesterday, hurt by concerns that the economy was not slowing enough to avoid a pickup in inflation.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32, to 98 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to d 6.85 percent from 6.84 percent. 
 Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with GovPx, a bond pricing service, said trading volume was high yesterday, with the value of the total amount of securities traded at more than $100 billion for only the second time in four months. The last time that happened, she said, was Sept. 26, a day after Federal Reserve policy makers met on interest rates.
Bond prices received a small boost after the Labor Department reported a modest increase in consumer prices. The rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index for September was within expectations, however, and only prompted a little buying.
And one economist, James Padinha, with MMS International in San Francisco, argued that the C.P.I. report suggested that the Fed should raise short-term interest rates next month.
Noting that the September figure brings the year-to-year increase in consumer prices to 3 percent, he said that "right now the 1996 inflation rate is on track to come in at 3.2 percent."
"In short, the combination of a high overall inflation rate and core rate that is not all that much kinder than the 1995 increase favors tightening more than it does a stand-pat policy," he said.
Dragging the market lower yesterday was another Labor Department report that showed weekly earnings adjusted for inflation increased by eight-tenths of 1 percent in September, compared with 1.2 percent in August, revised upward from seven-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts say while real average weekly earnings are up only 1.4 percent in the last 12 months, many remain concerned about a tight labor market, and yesterday's reported suggested that wage pressures were building.
Traders said the Government securities market also came under pressure by talk of selling by foreign central banks and some hedge funds, which took some loses as a number of European bond markets slumped. The Federal Reserve makes it a policy not to comment on central bank activity.
Still, the consumer prices and earnings reports provided little reason for the Federal Reserve to take action, said Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston.
"There was nothing in the reports would give the Fed reason to be concerned," he said.
Late short-covering by speculators betting against the market pulled up some prices by late in the day, even though there were those that were disappointed by the inability of the market to cash in on the C.P.I.
Elsewhere, the Treasury announced that it would sell $18.25 billion in two-year notes and $12.5 billion in five-year notes next week, in addition to the $26 billion in three- and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction on Monday. Traders said some selling yesterday might have been related to the anticipation of more supply, which would put downward pressure on prices. In when-isued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.94 percent and the five-year, 6.28 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slides Against Mark On Bank Official's Comments

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against the German mark yesterday after supportive comments from a German central banker encouraged investors to take profits against a recently surging British pound, currency traders said.
A member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, Hans-Jurgen Koebnick, voiced strong doubts about the ability of weaker European countries like Italy and Spain to fix serious economic problems in time to qualify for a proposed single European currency in 1999. 
 Mr. Koebnick said Italy and Spain would probably not be among the first nations to join Europe's planned currency union in 1999, but are likely to join by 2002.
He also said European Union members must eschew apparent budget gimmicks to meet the entry requirements for European economic and monetary union.
The comments bolstered the mark and hurt the Italian lira, traders said, with the mark hitting a two-week high just shy of 1000 lire.
"All these statements saying Italy and Spain may not be able to join the union until 2002 and discussions about creative accounting have caused people to run for cover and buy marks and sell lire," said Ben Strauss, trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company.
Investors shifted funds to the mark and Japanese yen, which had fallen to attractive buying levels after a strong rally by the pound against major currencies in recent sessions, traders said.
Dealers also cited intraday drops in United States stock and bond prices for the dollar's decline. Demand for American investments typically determines the relative demand for dollars.
"The dollar has come off its highs and I blame two things: today's fall in U.S. asset markets and the unwinding of sterling trades," said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.
In late trading in New York, the dollar fell to 1.5391 marks from 1.5407 marks on Tuesday. The British pound fell to $1.5830 from $1.5870.
Against the yen, the dollar retained most of Tuesday's gains to finish slightly higher at 112.27 yen. The dollar failed to match Tuesday's high of 112.39 yen, which was its highest level since January 1994.

HEADLINE: Bargain U.

BYLINE: By Harold Howe 2d; Harold Howe 2d is a former U.S. Commissioner of Education and a retired senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

DATELINE: CONCORD, Mass.

 BODY:
A recent study by the College Board found that once again the average tuition for four-year colleges in 1996-97 rose above the rate of inflation. Private colleges now cost $12,823 and public institutions, $2,966 -- just under 6 percent more than last year.
These tuition increases make news, for good reason. Many families can't afford to send their children to school or must rely on loans and scholarships. 
 But the truth is that even at these prices, higher education is still a bargain. The total bill for a student living in a dormitory and joining a meal plan is an average $18,000 at private colleges and $7,000 at public institutions. Full-time students attend colleges for about 200 days a year, so the daily costs come down to about $90 and $35. For what amounts to less than the cost of a room at a Holiday Inn, plus a couple of meals, consider what the student gets:
* A room and three meals a day.
* Free counseling services, both personal and academic.
* A luxurious student center for socializing and recreation.
* Lots of green grass for fun and sun-bathing.
* Job placement services.
* Unlimited opportunities to meet and date potential mates.
* Free advice from presidents, deans and other functionaries.
* Arts and entertainment, including varsity sports, classic films, local drama and almost any kind of music.
And, of course, students receive the serious attention of faculty members intent on improving their skills and knowledge. This pays off in the long run, as college graduates will probably earn more money and have a more interesting life than those without degrees.
Yet, as prospective students increasingly demand campus amenities as well as a good curriculum, tuition doesn't come close to covering the total cost at most institutions. That is why most also rely on public and private donations.
Certainly, the Federal Government should do as much as possible to help middle- and low-income families send their children to college. But why blame only colleges for tuition increases? Colleges are giving students what they want -- and much more than what they pay for.

HEADLINE: Consumer Inflation Rises, but With Some Quirks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Consumer inflation quickened in September but the moderate increase was dominated by seasonal quirks and reimposition of the tax on airline tickets, a Government report showed today.
Analysts remain confident that Federal Reserve policy makers will leave short-term interest rates unchanged at their meeting in mid-November while still expecting inflation to creep higher over the coming months as a tight labor market and this year's surge in oil prices make their full impact. 
 The Labor Department reported that its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month. The gain was in line with expectations of analysts and prompted little reaction in the financial markets. In August, the price index rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
The September increase means that more than 40 million beneficiaries of Social Security and other Federal programs will receive a 2.9 percent raise at the beginning of the new year, up from 2.6 percent in 1996. Benefits are raised automatically by the amount the price index increases between the third quarter of 1995 and the third quarter of 1996.
The average Social Security benefit for all retired workers will rise $21, to $745, while an aged couple who both qualify for benefits get a $36 increase, to $1,256.
After falling or staying the same for five consecutive years, consumer inflation has turned up this year to run at a 3.2 percent annual pace through the first nine months as prices for food and energy have accelerated after acting as moderating forces throughout most of the 1991-95 period.
Today's report, said Asha Bangalore, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, "is not comforting" at a time when unemployment hovers just above 5 percent and when there seems little sign that food and energy will soon be restraining influences again. The September results probably just bought the Federal Reserve a bit more time before it decides to tighten monetary policy, she added.
At the same time, another report indicated that wage pressures were increasing. The Labor Department said average weekly earnings rose by a hefty eight-tenths of 1 percent last month after an even stronger surge of 1.2 percent in August. This resulted from a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in weekly hours plus a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in hourly earnings minus the three-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices.
The head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, Joseph E. Stiglitz, told a luncheon meeting of economists that inflation was "stable" and that higher pay would not put this at risk.
"Real wages are not going up so fast to be a threat to inflation," he said.
Besides the 10 percent excise tax on airline tickets, which was reimposed Aug. 27, the September results reflect sharp increases for apparel and new cars, both quirky because of statistical problems in the seasonal introduction of new lines.
New vehicles climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase in more than five years but the department noted that its sample included a noticeably larger proportion than in recent years of the newest models, the 1997 model year.
Similarly, the index for apparel swung from a decline of 1.4 percent in August, when introduction of fall and winter clothing was slower than usual, to a five-tenths of 1 percent advance as the proportion of the higher-priced new goods returned to normal. This sharp turnaround accounted for two-thirds of the acceleration in the overall index, the department said, even though apparel accounts for just 5 percent of it.
For the third consecutive month, the price index rose the same amount whether the erratic food and energy components -- over which Federal Reserve policy has negligible influence -- are included or not.
While inflation remains at bay, the risks of acceleration remain, said Oscar Gonzalez of John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "As usual, we are looking at the past and the Fed is looking at the future," he said.
Food prices climbed five-tenths of 1 percent last month as the indexes for dairy products and for meats, poultry, fish and eggs accounted for 80 percent of the advance. Pork has jumped 13.4 percent over the last year while beef is up only 1.1 percent, the Government said. Gasoline eased four-tenths of 1 percent but energy as a whole was unchanged after three consecutive declines.
The index for used cars posted its first increase in six months, the report also showed, while the tax-spurred leap in airline fares was 2.9 percent.
For the New York metropolitan area, prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent in September -- matched by Los Angeles and Philadelphia -- but New York's 12-month increase, at 3.1 percent, was scarcely higher than the national rate of 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Canada Trims Key Interest Rate

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada lowered its key bank rate today by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.75 percent, reducing interest rates in Canada to their lowest level in almost 40 years.
The cut came on the heels of a series of weak economic statistics accompanied by a stronger Canadian dollar in the last few weeks. 
 The rate reduction quickly prompted Canada's six big chartered banks to lower their prime lending rates to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent, the lowest level since early 1959.
It was the ninth rate cut by Canada's central bank this year and the eighth independent of an easing by the United States Federal Reserve. The Bank of Canada has now eased by 4.5 percentage points since May 1995. Its previous rate cut was on Oct. 2.

Peso Hits Year's Low In Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The peso fell to its lowest level of the year today, continuing a weeklong slide strengthened by investor anxiety concerning Government economic policy after Sunday's decision to cancel a long-planned privatization of Mexico's petrochemical industry.
The Mexican currency, which has been relatively stable at about 13.3 American cents since midsummer, has fallen 3.3 percent since the beginning of last week and reached 12.7 cents today, its lowest level since December. 
 The Mexican stock market, which has also had a bad week, recovered slightly today, closing up 11.84 points, or 0.36 percent.
The peso's fall today came despite a rise of three percentage points in interest rates at the central bank's weekly auction Tuesday. The central bank has also been trying to shore up the currency this week by raising liquidity targets within the banking system, a move that makes pesos scarcer.
Some analysts had predicted the decline, saying that with inflation rates in Mexico expected to top 25 percent this year, the peso, by maintaining its value against the dollar, had in effect risen significantly. The analysts said that evidence of that was Mexico's rising level of imports. When a currency rises in value, imports become cheaper and people tend to buy more from abroad.
Several analysts predicted that the currency would drop further, perhaps reaching 12.5 American cents by the end of the year.
Alejandro Valenzuela, a Treasury Ministry spokesman, said the peso's recent slide had been expected. "The float system we're using for the peso exchange rate is working well," Mr. Valenzuela said. "It's not in a free fall. The peso is adjusting to the level the market dictates -- when it's cheap, investors buy it, and when it's expensive, they sell it. The market mechanism is working. We need to get used to this kind of period."
Others attributed the peso's slide to investor worries about which way the Government would take the Mexican economy after President Ernesto Zedillo reversed course Sunday and canceled the sale of 61 petrochemical plants, a step that the president had touted as a centerpiece of his modernization efforts and had promised to defend.
"If you're an investor, when they renege on a promise to privatize, this is a yellow flashing light, saying that the dinosaurs within the ruling party are gaining power and Mexico is not moving forward," Michael M. Churchill, an economist at Polyconomics Inc., an emerging-markets research firm, said in a telephone interview from Morristown, N.J.
"There was quite a bit of foreign investment that pulled out after this Mickey Mouse petrochemical arrangement was announced," Jaime A. Campbell, a broker at CBI Securities here, said.
Mr. Campbell said some Mexicans had begun selling their pesos for dollars after a couple of influential Mexican radio talk show hosts began warning listeners that the government would devalue the peso in December, a reminder of the peso crisis of December 1994. "People think, December's coming, there's going to be another devaluation," Mr. Campbell said.
Technically, the Government cannot devalue the peso, because its value has been allowed to float freely since a disastrous government attempt to support its value in December 1994 that failed to halt its plunge and pushed Mexico to the brink of bankruptcy. By its inaction, though, the Government can allow the peso to fall.
Throughout much of this year, the Central Bank has actively helped to keep the peso's value stable at about 13.3 American cents, occasionally by buying pesos and more frequently by ordering a rise in liquidity within the banking system, which withdraws pesos from the economy.
The Banco de Mexico soaked up 40 million pesos on Monday and Tuesday through that maneuver.
A number of analysts warned in recent weeks that the peso was becoming overvalued, and some had expressed modest concern about Mexico's trade figures. Although the country's trade surplus continues, imports have been growing faster than exports since April.
Shafiq Islam, chief emerging-markets strategist at Credit Suisse in New York, said that because Mexican exports were influenced by petroleum shipments, "rising oil prices have been masking the underlying weakening of the trade balance." For the first nine months of the year, Mexico has experienced a "nonoil trade deficit" of $2.8 billion, Mr. Islam said.

It's Hardly a Super Bowl But the Merchants Smile

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Three days after the Yankees won the American League pennant, Mitchell & Ness had shipped its entire stock of expensive, authentically styled shirts and jackets to the four New York-area Yankee Clubhouse stores.
"They ordered $60,000 in merchandise," said Peter Capolino, president of the Philadelphia maker of nostalgic baseball clothing. "That's a huge surge." 
 Yankee goods -- from a 1903-style Highlanders shirt to a 1961 jacket -- comprise half of Capolino's business, followed by the Dodgers, which make up 25 percent.
"I lit candles every night for a Yankee-Dodgers World Series," he said.
Apparel sales are always an economic barometer of success for title-winning teams, especially if they have a national following and also because T-shirts and caps are available so rapidly. The 43 local Modell's stores began selling the Yankees' American League championship goods Monday and anticipate brisk sales through Christmas -- if they win the World Series. "Dramatically less if they lose," said Peter Lindenbaum, the vice president of merchandising.
The team's 34th World Series will also spur at least two more capacity crowds at Yankee Stadium, more money in hot dog vendors' and parking lot operators' pockets, more subway fares paid and more business for local taverns and souvenir shops along and near River Avenue. "It's their Christmas season," said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer.
The excitement will undoubtedly spur continued consternation over the team's future in the Bronx, and whether the Yankees will move to Manhattan or New Jersey.
But as a magnet for major local economic activity, the World Series is not the Super Bowl.
Unlike the Super Bowl, the fall classic is a four-of-seven-game affair played in two cities, not a single event played at a single predetermined warm weather or domed site. It lacks the huge buildup that often results in a crescendo of visitor spending at local hotels and restaurants.
The New York City Comptroller's office estimates that the direct economic impact of the World Series -- from gate, concession, media, lodging and restaurant revenues -- will range from $11.4 million for two games at Yankee Stadium to $22.9 million for four games, following some $14.3 million for the playoffs.
(The figures exclude the city's overtime costs for the police and sanitation, taxes paid by the Yankees and Stadium maintenance costs.)
The Super Bowl in January at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans is expected to generate a direct economic gain of $124.7 million, according to the MetroVision Economic Development Partnership Foundation.
The World Series estimate doesn't equal the economic impact forecast for other local events, such as the Grammy Awards, the World Cup soccer tournament, the Gay Games, the New York City Marathon and the United States Open tennis championships. All those were scheduled well in advance.
But even if it's not a huge economic engine, "in terms of visibility and promotion, the World Series is great for New York," said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau.
For Major League Baseball, in its first full season since the 1994 players' strike, having the Yankees in the World Series is a dream come true.
The New York market virtually guarantees high viewership. New York is the largest market to play in the World Series since 1988, when the Dodgers, from the No. 2 television market, beat Oakland in five games and got a 23.9 rating.
In 1992 and 1993, the World Series- champion Toronto Blue Jays hailed from a market that is not rated by Nielsen. A Baltimore victory over the Yankees in the American League Championship Series would have put the No. 23 market, with 989,000 TV households, in the World Series as compared with New York's 6.7 million.
Having a team from the No. 1 market play Atlanta (No. 10) or St. Louis (No. 20) in four to seven telecasts is a boon for the Fox Network, which endured low ratings in the first season of a five-year, $575 million contract. Having the Yankees in the Series can only make it easier for Fox to sell its 30-second spots, which are priced between $250,000 and $300,000.
"The Yankees attract so much media attention, and it's attention about the team, not about baseball's problems,"said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for Fox Sports. "Of course, that's a benefit to us."
And the New York spotlight can only help baseball. The Yankees are ranked third in licensed merchandise sales, and the business expected to be done if they win the World Series will help accelerate baseball's gradual post-strike revival.
"When you talk to marketing executives, many of them are in New York, and they really feel the excitement," said Brandon Steiner, a Manhattan sports marketer. "A big market like this accelerates things and pushes baseball to the forefront."
Many key marketers from baseball's official sponsors will be among the elite to get seats in Yankee Stadium and the National League ball park.
"The Yankees are a national team, like the Dallas Cowboys," said Marla Miller, group licensing director for Major League Baseball Properties. "Last year, Cleveland was phenomenal. But the Yankees could be bigger."

Unexpectedly, Apple Halts String of Losses

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Defying Wall Street predictions of yet another money-losing period, Apple Computer Inc. reported a $25 million profit for its fiscal fourth quarter today.
The surprisingly strong financial results, which were reported after the close of the market -- and sent Apple's stock price up 7.6 percent, to $28.25 in after-hours trading -- were the best news the company's chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, has been able to report since taking the company's reins last February. 
 And yet, with revenues off sharply from last year, and profits coming mainly from drastic cost cuts, Apple's future is far from certain. The company was unwilling, for example, to predict that it would be able to report a profit for the current quarter.
Wall Street analysts, many of whom have been skeptical about prospects for the company's survival, were clearly caught off-guard by the announcement of Apple's profits. A consensus report of 23 brokerage firm analysts, as compiled by First Call, had forecast a loss of 30 cents a share, or about $37 million.
Until this quarter, fiscal 1996 had been disastrous for Apple. The computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., lost $69 million in the first quarter, more than $700 million in the second and $32 million in the third.
Even now, financial analysts said, while the company has at least temporarily stanched the financial hemorrhaging, Apple's recovery is far from complete.
"Amelio and his gang have done a good job of solving the short-term issues," Todd Bakar, a computer industry analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said. "But they still have a way to go on solving the long-term challenges."
And some analysts said the quarter's positive results were bookkeeping flourishes that were part of a carefully orchestrated Apple effort to provide good news that could be crucial for consumer confidence as it enters the big Christmas quarter.
"This was all premeditated," John T. Rossi, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, said. "They have to win hearts and minds of people for the December retail season. They can't have stories chiming impending doom."
Apple's executives said that while revenues were down almost $700 million from last year's fourth quarter, they were slightly higher than in the third quarter, which ended on June 30. The executives pointed to continued vigor in the education market, a traditional Apple stronghold, and a rebound in corporate sales.
Despite widespread belief in the financial community that corporate users have been deserting Apple's Macintosh platform, the company said it had recorded a $50 million increase in United States corporate sales for the quarter. The company did not provide a total for worldwide corporate sales.
"The question before us is not, 'Will Apple survive?' but rather, 'How will Apple establish leadership in the emerging digital era of the Internet and multimedia?' " Mr. Amelio said.
For the quarter, Apple's revenues were $2.3 billion, compared with $3 billion in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Net income fell to $25 million, or 20 cents a share, from $60 million, or 48 cents, last year.
For the fiscal year ending on Sept. 27, the company reported that revenues dropped to $9.83 billion, from $11.06 billion in 1995.
Apple's executives said that next week the computer maker would introduce an addition to its line of portable Powerbook computers -- a part of the market where the company has lagged significantly compared with laptops based on Intel chips and Microsoft software.
Even after introducing the new models though, the company will still need to increase production of the new product in the next three months. As a result, Apple expects Powerbook sales to decline by as much as $150 million for the current quarter, Fred D. Anderson, the company's chief financial officer, said.
That is an important reason Mr. Anderson said he was unwilling to predict the company would be profitable in its first fiscal quarter of 1997. He said the company did not expect to reach "sustainable" profitability until its second fiscal quarter.
One strongly positive sign for Apple was the improvement in its gross profit margin in the fourth quarter -- an indication that it may be better able to survive the fierce price wars of the personal computer industry. The company said its gross margins had risen to 22 percent, from 18.5 percent in the third quarter.
"We feel good about these margins and believe we're making progress toward sustainable gross margins in excess of 20 percent," Mr. Anderson said. He also said the company had succeeded in reducing inventories by nearly $400 million since June and had ended the quarter with more than $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments.

The big drug makers continue to ride a wave of rising sales.

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
PHARMACEUTICAL stocks are on a roll for a third consecutive year, propelled by relatively new products and a renewed ability to raise prices and generally outfox the managed care industry.
Several of the strongest drug makers have posted robust third-quarter results, pleasing investors with per-share earnings a penny or two more than most analyst expectations. Merck & Company, the Schering-Plough Corporation and Johnson & Johnson, the diversified health care giant, each reported double-digit percentage growth in after-tax profits yesterday, as had Pfizer Inc. on Tuesday. 
 Among the star products, sales of Pfizer's Norvasc blood-pressure drug soared 41 percent in the quarter to $471 million, and Merck pushed Zocor, its treatment to reduce cholesterol, up 47 percent to $725 million.
Sales of Schering-Plough's antihistamine, Claritin, was up 73 percent, to $323 million. Johnson & Johnson said that its treatment for schizophrenia, Risperdal, had become the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic drug.
Steven B. Gerber, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in Los Angeles, said that drug stocks had been selling at a premium about 15 percent above market averages. But he noted that premiums of 20 percent to 30 percent had been the rule a few years back, before high drug prices briefly became a political concern.
A number of drug makers defended themselves then by vowing not to raise prices faster than the rate of inflation, which was running at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the 12 months ending Sept. 30. Drug prices industrywide have gone up by 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year, Paul Brooke, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said. More importantly, sales volume is up, even to health maintenance organizations, which have seen double-digit percentage growth in monthly drug costs on a per-member basis, he said.
Merck, which paid $6 billion to buy a prescription-drug managed-care company, Medco Containment Services, in 1993, is benefiting, with Medco selling nearly $1 billion in Merck drugs this year, Mr. Brooke said. Merck does not disclose details of its Medco sales, but the bonus for Merck could reach $3 billion by 2000, according to projections by Cowen & Company.
Barbara Ryan at Alex. Brown & Sons said that the drug makers with the biggest market shares would gain even more of the H.M.O. business because they could offer the best price rebates to beleaguered managed care companies. "The rich are getting richer," she said, referring to the pharmaceutical companies. "The others are trying to stay afloat."
In addition to holding their own in price negotiations with H.M.O.'s, Mr. Gerber said, drug makers have benefited from faster Food and Drug Administration approvals of new drugs, fewer expirations this year of important drug patents and a "fairly good" stab at lowering internal costs. "They still have very far to go," he said. "I wouldn't characterize any of the major pharmaceutical companies as being terribly lean."
Net income rose 21 percent at Pfizer, 16 percent for Merck, 15 percent for Schering-Plough and 20 percent for Johnson & Johnson in the quarter, over the comparable period in 1995. Sales were up 10 percent each for Pfizer and Schering, 14 percent for J.& J., and 19 percent for Merck. The dollar's strength abroad cut overall revenues by about 2 percent, except at Pfizer, where the foreign exchange impact was 5 percent.
There were strong increases in prescription drug sales in the United States, ranging from 19 percent for Pfizer to 23 percent for Merck.
In discussing drug companies that will report earnings in the next few days, several analysts praised Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products. Ms. Ryan said that Bristol had effectively filled the gap caused when Capoten, its blockbuster blood-pressure drug, lost its patent protection recently. American Home Products has paid down debt it took on when it acquired American Cyanamid. "They are buying their own stock and generating a lot of cash," she said.
Mr. Gerber said Bristol-Myers and American Home were his favorites, too, along with SmithKline Beecham, Warner Lambert and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Out of favor for now is Pharmacia & Upjohn, which belatedly determined that it would not meet the earnings numbers it had told analysts to expect. Pharmacia has much of its sales in Europe, where the strong dollar has meant reduced revenue, he said. "They are the exception, a disaster," Mr. Gerber said.

Investments With Votes As the Interest

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IF only New York were here.
For an insight into what campaigns are really all about, and why the line "All politics is local" rings so true that some people must credit Shakespeare (try former House Speaker Tip O'Neill), come to Los Angeles and head south for about an hour. Take the San Diego Freeway, which is like the Long Island Expressway with palm trees, past the Los Angeles Airport and the spaghettilike interchanges that Johnny Carson used to parody, and down to the harbor. This is the area's pot of gold. 
 The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are prospering with imports and exports. And they stand to prosper even more with a particularly valuable export from Washington: Pork.
If only New York were here instead of there. Then it, too, might know how it feels to be courted. The Clinton Administration (with assent from Newt Gingrich) just kicked in $400 million in low-interest loans, the last piece of financing for a new high-speed rail link to a downtown terminal. The project, the Alameda Corridor, is also getting $46 million in Federal grants, and just two days ago Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros hinted that communities along the Corridor's route might qualify for special Federal breaks. If the President is re-elected.
There is more.
Washington rescued Los Angeles County's health care system with $364 million, provided speedy earthquake relief, $430 million for a community development bank, a $40 million loan for the Long Beach waterfront, $128 million for the Los Angeles Police Department and millions for mass transit.
BENEFICIARIES of this munificence say they got it on merit. So do the White House and members of Congress. Beverly O'Neill, the Mayor of economically depressed Long Beach, notes that her city suffered severely from military cuts and that the Corridor will help not only Long Beach but the whole country. But there are many needs and many meritorious projects, and nobody who knows politics doubts that the Presidential campaign has a great deal to do with Washington's generosity to this area, as opposed, for instance, to New York City.
New York did get $114 million for its Police Department, empowerment-zone status, and money for housing and to renovate Pennsylvania Station and empowerment-zone status. "Then it sort of stopped," said an adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Democrats grumbled about the White House helping Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who has yet to endorse his party's ticket, though that is likely to happen soon. But mostly it was higher-level politics.
The President figures he needs Democratic Los Angeles to counter Republican areas of all-important California, which delivers a hefty 54 electoral votes: a fifth of the 270 needed for victory. In a state with a mercurial voting history, the White House is taking no chances.
"The Clinton-Gore administration takes New York for granted," said Bill Cerrell, a Democratic campaign consultant here. "This is the battleground."
SOMETIMES, Mr. Clinton seems more of a presence in Los Angeles than does its own Mayor, Richard J. Riordan. Mr. Riordan has been vacationing in Canada lately and isn't very outspoken when he is around. Unlike Mr. Giuliani, he has not used his platform to promote an urban agenda.
It is not his style, nor does it have to be. Mr. Riordan's re-election next spring is considered safe, thanks in part to Washington's largess. Not that he has done anything to get the goodies, except maintain his neutrality in the Presidential race. "What is he supposed to do, turn his back?" asked Bill Wardlaw, a Riordan friend and chairman of California's Clinton campaign. "No matter what the motives were, they have done all these wonderful things for the city."
Like the Alameda Corridor. It will carry goods to a downtown terminal without hurting local traffic or residential communities, explained Yvonne R. Avila, communications director for the Port of Long Beach, sitting in her office with its view of ships and containers and huge gantry cranes like the ones along the harbor in Brooklyn. A visitor noted a photograph on the conference table of a windblown Bill Clinton.
"He was here, Aug. 8," Ms. Avila said. "To talk about the importance of the port to the economy." She paused. "It was really a campaign appearance." One of many out here. But not back there.

Sleaze at the Top

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Whose money is buying those anti-Dole TV spots saturating the airwaves, and what are the secret sponsors getting for their investment?
Thanks to the reporting enterprise of The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal (whatever became of The Washington Post and "60 Minutes"?), we have learned that a good chunk of Clinton campaign money comes from "the Asian connection" -- millions from Indonesia's Riady family, from its $6 billion Lippo banking interests in California and Hong Kong, and the Asian money-raising prowess of its hired hand, John Huang. 
 Mr. Huang, who involved President Clinton personally in prying an illegal $250,000 out of a South Korean company, also helped steer $425,000 to buy those TV spots through a gardener and his wife. That resident alien couple, related to a Lippo bank partner, went home to Indonesia and then sent over $295,000 of their contribution. That's an election crime no matter what Al Gore says.
But set that aside for future prosecutors. Focus on simple sleaze: it's wrong for Bill Clinton to solicit money from a powerful family in cahoots with a foreign dictator to affect the American election.
Focus, too, on obstructing justice in the Whitewater scandal: between the time the Clinton confidant Webster Hubbell was forced to leave the Justice Department and went to jail, it was a Lippo retainer who gave him the comfort to remain hushed.
What has the Riady family been getting for its campaign money investment? Plenty; Clinton's Asian connection helped turn around U.S. policy on human rights.
Fact: In 1992 President Bush launched a formal review of whether Indonesia, with its military thugs terrorizing labor organizers, was failing to live up to "international labor standards" and should be denied duty-free access to U.S. markets.
Fact: Clinton's former campaign manager, Mickey Kantor, when he became U.S. Trade Representative, resolutely kept that review from being terminated throughout 1993. But at the same time, James Riady, Webster Hubbell and a Little Rock lawyer, Mark Grobmyer, worked over President Clinton to forget about the support Candidate Clinton had promised the people of East Timor, targets of bloody repression.
Fact: On Feb. 16, 1994, Kantor suddenly changed -- he rejects the word "reversed" -- policy by declaring the Indonesia review ended.
That $40-million-a-year gift to Indonesian exporters and bankers reduced our human rights leverage in East Timor. It presaged Clinton's flip-flop three months later that removed all trade pressure on China to encourage democracy.
Grant that other policy arguments by hungry U.S. executives and eager advocates of engagement carried weight. But heavy money plus top-level persuasion provides basis to believe that American foreign policy was improperly influenced by the back-channel dealings of Clinton's "Asian connection."
Now to Huang, fondly called "aggressive" by Clinton. For two years, this richly severanced Lippo operative held the sensitive post of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Economic Affairs. That job requires a Top Secret clearance, sometimes one for Special Compartmented Intelligence.
Thus, Huang was privy to U.S. trade bargaining positions, internal reviews of policies toward Indonesian and Chinese interests, even electronic and satellite intelligence from the National Security Agency.
Surely the F.B.I. conducted a full field investigation of Huang before he was granted his top-security clearance. Oversighters should ask: Did its summary reveal to Craig Livingstone the background to Lippo's agreement with the F.D.I.C. to cease and desist from violating laws about money-laundering?
Clinton's Asian connection carries no "gate" in its slug. The scandal's coverage cannot be dismissed as being driven by a partisan Congress or a procrastinating prosecutor or an opposition candidate.
For a change, the story is being ferreted out by reporters and editorialists. Some are uncomfortable about the sleaze they are uncovering, but want to be on firm ground when asked later: "Where were you when American foreign economic policy was put up for sale?"

Progress Is Made in Talks On G.M. Strike in Canada
Progress was made in ending a two-week Canadian strike against General Motors that has crippled operations in the United States.
G.M.'s chairman met for two hours with the union's president and the two agreed on broad principles, leaving details for their negotiators to work out next week. But a contract will be subject to worker ratification, making it unlikely that plants could reopen quickly. So it was likely that factory closings and layoffs will spread across the Midwest. [Page D4.]
 
Ford Earnings Meet Expectations
Ford reported third-quarter profits that barely met analysts' expectations, while disclosing heavy losses in its European and South American operations and a drop in profits from car loans and leases. [D4.]
 
Compaq Reports Strong Profits
Compaq Computer earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, on strong gains in revenues, earnings and profit margins, which it attributed to successful new products, cost-saving efforts and an increase in its share of the personal computer market. [D5.]
 
AT&T Board Discusses Presidency
AT&T's board met for several hours and discussed a potential candidate for its presidency, but an official announcement was unlikely until early next week. AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance carrier, is scheduled to release its earnings today. [D9.]
 
Sears Profits Rise 22 Percent
Sears said third-quarter earnings rose 22 percent, caused mostly by strong sales of apparel, hardware and furniture. [D9.]

Time Warner Cash Flow Rises
Time Warner and U S West had informal discussions about a settlement between the two companies over ownership of Time Warner Entertainment. Time Warner also reported a loss of 43 cents a share but said cash flow rose 32 percent, to $964 million. [D8.]
 
Stocks Again Set Records
A late rebound lifted stocks to new highs. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.03 points, to 6,020.81, bouncing back from a 35-point drop and surpassing Monday's record close by nearly 11 points. [D12.]
 
Treasury bond prices ended slightly lower, hurt by concerns over inflation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged up to 6.85 percent from 6.84 percent. [D19.]
 
Mexican Peso Continues Slide
The Mexican peso fell to its lowest level of the year, continuing a weeklong slide strengthened by investor anxiety concerning the Government's privatization program. The Mexican currency, which has been relatively stable since mid-summer, has fallen 3.3 percent since the beginning of last week and reached 12.7 cents, its lowest level since December. [D6.]
 
Drug Makers' Stocks and Profits Up
Pharmaceutical stocks are on a roll for a third consecutive year, propelled by strong earnings that reflect relatively new products and a renewed ability by drug makers to raise prices and generally outfox the managed care industry. Market Place. [D12.]

Searing Images From Debates Past Are Continuing to Haunt Dole

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
If Bob Dole was skittish about going negative in Wednesday's debate against President Clinton, he had good reason to be.
When he began attacking Walter Mondale in their 1976 Vice-Presidential debate, Mr. Dole sealed a reputation as a partisan hatchet man, which he has been trying to live down since. And his ticket lost the race, too. 
 "It became his touchstone," said Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. "Any time he begins to look negative, people start asking themselves, 'O.K., is he going to turn the car into the guardrail?' "
The other most notable time he went on the attack was during a debate in his hard-fought 1974 Senate race in Kansas. Mr. Dole won that election, but barely, and he lost the respect of some of his supporters, who booed him on stage.
"People in Kansas have not completely forgiven him for that," Mr. Loomis said.
These two searing debate experiences, both occurring when Mr. Dole trailed in the polls, have to have been part of Mr. Dole's calculations as he considered his strategy for the debate, his last chance to appeal to a nationwide audience before the Nov. 5 election.
While Mr. Dole pointedly referred tonight to some of the ethical problems involving the Clinton Administration, he seemed careful to avoid the mean-spirited edge that has characterized his past debates. President Clinton studiously avoided responding, so there was little combustion between the candidates.
Mr. Dole has always been sharp and fast on his feet. Running for re-election to the Senate as the Watergate scandal was unfolding, he was asked if he wanted President Richard M. Nixon to campaign for him in Kansas. "I'd settle for a flyover in Air Force One," the once-and-future Nixon loyalist replied.
His challenge has been to check his bitterness, which was so evident in the debate with Mr. Mondale.
That debate is remembered chiefly for Mr. Dole's comment that all the wars of this century were "Democrat wars." But it was a rough night even before that.
Mr. Dole used innuendo to attack Jimmy Carter, saying, "Some of those who lust for power are not really concerned about people," a reference to Mr. Carter's Playboy interview in which, asked about adultery, he said he had had "lust in his heart." Mr. Dole also said the Democrats had cut unemployment in the 1960's by having a "full-grown war in Southeast Asia." And he disparaged the debate's sponsor, the League of Women Voters, for rating his legislative career as mediocre.
After Mr. Dole's statement about "Democrat wars," Mr. Mondale quickly hauled out the characterization that had already been slapped on Mr. Dole's career: "I think Senator Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight."
It was a reputation Mr. Dole burnished, willingly or not, as President Nixon's hand-picked chairman of the Republican National Committee and in the debate that capped his 1974 Senate race.
In his final moment before thousands of people at the Kansas State Fair, Mr. Dole, already frustrated and angry, asked his opponent, Dr. Bill Roy, an obstetrician, about abortion. Dr. Roy fudged his answer, and Mr. Dole pounced. "You heard him stand here today and say he was for abortion on demand," the Senator declared. "I want to know how many abortions you've done." Many in the audience, including Mr. Dole's own supporters, booed him.
But Mr. Dole had successfully turned the race away from himself and focused it instead on Dr. Roy's character.
After the ticket's 1976 loss, Mr. Dole went to charm school under the tutelage of Dorothy Sarnoff, a speech-dynamics consultant in New York, who told him to keep his face animated so that he did not look "mad" all the time.
By 1978, he was able to joke about his debate performance. "I'll never forget the Dole-Mondale debate, and don't think I haven't tried," he said at an annual dinner of journalists and politicians, the Gridiron Dinner, that year. "President Ford was supposed to take the high road, and I was supposed to go for the jugular. And I did -- my own."
Mr. Dole had also moderated his legislative stance and became more bipartisan, promoting food stamps, school-lunch programs and the Women, Infants and Children program. He talked more directly about being compassionate, a theme that is a staple of his speeches today.
But those who thought the nice Bob Dole had vanquished the mean Bob Dole were disappointed in 1988, when he barked in a television interview that George Bush should "stop lying about my record."
Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego and a former pollster for Mr. Clinton in 1992, said that Mr. Dole has probably concluded that his debate in 1974 was a good move because it won him the election. The lesson from 1976, he said, "is that you better aim carefully. Don't use a shotgun, use a stiletto."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Arkansas Have Long Ties to Indonesian Family

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The 10,000 miles between Little Rock, Ark., and Jakarta, Indonesia, shrank when Bill Clinton became President.
The commercial ties forged between an Indonesian banking family and Arkansan entrepreneurs began while Mr. Clinton was Governor of Arkansas and multiplied soon after he moved into the White House. 
 James T. Riady, the wealthy son of a billionaire banker from Indonesia attended the inauguration of his friend Bill Clinton. Then Mr. Riady spent the next two months making the rounds in Washington and Indonesia, accompanied by Mark Grobmyer, a Clinton golfing friend from Arkansas, letting it be known that he was a close backer of the new American President and that he could set up deals for American entrepreneurs in Indonesia and China.
And on April 19, 1993, Mr. Riady and Mr. Grobmyer met President Clinton in the Oval Office for a brief private visit.
The next day C. Joseph Giroir Jr., the Arkansas lawyer who hired Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1977 for the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, organized a new corporation in Little Rock whose purpose, he says, was to match the Riady conglomerate with United States companies looking for business in China and Indonesia.
The Little Rock corporation had no trouble finding business. Since Bill Clinton's election the Riady family has forged international business alliances with American companies in Arkansas and elsewhere, some with the help of Mr. Giroir's corporation, which also helped the family open a Wal-Mart in Indonesia and plan a power plant in China.
Mr. Grobmyer also did well, traveling through Indonesia on behalf of his own company, Commerce International, where he passed out business cards describing himself as a White House liaison, said Riady business associates, even though he did not hold a White House position. Mr. Grobmyer did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the accusation.
In many ways, the Riadys and their associates operate here like other powerful corporations, such as the Archer Daniels Midland Company, the agricultural giant close to Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate. They give large campaign contributions, gain high-level access and develop business ties with a politicians' associates.
But the millions of dollars the Riadys and their associates have contributed and raised for President Clinton and the Democratic Party have now become an issue in the Presidential campaign, largely because the Riadys are foreigners.
They have close ties not only to Mr. Clinton but to leaders in their own country and those in China, their ancestral home, and a nation whose relations with the United States are uneasy, if not rocky. Indeed, in the Hong Kong office of the patriarch of the family, Mochtar Riady, are two photographs of himself: one with President and Mrs. Clinton and one with Prime Minister Li Peng of China.
While James Riady, associates say, has discussed Asian-American relations with President Clinton and President Suharto of Indonesia, the White House rejects any suggestion that the Administration changed any policies as a result of the Riadys' contacts with the Administration.
"We've specifically denied that there was any alteration in our policy," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Still, the Clinton policy of emphasizing commercial diplomacy, often playing down human rights, especially in Asian countries with fast-growing economies, has been appreciated in Indonesia and Little Rock.
"At the beginning we had some problems," said Arifin M. Siregar, the Indonesian Ambassador, referring to the Administration's early criticism of Indonesia on human rights. But, he added in an interview last year, "the relationships now are much better."
Mr. Siregar said Mr. Clinton "came to be familiar with Indonesia" as a result of his longstanding ties to Mr. Riady, who worked in Arkansas in 1977 as a banking intern and who was sponsored, he has said, by Mr. Clinton.
Wayne Forrest, the executive director of the American-Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, said, "The Clinton Administration's commercial efforts on behalf of American companies in Indonesia have been surprisingly good, given what might have been when they first came to Washington."
Mr. Forrest, speaking of Mr. Riady, said, "We've always felt he was a credible Indonesian voice to interpret for Clinton what goes on in Indoensia."
Mr. Riady's business partner, Mr. Giroir, is also pleased with United States policies in Asia. "The Clinton Administration has been very good for international businesses, including mine," he said in an interview this week.
In Asia, the Riady family controls a $12 billion empire revolving around financial services and real estate and operating under the umbrella of the Lippo Group. The companies have alliances with Asian and Western investors.
The family's American ties include deals in Asia with banks and insurance companies from North Carolina, Alabama and New York. The family started doing business in the 1970's with an influential Arkansas family, the Stephens.
In 1984 the Riadys applied for and received approval from Federal regulators for an investment in Worthen Bank of Arkansas. Mr. Giroir, then the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, worked on the application..
Another Rose firm lawyer who worked for the Riadys in Little Rock was Webster L. Hubbell, who joined the Clinton Administration. When Mr. Hubbell faced legal and financial problems in 1994 after stepping down as Associate Attorney General, he traveled to Indonesia to work for a Lippo affiliate.
Mr. Giroir became an international businessman after leaving the Rose firm, in the late 1980's. He incorporated the Arkansas International Development Corporation on April 20, 1993, to bring together the Lippo Group and American companies that wanted to do business in China and Indonesia. Mr. Giroir's company helped negotiate the deal in which Wal-Mart, the Arkansas based-retail giant, opened a store in a Lippo mall outside Jakarta.
Another Riady-Giroir project involves plans to build a $1 billion power plant in southern China in partnership with the Little Rock unit of the Entergy Corporation, a New Orleans utility company. The project is on hold pending completion of the financing.
Mr. Giroir says he has been working with two other Arkansans on possible Asian deals with the Riadys: Paul Berry, a lobbyist with close ties to Mr. Clinton, and Mark Middleton, who was a special assistant to Mr. Clinton until February 1995.
When Mr. Riady wanted Mr. Clinton to send a get-well letter to an Indonesian business partner of the Riady family, he turned to Mr. Middleton for help, said Mark Fabiani, an associate White House counsel. A letter was sent in June 1995 but was not signed personally by the President. Mr. Fabiani says President Clinton was unaware of the routine courtesy letter.
Mr. Grobmyer said in a 1995 interview that his Indonesian activities included helping strengthen the "sister-state relationship" between Arkansas and Indonesia, exploring the development of Indonesian resorts and trying to get American companies to look at overseas business opportunities.
Mr. Grobmyer explored possible Asian business deals, among other things, for the American Ecology Corporation, said past and present company officials who spoke on condition they not be identified.
The officials said that Mr. Grobmyer promised to introduce American Ecology officials to influential Asians and touted his ties to the Clinton Administration. Mr. Grobmyer helped set up a 1994 meeting in Jakarta between Lippo officials and a representative of American Ecology, the officials said, but the meeting did not lead to any business.
Mr. Grobmyer was in Jakarta then, too, in connection with an economic summit attended by Mr. Clinton. Mr. Riady planned to fly a number of Arkansans business executives to Jakarta for the 1994 meeting, but Bruce Lindsey, one of President Clinton's closest White House advisers, told the Senate Whitewater Committee he vetoed the idea. American Ecology said it dropped its relationship with Mr. Grobmyer's company in 1995.

A Spicier Mix, but Will the Voters Bite?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
What Bob Dole wants the American electorate to do on Nov. 5 is quite straightforward: he wants it to fire Bill Clinton as the nation's Chief Executive, not something the country does casually.
So tonight, in the second debate between the two men, he sought to supply new reasons to do so. When a teacher asked about Washington, Lincoln and national unity, he accused Mr. Clinton of violating "the public trust" of his office and running a White House where scandals and "ethical problems" were commonplace. But he sounded a little half-hearted, reluctant to grapple with the issue in any detail and with sustained intensity. 
 Modifying the decorous style that characterized the early stages of his campaign, he gave confrontational answers for much of the 90-minute joint appearance, on issues ranging from health care to drugs to the military.
"I keep my word," Mr. Dole said again and again, by way of suggesting Mr. Clinton does not.
But by the end of the evening, not much of it seemed to have stirred the invited audience here in the city where the Republicans held their national convention in August. If that proves to be case with the wider audience as well, it will be bad news for Mr. Dole, who badly needed to alter the status quo.
"It was a wash," said Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. "And remember, most of the people who are going to vote had made up their minds before the debate took place."
Not a single direct question about the President's character or about scandals involving F.B.I. files, the White House travel office or the Whitewater affair was asked by the 113 people at the University of San Diego. Evidently sensing that the audience disliked Mr. Dole's harsher jibes, Mr. Clinton said, "No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person."
The President refused to get involved in a slugging match, remaining Presidential and reassuring in his demeanor. He kept his voice low and his gestures small, talking directly to his questioners and calling many by name, in the informal town-hall format. He seemed the picture of confidence, though his face betrayed considerable irritation at his opponent's barbs.
He tried hard to project an image of sweet reason, telling the audience with a smile that he felt one way, Senator Dole the other, and it was up to them to say which was right.
The President completely ignored several of the Republican nominee's assaults on his ethics, including one on the 30-odd Administration aides who, he said, were under investigation, had been fired or indicted. And when Mr. Dole argued that the nation's economy was growing too slowly, he loftily replied, "If you believe the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Senator Dole."
In his closing remarks, Mr. Dole briefly raised several of the issues on the conservative agenda that have been remarkably absent from the campaign -- issues such as term limits, school prayer and protecting the United States flag against desecration. He said nothing, however, about banning abortion, a conservative cause that has cost him support.
Mr. Dole also emphasized several issues that have a particular relevance to California, such as the cost of providing social services to illegal immigrants. He stressed his opposition to affirmative action, which Mr. Clinton supports and which is the subject of a proposition on the ballot in the state this fall.
The Republican's attacks represented an admission that his early tactics, built around a promise to cut taxes by 15 percent and balance the budget at the same time, would not by themselves do the job when the economy, by most measures and in the view of most Americans, is doing well. Tonight, he tried to redefine the campaign by making it a referendum on Mr. Clinton's performance.
Behind in most national polls by about 15 percent with only 20 days to go, he risked alienating voters who, the same polls show, already consider him too negative. He clearly thought he had no other choice, but he was careful not to press too hard; after raising the character issue at the beginning of the face-to-face encounter, he spent most of the evening on broad policy issues.
He also specified, though in a low voice, almost in passing, that his complaints had to do with "the public, not private ethics" of the President. It fell considerably short of the full-throated condemnation of Presidential character that many of Mr. Dole's aides had promised.
"When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other candidate's ideas are old," Mr. Dole said in one of his sharper asides, but he also used humor to soften his belligerence and restrained his sardonic tendencies.
If the challenger often sounded frustrated and a little desperate, his situation warranted it. No Presidential candidate who trailed by as much as he does at this late stage has ever won. The biggest turnaround ever produced by a final Presidential debate would not have been large enough to help him; that took place in 1980, when Ronald Reagan trailed Jimmy Carter in the pre-debate Gallup Poll, 39 percent to 47, and led him afterward, 46 percent to 43.
Mr. Dole's aides said last weekend that he planned to commit considerable time and money in California, which has long been regarded as all but locked up for Mr. Clinton. Democrats here remain confident, and the President's campaign has made a large purchase of television advertising in Florida, which is one of Mr. Dole's better big states.
Behind this strategic maneuvering lies concern about what appears to be the closest of this year's contests, that for control of the House. One major question is whether the Republicans will change their approach and tacitly admit the likelihood of a Dole defeat so that they can argue that with Mr. Clinton remaining in the White House, voters should support Republican House candidates so as to provide a check on his power.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SCENE;
Candidates Fling Barbs and Strive for Folksy Tone

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
They began their debate here tonight by taking neighborly strolls to chat with their questioners, more than a hundred uncommitted San Diego voters.
But within minutes, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole were prowling the red carpet, each trying to land a blow before retreating to his corner, to lean his left elbow against his lectern and brace for the counterpunch. 
 As the night wore on -- and the smiles faded as the criticisms mounted over Medicare, malfeasance and economic growth -- the men began moving closer to each other, occasionally locking stares and addressing one another directly across three or four feet of crimson, the questioners seemingly forgotten.
With 15 minutes to go, Mr. Clinton walked right behind Mr. Dole's lectern, staring him down as he explained a position on Social Security. Mr. Dole turned away, gazing out over the audience instead as Mr. Clinton spoke to his right temple.
Even as they flung barbs, each candidate vied for the folksiest presentation. In 1992, after the first town-hall debate, President Bush was roundly criticized for clinging to his lectern, while Mr. Clinton waded into the crowd. Both men missed no opportunity to wander the room tonight, and both turned questions back on audience members to display an interest in their lives.
"Did you say you're unemployed?" Mr. Dole asked Iris Siefert, who had inquired whether the candidates would encourage baby boomers to plan for retirement rather than rely on Social Security. "See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job."
In jean jackets and suits, t-shirts and elegant blouses, the 113 questioners -- selected during the last week by the Gallup Poll because they had stated no definite preference for President -- sat in a patient semicircle through each peppery exchange. No audience member directly chided the candidates for testiness, as some did in a similar-style debate in 1992.
But question by question, they tried to nudge the candidates toward substantive issues, from the preservation of Medicare to whether American troops were required to insure peace in the Middle East.
The candidates, however, would not be easily led. From the very first question, Mr. Dole signaled the tone of the evening with a move that might be called a switch-and-bait: He turned a question about uniting Americans into a critique of Mr. Clinton's Administration, which he said generated "scandals almost on a daily basis."
Mr. Clinton did not rise directly to the bait, addressing the questioner by name and calling for an end to partisanship in order to set up a partisan point: "When we do that instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country."
The moderator, Jim Lehrer, had the power to sharpen questions and redirect the converstation. But the talk-show format notwithstanding, Mr. Lehrer, of the Public Broadcasting System, proved to be no Oprah Winfrey, calling on each questioner and ducking out of the way.
The scene for the final debate of the 1996 campaign was the 44-year-old Shiley Theater at the University of San Diego, a collection of Spanish Renaissance buildings pillowed in the hills overlooking Mission Bay north of downtown San Diego.
It seemed an incongruous setting for such a dour debate, which began at 6 P.M. here, while the palms trees were still casting shadows across the manicured lawns. While one dormitory was speckled with a few Dole and Clinton signs, other obsessions than politics were suggested by the wet suits draped over the balcony railing, drying in the late afternoon sun.
Ross Perot, who participated in all the debates in 1992, was not invited this year, but he was not forgotten here. His name was engraved into a hillside facing the debate site in enormous white letters.
Mr. Clinton relied heavily on town-hall forums during his 1992 run for the Presidency, but, as he noted this afternoon, he has not participated in one for a long time. Still, he seemed to have lost none of his form, walking right up to the edge of the semicircle to answer some questions, scooping the air with both hands to emphasize his points, and even asking audience members to raise their hands to indicate how many were in managed health care programs. But Mr. Clinton was asked some easy questions, for example what he would do to expand family and medical leave, a program Mr. Dole has criticized.
Mr. Dole has been meeting regularly with voters in town-hall-style sessions that his campaign calls "Listening to America." But attendees have been carefully screened by the campaign, and the questions tended to float in slow, steady and down the middle of the plate.
He occasionally slipped into legislative jargon -- "He puts his money in the out years," he complained of Mr. Clinton's defense budget -- but Mr. Dole displayed flashes of his sense of humor, arguing at one point that he perhaps deserved some sort of preference in the Presidential race becuase of his disability. "Maybe we can work that out -- I get a 10-point spot," he said to Mr. Clinton.
But Mr. Dole did not smile as often as his aides, who frequently remind him to do so, might have wished. At the end, he did not smile as he shook hands with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton's expression was not visible on camera, or to viewers in the back of the crowded hall.
More than a few of the visitors and staff members ho gathered here today had hoped for a sweeter, more inspiring exchange. Outside the room where reporters and spinners beavered away before, during, and after the debate, the Rve. Paul Donovan, a Jesuit, sat at a piano, trying to lower the stress level by softly playing Tinpan Alley tunes like "Someday My Prince Will Come" and "Wanting You."
Even before the debate, Father Donovan bemoaned what seemed to him a more personal and nasty tone creeping into American politics. "I was telling the people at Mass yesterday that every fourth October has become an insult contest for the self-righteous," he said.

HEADLINE: The Attack That Fizzled

 BODY:
Letting their hopes shape their predictions, Bob Dole's advisers had promised an all-out assault on President Clinton's character and ethics. But all Mr. Dole could deliver last night, once in the ring, was a series of pawing jabs and rhetorical asides of the sort that work in the Senate's cozy quarters but not in a two-person debate on national television. Mr. Dole gave the public a look at his wit, at his longstanding rejection of bigotry and his high-minded refusal to turn delicate foreign affairs problems into campaign issues. The only thing he failed to do was deliver the galvanizing attack that his strategists say he needed to turn the campaign around.
Mr. Dole highlighted his own problem during his concluding remarks when he listed "fundamental differences" between himself and the President. They were term limits and constitutional amendments to require a balanced budget, permit voluntary school prayer and ban flag-burning. It was a roll call of mind-boggling minimalism, demonstrating once more that Bill Clinton has taken over all the mainstream issues that made the Republican Party popular, leaving Mr. Dole only side concerns. 
 The debate, like the campaign that preceded it, made it clear that Mr. Dole has only two issues of substance that could convince vast numbers of dubious voters that they should replace Mr. Clinton with him. One is the string of complicated ethics charges against the President. But Mr. Dole failed to provide the consistent, detailed narrative that would persuade swing voters that they add up to a pattern that discredits Mr. Clinton's candidacy. The other issue is his dramatic proposal for a 15 percent tax cut, but once again Mr. Dole failed to explain its rationale or back up his puzzling charge that "we have the worst economy in a century."
Mr. Clinton is never happier than when he is answering questions from average Americans, and the Americans in this audience seemed happy to pitch softballs to him. Mr. Dole opposed affirmative-action programs. Mr. Clinton said he supported them if they did not involve quotas. His example was the Americans With Disabilities Act requirement for wheelchair ramps -- hardly a program most people connect with affirmative action.
When Mr. Dole got to the middle ground, he generally found Mr. Clinton had gotten there first. The two men agreed that teen-agers should be discouraged from smoking, that there should eventually be a bipartisan commission to come up with a plan to insure Medicare's stability, and that people should not be forced into managed-care plans. Asked about the future of entitlements, Mr. Dole assured the questioner, "We'll work it out."
What Mr. Dole did not work out was the fairly simple problem of how to open a line of attack or a vein of explanation and keep pounding it. Had Mr. Clinton risen to his tentative sallies on the ethics issue, Mr. Dole might have broken the President's aura of relaxed confidence. But between the poll numbers and Mr. Dole's performance, Mr. Clinton had little reason to get tense.

HEADLINE: Administration Moves to Defend Indonesia Policy After Criticism

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today responded to Republican accusations that it had manipulated its trade and human rights decisions in return for campaign contributions from two wealthy Indonesian families.
Officials released confidential documents to support their argument that President Clinton had been tougher on Indonesia's Government, especially on workers' rights, than had his Republican predecessors. 
 The documents, released hours before tonight's debate between Mr. Clinton and Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, include an 11-page commitment from the authoritarian Government of President Suharto to cease using the Indonesian military to break up industrial disputes and to allow workers to organize into independent company unions.
In return for those commitments -- which have been partly fulfilled, and which did not halt the imprisonment of labor leaders involved in demonstrations against the Suharto Government this past summer -- the Administration renewed a special trade status for Indonesia in 1994.
That decision eliminated tariffs on industrial goods -- electronics, machinery and other parts -- exported from Indonesia to the United States and helped insure continued foreign capital investment in Indonesia.
But if there were benefits to Mr. Clinton's Indonesian campaign contributors -- the Riady and Wiriadinata families, both linked to the Lippo Group, a major Indonesian real-estate and financial-services conglomerate -- any quid pro quo appears to have been indirect at best.
Until today, the White House had not directly addressed Republican accusations that the contributions of nearly a million dollars, which the Democrats say were legal, were part of an effort by Indonesia to win favorable treatment in Washington.
But today Administration officials released detailed chronologies, offered interviews with major and minor players in the formation of policy toward Indonesia, and provided documents -- which the officials had selected -- to make the case that Mr. Clinton had confronted Indonesia's Government on a range of issues, including human rights and a growing trade dispute over automobiles.
Late today, the Democrats also announced that they had dug into Federal records and come up with a $1,000 contribution by a member of the Riady family in 1987 to Mr. Dole's unsuccesful 1988 Presidential primary campaign.
A major player in the relationship, John Huang, a former Lippo Group executive and former Commerce Department official who solicited the donations for the Democratic National Committee, has repeatedly declined to talk to reporters. And neither the Riadys nor the Wiriadinatas have spoken publicly on the issue, which Mr. Dole raised briefly in the debate tonight and to which President Clinton did not respond.
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said today: "What's frustrating about this is that we have been very resolute, organized and focused in getting Indonesia to change many of its practices. Have we solved all the problems? Far from it. Have we backed away? That's ridiculous."
In fact, there is so far no evidence that the contributions from the Lippo Group -- a $5 billion conglomerate whose relations with Mr. Suharto have sometimes been rocky -- and from a related Indonesian family have resulted in any beneficial policy changes by the Administration.
Mr. Kantor, who as the United States trade representative until earlier this year was the central player in the policies Indonesia cared about most passionately, said today that he had met the Lippo chairman's son, James T. Riady, "two or three times, always in settings where there were 100 people or more."
Although Mr. Riady has known Mr. Clinton since 1977, an effort by Mr. Riady to set up a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Kantor at a critical moment in trade relations between the two countries was turned down in 1994, Mr. Kantor's office said today. Nor did Mr. Riady meet with Mr Kantor's deputy at the time, Charlene Barshefsky, now the trade representative, trade officials said.
But Mr. Riady did meet lower-level American trade officials in Jakarta. One official, Joseph M. Damond, the director for Southeast Asia at the trade representative's office, described Mr. Riady's role today as something of a cultural intermediary. Mr. Damond said Mr. Riady had "never advocated a particular outcome." Since 1994, Mr. Riady has met President Clinton several times, most recently in what the White House has called a "social visit" in the Oval Office.
So far, the Dole campaign has not identified specific decisions that benefited Indonesia or the Riady empire, which has a reputation in Asia as one of the more Western-savvy of the enterprises run by families of Chinese descent. In fact, Indonesian officials have recently complained to American reporters about pressure from Washington on the Indonesian Government in a variety of areas.
Earlier this year Ms. Barshefsky identified Indonesia as the only Southeast Asian nation that had failed to clamp down on the illegal copying of software, movies and computer programs, and she put it on a "priority watch" list for potential sanctions.
The Administration announced last month that it was taking the Indonesian Government to the new international court for trade complaints, the World Trade Organization, because of a series of policies that favor Indonesia's national car project, run by President Suharto's son, over imported cars and projects with foreign investors.
The Riady family, however, may not have been unhappy with that decision. A business associate of the family noted that the family held a minority interest in a competing project to build Chrysler Jeeps in Indonesia. American officials said today that they had not been lobbied in either direction on the complaint by any member of the family.
"I can't see any evidence at all that our trade policy toward indonesia was affected by any of this fund raising," said Clyde Prestowitz, a former top official in the Reagan Administration's Commerce Department and now the president of the Economic Strategy Institute, research group in Washington.
"In fact, you could even argue it the other way. I just got back from Indonesia and what I was hearing from Indonesian businessmen was, 'Why has the United States been so hard on Indonesia? Why are you coming after us?' "
But even if there were no direct financial benefits, the Riady's connection to the White House may have helped make the family a bit more useful to Mr. Suharto, whose relationship with Washington has long been rocky. Some Administration officials acknowledge that the Riady family has helped ease the way for meetings between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Suharto.
Perhaps the most important of those occurred last October, when Mr. Suharto arrived at the White House for what the Administration described as a private visit. He was escorted into the Cabinet Room, where he was greeted by Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mr. Kantor, and Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary who was killed in a plane crash in April.
"No one used to treat the Indonesians like this," one senior official said at the time, "and it said a lot about how our priorities in the world have changed."
The most important of the documents the Administration released today was a plan, delivered to Mr. Kantor by Indonesia's Ambassador to Washington in January 1994, specifying how worker rights in Indonesia would be improved.
The most important of those changes was permission for workers to form company unions that could negotiate collective labor agreements, and a Government agreement to issue regulations that "eliminate the role of the security authorities in cases of industrial dispute."
There are differing assessments of how well the Indonesians have complied with those obligations. The Administration notes that there are now more than 1,000 factory-based unions, and that they no longer have to funnel union dues through the Government in Jakarta. Military intervention in labor disputes is down, though some activists attribute that development to intimidation of unions through other means.
"The Clinton people did get agreements on paper, and that was important," said Sidney Jones, the executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. "This Administration has been marginally better on these issues than past Administrations."
Ms. Jones noted that the Bush Administration had rarely raised human rights issues with Indonesia. At the United Nations Human Rights Conference in 1993, the Clinton Administration, for example, was the first Administration to press for a condemnation of repression by Indonesia on the island of East Timor, which it seized in 1976 after Portugal ended its colonization there.
Ms. Jones and others who have pressed the Administration on human rights and worker-rights issues also said they doubted that any foreign campaign contributors had played a major role in the decision to renew Indonesia's trade preferences.
"They didn't have to, because the Fortune 500 did it for them," she said. "American companies were afraid that there would be retaliation, and that big contracts would go to the Europeans and the Japanese. And that's how you really get this Administration's attention."
