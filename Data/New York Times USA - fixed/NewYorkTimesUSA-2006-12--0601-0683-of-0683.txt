HEADLINE: Judge Sends Katrina Flooding Lawsuit Back to State Court

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A federal judge has sent back to Mississippi state court a lawsuit demanding that insurers pay flood damages to thousands of Hurricane Katrina victims, a ruling that was opposed by the companies. 
 Mississippi's attorney general, Jim Hood, said at a news conference yesterday that he was ready to take the case to court but urged the insurers to negotiate a settlement with him and Mississippi residents.
Mr. Hood, who brought the suit on behalf of state residents 15 months ago, said that if insurers did not negotiate settlements by spring, he expected Congress, led by Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, to investigate the industry.
 The lawsuit claims that the five insurers had refused to pay for damages from storm surge, a 30-foot-high wall of water that destroyed property worth billions of dollars during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.
 The insurers, led by the Allstate Corporation, the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, claimed that flood damages were excluded from their policies and were covered under federal flood insurance.
 Nationwide Mutual is the parent of Nationwide Financial Services. 
 The insurers had wanted the case to be heard in federal court, where judges have ruled against awarding flood damages.
 The case now goes to state court in Hinds County, Miss., where it will be decided by a local judge.
 ''Insurers will be unhappy about this ruling,'' Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, said.
 He said federal judges had already ruled that flood damages were not covered by regular insurance, ''and in the world of courts, precedent is everything.''
 The companies expressed disappointment at the ruling.
 ''But we are confident that the Mississippi state courts will also recognize that flood coverage is excluded,'' a State Farm spokesman, Fraser Engerman, said.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Union Chief Falters In a Pop Quiz on Fractions 

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
In contract negotiations, Randi Weingarten, the president of the New York City teachers' union, typically does math in percentages, not fractions -- as in 7.1 percent pay raises over two years in a deal that she brokered last month. And with teachers receiving large raises in the last three contracts, many teachers would say they like the way she counts. 
 But Ms. Weingarten, the standard bearer for more than 80,0000 teachers, was left flummoxed by a question about fractions yesterday when she was on ''The Brian Lehrer Show'' on WNYC radio, to discuss a recent report calling for a reinvention of American public schools. ''What is 1/3 plus 1/4?'' the guest host, Mike Pesca, asked.
''What is 1/3 and 1/4?'' Ms. Weingarten stalled. ''I would actually have to do it on paper.'' 
 Mr. Pesca turned to his other guests, Marc S. Tucker, the director of the National Center on Education and the Economy, and Susan Sclafani, a former assistant federal education secretary who is now with an education consulting company. 
 Mr. Tucker quickly offered up the answer: ''Seven-twelfths.''
 According to New York State standards, adding fractions with different denominators is sixth-grade work. But Ms. Weingarten defended her lack of a quick answer. ''I do it the old-fashioned way,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''You take your paper, your pen, you add it up, you get to the fractional whatever.'' 
 ''And you show your work, right?'' Mr. Pesca prodded. ''So a good teacher can give you partial credit.'' 
 Ms. Weingarten replied, ''A good teacher will look at it and talk to you about what went right and went wrong.'' 
 In a statement later, she said: ''Guilty as charged. I can't add fractions at a moment's notice in my head.'' But she reiterated that she could do the calculations on paper. ''As I was taught by some great math teachers.''

HEADLINE: Sickness Leads to Financial Crisis and a New Direction

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
There is a constellation of dime-size brown spots on the lower half of Katasha Green's legs. The spots reflect how her illness is weakening her body, she said. At only 28, she has sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease primarily of the lungs and lymph glands that she developed after working for years in filth and grime. 
 Ms. Green became a boiler mechanic when she was 19. As a caretaker of radiators and water heaters for New York City Housing Authority buildings, she went to work at 5 a.m. and often stayed for 18 hours.
She would sometimes remove dead pigeons from rooftop water tanks. In basements, she wriggled into crawl spaces to clear pipes and repair and maintain boilers. She had to use chemical solvents to remove grime. It was all in a day's dirty work, for which she earned $36,000 a year plus benefits. She could afford to pay $574 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, where she lives with her two sons, Khaaliq Ford, 9, and Kazeer Williams, 3. 
 Then, two years ago, the symptoms of her disease began with a cough that escalated into shortness of breath. She thought it was asthma or bronchitis, but then she heard a pop in her ribs. The sound scared her enough to make her go to the emergency room at Brooklyn Hospital Center in February 2005. She spent a month in the hospital. It was not until a pulmonary doctor told her to transfer to Mount Sinai Hospital that she learned what she had.
 ''With one test, they found out,'' she said. 
 It was a relief. At least now, she knew she was not going to die from her illness. Her sons would not be orphans. She was put on steroids to treat the symptoms and gained more than 100 pounds, which she is slowly losing since going off the medication.
 After eight months on disability, she was ready to go back to work. In October 2005, she sought a transfer from the boiler mechanic's job to a position that did not require working in harsh places. She was told she could apply for such jobs when they came open, but could not be automatically transferred. 
 Feeling her situation was an emergency, she approached her union representative to intervene. She also wrote letters to her councilman and to the mayor. All of her inquiries received a similar response. 
 She had no choice but return to her position, and by December 2005, she had a relapse. 
 ''I couldn't breathe,'' she said. ''I was very sick dealing with the soot.'' 
 She went back on medical leave for five months, receiving $250 a month in disability payments from her union. When that stopped, she continued to survive on her income tax refund, close to $7,000 for each of the last two years. When that ran out, she went on on public assistance, which was less than $300 a month. 
 ''I wanted to work, but all I knew was boilers,'' she said. Without other skills, she felt crippled. By the end of September, her bills were mounting and she was four months behind on the rent, owing close to $2,300, plus a cable and phone bill of about $475. 
 With the stress, she lost sleep. One late night in August, she was searching the Internet and found an ad for training at the Grace Institute, which offers tuition-free business training to disadvantaged women. ''It had everything I was looking for,'' she said. ''My eyes began to well up.'' 
 The institute is an affiliate of the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In September, she began taking classes five days a week, learning administrative skills, including how to type and how to use office software. 
 But she continued to have financial problems. In September, she was 72 hours away from being evicted when she confided in Anne Yackee, a social worker at the institute. ''I had no one else to turn to,'' Ms. Green said. 
 Ms. Yackee advised Ms. Green to go immediately to housing court. There, Ms. Green informed the judge that $1,874 would be paid from Jiggets, a rent subsidy, and that public assistance was paying the $426 balance. Ms. Yackee also spoke with Elizabeth Savage, the student affairs coordinator, who approached Catholic Charities on Ms. Green's behalf. With money from the Neediest Cases, Ms. Green was able to pay $475 for the phone.
 For the past four months, Ms. Green has excelled at the institute. After graduation in February, she hopes to work in an office while continuing her studies to be a respiratory therapist. To keep her focused on her goal, the Neediest Cases money was used to pay $70 for the application fee at Borough of Manhattan Community College. She has applied for a grant that she hopes will cover the tuition. 
 ''I am so blessed, I am so blessed, '' she said, referring to all the help she has received.
 ''Everything is changing. I am going to school; I am going to get a great job. I feel so good.''

Standard & Poor's has raised Buffalo's credit rating, citing the city's improving finances and continued oversight by a state control board. The rating agency had assigned the lowest investment grade to Buffalo's general obligation bonds until raising them to BBB stable this week. The rating implies that a municipality has the capacity to meet its financial obligations but is vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Explore Ways to Profit From Trading Credits to Emit Carbon

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
While the trading of credits to emit carbon is under way in bits and pieces and California has moved to cap its production of greenhouse gases, no one expects nationally imposed limits to go into effect in the United States soon. Most experts see 2010 as the earliest possible date.
 Even so, a rapidly growing number of American companies are preparing for what they think will be a booming market after rules are approved.
''The U.S. market will be the mother lode of carbon trading, so we want to start setting up our brand now,'' said Marc Stuart, director of new business development at EcoSecurities. 
 EcoSecurities, which has spent seven years investing in the reduction of greenhouse gases in Europe, is setting up a New York office to expand into the United States. Similarly, Morgan Stanley plans to spend almost $3 billion to trade carbon credits on greenhouse gases over the next five years. 
 Meanwhile, American Electric Power has started including the value of carbon credits when it compares the costs of traditional coal-burning plants with more expensive, cleaner ones.
 Carbon trading is common in Europe and parts of Asia, where many countries operate under the Kyoto Protocol, the international pact regulating greenhouse gas emissions, which is set to expire in 2012. The United States has refused to join. 
 Most of the countries operate under a ''cap and trade'' system in which nations allot companies the right to emit a set amount of greenhouse gases. Companies that emit less than allowed, or that build new clean-burning plants, get credits they can then sell to companies that need them to meet the standard because they are emitting more than their allowable amount. 
 For now, trading in the United States is voluntary: 225 companies that have made promises to reduce greenhouse gases by 6 percent by 2010 are trading carbon credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange. Prices for the credits started around 90 cents per ton of carbon when the exchange was established in 2002; they now trade around $4. 
 Most experts said trading would pick up in California, which has passed greenhouse gas rules (they are being challenged in court), and in the Northeast, where a coalition of states are following California's lead. But once national rules pass, as many experts predict, the market is expected to explode.
 ''This cottage industry has the potential to become one of the largest commodity markets in the world,'' said Emma Stewart, director of research and development at Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit consulting and research organization.
 For utilities and manufacturers, the ability to trade credits could take some of the sting out of regulation. ''There is more certainty that we will be living in a carbon-constrained world through some sort of legislative activity, and that helps carbon take on a value,'' said Sara S. Kendall, vice president for environment, health and safety for Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company. 
 That value, in turn, makes it easier to persuade shareholders and directors that it makes sense to invest in research on ways to cut emissions even beyond a mandatory level.
 ''A market-based trading approach fosters innovation,'' said Edwin L. Mongan III, director of energy and environment at DuPont, one of the exchange's 14 founders. ''It gives an incentive to use your best technology to get well below the mandatory targets.''
 But while utilities and manufacturers worry about abating the costs of new rules, financial firms are already figuring out the best ways to profit from them. 
 Natsource, a green-oriented investment firm, has begun hiring environmental economists and regulatory experts to help ''figure out what the regulatory regime will look like, and what sort of abatement projects will make sense from an investment standpoint,'' said Jack D. Cogen, its chief executive.
 GE Energy Financial Services is already negotiating to invest in projects that keep methane from escaping from landfills and coal mines, and it will take ownership of many of the resulting carbon credits. There are only a few deals in the pipeline now, said Kevin Walsh, the unit's managing director, ''but we want to get in, learn and have a few deals under our belt when regulation comes to the U.S.''
 Insurance companies and consulting firms see the potential for profit, too. Marsh, which is in both those businesses, is helping clients assess the risks and potential rewards of carbon abatement projects. Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan, is also creating new insurance products that mitigate the risk of a project going awry -- say, a forest that burns down, or a carbon leak at a coal-burning plant. 
 ''The U.S. market for carbon credits will be huge,'' said Gary S. Guzy, a senior vice president at Marsh, ''and we want to be leading the risk management and services side of it.''
 For many companies, though, the motivation has less to do with the potential for profit. American Electric Power, one of the climate exchange's 14 founders, joined partly to influence national policy and partly to ''get carbon prices embedded in our own people's thought processes,'' said Bruce H. Braine, vice president of strategic policy analysis.
 Once emissions rules are in place, he said, it may make more economic sense to earn carbon credits by planting a forest or capturing methane from agricultural holding ponds than to cut emissions by switching a carbon-spewing coal plant to natural gas. Conversely, carbon credits can add to the economic viability of converting coal to gas, efficient turbine components and other clean technologies with high upfront costs.
 The Chicago exchange is being watched for early signs of glitches in its trading systems so those glitches can be ironed out before mandatory emissions rules make trading more a matter of profit and loss than of choice.
 ''If you shut down an obsolete plant, should you automatically get carbon credits?'' asked Matt Cheney, chief executive of MMA Renewable Ventures, which invests in clean energy projects and is a member of the exchange. ''And if I put up a wind-powered plant, should you get the carbon credit for buying my clean electricity, or should I for providing it? It is all still very complicated, because we just don't know what the final U.S. law will say.'' 
 In particular, companies are already worrying about how Congress will establish baselines, the emission levels from which mandated reductions will be calculated. In Europe, prices for credits plunged this year because too many credits were issued, producing a glut.
 ''They should have auctioned off emissions allowances in Europe, not just given them away,'' said Dan Bakal, director of electric power programs at Ceres, a coalition of environmentalists and investors. He predicts that an auction system will be built into any American regulatory scheme.
 Nor is there any certainty that the Chicago exchange will end up as the primary trading vehicle for carbon credits. Some experts predict that the Intercontinental Exchange, usually called Ice, will take over. Others suspect that the New York Mercantile Exchange, where energy futures now trade, will be dominant. 
 But for now, Chicago is the only game in town.
 ''I would say within the next year or so we'll start trading on this market,'' said Simon Greenshields, managing director of the Morgan Stanley Capital Group. ''We want to gain the experience.''

 About a year ago Mr. Spanitz, a professor of management at Lake Forest University in Illinois and a business consultant, finally decided to buy a phone and a music player, but he didn't want to carry two devices. Instead he bought a Sony-Ericsson W800i Walkman phone that combines both.
''I use it more often than I expected,'' he said of the music function, with which he listens to tunes on plane trips and in his hotel room, and even uses his selection of 60s rock, jazz, classical and German electronica to serve as a D.J. at impromptu gatherings. ''The constant reaction is, 'Where are you hiding the speakers? That sound can't come from the phone,' '' he said.
 Speculation that Apple Computer will announce a combination iPod and phone at the Macworld convention in San Francisco next month has fueled interest among people who, like Mr. Spanitz, don't want to carry multiple devices -- even though most phones already have multimedia players that handle music. 
 The problem seems to be that few multimedia phones, if any, are as easy to use as an iPod. Of course, most people pick phones primarily for the phone features or service plan, but for those who put high importance on music, there is a subset of media phones designed with the music fan in mind. A few can give an iPod a run for the money.
 At the top of the list is the Motorola iTunes phone from Cingular ($200 after $50 rebate with a two-year contract). The handset is a modified Motorola RAZR, called the V3i, with a music note button that takes you right to your songs. The V3i uses the same menu system as the iPod. The phone lacks the iPod click wheel, so an up/down/left/right button substitutes.
 The phone screen displays not only the basic song information, but also a picture of the CD cover -- if you have downloaded the image into your iTunes file. Plugged into a computer with iTunes software, the V3i practically sets itself up. With a few button clicks it randomly fills with songs. Like an iPod, the phone can recharge from its U.S.B. connection or from a wall socket and works equally well with Mac or PC.
 The sound quality is Pod-worthy, but the V3i does have its limitations. For one, it can hold only 100 songs (6.9 hours of music, its maker says.), and the memory cannot be expanded, as is true for most music phones. Because Cingular does not sell music over its network (just ring tones), you can't buy songs and have them instantly transmitted into your phone.
 Another Cingular music phone, the Sony-Ericsson Walkman W810i (the newer version of Mr. Spanitz's phone is $99 after a $100 rebate with a two-year contract), offers a memory slot to store a heap of music, but uses only Sony's proprietary Memory Stick cards, which are frequently more expensive than generic memory. 
 A ''candy bar''-style phone, it has an adapter for other brands of headsets, although the Sony in-ear headphones that are included are decent -- crisp sounding, if lacking in bass. Setting the built-in equalizer to ''bass'' helps.
 Loading songs should be easy but proved initially glitchy in a reporter's test. Plugging the phone into a U.S.B. port sets it up as a drive; then you can drag and drop songs. The W810i should recognize music and store it properly, but it didn't work in the test. When music was dropped directly into the folder labeled MP3 on the card and the phone restarted, it worked perfectly.
 The Sony does pump out a lot of sound through its three tiny speakers. While it is loud enough for small gatherings like Mr. Spanitz's, fidelity is the quality of a 1960s transistor radio.
 The Walkman phone offers 50 streaming radio stations through MobiRadio for $8.99 a month. Channels range from rap to classical, but the tinny sound quality and signal drop-outs will disappoint hi-fi fans. The built-in FM tuner (found under the Entertainment tab, not Music) sounds far better at no extra charge.
 From Verizon Wireless, the LG VX8500 Chocolate phone ($99 after $50 rebate with a two-year contract) has plenty of cool factor, but how much you like it depends on your regard for the buttonless, touch-sensitive control pad. The red backlight glow will attract admiring glances, but it takes practice to develop the right touch to operate the pad.
 The slider phone has a hot button to take you right to your music, and loading songs, while not flawless, worked with some persistence. Sound quality was a bit thin but acceptable.
 The display while music is playing shows the album cover in a larger size than others, a nice graphic touch.
 Browsing Verizon's V-Cast music store on the Chocolate displays only three artists at a time, making shopping laborious. If you already know what you want, it's easier. Downloads direct to the phone from the V-Cast store are $1.99 and you get two copies, one to the phone and a higher-quality copy for your computer. You can also use your computer to buy a single copy from the V-Cast store for 99 cents, which can be loaded onto the phone's SD card by U.S.B.
 Sprint's most tune-oriented phone is the Fusic ($30 after a $50 rebate with a two-year contract, through Dec. 31). But Sprint tries to appeal to the music fan not so much with the phone as with its service, producing exclusive live music and phonecast TV shows for its customers.
 Many of the special features and much of the exclusive content, however, are geared toward selling music through Sprint. Shopping screens are neatly laid out showing an artist's most popular downloads as well as a comprehensive list of tunes. The downloads are remarkably fast, but the cost of that convenience is a steep $2.50 per song -- plus the minutes spent downloading. As with Verizon, you get two copies of the song, one direct to the phone and one for your computer, but you can't save money by buying direct through your computer. 
 While you can download on an economy plan, the per-kilobyte charge makes it expensive. Frequent downloaders may save over all using the more expensive Power Vision plan, which includes some data downloads. Other add-ons also add to the price, like 20 channels of Sirius radio, which cost $6.95 a month plus tax.
 In a test of the Fusic, loading songs through the U.S.B. connection was stymied by a card-reader problem that the company said was being addressed, but was easily accomplished by putting the micro SD card in a reader and dragging unprotected MP3 files to the card's MP3 folder.
 Sound quality was better with MP3s than with the streaming radio, but was greatly improved in both cases by other brands of earbuds.
 One novel feature of the Fusic is its FM transmitter, which lets you send the music from your phone to an FM radio receiver.
 Then you can use the phone not only like a D.J., as Mr. Spanitz does; you can go him one better at your next party and be an in-house dance club D.J. over your radio.

Sprint's Fusic, near right, has an FM transmitter that allows it to play on an FM radio and also offers exclusive content like live music. The V3i, far right, is a modified Motorola RAZR. Verizon's LG VX8500 Chocolate, below, has a touch-sensitive control pad. Apple may announce plans for a combination cellphone and iPod next month.

HEADLINE: As Diabetes Destroys Kidneys, New York Lags in Dialysis Care

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of people across the country, their kidneys ruined by Type 2 diabetes, have been forced into the grim routine of dialysis care, and in New York, those patients routinely receive some of the worst treatment, government records show.
 At New York dialysis centers, those being treated are more likely to suffer from anemia and are less likely to have enough impurities and excess fluid removed from their blood, allowing more damage to their bodies, according to the records.
Experts say the disparity is caused in part by the fact that New York is dominated by small dialysis providers, many of them run by people with little background in medicine who entered the business to meet the surging demand.
 Many of the smaller centers provide good care, experts say, but a lot also lack the money and staff training to compete on a quality-of-care basis with the national dialysis chains that dominate the market across the rest of the country. 
 Newly released patient data show that people who receive their dialysis from a national chain generally fare better than those treated by an independent provider.
 But the chains are largely blocked from operating in New York by a state law that effectively bars publicly traded companies from owning health care facilities in the state. 
 ''With the need for dialysis on the rise, the department is questioning whether it makes sense not to allow these large corporations to participate,'' said Jeffrey W. Hammond, a Department of Health spokesman.
 In 1980, fewer than 50,000 people in the United States needed dialysis to do the work of their kidneys; today, there are more than 350,000, including roughly 24,000 in New York. In 1980, diabetes was the primary cause of kidney failure for fewer than 6,000 dialysis patients; today, the figure is about 150,000.
 Survival for them is an ordeal, at best.
 At a typical dialysis center, patients come in three times a week, typically for four hours at a time. They sit in rows of recliners, dozing, watching television -- anything to take their minds off the machines, needles and tubes that siphon blood from their bodies, clean it of impurities like urea, and pump it back in. It is surprisingly quiet; patients are so beset by side effects like fatigue, cramps or thirst, that mere conversation seems like an effort.
 For all but a few, holding a job is out of the question. Most will never be healthy enough to qualify for a transplant that would free them of this burden, and there are far too few donated kidneys, anyway.
 New drugs and dialysis techniques have improved their chances of survival since the 1980s, despite the fact that patients today are older, heavier and sicker. Even so, the average dialysis patient spends 15 days a year hospitalized, and the death rate is about one in five each year.
 ''I want to say it's a rough life, but it hardly is a life,'' said Denise Bembury, a dialysis patient who lives in Brooklyn. ''I wouldn't put this on anybody.''
 Across the country, five companies own or operate almost two-thirds of the 4,800 dialysis units. Two of them, Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita, have more than half the market. But in New York, the big five run about 20 percent of the roughly 250 centers, by far their lowest share in any state.
 The State Department of Health has helped the national chains work around the law that bars publicly traded companies from owning health facilities. This has allowed them to open some centers here, but the companies say the approval process remains long and difficult, dampening their interest.
 The ownership restriction, in place for at least 50 years, state officials said, was enacted when there was no such thing as a dialysis center, and was intended to ensure that hospitals are responsive to local concerns, not to far-flung shareholders. Though the Health Department talks of changing the law, no one has made it a priority, and not even the large chains have pushed the issue in Albany.
 Recent reports on the quality of dialysis care by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid illustrate New York's cause for concern. The centers examined a sampling of Medicare patients' dialysis records in each of 18 regions, one of them New York State.
 Medicare pays for almost 90 percent of dialysis in this country, and in the reports, for 2003 and 2004, New York ranked worst in all three of the most commonly used quality measures. Those measures are how likely patients are to have enough excess fluid like water removed from their blood during dialysis, how likely they are to have enough impurities like urea removed, and how likely they are to be anemic or severely anemic because of the treatment. 
 Those scores have improved in New York over the last decade, but not as quickly as they have nationwide, and New York's numbers were actually worse in 2004 than in 2003.
 The federal agency does limited comparisons of individual dialysis centers, which show that nationally, 4 percent of them have unusually poor patient survival rates, defined as at least 20 percent below average. In New York, 12 percent do. Federal officials caution against putting much stock in any one center's numbers, but they say the regional picture clearly shows a problem.
 The federal data do not draw any conclusions about the cause of the disparity. But experts said they believed the quality of care was affected by the high number of smaller, less experienced providers in the New York market. In fact, in New York City, one-fifth of the centers operating earlier this year had existed for less than five years.
 A recent report by the United States Renal Data System Coordinating Center, a quasi-governmental agency that compiles the records of most dialysis patients, shows that patients at the major chains were less likely to die than those treated by smaller companies.
 According to the center, the numbers were adjusted to account for differences that might affect patients' risk, like age and sex, whether they had an underlying disease like diabetes and how long they had been on dialysis. The independents were defined as not being part of a major chain or a hospital.
 Four of the five largest chains had adjusted death rates 7 percent to 10 percent lower than the independents had as a group in 2004, and one chain had higher rates, according to the center's most recent annual report. Since then, two major chains, including the one with the highest death rate, have left the business, and two new ones have been formed.
 Patients at the small companies were much more prone to infections that led to hospitalization or death. The small companies also lagged in nondialysis care that dialysis centers usually take over, like ensuring that patients get vaccinations for influenza, pneumonia and hepatitis B. Their diabetic patients were less likely to have tests that monitor blood sugar control.
 Some independent operators say that large companies can ''cherry pick'' healthier clients. But the government's figures show that the national chains' patients are actually sicker when they begin dialysis -- more anemic, more overweight, and with more advanced kidney disease.
 Researchers and state and federal officials say they have known, or at least suspected, for years that patients fare better at the major chains, but they cannot be sure why.
 One factor believed to play a role is that the average Medicare reimbursement rate for a dialysis session, $140 to $150, has changed little since the 1970s, making it difficult for the smaller operators who cannot realize economies of scale. Tight operating margins have left fewer small providers nationwide, although their numbers have grown in New York, where the chains have not been ableto operate freely.
 Dr. Allan J. Collins, director of the United States Renal Data System Coordinating Center, said: ''We do know that the large organizations have an enormous advantage in resources because they can demand discounts from suppliers on drugs and equipment, and that can translate to better staffing, better training. The chains also tend to be more systematic and standardized in their procedures.''
 Michael Paget, executive director of the National Renal Administrators Association, which represents large and small dialysis companies, said he was not familiar with the Coordinating Center's research that indicates one group performs better than the other. The center first included those comparisons in a report last year, and first included the mortality and hospitalization breakdowns this year.
 ''I don't think you can generalize about the independents, and there are many that do an excellent job,'' outperforming even the best of the major chains, he said. But he acknowledged that bigger companies probably had an edge in training.
 The federal government and most states, including New York, do not set training or educational standards for dialysis technicians, the workhorses of a dialysis center. (Federal rules require only that the centers have full-time or part-time doctors, social workers and nurses on staff.)
 National chains customarily provide technicians and other staff members with months of initial training and occasional re-training, instruction that can boost the quality of care and that independent companies, with their tighter operating margins, have a hard time affording, experts say.
 Ms. Bembury, 44, uses an independent center, Nephrocare, a three-year-old unit on Atlantic Avenue, in the Weeksville section of Brooklyn. She goes there, she said, because her doctors referred her there. Like many patients, she has no idea how it compares with other centers, or how to find out.
 Until earlier this year, she was a social worker and an avid cook. Now, she is on disability, and her companion of more than 30 years prepares meals. They have six children, and she wonders how the four youngest, all teenagers, will manage.
 ''I'm thirsty all the time, and tired,'' she said.
 Nephrocare was one of a few dozen centers in New York with an abnormally high death rate in 2004, though not in 2005, and in both years, it had an unusually high number of patients with uncontrolled anemia, Medicare records show. An administrator at Nephrocare said that none of the owners or staff would be interviewed, and several other large, independent centers around the city gave the same response.
 There are no rules as to who can own or manage a dialysis center. Doctors control some. Others are run by people with no background in health care. State officials say they conduct a ''character and competence'' review, and look at owners' finances.
 Under Medicare rules, states must inspect most centers every three years, though troubled centers are visited more often. Even when there are persistent problems, regulators would rather coax a center into improving than shut it, even temporarily, because the dialysis supply barely keeps up with demand.
 State officials said they could recall only one center being forced to close this decade, and Medicare gave that order, not the state. The experience was painful, they said, as patients had trouble finding other centers nearby with spaces, or stations, available.
 ''We had 403 people who had to find other stations in New York City,'' said Mr. Hammond, the department spokesman, ''and that is not something we encourage or want to happen.''

HEADLINE: Lessons Never Learned

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; David Brooks is on vacation.

 BODY:
It would not be easy to find two men more different than Gerald Ford and James Brown. But I had a similar reaction to each of their deaths -- a feeling of disappointment at some of the routes the nation has traveled since their days of greatest prominence. 
 Both men were important figures, symbolically more than substantively, at crucial periods in postwar American history -- Mr. Brown at the crest of the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s and Mr. Ford in the trough of the ''long national nightmare'' of Watergate. 
Both were unlikely harbingers of the new. Mr. Brown, with his gleaming (and anachronistic) pompadour, became the very embodiment of black pride, a troubadour exhorting his followers to ''Say it Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud'' at a time when schoolhouse doors were opening and unprecedented opportunities were beckoning to black Americans after centuries of almost unimaginable degradation.
 Mr. Ford was more than just the designated healer after Watergate. The U.S. was also in the final throes of the long national nightmare of Vietnam. And it was stuck in a protracted energy crisis. The nation was looking for a way forward.
 My disappointment stems from the opportunities never seized and the lessons never learned from those two periods, which were all but bursting with possibilities.
 Mr. Brown's message was relentlessly upbeat and optimistic. Despite the continuing plague of racism, there were dreams in the 1960s of fabulous days ahead for black Americans, days in which the stereotypes and degradation of the past would be erased by a new era of educational, professional and cultural achievement.
 Those dreams did not include visions of an enormous economically disadvantaged population that would continue to live in poverty, or near-poverty, more than 40 years later; or a perennially ragged public school system, largely segregated in fact, if not by law, that would turn out generation after generation of educationally deprived children; or a black prison population so vast and so enduring it would come to seem normal to legions of black youngsters, actually dictating to a great extent their tastes in fashion, art and music; or a level of sustained violence that has condemned thousands upon thousands of black youngsters to an early grave.
 Oh, there have been plenty of strides since the mid-1960s. That's undeniable. But one would have to be blind not to notice that there is much cause for disappointment, as well.
 James Farmer, who helped create the Congress of Racial Equality on Gandhian principles of nonviolence, once told me that even as the civil rights movement was racking up its stunning successes, its leaders made a grave error.
 ''We did not do any long-range planning,'' he said. ''So we were stuck without a program after the success of our efforts, which included passage of a civil rights bill and voting rights legislation. We could have anticipated the backlash that followed. We could have asked ourselves what the jobs prospects would be for blacks in the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, and later on. By and large we didn't do that, except for affirmative action. We should have had a plan.''
 It would be foolish to suggest that the United States as a whole hasn't made tremendous progress since the 1960s and '70s. But it's impossible to reflect on the presidency of Gerald Ford, who formally ended U.S. participation in the war in Vietnam, and fail to notice that his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and chief of staff, Dick Cheney, were among the chief architects of the current calamity in Iraq. There were lessons galore to be learned from Vietnam. But Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney, like frat boys skipping an important lecture, managed to ignore them.
 The trauma of the 1973 oil embargo actually spooked the country into action on the energy front. Fuel economy standards for automobiles were ratcheted up and improvements were made in the energy efficiency of refrigerators, air-conditioners and other household appliances. But those successful early efforts, instead of being strengthened, were undermined by the conservative political tide of the past several years.
 Now we're confronted with the dire threat of global warming, and as usual there is no plan.
 If history tells us anything, it's that we never learn from history. We could have stepped back from the war in Iraq, and stepped up to the challenge of global warming. We could have learned something when James Brown was on the charts and Gerald Ford was in the White House.
 Maybe next time.

HEADLINE: Are Wall Street Bonuses Just Too Rich?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Wall St. Bonuses: So Much Money, Too Few Ferraris'' (front page, Dec. 25):
 Surely I am not the only reader who yearns to see Wall Street revise the bonus system in a society increasingly defined by the polar ends of super-rich and barely surviving. 
Which firms will step forward to allocate a significant portion of bonuses into foundations that invest in job training, housing subsidies, education assistance, disease prevention, environmental conservation or so many other worthy causes?
 Cynics may claim that such firms would have a harder time recruiting and retaining the best employees if cash bonuses were reduced. But I believe that many enormously bright, highly skilled people understand and value the balance between doing well and doing good.

Mara Natkins
Philadelphia, Dec. 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 How sad is it that nowhere in your article was there any indication that even a small percentage of the riches that ''have been rained upon the top bankers and traders'' would find its way to worthy causes. 
 Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett have set fine examples that these newly rich hedge fund analysts and private equity deal makers might want to consider following.

Stuart Zuckerman
New York, Dec. 26, 2006

To the Editor:
 Somewhere between ''A Lump of Coal Might Suffice'' (Sunday Business, Dec. 24) and ''Wall St. Bonuses: So Much Money, Too Few Ferraris'' (front page, Dec. 25), there is hope.
 These classic examples of greed should drive the final nail in the coffin of those who fear that raising America's minimum wage will do serious damage to our economy. 

Jim Nevins
Gulf Shores, Ala., Dec. 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 The war against the middle class is well under way. College graduates and longtime salaried executives face the harsh question of economic survival, while the Wall Street juggernaut rolls on. 
 The middle class, vital to the stability of democracy, is being trodden under the wheels of those $250,000 cars.

HEADLINE: Iran's Strong Ties With Syria Complicate U.S. Overtures 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Rasha Elass contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria 

 BODY:
Early next year, Syria's first domestically manufactured cars are scheduled to roll off an assembly line. They will have an Iranian name, be produced in a plant partly financed by a state-controlled Iranian car company and be made of parts from Iran.
 Not long after that, Syria hopes to open two new multimillion-dollar wheat silos, add 1,200 new buses in Damascus, open another Iranian car factory in the north and start operating a cement plant -- all in partnership with Iran. The two countries are also talking about building an oil refinery, opening a joint bank, constructing housing, developing electric generators and, someday, linking their rail systems through Iraq. 
As the White House begins to rethink its strategy for dealing with the Middle East, particularly how to calm the chaos in Iraq, pressure to try to re-engage Syria has grown. Some Western analysts contend that Syria, with a government more pragmatic than ideological, can be pried away from Iran's influence and convinced that its long-term interests lie instead with the West.
 But Washington has spent years trying to isolate Syria, while Iran has for decades moved to entwine itself with Syria on many levels -- political, military, economic and religious. 
 Iran is a country of many power centers with different pools of money, from funds controlled by grand ayatollahs of Qum, to those in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards. They may not all be directed by the central government, but they all help promote Iranian influence in Syria.
 As a result, some Western diplomats in Iran say that, even if the United States tried, it might be impossible to extricate Syria from Iran's orbit.
 ''Iranians have been working harder for longer than we realized,'' said a European diplomat based in Damascus who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Syrian officials. ''They have stronger links going back more years than we were aware of.''
 Syrian officials are extremely sensitive about the relationship with Iran. Part of the reason is fear of igniting sectarian tensions in Syria, which is about 80 percent Sunni Muslim. The president and his inner circle are from a minority Shiite sect, the Alawites, and Iran is Shiite. 
 While the Syrian power brokers have decided for practical reasons to align with Iran, political analysts in Syria say the government remains fearful of alienating the Sunni majority, especially amid widespread rumors that Iran is trying to convert Sunni Syrians to Shiism. 
 Concern among Sunnis is heightened because Syria is a major destination for Iranian religious tourists; as many as 500,000 a year visit Shiite sites in Syria. Iranian organizations have spent millions of dollars restoring, enlarging and maintaining Shiite shrines in Syria, from the center of Damascus, the capital, to the north, near the Turkish border.
 Iran's efforts to spread its influence around the Middle East have increased in the last two or three years, regional analysts say. They have been propelled by rising oil prices and American policies in the region, which have neutralized Iran's enemies, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
 ''Iran has used this affluence of oil revenues over the last five or six years to play a beautiful game, from their perspective,'' said Osama T. Elansari, a director of the Dubai International Financial Exchange who lives in Syria.
 Iran's efforts have often been most evident in Lebanon, where it has set up an informal economy in the south. It needs only to provide money to its proxy, Hezbollah, which has a construction arm, called Jihad al Bina, and a vast network of social services that dole out money and build schools and hospitals. 
 According to some estimates, Iran has spent tens of millions a month over the years in Lebanon. Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon's central bank, said he had no idea how much money Iran had sent into Lebanon because it had gone via Syria, not through the central bank. 
 ''Iranians bring in money donations over the border,'' he said. 
 In Lebanon, after Israel and Hezbollah fought for 34 days over the summer, Iran quickly delivered generators, and fuel, to villages without power, and was credited with providing the $12,000 that Hezbollah gave to each family whose home had been destroyed. 
 Iran offered an open checkbook to repair anything not covered by other sources -- including roads, mosques, schools and houses. While there is no guarantee Iran will deliver on that pledge, it is already way ahead in the battle for the hearts and minds of many Lebanese. 
 ''The Zionist enemy destroys and the Islamic Republic of Iran rebuilds,'' read banners in front of restored schools in Lebanon.
 In Syria, relations with Iran are more formal and less public, but no less consequential. Diplomats say, for example, that Iran has developed very close ties with Syrian intelligence, providing gear and training, and sharing listening posts to monitor Israel. Iran also has one of the largest embassies in Damascus, political analysts said, and has assigned an ambassador there who served for seven years as chief of staff to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
 The United States, by comparison, maintains economic sanctions on Syria and withdrew its ambassador in 2005 after the assassination of the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri. The highest-ranking American diplomat in Damascus, Michael H. Corbin, the deputy chief of mission, has little access to Syrian officials.
 But Iran's economic relationship with Syria is far more complicated than that with Lebanon. The Syrian economy is still struggling to overcome decades of corrupt central control, and to attract foreign investment and create jobs. Iran, meanwhile, has shifted in the other direction. 
 Iran's investments are relatively modest in value: just $120 million a year, the Syrian government says. But current and planned projects are considered significant.
 ''Iran is moving in the direction of investing in Syria, and of course Syria won't say no,'' said Samir Seifan, a Syrian economist in Damascus. ''For Iran, it's about business and about cementing political ties.''
 Iran's ambassador to Syria, Muhammad Hassan Akhtari, acknowledged that Iran had had trouble working in foreign markets. But he said the experience of the past 10 years -- especially in Syria -- had helped improve Iran's business practices. And he said that he was not worried that Syria would abandon Iran, or even try to alter relations with it.
 ''Syria remains very steady in their principles of foreign relations,'' he said. ''If the West wants to do something, we think they have to change their attitude.''

HEADLINE: Asian Quake Disrupts Data Traffic

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and WAYNE ARNOLD; Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Wayne Arnold from Singapore. Brad Stone contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Telecommunications across Asia were disrupted on Wednesday after an earthquake off Taiwan damaged undersea cables, jamming Internet services as voice and data traffic vied for space on smaller cables and slower satellite links. 
 The quake disrupted services in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, but a ripple effect was felt in other parts of the world. Many phone subscribers could not get through to Europe, regional telecommunications operators reported, as they raced to reroute their traffic to alternative lanes.
''We are seeing really massive outages in a spread of countries in East and Southeast Asia,'' said Todd Underwood, chief operations and security officer at the Internet monitoring firm Renesys. ''This is a much broader effect than you see in most natural disasters.'' 
 Financial companies and businesses in the region were hit hard, as online banking and communications between financial markets and traders were affected. The stock exchanges in Tokyo and Hong Kong said they were working without problems, and traders found ways to complete their transactions.
 The earthquake, which Taiwan authorities said registered a magnitude of 6.7, struck off the island's southern tip Tuesday evening. Several major cables were cut, according to telecommunications executives, including the Asia Pacific Cable Network, which links North and Southeast Asia, and the SEA-ME-WE-2 link, which stretches from South Korea around the Eurasian land mass to the Netherlands.
 Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest phone company, said that the quake had damaged two undersea cables off the Taiwan coast. The lines route calls and process Internet traffic for several Asian countries. China Telecom, China's biggest fixed-line telephone operator, said that the earthquake had affected lines ''from the Chinese mainland to places including the Taiwan area, the United States and Europe, and many have been cut.'' It also reported serious damage to Internet connections.
 PCCW, Hong Kong's main fixed-line telecommunications provider, said that several of its partly owned submarine cables had been damaged. With its data capacity reduced by half, PCCW cautioned that some Internet users in the region could experience congestion over the next several days. Both Singapore Telecommunications, Southeast Asia's top phone company, and its local rival, StarHub, reported slow access to Internet pages.
 Mr. Underwood said that after the earthquake struck, 3,000 Asian networks disappeared entirely from his company's tracking equipment. By comparison, 5,000 networks disappeared during the blackout of 2003 in the Northeast United States, he said. 
 Networks in the United States and Europe were not affected. However, many companies with subsidiaries, partners or manufacturers in Asia are finding their communications disrupted. ''The reality is the Internet is a global network, and it is fairly rare to find large organizations that don't do a significant amount of traffic to Asia,'' Mr. Underwood said.
 Experts in Taiwan and elsewhere said that repairs to undersea cables could take weeks, raising fears of more communications difficulties in Taiwan, the fifth-largest economy in Asia, and of more telephone and Internet problems in the region.
 ''This is a major event, and it's not going to get fixed fast,'' Mr. Underwood said. ''These cables are underwater. You have to get boats in place, they have to drag the cables until they find the break. The good news is that during earthquakes the breaks tend to happen close to land and are not really that deep. But the last underwater cable outage took six weeks to fix.''
 Analysts said it was fortunate that the breakdown occurred during the relatively quiet holiday period, with business activity light and markets mostly quiet. Such an interruption during an ordinary week could have had catastrophic impact on regional businesses, especially financial markets.
 Still, many securities traders in Hong Kong and Singapore were unable to obtain prices and complete orders because networks linking financial companies were disrupted. Dealers in the region said they have had difficulties accessing international news providers for information. They also reported that customers using the Internet for prices complained that they could not look up stock prices online. 
 That Internet traffic out of Southeast Asia was not cut off entirely was testimony to the progress made in recent years in adding capacity along new routes, executives said. But they said that most information sought by global Internet users remains in the United States, and Asia is linked to that information by only a handful of relatively fragile cables that are subject to forces on the ocean floor. Information can be transmitted by satellite, but it is slower and more expensive than sending it over cables.
 ''We do need these submarine cables,'' said Paul Budde, an analyst in Sydney. ''Satellite is not really an alternative for the heavy traffic. For the bulk, you do need these fat cables.''
 But most of Asia is separated by water, meaning data must be carried by undersea cables that rest on the seabed up to eight kilometers, or five miles, below the surface. Building such submarine cables is an expensive undertaking. By one estimate, it costs up to $500,000 a kilometer to lay undersea cables. As a result, most cables are owned by consortiums of telecommunications companies, which create joint pricing and share the cost of building and repairing the cables. 
 As recently as a decade ago, Asia was connected to the United States by only five cables, all through Japan. The dot-com boom ushered in a period of rapid expansion, and cables now connect Australia, China and South Korea directly to the United States. 
 In an attempt to add even more capacity to meet growing demand in Asia, Verizon Communications announced last week that it was joining with three Chinese carriers, a Taiwanese carrier and a South Korean carrier to build the Trans-Pacific Express, a $500 million, 18,000-kilometer network in the region.
 That will help telecommunications companies in the future, but their most immediate task is finding alternatives for delivering their customers' information until the undersea cables can be repaired.
 KDDI, Japan's major carrier for international calls, whose communications along undersea cables out of Japan went through Taiwan before reaching Southeast Asia and beyond, said that the use of alternative lines would limit the possibility of a complete breakdown in communications.
 In Seoul, the KT Corporation, South Korea's leading fixed-line and broadband service provider, rerouted ordinary telephone calls and data traffic, said Yeom Woo Jong, a KT spokesman. 
 ''This incident reminds telecommunications companies like us of the importance of acquiring alternative lines,'' Mr. Yeom said, ''to ensure undisrupted services during an emergency. It means investment and more cost.''

HEADLINE: Reversal of Fortune

BYLINE: By Barry Werth. 
Barry Werth is the author of ''31 Days: The Crisis that Gave Us the Government We Have Today.''

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, MASS. 

 BODY:
AMERICA got its first real impression of Gerald Ford on the steamy August morning 33 years ago when he took office as president, and most people instantly liked what they saw. Mr. Ford stood in the driveway of his suburban split-level house, hours before assuming a post he never sought and hoped to avoid having to fill. One of the questions he took was about Harry Truman's comment when he had the office abruptly thrust upon him. Mr. Truman said he felt that the moon, the stars and the planets had fallen on him.
 ''I think that's an apt description,'' Mr. Ford said. ''I can tell you better this afternoon after it actually happens.'' 
''Mrs. Ford hoped you would get out of politics. What is her response?'' 
 ''Well,'' Mr. Ford shook his head. ''She's just doing her best and we'll wait and see about the other.''
 Like Mr. Truman, President Ford was a seemingly ordinary Midwesterner, a career politician and party man dogged by low expectations and doubts -- suitable ''standby equipment,'' as Nelson Rockefeller called the vice presidency, but no one's idea of a commanding leader. 
 Still worse, he came into office not as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson had, inheriting the mantle of a popular fallen leader and with a supportive Congress, but replacing a disgraced and reviled figure and facing Democratic majorities in both houses, as well as right-wing rumblings about Richard Nixon's foreign and economic policies. By the time Mr. Nixon departed, Mr. Ford wrote, ''he had no mantle left.''
 Of necessity, President Ford devised a new one -- ''the mantle of the presidential center,'' The Washington Post's Lou Cannon called it. For a month, Mr. Ford set out not just to heal America's divisions but to expunge them. He moved hard to the center, determined, he wrote, ''to leave the right sputtering.'' 
 He chose Nelson Rockefeller as his vice president (over George H. W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, who both campaigned vigorously for the job), met with blacks and women, proposed partial amnesty for Vietnam-era draft resisters, and hewed to Mr. Nixon's realism in foreign affairs. The press corps extended him the benefit of the doubt, finding him refreshingly open and honest after Mr. Nixon, and his approval ratings soared -- literally, from nowhere -- to 70 percent.
 Then, one Sunday morning a month after moving into the Oval Office, he pardoned Mr. Nixon before the former president was indicted. With a pen stroke, a very different Ford presidency emerged. Though he said he was forgiving Mr. Nixon because the televised spectacle of a former president in the criminal dock would stir up ''ugly passions,'' the pardon instantly and inevitably looked like the last cynical act of the Watergate cover-up -- Mr. Nixon's hand-chosen successor giving him a free pass.
 The pardon was a political disaster for President Ford. His approval ratings plummeted, inviting attacks from not only the Democrats, but also the Republican right, which rallied around Ronald Reagan. 
 President Ford spent the remainder of his presidency trying to stave off the intraparty challenge that had suddenly emerged. Two weeks after the pardon, he appointed Mr. Rumsfeld as White House chief of staff, and Mr. Rumsfeld chose Dick Cheney, then 33, as his deputy. A year later, President Ford fired Defense Secretary James Schlesinger and replaced him with Mr. Rumsfeld, put Mr. Bush in charge of the C.I.A., forced Nelson Rockefeller off the 1976 ticket, and promoted Mr. Cheney to chief of staff. In that role, Mr. Cheney instituted a more centralized, secretive, Nixonian approach to presidential power, as he and Mr. Rumsfeld moved to replace President Ford's restraint and realism with a swaggering, messianic view of American might. If it all sounds familiar, it is.
 Unlike those he elevated to power, President Ford accepted accountability and showed uncommon political and personal courage. He announced his amnesty plan before the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars -- the toughest audience he could find -- telling reporters it would be ''a little cowardice'' to roll it out before a hand-picked crowd. 
 When it came out that Gen. Alexander Haig, President Nixon's chief of staff, went to Mr. Ford a week before the president's resignation proposing that he pardon him, Mr. Ford volunteered to testify before Congress, where he swore under oath, ''There was no deal, period, under no circumstances.'' Suspicion still lingers that President Ford telegraphed Mr. Nixon that he wouldn't face jail -- after the pardon discussion, according to a close Ford aide, he told General Haig to ''do whatever they decided to do'' to convince Mr. Nixon to step down. But he never complained publicly about his reversal of fortune in office. 
 President Ford believed that by pardoning Mr. Nixon, he was putting Watergate and the imperial presidency in the past. But by sacrificing his popularity, he also lost much of his mandate to address the aftermath of Watergate and Vietnam with moderation, bipartisanship and national humility -- the very goals he set out to achieve. Forced to the right, his administration spawned many of the core attitudes and key players of the George W. Bush White House.
 Mr. Ford didn't struggle for the presidency, didn't win it, but he was determined not to fail at it. His candor and decency helped restore America's faith in its institutions. It's regrettable that the pardon -- shadowed by ambiguity, politically catastrophic, and with a long tail extending to the heart of today's White House -- weighs so heavily on his legacy.

HEADLINE: Gerald R. Ford

 BODY:
Gerald R. Ford was an accidental president, his tenure brief, his legacy limited. Yet he was the right man summoned at the right time to begin the necessary process of healing a country exhausted by war abroad and scandal at home. Elevated to the nation's top job when Richard Nixon was forced by threat of impeachment to resign, he was everything his predecessor was not -- transparent and largely content with life as he found it. His many friends saw him as plain old ''Jerry,'' a get-along, go-along product of the House of Representatives whose self-assurance and modest ambitions perfectly suited a country that wanted little more than a few months' rest.
 Mr. Ford's unplanned and largely unsought rise up the American political ladder was assisted not once but twice by scandal. In 1973, when Spiro Agnew resigned the vice presidency after a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Mr. Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. ''We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,'' House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later. 
Which was fitting, because Mr. Ford was in essence a creature of Congress -- more precisely, of the House of Representatives, a place of perpetual compromise that encourages neither the vision that sometimes attaches to the Senate nor the managerial skills that come with being a governor. Michigan voters elected Mr. Ford 13 times, and of his 25 years in the House, he served eight as minority leader. He saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career.
 As president, Mr. Ford would have had little room in which to pursue lofty ambitions even if he had them. Domestically, he was bedeviled by inflation and then recession, and his effort to cure both embroiled him in constant combat with his old friends in Congress. Abroad, he had his hands full maintaining American power and sustaining detente with the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the collapse of Vietnam and Cambodia.
 But he judged, correctly, that his primary mission was to quiet national passions inflamed by war and Watergate -- to end, as he put it, ''our long national nightmare'' -- and in so doing to restore a measure of respect to the presidency itself. To that end he made several small gestures largely forgotten now but symbolically important at the time. He announced that he would be lenient to draft resisters, he opened the White House to people on Mr. Nixon's ''enemies list,'' and he crisscrossed the country endlessly, speaking to groups large and small in an effort to open up an office that Mr. Nixon had all but closed to public inspection.
 Yet his wish to heal led him to do something that reopened the very wounds he was trying hard to close. On Sept. 8, 1974, barely 30 days into his presidency, Mr. Ford announced his decision to give Mr. Nixon a ''full, free and absolute pardon.'' The reaction was immediate, intense and largely negative. Mr. Ford had expected criticism, but not the outrage that erupted in Congress, in many newspapers and among the public at large.
 This page, for example, condemned the pardon as ''a profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act'' that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's ''credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence.'' The critics' fundamental point was that a nation in which the law applies equally to rich and poor, the meek and the powerful, cannot exempt anyone, least of all a president, from the requirements of justice.
 History has been more sympathetic to Mr. Ford's argument that to allow Mr. Nixon's prosecution to go forward, perhaps all the way to a trial, would have been profoundly destabilizing to a nation that was already in shaky health. In 2001, the trustees of the John F. Kennedy Library honored Mr. Ford with its Profile in Courage Award for the decision, which Senator Edward Kennedy, a onetime critic, described as essential to the restoration of national unity. When Senate and House leaders bestowed on Mr. Ford and his wife, Betty, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, President Clinton -- who had his own experiences with prosecutors -- said the critics had been ''caught up in the moment,'' and that Mr. Ford's decision had helped ''keep the country together.''
 Our own bottom line continues to be the same: that the nation is strong enough to endure almost anything but burying the truth. Still, Mr. Ford deserves to be remembered for more than the pardon. Marking the end of a national nightmare is no small thing.

HEADLINE: Moscow Links Poisoning Inquiry to Yukos Case

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Scott Shane contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Russia's Prosecutor General's Office on Wednesday produced a startling new twist in the investigation of the killing of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer who died in London in November of radiation poisoning. It announced that it was investigating the possible involvement of former executives of Yukos Oil, the company dismantled by a prosecutorial assault last year.
 In a statement released Wednesday evening, the prosecutor's office said its investigation indicated a link between the poisoning of Mr. Litvinenko and criminal cases under way against Yukos executives. It singled out Leonid B. Nevzlin, a major shareholder and partner of the company's jailed chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. 
 The statement did not elaborate on any evidence that might link Mr. Nevzlin and others to Mr. Litvinenko's death, which was caused by a high dose of a radioactive material, polonium 210.
 The accusation nevertheless was an effort on the part of the Russian government to tie Mr. Litvinenko's death to accusations of a convoluted web of economic and other crimes that destroyed Yukos, once Russia's richest company.
 The prosecution of Yukos and Mr. Khodorkovsky was widely seen as a Kremlin-led campaign against a company seen as defiant of President Vladimir V. Putin and against a man seen as a potential political threat.
 A spokesman for Mr. Nevzlin, a close associate of Mr. Khodorkovsky who is wanted on charges in Russia and lives in self-imposed exile in Israel, dismissed the new accusations as a continuation of that campaign.
 ''We all know the methods of the K.G.B.,'' the spokesman, Amir Dan, said in a telephone interview, referring to the defunct Soviet security agency. ''The statement is ridiculous. It is not worth any comment.''
 When Mr. Litvinenko fell ill on Nov. 1, officials in Russia ridiculed the accusations of Russian involvement. But when he died on Nov. 23 from the effects of radioactive poisoning, investigators here agreed to assist British detectives, who visited for several days this month.
 The statement from the Prosecutor General's Office said the investigations of Yukos had now been combined with that of Mr. Litvinenko's killing.
 ''A version is being verified according to which the contractors of these crimes may be one and the same group of people whose names are on the international wanted list'' for committing grave crimes, the prosecutors' statement said. It specified Mr. Nevzlin as one of them but did not identify any others.
 Mr. Nevzlin has long evaded Russian requests for extradition -- a source of diplomatic irritation between Russia and Israel. On Sunday he arrived in the United States on vacation, Mr. Dan said, prompting new demands by the Russians that the Americans arrest him.
 A United States government official who has been briefed on the case and spoke on condition of anonymity because of privacy regulations said Mr. Nevzlin arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on Sunday and was questioned by Customs and Border Protection officers. He had a valid visa and was allowed into the country, the official said. A Justice Department spokesman said the department had no information about Mr. Nevzlin.
 The prosecutors' statement said Russia would prepare new requests for extradition, though it did not identify the countries to which the requests would be made.
 Mr. Nevzlin's name has surfaced in connection with the Litvinenko case before. He met with Mr. Litvinenko in the weeks before his poisoning, evidently in October. After Mr. Litvinenko's death, Mr. Nevzlin said that Mr. Litvinenko had provided him with a dossier that ''shed light on most significant aspects of the Yukos affair.''
 The dossier's contents remain unclear, but Mr. Nevzlin said he had provided them to British investigators. It was also unclear how Mr. Litvinenko, who fled Russia in 2000, could have come to possess incriminating information about a case that unfolded after his departure.
 In another aspect of the Litvinenko case, investigators in Germany discovered traces of polonium at places visited by Dmitry V. Kovtun, another businessman and former security officer who was one of two Russian businessmen who met Mr. Litvinenko in London on Nov. 1, the day he was evidently poisoned. 
 The traces found in Germany appeared to have been left in the days before Mr. Kovtun flew from Hamburg to London on that morning.
 Prosecutors here say they are investigating Mr. Kovtun's poisoning as an attempted murder committed in conjunction with Mr. Litvinenko's killing. That would suggest that Mr. Kovtun was a victim, not a suspect. 
 Mr. Kovtun is said to be in a Moscow hospital being monitored for symptoms of radiation poisoning, though his condition and whereabouts are shrouded in mystery. He and the other businessman, Andrei K. Lugovoi, were questioned by Russian and British investigators. Nothing is known of the nature of their responses.
 The man at the center of the Yukos affair, Mr. Khodorkovsky, the company's former chairman, has also come under new prosecutorial scrutiny. Convicted last year on charges of fraud and tax evasion that his supporters described as politically motivated, Mr. Khodorkovsky was transferred over the weekend from the remote Siberian prison where he was serving an eight-year sentence to a regional detention center in Chita.
 On Wednesday prosecutors preparing new criminal charges against him questioned him and his jailed business partner, Platon A. Lebedev, Mr. Khodorkovsky's lawyer said in a statement. The lawyer, Yuri M. Schmidt, said investigators accused his client of laundering money by making contributions to Open Russia, a social and educational charity Mr. Khodorkovsky founded. The authorities have since closed the charity.
 Mr. Schmidt said the timing of the new questioning amounted to ''moral and physical pressure'' on his client, whose current sentence does not end until 2012.

HEADLINE: President Gerald R. Ford, Who Led U.S. Out of Watergate Era, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By JAMES M. NAUGHTON and ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Former President Gerald R. Ford, who gently led the United States out of the tumultuous Watergate era but lost his own bid for election after pardoning former President Richard M. Nixon, died at 6:45 p.m. Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
 He was 93, making him the oldest former president, surpassing Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004, by just over a month. He became vice president after Spiro T. Agnew was forced to resign in October 1973, and 10 months later ascended to the presidency when Nixon stepped down, thus becoming the first person to serve as president without having been elected to that office or the vice presidency.
His death was announced late Tuesday night in a statement issued by his wife, Betty Ford, which gave no details. ''His life was filled with love of God, his family and his country,'' it said in part. 
 Further announcements from the Ford office yesterday gave no cause of death, but he had been in and out of the hospital since January 2006, most recently in October at the Eisenhower Medical Center for tests. He returned to his home in Rancho Mirage after five days of hospitalization. 
 Thrust by the Nixon resignation into an office he had never sought, Mr. Ford occupied the White House for just 896 days. But they were pivotal days of national introspection, involving the United States' first definitive failure in a war and the first resignation of a president. It was Mr. Ford's uncommon virtue to have presided with a common touch.
 ''He assumed power in a period of great division and turmoil,'' President Bush said in a statement broadcast early Wednesday morning. ''For a nation that needed healing, and for an office that needed a calm and steady hand, Gerald Ford came along when we needed him most. During his time in office, the American people came to know President Ford as a man of complete integrity who led our country with common sense and kind instincts.''
 After a decade of division over Vietnam and two years of trauma over the Watergate scandals, Jerry Ford, as he called himself, radiated a soothing familiarity. He might have been the nice guy down the street suddenly put in charge of the nation, and if he seemed a bit predictable, he was also safe, reliable and reassuring. He placed no intolerable intellectual or psychological burdens on a weary land, and he lived out a modest philosophy. ''The harder you work, the luckier you are,'' he said once in summarizing his career. ''I worked like hell.''
 When he took the oath of office at a quickly arranged ceremony at noon on Aug. 9, 1974, the economy was in disarray, an energy shortage was worsening, allies were wondering how steadfast the United States might be as a partner and Nixon, having resigned the presidency rather than face impeachment for taking part in the Watergate cover-up, was flying to seclusion in San Clemente, Calif. 
 There was a collective sense of relief as Mr. Ford, in the most memorable line of his most noteworthy speech, declared that day, ''Our long national nightmare is over.''
 Two years later, as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination and began a campaign that would end in his first failure in an election, Mr. Ford scarcely seemed to be indulging in hyperbole as he recalled what it had been like to take office as Nixon's heir.
 ''It was an hour in our history that troubled our minds and tore at our hearts,'' he said. ''Anger and hatred had risen to dangerous levels, dividing friends and families. The polarization of our political order had aroused unworthy passions of reprisal and revenge. Our governmental system was closer to stalemate than at any time since Abraham Lincoln took that same oath of office.''
 The pardon, intensely unpopular at the time, came to be generally viewed as correct. In May 2001, Mr. Ford was honored with a Profile in Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, spoke and said he had originally opposed the pardon. ''But time has a way of clarifying past events,'' he said, ''and now we see that President Ford was right.''
 Mr. Ford's decision to back the 1975 Helsinki Accords was furiously criticized in 1976 by both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. They complained that it had legitimized the post-World War II borders in Europe. But in his book ''The Cold War: A New History'' (Penguin, 2005), John Lewis Gaddis of Yale wrote that the pact's commitment to ''human rights and fundamental freedoms'' became a trap for the Soviet Union, which was facing ever-bolder condemnations by dissidents. 
 ''Thousands of people who lacked the prominence of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov began to stand with them in holding the U.S.S.R. and its satellites accountable for human rights,'' Mr. Gaddis wrote. The Helsinki process, he added, became ''the basis for legitimizing opposition to Soviet rule.'' 
 Mr. Ford also advanced negotiations for a new treaty to turn over control of the Panama Canal to Panama, though he slowed the process during the 1976 campaign and left it to Mr. Carter, his victorious Democratic opponent, to complete. 
 Both inflation and unemployment fell while he was in office. And he vigorously tried to control federal spending with vetoes of spending bills, starting his first week in office. In a matter of months, however, after the Democratic landslide in the 1974 elections, Congress began overriding his vetoes.
 But that did not stop him from threatening to veto a measure, sought by Mayor Abraham D. Beame and Gov. Hugh L. Carey, offering a 90-day $1 billion line of credit to nearly bankrupt New York City in October 1975. ''Ford to City: Drop Dead'' was the front-page headline in The Daily News. The next month, the New York leaders went to Washington with a new plan with new controls on the city budget, and they got the short-term loans they needed. 
 Mr. Ford brought to his duties an indomitable self-assurance.
 ''I can recall no incident, either in the Congress, vice presidency or presidency, where I didn't feel that I was prepared,'' he said in retirement. ''I felt more secure, more certain of myself in the presidency than at any other time.'' 
 His steadiness showed through as a timely presidential attribute, but it was always that way with Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. He was a man more fundamental than flashy, more immutable than immodest. He served undefeated through 13 elections to the House and rose to be its Republican leader, yet in 25 years in Congress he did not write a major piece of legislation. He was overwhelmingly confirmed as vice president, the first to be appointed under the 25th Amendment, yet he owed his selection by Nixon to the likelihood that he would prove inoffensive in the job.
 As president, he was quick to assert to Congress, in a play on words that nobody misunderstood, ''I am a Ford, not a Lincoln.''
 If it was true, as was often said, that the Oval Office shaped the occupant, Mr. Ford resisted the temptation of the imperial. On an early trip as president to South Korea, he called American enlisted men ''sir.'' His prose was so pedestrian and his tongue so unreliable -- he referred on one public occasion to the noble American ''work ethnic'' and on another to the disease of ''sickle-cell Armenia'' -- that he became a favorite target of comedians.

Acts of Forgiveness
 ''I think it's progress that the presidency has been humanized,'' Mr. Ford remarked a few days before he left the White House. It might easily have been an epitaph.
 He had sought to bind up the nation's wounds as much by instinct as by design. One of his earliest acts, combining courage with forgiveness, was to announce before a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that he favored leniency for Vietnam-era draft resisters. 
 When Congressional Democrats suggested that he had obtained Nixon's resignation by promising to pardon him, Mr. Ford did something presidents do not do: he went to Capitol Hill and testified, telling a House subcommittee, ''There was no deal, period, under no circumstances.''
 He invited to the White House individuals who had been excluded as political ''enemies'' in the lists kept by the Nixon administration. When Mr. Ford heard, as a Republican in Congress, that Nixon kept such a list, he said to an aide, ''Anybody who can't keep his enemies in his head has too many enemies.'' 
 His decision to grant a full and absolute pardon to his predecessor stunned the nation. After going to church the morning of Sept. 8, 1974, Mr. Ford went on national television to announce that there would be no formal judicial retribution against Nixon. Then, apparently untroubled by his decision, he played golf.
 ''I felt then, and I feel now, if I was going to do it, it had to be clean, sudden,'' Mr. Ford said months after he had left office. ''It was a part of the healing process.''
 He paused a moment, smiled, and added, ''It didn't turn out to be quite as much of a healing at the time.''
 Revulsion and disillusion exploded in editorial comments and angry telegrams to the White House. Mr. Ford's biographer and friend, J. F. terHorst, resigned as White House press secretary rather than defend the pardon. For the rest of his term, Mr. Ford had to do the defending.
 Those who were critical of the pardon, he said, ''haven't thought through what would have happened over the next 18 months, 24 months, 36 months; that whole episode would have been on the front page.'' 
 He had expected some public criticism, he said, but it proved ''far worse than I anticipated.'' He insisted, however, in his 1979 autobiography, ''A Time to Heal'' (Harper & Row), and in conversations in retirement, that had Nixon been required to face indictment and trial over the many months of the Ford presidency, ''all of the healing process that I thought was so essential would have been much more difficult to achieve.''

Hard Work, Honesty, Punctuality
 Mr. Ford's early circumstances made him an unlikely future president. He was born July 14, 1913, in Omaha to Leslie Lynch King and Dorothy Ayer King. Not for 17 years was he to learn that he had been christened Leslie Lynch King Jr.
 When he was 2, his mother divorced Mr. King and moved to Grand Rapids, Mich. She remarried, and her husband, Gerald Rudolph Ford, a paint salesman with an eighth-grade education, gave the boy his name in formally adopting him.
 Gerald considered his mother ''a human dynamo in a womanly way'' and revered his stepfather. Later in life, even in the White House, he would confront difficulty by wondering, ''Now, how would he have done this?'' What he respected in his stepfather's manner was common sense.
 His closeness to his stepfather was deepened, if anything, by the discovery that he was adopted and in particular by a brief encounter with his father.
 It occurred at the age of 17, when he was a star on the state champion South High School Trojans football team, a 6-foot, blue-eyed blond with a husky voice and an infectious laugh. His mother and stepfather had told Mr. Ford that he was the product of a broken home, and the information did not appear to disturb him unduly. He went on with his schooling and, because the Ford Paint and Varnish Company was struggling to survive the Depression, with a job waiting on tables at Bill Skougis's Restaurant. One day a patron in the restaurant stared at him and then told him, ''Leslie, I'm your father.''
 He was stunned.
 Nearly half a century later, recalling the episode in an interview, Mr. Ford spoke in words drenched in bitterness: ''It was shocking, in that he would intrude on a happy family life after he had neglected my mother and me by his refusal to pay what the court ordered him to pay as child support.'' 
 In his 1994 biography of Mr. Ford, ''Time and Chance'' (HarperCollins), James Cannon wrote that Mr. King never paid the monthly child support ordered by an Omaha court after it found that he had beaten his wife, but that Mr. King's father did pay the money his son owed. Those payments stopped when the elder Mr. King died, Mr. Ford wrote in his autobiography. 
 ''I really never forgave my father in a sense of totally forgiving,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview. 
 The home in which the future president was brought up, along with his three stepbrothers, was imbued with the values of family loyalty, thrift and patriotism. Not surprisingly, he became an Eagle Scout. 
 Mr. Ford ran for president of the senior class in 1931 on, as he later used to recall with a laugh, the Progressive ticket. He lost, but he was never to lose another election until he sought a different presidency 45 years later as more of a conservative.
 His basic philosophy involved fiscal prudence, strong national defense, suspicion of alien lands and a belief that citizens should earn a living rather than be given one. This, he said, was a legacy ''from both my stepfather and my mother -- hard-working, typical Middle Western individuals who had themselves been brought up in families that had comparable philosophical views.''
 Always a hard worker, he did well enough to win a scholarship to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He applied himself with equal diligence to his studies and to football, and he worked as a dishwasher at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity to help pay his room and board.

To Law School, Then to War
 In those days, both his professional and athletic ambitions were mixed. He said decades later that ''one of my great ambitions was to be captain of the Michigan football team,'' the Wolverines, in his senior year. But someone else was chosen as captain. Mr. Ford, a center, was instead selected by his teammates as the most valuable player.
 After he graduated from Michigan in 1935, he had offers to play professional football for either the Detroit Lions or the Green Bay Packers (at $110 per game). Mr. Ford remained fascinated with sports, ''but he chose the law, a subject that had appealed to him since high school. He enrolled at Yale Law School.
 Political opponents would ultimately fasten on Mr. Ford's sports background as a source of ridicule. President Lyndon B. Johnson, angered at a legislative development inspired by Representative Ford, cracked once that he had played football too long without a helmet. And despite his real skill at skiing and golf, a tumble on the slopes or a tee shot drive into a golf gallery would be seized on by the comedy show ''Saturday Night Live'' as a metaphor for a clumsy presidency.
 If Mr. Ford's mental cast was more often instinctive than imaginative and his approach to issues more tactical than conceptual, he was no intellectual slouch. At Yale, Prof. Myres McDougal wrote in interview notes on the young student: ''Very mature, wise person of good judgment. Informational background not the best but interesting, mature and serious of purpose.'' 
 Initially, because he needed the income of an assistant football coach and a head boxing coach, Mr. Ford was so busy that he was not allowed to take law classes full time. He kept insisting he was capable of the dual schedule and was so persistent that he was allowed to become student and coach simultaneously in 1938. He finished in the top third of the class of 1941, with a B average. 
 He returned to Grand Rapids, and with a friend, Philip W. Buchen, who would later become his White House legal counsel, he set about establishing a practice specializing in labor-management matters. Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the Navy as an ensign.
 The war, more than anything else, was responsible for altering Mr. Ford's outlook and inspiring him to pursue a career in public life.
 At first, the Navy assigned him as a physical training officer to work with recruits on the grounds of the University of North Carolina. Mr. Ford kept applying for a transfer to a combat zone and kept being denied. Ever persistent, he applied anew and after a year of rejection was sent to the Pacific as a physical education officer on the light aircraft carrier Monterey.
 By war's end he had risen to lieutenant commander and won 10 battle stars for participating in engagements at places like Okinawa, Wake, Taiwan, the Philippines and the Gilbert Islands. Just before Christmas in 1944, he nearly lost his life when a typhoon struck the Third Fleet and, topside on the carrier, he came within inches of being swept off the deck.

An Internationalist Takes Office
 Mr. Ford never adopted the domestic liberalism of a Roosevelt or, later, a Johnson. But the war experience broadened his view, changing him ''from a passive isolationist to an ardent internationalist,'' as he put it.
 Having re-established himself in a comfortable law practice in Grand Rapids, Mr. Ford had a limited ambition at first. ''I was 33, single, working and having a great time, playing lots of golf,'' he said later. ''All I was interested in was enjoying life and getting on with my law practice.'' 
 But he kept reading a new magazine, World Report, to which he was a charter subscriber, and became an ever firmer advocate of the Marshall Plan of postwar assistance to Europe and an internationalist in a community of Dutch-origin conservative isolationists. He came to the attention of two forces -- Republican reformers bent on taking control of the local party, and internationalists allied with Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, the Republican leader, who was also from Grand Rapids.
 The congressman from the Fifth District was Bartel J. Jonkman, who seemed tailored to the district: of Dutch descent, Republican, conservative, isolationist.
 ''I knew I was meeting a formidable incumbent,'' Mr. Ford later recalled, ''who for many reasons should have won. And I shouldn't have expected to win.''
 Mr. Ford did expect to win, though, and with but a smidgen of apprehension that the challenge might be taken up, he dared Mr. Jonkman to debate. ''Fortunately, he did not,'' Mr. Ford said.
 Aided by President Harry S. Truman's disputes with Congress that kept Mr. Jonkman in Washington, Mr. Ford worked tirelessly and won the Republican primary in 1948 by nearly 10,000 votes. Then he easily won his first term in the House. He never received less than 60 percent of the vote during a quarter-century as the representative from the Fifth District.

A Candid Helpmate
 Shortly before the 1948 election, Mr. Ford paused from his campaigning to march down the aisle of Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids -- by local legend, wearing one black shoe and one brown -- with Elizabeth Bloomer Warren, who had been divorced and was generally regarded as the most attractive single woman in the city.
 Betty Ford had been a model and a fashion coordinator. For two years, in New York City, she had danced in Martha Graham's troupe. She was, and remained throughout Mr. Ford's public career, a remarkably open and candid woman, given to strong opinions on abortion, feminism and other issues and willing to talk about the radical mastectomy she underwent while in the White House. She encouraged the same outspokenness in the four Ford children: Michael Gerald, John Gardner (known as Jack), Steven Meigs and Susan Elizabeth.
 Besides his wife and children, Mr. Ford's survivors include his half brother, Richard Ford of Grand Rapids and Naples, Fla.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
 Mrs. Ford battled drug dependency, which began in the 1960s with prescriptions for pills to relieve pain from a neck injury, and alcoholism, which grew with her loneliness during Mr. Ford's increasingly heavy travel schedule. In 1978, her family confronted her about her addictions, and, after initial denials, she finally admitted herself for treatment. Four years later, she helped dedicate the Betty Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation in Rancho Mirage, on the campus of Eisenhower Medical Center.
 While Mrs. Ford reared their children, Mr. Ford rose doggedly from the obscurity of the House to the leadership of its minority. In his second term he won assignment to the Appropriations Committee, where he and other fiscal conservatives worked to curb government spending. By 1953 he was on influential subcommittees like those dealing with money for foreign aid and national defense; throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars he was a stalwart supporter of American military intervention in Asia.
 Bud Vestal, a reporter for The Grand Rapids Press, distressed Mr. Ford by noting in a biography that Mr. Ford ''never authored a major program of legislation on his own.''
 Mr. Ford's explanation was that as a member of the Appropriations Committee, he ''was pretty preoccupied with very important matters'' and ''didn't have time, just as a pragmatic thing, to get involved in all the other pieces of legislation that others were writing or sponsoring or working for.''
 His legislative activity more often than not involved fealty to Republican Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Nixon or obstruction of the liberal New Frontier and Great Society proposals of Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. For instance, Mr. Ford voted against a major housing assistance act in 1961 and fostered opposition to the Medicare program in 1965.
 In a Congress that often seemed akin to a fraternity, he was nearly everyone's friend. He was thus an ideal prospect for minority leadership. When younger Republicans were casting about in 1963 for a point man in their rebellion against their aging leaders, they settled on Jerry Ford.
 The group installed Mr. Ford as chairman of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking post in the minority hierarchy. His name came to more prominent attention later that year when President Johnson appointed Mr. Ford to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. In 1965, after the huge loss that came with Senator Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat for the presidency the year before, the younger Republicans deposed Charles A. Halleck of Indiana as their House leader, supplanting him with Mr. Ford.

'I Need Your Vote'
 With the exception of an ill-conceived effort in 1970 to impeach Justice William O. Douglas, a liberal member of the Supreme Court, Mr. Ford generally enlarged his circle of friends by establishing an amicable style of leadership.
 When one or another Republican voted against the leadership's wishes, some party stalwarts sought to persuade Mr. Ford to discipline the offender. There were methods that might have been used: transfer to a minor committee, elimination of money for overseas travel, loss of campaign money. Mr. Ford said no. 
 ''That's counterproductive,'' he insisted. ''That person knows that he disappointed you. To rub it in makes it, the next time, literally impossible to get his cooperation. You can lose one battle, but the most important thing is to win the war.''
 A leading House Democrat of the era, Representative Joe D. Waggoner Jr. of Louisiana, confirmed the technique's success. ''It's the damnedest thing,'' Mr. Waggoner said. ''Jerry just puts his arm around a colleague or looks him in the eyes and says, 'I need your vote,' and gets it.''
 Mr. Ford, as Republican House leader, worked to enlarge the minority, always pursuing the elusive dream of a Republican majority and, with it, the realization of his greatest political ambition, to be speaker of the House.
 Asked in his retirement why he had coveted the speaker's post, he replied:
 ''I thought, as a member of Congress, that would be the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the history of mankind, I think, in an efficient and effective way, to tend to the people's business, both domestic and foreign, to make sure, whatever legislation was required, to see that it was done. I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives.''
 For a decade he crisscrossed the country, downing chicken dinners in 200 or so cities each year, extolling this or that prospect for a House seat and trying diligently to build a majority. But the closest the Republicans came in his years as leader was the 192 seats they held after the 1968 elections. That was still 16 short of the majority that would have made him speaker.
 Apparently destined to be the perennial leader of a minority, Mr. Ford promised his wife in 1973 that he would make one more effort, in 1974 at winning a majority and would then retire from politics in 1976.
 ''I don't want to be a minority leader in perpetuity,'' he told friends.
 On the night of Oct. 10, 1973, a few hours after Vice President Agnew rose in a federal courtroom in Baltimore to plead no contest to a charge of federal income tax evasion and simultaneously resigned the vice presidency, Mr. Ford was at his home in Alexandria, Va., trying to relax. The telephone rang; it was his old House ally Melvin Laird, now a White House counselor. Would Mr. Ford be interested in the vice presidency if it could be arranged? Mr. Laird asked.
 ''I suspect if I was asked, I would accept it,'' Mr. Ford replied.
 He turned from the phone, he later recalled, and told Mrs. Ford that ''well, that would be a nice conclusion'' for his career.
 The next night President Nixon was the one who telephoned Mr. Ford's home. He offered the vice presidency.
 It was the first time that anyone had been nominated for the office under the terms of the 25th Amendment, which made the appointment subject to confirmation by both the Senate and the House. Much as Republicans had fixed on Mr. Ford as leader in 1965 because of his general acceptability, so Nixon chose him in 1973 to be vice president. 
 At the time, in late 1973, Nixon was locked in a legal duel with the Watergate special prosecutor and the Senate Watergate committee, refusing to yield documents and tape recordings that had been subpoenaed. Indeed, a few days after Mr. Ford was nominated for the vice presidency, Nixon dismissed Archibald Cox, the first special prosecutor, for insisting on pursuing legal remedies to gain access to the White House evidence, and accepted the resignation of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson, who had declined to carry out the order to dismiss the prosecutor.

'I Believed What I Was Told'
 There were Nixon allies who thought Mr. Ford might, as vice president, serve as a buffer against the efforts to impeach Nixon that were precipitated by the events of that ''Saturday night massacre'' in October 1973. Nixon remarked once to former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, ''Can you see Gerald Ford sitting in this chair?'' 
 Mr. Ford accepted the nomination. ''I thought,'' he later reminisced, ''well, if I could be helpful, I knew I could be confirmed. And it was a nice way to end a career. I wasn't going to be speaker.'' 
 He took it on faith, because he had been told privately by Nixon and others that the president was innocent of any involvement in the burglary at the Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972, or of complicity in the effort to cover up the extent of the conspiracy.
 Three days after the break-in, Mr. Ford had asked John N. Mitchell, the former attorney general and the 1972 Nixon campaign chairman, if the break-in had been authorized. As Mr. Ford recalled it, Mr. Mitchell ''looked me right in the eye and said neither he nor the White House was involved.''
 ''I believed what I was told,'' Mr. Ford once said, referring to the belief that Nixon was not involved in Watergate wrongdoing, ''so my whole conduct as vice president was predicated on that personal trust.''
 Because it was the first such occasion, Mr. Ford's vice-presidential nomination prompted an extensive investigation of his background by as many as 400 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His nomination was confirmed, 92 to 3 in the Senate and 387 to 35 in the House. At dusk on Dec. 6, 1973, to the thunderous applause of those with whom he had served in Congress, he strode down the center aisle in the House of Representatives to stand at the lectern, not as speaker but as vice president.
 Mr. Ford took it upon himself as the heir apparent to try, initially, to make certain that Nixon would remain in office. In the eight months of his vice presidency he traveled more than 130,000 miles to speak up for Nixon.
 As the House Judiciary Committee painstakingly assembled evidence on which its members would ultimately recommend three articles of impeachment, Mr. Ford proclaimed confidence in Nixon's blamelessness, but privately he grew increasingly uncertain.

Growing Skepticism
 The doubt was slow to take hold. In January 1974 Mr. Ford told an audience in Atlantic City that the impeachment movement was the work of ''extreme partisans'' who were trying to ''crush the president'' and in the process increase the Democratic majority in the Congress.
 Alarmed, Mr. Buchen, Mr. Ford's old friend from Michigan, and Senator Robert P. Griffin, another longtime Michigan ally, privately counseled Mr. Ford to be careful lest his faith be unrewarded and his loyalty further divide the country.
 Thereafter, Mr. Ford loyally defended the president, but in his own words. The Nixon staff kept sending proposed texts to Mr. Ford's office, but Mr. Ford's aides toned them down.
 Instinctively, too, Mr. Ford continuously and openly urged the president to demonstrate his innocence by yielding to Congress and the courts the Watergate tape recordings and documents that were being sought. When Nixon continued to ''stonewall,'' as the resistance came to be known, ''it certainly began to raise some reservations'' in Mr. Ford's mind, he said, although he kept them to himself.
 Gradually, even Mr. Ford's defense of Nixon began to take a skeptical tone. At a Republican Party conference in Chicago, Mr. Ford explicitly attacked for the first time the attitude of the 1972 Nixon campaign organization, saying that it had been led by ''an arrogant, elite guard of political adolescents.''
 At the end of July 1974, Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., then the White House chief of staff, made an urgent call to the vice president. General Haig advised him that a tape recording under subpoena by the special prosecutor -- one of several that the Supreme Court had ruled could not be withheld by Nixon -- would show conclusively that Nixon had tried to curb the Watergate investigation as early as June 23, 1972, six days after the break-in.
 ''That was the first concrete evidence that I had contrary to the assurances I'd had before,'' Mr. Ford remembered. 
 For three days, as Nixon's aides sought to persuade the president to make public the transcript of the June 23 tape, Mr. Ford continued to travel, saying nothing of the evidence.
 The president did publish it. Although Mr. Ford was unaware that Mr. Buchen and others had begun making secret preparations for a Ford presidential transition, he began to wonder in the first days of August 1974 how soon he might be president.
 On Aug. 6, Nixon assembled his cabinet at the White House and declared that he would not resign. Mr. Ford, seated opposite the president across the huge cabinet table, told Nixon, ''I no longer can publicly defend you.'' It was, for Mr. Ford, the loyal friend of the president, one of the most difficult things he had ever done, but, he told an interviewer, ''with the development of the evidence, I had no other choice.''
 Two nights later Nixon announced on national television that he would resign the presidency at noon on Aug. 9.
 Mr. Ford and his wife watched the Nixon statement on the television set in the family room of their home in Alexandria. Then, despite the looming accumulation of pressures, Mr. Ford went to sleep. 
 That he could do so, with no particular difficulty, on the eve of the nation's most unusual presidential transition, was illustrative. ''My feeling is you might as well get to sleep'' whatever the circumstances, Mr. Ford had said. ''You'll feel better the next day. If you've got a problem, you are better prepared to deal with it tomorrow. You sure can't do much about it that night. It's a blessing, really.'' 
 The nation's torment was on his mind as he spoke that next day, Aug. 9, 1974, of the import of his sudden inauguration as the 38th president of the United States.
 ''I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots,'' he said to the dignitaries in the East Room of the White House and to the millions of Americans watching on television. ''I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it.''
 With an empathy that came as a relief after months of White House aloofness, the new president said: ''This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts. Therefore, I feel it my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. Not an inaugural address. Not a fireside chat. Not a campaign speech. Just a little straight talk among friends.''
 He urged his countrymen to help him ''bind up the internal wounds of Watergate'' and then added: 
 ''My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule.''

The Man in the White House
 Mr. Ford's presidency was an extension of his own political personality: reactive rather than activist, instinctive instead of intellectual, humanistic but within the fiscal limits of conservative dogma.
 Mr. terHorst, the biographer, puzzled over the seeming contradiction between the president's personal and professional philosophies: ''The problem with him -- he doesn't like to be kidded about it -- but the fact is, this guy would, if he saw a school kid in front of the White House who needed clothing, if he was the right size, he'd give him the shirt off his back, literally. Then he'd go right in the White House and veto the school lunch bill.''
 John Hersey, after spending a week in close observation of the president, wrote in The New York Times Magazine of April 20, 1975, ''What is it in him?''
 ''Is it an inability to extend compassion far beyond the faces directly in view?'' Mr. Hersey wrote. ''Is it a failure of imagination? Is it something obdurate he was born with, alongside the energy and serenity?''
 The answer seemed to be a belief -- one Mr. Ford was schooled in if not born with -- in the essential dignity of human struggle. ''Everything didn't turn to gold just because I did it,'' he remarked. ''I had this foundation, and I had been brought up with the training that -- and this is an oversimplification, but I think it's indicative -- the harder you work, the luckier you are. And whether it was in such things as the Boy Scouts or athletics or academics, I worked like hell.''
 There were those who contended, as did Richard Reeves, the author of a critical biography, that Mr. Ford had a ''tragic gap'' in his understanding of such crucial matters as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. More common was the assessment of Mr. Ford as ''innately decent.''
 Mr. Ford disputed the notion that it required forceful, even harsh, character to meet the tests of the White House. He was asked once if a nice guy should be president, and answered: ''Those who allege that you've got to be a mean, sinister, devious person to be president are just dead wrong. I don't see how a president in his conscience could be that.''
 He, too, could be forceful. He resented the accident of fate that had made him president as the nation watched South Vietnam and Cambodia -- where so much of America's human and economic treasure had been spent by three predecessors -- fall to the Communists in 1975. Rebuffed by Congress when he sought a last-minute $972 million in aid to Saigon, Mr. Ford made it possible for 130,000 or more refugees to come to the United States.
 When the Cambodian Communists seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in May 1975, Mr. Ford reacted with uncharacteristic emotion, sending United States military forces to recapture the ship.
 The order was motivated in part by concern for national image. ''We had just pulled out of Vietnam, out of Cambodia,'' Mr. Ford said later, ''and here the United States was being challenged by a group of leaders who were bandits and outlaws, in my opinion, and I think their subsequent record has pretty well proved it. And it was an emotional decision to tell the Defense Department we had to go in there and do something.''
 Mr. Ford's economic policies were traditional for Republican conservatives. He proclaimed, amid considerable White House ballyhoo, a campaign to ''Whip Inflation Now,'' complete with ''WIN'' buttons. Scarcely had it begun than mounting joblessness and the worst recession since the 1930s caused Mr. Ford to abandon the anti-inflation program and propose tax cuts to stimulate the economy instead of tax increases to dampen it.
 Congress, meanwhile, reflected its dominance by the Democratic Party in a steadily increasing number of spending programs and expansion of the federal deficit.
 In what may have been his most difficult personal decision -- because it went against the grain of his personality -- the genial man from Michigan also acted forcefully in his dismissal of Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger.
 There were no known policy differences of consequence between Mr. Ford and Mr. Schlesinger. But their styles and characters never quite proved compatible, and the defense secretary, a bookish and occasionally dogmatic intellectual who later became Secretary of Energy to President Jimmy Carter, got on the president's nerves.
 ''There was a tension,'' Mr. Ford acknowledged later. ''There was a personality problem.'' Mr. Schlesinger, he stressed, ''is an honorable, decent person, but our chemistry doesn't fit.'' He did not need to add but did, ''I'm not one that likes to fire people.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Ford did make another central personnel decision that troubled him: jettisoning Vice President Rockefeller from his 1976 campaign ticket. Mr. Ford did so even though he had declared, in nominating the former New York governor to be his vice president, that there was no one else in the country so well equipped to stand next in the line of presidential succession.
 Mr. Ford eventually decided to seek a full term as president, something he had intimated in his testimony to Congress as nominee for vice president that he would be loath to do. He decided that a lame-duck president could not be effective in a political role. Besides, although he did not like to admit it, Mr. Ford and his wife had grown to like the perquisites of the White House.
 As a candidate to succeed himself -- and, he hoped, thus legitimize his accidental presidency -- Mr. Ford grew politically timid. It was apparent that he would be challenged for the Republican nomination by Reagan, the former governor of California and a politician far more conservative than Mr. Ford.
 Mr. Ford responded by becoming ever more conservative in his political statements and by undertaking the same sort of aggressive, energetic campaigning as an incumbent that had marked his campaigns as a member of the House of Representatives. From early 1975 until the summer of 1976, Mr. Ford traveled from one corner of the country to another. Even two attempts on his life by unbalanced women in California in 1975 did not deter him.
 On one of those trips, to Sacramento on Sept. 5, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by Lynette Fromme, who had been a follower of the convicted killer Charles Manson. Mr. Ford was moving through a crowd in Capitol Park, shaking hands and waving, when a Secret Service agent saw Ms. Fromme's arm and the pistol. She was subdued, and it turned out that while the gun was loaded there was no bullet in the chamber. She was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison.
 The other attempt, by Sara Jane Moore, took place in San Francisco. A former marine, Oliver W. Sipple, knocked a pistol out of Ms. Moore's hand as she fired. 
 By the time Mr. Ford narrowly won the Republican nomination in Kansas City, Mo., in August 1976, he seemed to many of his political advisers to have diminished the value of his incumbency by traveling so extensively as to seem only another candidate. He was more than 25 percentage points behind the Democratic nominee, Mr. Carter, in the opinion polls. The economy was improving but not good. The Republicans' identification with Nixon remained.
 Mr. Ford reassessed the situation with his advisers. Together they altered his political strategy and style. He spent most of the campaign period hunched over his desk or greeting guests in the Rose Garden of the White House, trying to reinforce the image of incumbency and to stress his claims to having achieved ''peace, prosperity and trust.'' 

Strides, Then a Stumble
 In one of the most remarkable political comebacks in presidential campaign history, Mr. Ford nearly overcame adversity and odds. One late stumble, insisting in a debate that ''there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe'' and that Poland was not ''dominated by the Soviet Union,'' halted the Ford surge. 
 In the end, his loss to Mr. Carter, a former Georgia governor, was narrow, by only 1,682,970 votes. Mr. Ford had 48 percent and Mr. Carter 50.1 percent.
 But neither Poland nor a last-minute bit of bad economic news was central to his defeat. The Nixon pardon was.
 Stuart Spencer, Mr. Ford's campaign manager, said that polling data about the pardon had made it clear that ''it cost him the election.'' He said 7 percent of Republicans had either voted for Mr. Carter or stayed home because of the pardon, and it hurt with Democrats and independents, too.
 Mr. Ford's political recovery, although incomplete, reflected a positive aspect of his brief presidency. It indicated the extent to which he seemed to have re-established a sense of trustworthiness in the nation's most visible and symbolic office.
 One political aide said of those who voted for Mr. Ford: ''They're voting for something solid -- a simple, honest, decent man.''
 In the years after he left the White House, Mr. Ford took on two new roles, senior statesman and newly arrived millionaire, with his characteristic easygoing manner and energy.
 He had become something of a one-man academic, political and business enterprise, and by 1983 his income was estimated to be more than $1 million a year.
 Mr. Ford frequently criticized President Carter on economic and defense matters, but the attacks on his successor never grew bitter or personal. On some foreign policy issues, like the Panama Canal treaties, which his own administration had quietly sought, he supported his successor.
 For three years Mr. Ford contemplated another race for the presidency. In 1975, he had told aides in the White House that ''Reagan would be a disaster'' as president. After Reagan won the 1980 New Hampshire primary, Mr. Ford told The New York Times that it would be ''impossible'' for Reagan to win a general election, and he cautiously invited Republicans to ask him to run again. 
 But the draft he invited never came, and Reagan cruised to the nomination. When the Republicans gathered in Detroit in 1980 to nominate Reagan, he asked Mr. Ford to be his running mate. 
 For hours, representatives of the two men, with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger acting for Mr. Ford, negotiated the outlines of a possible Reagan-Ford administration, in which Mr. Ford would have been given extensive authority in making appointments and managing the executive branch. But the negotiators were unable to reach a formula that satisfied Mr. Ford's desire to be more than a traditional vice president while also giving Reagan a free hand to govern as chief executive.
 Mr. Ford nevertheless worked on the 1980 campaign trail for Reagan and his running mate, George Bush.
 Two months after the inauguration, Reagan sent Mr. Ford as his representative to China to reassure leaders there that Washington wished to continue improving relations. 
 The next October, after President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt was assassinated, Mr. Ford represented the United States at the funeral along with the two other former presidents, Mr. Carter and Nixon.
 In August 2000, Mr. Ford appeared at the Republican convention in Philadelphia but was hospitalized for a week after a stroke.
 As a result of Mr. Ford's new income, the Fords enjoyed a way of life that contrasted with their modest existence when he was a congressman, establishing homes in Rancho Mirage, in the California desert, and at Vail, in the Colorado mountains. 
 In addition to attending fund-raising functions, teaching at the University of Michigan and giving 30 paid speeches a year, Mr. Ford bought interests in two Colorado radio stations and served on the boards of at least eight corporations. 
 He also supervised and participated in sporting events, mostly golf, including an invitational golf tournament bearing his name in Vail; promoted a Southern California real estate development; and helped advertise a commercially minted coin set commemorating the presidency.
 He even made his acting debut at the age of 70, portraying himself on an episode of the nighttime television soap opera ''Dynasty.''
 Asked in an 1978 interview about his life in retirement, Mr. Ford said that he was having trouble with chipping and putting in his golf game, but otherwise, ''everything is wonderful.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Release of Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street stalled yesterday after a battery of reports indicated the economy was stronger than expected and raised concerns that the Federal Reserve might be more aggressive about interest rates next year.
 There has been speculation in the market that Fed policy makers may be ready to cut interest rates as the economy moderated. Investors apparently thought that the possibility of a cut was lessened by reports yesterday showing more strength than expected in existing-home sales, consumer sentiment and manufacturing in the Midwest.
Moreover, the reports suggested to some that central bankers might even have to raise rates. This caused a sell-off in bonds, and stifled a stock market surge that pushed the Dow Jones industrials past the 12,500 mark for the first time on Wednesday. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.05 points, or 0.07 percent, to 12,501.52, after reaching a new intraday trading high of 12,529.88.
 Broader stock indicators slipped. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index decreased 2.11 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,424.73. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.65 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,425.57.
 Analysts said that investors remained positive. Volume was thin, typical for the week between Christmas and New Year, which means that price swings can be exaggerated. The market's real response could come next week, when most of Wall Street gets back from vacation.
 ''You'd expect some kind of correction after these reports, and the fact we're not getting one shows Wall Street is pretty bullish,'' said Ryan Detrick, equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''With the market going up and not too many sellers out there, we could stay at these levels until we get back next week.''
 Bond yields have fallen to record lows in the last few months, but began to rebound on Wednesday after a better-than-expected government report on new-home sales suggested the housing slump could be at the bottom of its decline. It was the first sign this week that the economy might be expanding instead of moderating.
 The three economic reports yesterday continued to push rates higher, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 4.68 percent, from 4.65 percent. The price, which moves in the opposite direction of the yield, dropped 8/32 to 99 17/32.
 Oil prices rose after the Energy Department said in its weekly inventory report that crude supplies dropped by eight million barrels last week. The rise was limited, though, by greater gasoline and heating oil supplies and lagging demand for heating fuels.
 A barrel of light crude oil rose 19 cents, to $60.53, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 With little in the way of corporate news, Apple Computer fell amid reports of a federal investigation into the possible forgery of documents to bolster executives' profit. The chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, was reported in The Financial Times to have received 7.5 million stock options in 2001 without proper board approval. Its shares fell 65 cents, to $80.87.

HEADLINE: Homeowners Cut Prices, Drawing Some Buyers Back

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The sales rate for previously owned homes rose in November for the second straight month, an industry group said yesterday, as homeowners eager to unload their properties in a crowded market cut their prices.
 The group, the National Association of Realtors, reported that sales of existing homes increased 0.6 percent over October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million. But sales remained significantly behind last year's levels, falling 10.7 percent from November 2005.
The median price, the midpoint of prices for homes sold, dropped to $218,000 in November, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier. 
 Economists said falling prices -- November was the fourth consecutive month in which the price of a previously owned home declined year over year -- were starting to draw back buyers who had been wary after years of double-digit home price increases.
 ''Prices coming down are bringing people back to the marketplace,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors association. ''That's bad news for people who own houses, but it's working.''
 While recent signs have led some economists to speculate that the worst of the housing slump has passed, many, including those at the Realtors association, are taking a wait-and-see approach. 
 ''Maybe we've hit bottom,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''I'll need another month before I can get comfortable with that statement.''
 Still, the back-to-back monthly increases in sales of previously owned homes, coupled with a report Wednesday showing a rise in sales of new homes in November, suggests to some economists that the housing decline is starting to stabilize.
 Gary Bigg, an economist with Bank of America, said in a research note that the housing reports from this week suggest ''that housing demand has firmed, albeit at a lower level than in 2005.'' 
 The upturn last month in sales of previously owned homes was largely a result of a 6 percent rise in the Northeast that offset flat sales in the Midwest and a 1.6 percent decline in the South. Sales in the West rose 0.8 percent. 
 Median prices declined in each region of the country, led by the Midwest, where it fell 3.5 percent, to $165,000, from a year earlier. Prices in the South fell 3.2 percent, to $179,000. In the Northeast, they were down 2.2 percent, at $269,000, and the West was down 0.8 percent, at $351,000.
 In the months ahead, selling off the huge supply of unsold homes will be crucial to determining whether the housing market will rebound, analysts said.
 In November, the time it would take to sell all the existing homes on the market fell to 7.3 months, down from 7.4 months in October. The October number represented the biggest backlog of single-family homes since May 1993.
 ''We still need to clear a huge amount of inventory,'' said David Kelly, an economist with Putnam Investments. 
 While a decline in residential construction lopped more than one percentage point off the nation's gross domestic product in the third quarter, strength in other areas of the economy has prevented the housing slowdown from becoming too much of a drag. 
 ''The encouraging sign is that the rest of the economy is O.K.,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''And we're really running out of time for housing to hurt the rest of the economy.''
 Yesterday, a pair of economic reports suggested that the economy outside of housing is on sturdy footing.
 The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose this month to the highest level since April. And a report on business activity in the Midwest showed an increase this month, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. Last month, the report showed a contraction in business activity for the region.

Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first two installments of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, these productions pulse with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast that includes Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'BECOMING ADELE' Eric Houston's one-woman show about a young Brooklyn waitress's journey to self-actualization imagines a New York where fairy tales are possible even for the very ordinary. The sentiment is heavy and thick, but Kimberly Stern's performance burrows through it to deliver moving moments (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante)

'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)

'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)

'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)

'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugge's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)

'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

Spectacles

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30); closing tomorrow. The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Gates)

'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'CIRCUS OZ' Welcome holiday entertainment (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Van Gelder)

'A CRAZY SOUND' The Italian avant-gardist Dario D'Ambrosi offers a jaunty, unexpectedly feel-good musical about the mentally ill (1:15). La MaMa's Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) It's bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Tuesday. (Isherwood)

'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)

* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (John Rockwell)

'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000; closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)

* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

' 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE' Five prominent writers -- Christopher Durang, Mac Wellman, Elizabeth Swados, Roger Rosenblatt and Len Jenkin -- toss off short plays inspired by this Christmas poem, and the Flea Theater's troupe of young actors attack them with verve. The Swados piece, ''Holiday Movies,'' is as wacky as they come (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)

'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future in which the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)

'BLACK CHRISTMAS' (R, 100 minutes) It's been more than 30 years since the original ''Black Christmas'' revealed how much fun it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Glen Morgan's disastrous remake not only sidelines the original's hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Smothering terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, the movie is no more than a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. (Catsoulis)

'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)

'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)

* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)

'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)

'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)

* 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuaron about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)

'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)

'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)

'DEATH OF A PRESIDENT' (No rating, 93 minutes) This fake-umentary, the subject of much hyperventilation since it was shown at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, imagines what might happen if George W. Bush were assassinated. Condemned as irresponsible wishful thinking by some, hailed as a brave artistic statement by others, the movie, directed by Gabriel Range, is far too banal to merit such strong responses. Its formal cleverness wears thin and after a while exposes a lazy, pretentious form of provocation. (Scott)

'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)

'DEJA VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)

* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expose of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)

* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)

* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 2:12 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)

'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Stephen Holden)

* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)

'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)

'THE GOOD SHEPHERD' (R, 157 minutes) This chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. (Dargis)

'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh tries to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)

'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)

'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)

* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)

'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)

* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly titled documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner, Bjork, dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)

'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)

'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM' (PG, 108 minutes) This season's answer to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. (Holden)

'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)

'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)

'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning, Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)

'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)

'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

PRIX JEAN VIGO (Today and tomorrow) Since February, the Museum of Modern Art has been honoring Jean Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with screenings of films that have won the prize that bears his name. The series winds up today and tomorrow with three features. Arnaud Desplechin's drama ''La Vie des Morts'' (1991), about a family's reaction to a suicide attempt, will be shown with Laurent Cantet's short about high school students, ''Tous a la Manif'' (1994).

Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10 (but $20 buys a pass to all eight movies). (Gates)

FRANZ WAXMAN: MUSIC FOR THE CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Waxman (1906-1967), the German composer, with a 21-film retrospective.

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

A-BONES, SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS (Sunday) Meaty, beaty, big and retro: the brawny sounds of gourmet 1960s-style garage-rock. The A-Bones' take on this sound is brusque and raw, while the Swingin' Neckbreakers play a more controlled version that recalls the Flamin' Groovies, the 1970s band that was perhaps the first (and best) in a long line of '60s garage revivalists. At 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)

SANDRA BERNHARD (Tonight through Sunday) Expect outrageous comedy, but also expect some oddly dull music from Sandra Bernhard, like her colorless recent holiday song, ''Miracle of Lights,'' or her cover of the late-period Cheap Trick song ''The Flame,'' which is thankfully tucked into a hilarious routine about rescuing her daughter from a bad boyfriend. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30, Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $45 tonight and tomorrow; $100 Sunday at 7:30, $150 at 10:30. (Sisario)

BLACK LIPS (Tonight and Sunday) Sounding like a nightmarish variant of the 13th Floor Elevators or the Troggs, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, play a grisly version of 1960s garage-rock that is deliberately damaged. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., at Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com. (Sisario)

BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tonight and Sunday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. Tonight at 9, with Kudu and DJ Hardedge, and Sunday at 9:30 p.m., at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 tonight; for Sunday, $55 in advance or $60 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

ELECTRIC SIX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Electric Six looks fondly back to the early 1980s merger of rock guitars, disco beats and electro blips, with arch and gleefully overblown songs about dancing and romance, like ''Danger! High Voltage'' and ''Nuclear War'' (''on the dance floor''). With the Dansettes on Sunday. At 10 both nights, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15 tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Pareles)

* MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight through Sunday) The strongest incarnation so far of this singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11, Sunday night at 9, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum tonight and tomorrow night, $650 on Sunday. (Stephen Holden)

RACHELLE GARNIEZ (Thursday) Ms. Garniez is a songwriter who plays accordion, which leads her to wrap her playful songs and hyperactive voice in country tunes, waltzes or wheezy ballads. At 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Pareles)

GLASSJAW (Tonight) This tough-as-nails Long Island band was a big player in the dissonant, tantrum-prone punk subgenre sometimes called screamo or post-hardcore, which peaked in the early years of this decade. A revolving door of lineup changes kept the band from moving forward, but Glassjaw is now reportedly working on a new album. At 6:30, with This Is Hell and Crime in Stereo, at Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

GOV'T MULE (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes, this Southern-rock-meets-Led Zeppelin jam band plays three shows for New Year's weekend, with notable guests each night. Tonight is Los Lobos, the enduring Latino rock band from Los Angeles; tomorrow is the North Mississippi Allstars, whose blues-rock wanders into jam territory; and Sunday features Toots Hibbert, the Jamaican singer who, with his band the Maytals, helped shape reggae from the very beginning. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 9 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $40.50 to $63.50 tonight and tomorrow night; $55 to $79.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)

* 'HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL: THE CONCERT' (Tonight and Sunday) Cynical parents might compare it to the Monkees. But what in the world could be wrong with ''I'm a Believer''? Or, for that matter, with ''Breaking Free,'' the PG-rated climax from ''High School Musical,'' the Disney Channel phenomenon whose soundtrack is the best-selling album of the year? Performing the songs from this tween ''Grease,'' to the accompaniment of many thousands of squeals, will be the cast of the movie, or at least most of it: Zac Efron, who played the heartthrob, Troy, is replaced here by Drew Seeley, who supplied many of Troy's vocals on the soundtrack. Tonight at 7, Sunday afternoon at 3, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; sold out tonight, $35.50 to $55.50 on Sunday. (Sisario)

* JENNIFER HUDSON (Tomorrow) This former ''American Idol'' finalist and star of ''Dreamgirls'' performs songs from that movie in a one-off concert choreographed by Hinton Battle, who also appears in the film. And if that's not enough ''Dreamgirls'' for you, the concert will be followed by remixes of music from the movie by the celebrity DJ Junior Vasquez. At 10 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, saintatlarge.com; $90 in advance, $100 at the door. (Sisario)

JAMES HUNTER (Tomorrow) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating with care and affection the smooth, slithery R&B of early-1960s American singers like Sam Cooke and Little Willie John. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario)

JAPANTHER (Thursday) This Brooklyn avant-rock duo has bridged the gap between scruffy noise-punk and contemporary art: for the latest Whitney Biennial, the band collaborated with Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Laurent P. Berger and Tony Oursler on a live puppet opera called ''Don't Trust Anyone Over 30.'' But perhaps even more impressive, Japanther has also provided musical accompaniment for a synchronized-swimming performance. Anyone who has witnessed synchronized swimming knows that can't be easy. At 8 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8. (Sisario)

MOE (Tomorrow and Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacy interludes or the borderline of funk. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. Sunday at 9 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $52.50. (Pareles)

REBIRTH BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) A New Orleans institution since the 1980s, the Rebirth Brass Band updates the traditional strutting rhythms and continuous improvisation of New Orleans parades with an infusion of funk. It doesn't need microphones, amplifiers or anything but breath and rhythm to make a crowd jump. At 11:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)

VERNON REID (Tonight) Long after his time as the lead guitarist of Living Colour, Mr. Reid continues to play in ways so weirdly innovative that he sometimes seems more magician than mere musician. Tonight he offers ''A Night of Pure Guitar'' with Rob Balducci and Dave Weiner. At 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario)

THE SLIP (Sunday) New Year's Eve was made for jam bands, which are used to playing all night without exhausting themselves (or their audiences). The Slip, from Boston, plays a mild jazz fusion that veers into the abstract post-rock of Tortoise. With Meowskers. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $25. (Sisario)

* PATTI SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) For the ninth year, Ms. Smith and her band ring in the new year with noise, poetry and rock 'n' roll. This event features a special milestone: tomorrow is Ms. Smith's 60th birthday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)

* SPOON (Tomorrow) Led by Britt Daniel, one of the best songwriters ever to get stuck with the meaningless appellation ''indie,'' Spoon, from Austin, Tex., accomplishes a lot with a little. Its tight, jabby songs, influenced equally by minimalist post-punk and sentimental white soul, are beguiling miniatures that seem to end just when you think you've figured them out. As a result, you must listen again and again and again. With Benjy Ferree, a rising singer-songwriter from Washington. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

THE SWORD (Tomorrow) Long live Black Sabbath. Or, at least, bands that sound an awful lot like them, such as the Sword, an Austin, Tex., group that seems to have most of what made Black Sabbath great. Fuzzy, decelerated blues-rock riffs? Check. Sasquatch tempo? Check. Songs about vague industrial-age catastrophes and medieval monsters? Check (''The Horned Goddess,'' ''Iron Swan''). Ozzy Osbourne? Well, no, even retro-rock has its limits. At 9 p.m., with Stinking Lizaveta and Motherboar, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)

UNCLE MONK (Wednesday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this acoustic duo, singing tautly written numbers -- kind of like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. With Radio I-Ching and Who Put the Bad Mouth On Me? At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)

* THE VIEW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Arctic Monkeys are so 2006. The next next wave of hyperactive British rock savants is the View, four teenagers from Dundee, Scotland, who play sharp, tuneful pop-punk that resembles that of the Arctic Monkeys. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., with the Diggs and Favourite Sons, at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario)

WHITE MAGIC (Thursday) Mira Billotte's songs in White Magic are both spartan and spooky, with simple piano figures underlying vocals that can be steady incantations or elaborate, multilayered rhapsodies. With Women and Children, and Legends. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario)

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ABERCROMBIE, BYRON, GOMEZ AND WHITE (Thursday) The guitarist John Abercrombie, the clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Don Byron, the bassist Eddie Gomez and the drummer Lenny White make up this all-star collective, which seems predisposed to lean toward the funky side.

BALLIN' THE JACK (Thursday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's certainly true of this engagement, featuring music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

DAVID BERGER AND THE SULTANS OF SWING (Tuesday) The music of Duke Ellington figures prominently in this weekly residency by the Sultans of Swing, a big band led by the knowledgeable David Berger. For the next few weeks the group will feature a special guest: Jon Hendricks, the indomitable godfather of vocalese. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

PETER BERNSTEIN, LARRY GOLDINGS, BILL STEWART (Tuesday through Thursday) A Hammond B-3 organ trio with a decidedly modern harmonic language and an intense collective bond; the crisp guitar of Mr. Bernstein meets the polyrhythmic churn of Mr. Goldings on organ, and Mr. Stewart on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

ALEX BLAKE TRIO (Sunday) The intensely rhythmic style of the bassist Alex Blake has worked well in African-inspired jazz settings, notably the Randy Weston Trio. Here he features his own compositions in a group with Ted Cruz on keyboards and Jaime Affoumado on drums. At 10 and 11:30 p.m. and 12:45 a.m., Puppets Jazz Bar, 294 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, (718) 499-2627, puppetsjazz.com; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

CHRIS BOTTI (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a sizable audience, as has his standard-laden repertory. He gets a shade more abstract with his first-rate working band; on New Year's Eve, it will follow an opening set by the vocalist and pianist Jon Regen. At 8 and 10:30 tonight and tomorrow night, at 7 and 10 on Sunday night, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $60 at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Fluent and fiery hard bop, from a well-traveled saxophonist and a rhythm section that includes the sharp pianist Anthony Wonsey. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

PAQUITO D'RIVERA AND THE PANAMERICAN JAZZ ENSEMBLE (Tonight through Sunday) Few musicians have a better claim to pan-Americana than Paquito D'Rivera, the clarinetist and saxophonist who toured extensively with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. This engagement, at the club that bears Gillespie's name, will feature his more Latin-flavored tunes. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. Sold out on New Year's Eve. (Chinen)

GLOBAL MOTION (Thursday) Marc Mommaas, a Dutch tenor saxophonist, employs a fluid post-bop language in this aptly named band, with the Danish pianist Nikolaj Hess and the American rhythm team of John Hebert (on bass) and Tony Moreno (on drums). At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

VINNY GOLIA, NELS CLINE, KEN FILIANO (Tonight) Mr. Golia, a multireedist, and Mr. Cline, a guitarist, are pillars of the West Coast free-improvising scene; they have a good conversational rapport, as they demonstrated a couple years ago on an album called ''The Entire Time'' (Nine Winds). Here they team up with Mr. Filiano, a stalwart bassist who has a home base in Brooklyn. At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $15. (Chinen)

LOUIS HAYES'S CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tonight through Sunday) Julian (Cannonball) Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with homegrown grit and soul. This crisp tribute band, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features the worthy alto saxophonist Vincent Herring and the sharp trumpeter Jeremy Pelt. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10, Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow night, with a $10 minimum; $75 on Sunday, with a $20 minimum. (Chinen)

MAP (Wednesday) The guitarist Mary Halvorson, the bassist Reuben Radding and the drummer Tatsuya Nakatani make up this texture-minded ensemble, which put out a likable album (with a different bassist) a few years ago. Their abstract interplay is best experienced in person, and in real time. At 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

* DELFEAYO MARSALIS TRIBUTE TO ELVIN JONES (Tuesday through Thursday) A few months ago the trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis released ''Minions Dominion'' (Troubadour Jass), an album recorded in 2003 and featuring the unmistakable polyrhythmic pulse of the drummer Elvin Jones. Here Mr. Marsalis pays tribute to Mr. Jones, who died in 2004, with a band featuring his brother Jason Marsalis on drums and either Mark Shim (on Tuesday and Wednesday) or David Liebman (on Thursday) on tenor saxophone. (Through Jan. 7.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

* SAL MOSCA (Monday) Mr. Mosca has largely based his piano style -- and, to a considerable extent, his career -- on the heady legacy of the pianist-composer Lennie Tristano. But at 79, he assuredly has an improvisational voice of his own; he also has a cult following, chiefly among his former students. He performs infrequently, but that's only one reason that this trio engagement is a noteworthy event. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

CHICO O'FARRILL'S AFRO-CUBAN JAZZ ORCHESTRA WITH HILARY KOLE (Sunday) The legendary Latin orchestra of Chico O'Farrill, now led by his son Arturo O'Farrill, performs two New Year's Eve sets with Ms. Kole, the sensuous cabaret singer. At 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40 at 8, $60 at 11, with a $20 minimum. (Chinen)

ONE FOR ALL (Sunday) The driving hard bop of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers provides a mission and a method for this strong sextet, which consists of the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the trumpeter Jim Rotondi, the trombonist Steve Davis, the pianist David Hazeltine, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $125. (Chinen)

REUBEN RADDING 40th BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Tonight) Reuben Radding, an adventurous bassist and composer, celebrates a special occasion with a passel of improvising friends, including the multireedists Daniel Carter and Ned Rothenberg, the guitarists Elliott Sharp and Mary Halvorson, and the drummer Andrew Drury. At 8 and 10, Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. She performs here with two frequent foils: the guitarist Adam Levy and the clarinetist Doug Weiselman. At 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

DIANE SCHUUR WITH THE CARIBBEAN JAZZ PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) As on a recent album called ''Schuur Fire'' (Concord Picante), the singer Diane Schuur enjoys streamlined accompaniment from the vibraphonist Dave Samuels and his Caribbean Jazz Project. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30, and Sunday night at 8 and 11, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $45 tonight and tomorrow night, with a $10 minimum; $110 and $160 on Sunday, including dinner. (Chinen)

TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE / PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tuesday) Two ambitious ensembles that combine spacious avant-gardism with the melodic punch of rock. Oblique is a sextet led by Mr. Sorey, a ferocious drummer, with ranks including Mr. Robbins on alto saxophone and clarinet. Centric, led by Mr. Robbins, also happens to include Mr. Sorey, along with other bright young players, like the trumpeter Jesse Neuman and the keyboardist Eliot Cardinaux. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings both virtuosity and restraint to the conventions of small-group hard bop; his group includes his wife, the cellist and vocalist Akua Dixon, as well as the pianist Ronnie Mathews, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Dion Parson. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)

BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON (Tuesday through Thursday) The alto saxophonist Bobby Watson formed his first version of Horizon more than 20 years ago, managing to iron a sharp new crease into the legacy of Jazz Messengers-inspired hard bop. His current iteration of the group, as heard on the 2004 album ''Horizon Reassembled'' (Palmetto), consists of Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. (Through Jan. 7.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

* JOHN ZORN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of open-minded participants; tomorrow's cast will include the violinist Mark Feldman, the cellist Okkyung Lee, the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and the drummer Matt Wilson. Then, on New Year's Eve, Mr. Zorn plays an early set at Tonic with the bassist and producer Bill Laswell and the drummer Guy Licata, among others. Tomorrow at 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $20. Sunday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)

Opera

'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tonight and Tuesday night) The excitement of a world premiere at the Met, combined with widespread public interest in the composer Tan Dun, who won an Oscar for his film score for ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' have resulted in a sold-out run for ''The First Emperor.'' Alas, though the story of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who unified the country through brutality and conquest, is compelling, Mr. Tan's ponderous score is a huge disappointment. There are gripping moments, especially some propulsive orchestra passages that incorporate Chinese instruments. But the opera's lyrical flights are slow-moving and sometimes cloying. Mr. Tan has tried to meld Chinese melody and Italianate lyricism. But his music seems caught in some nowhere land between ''Crouching Tiger'' and Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Even the great Placido Domingo, bravely taking on the challenging title role, cannot save the show. The colorful production is by the Chinese film director Zhang Yimou (''House of Flying Daggers''). Mr. Tan conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)

'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tonight through Sunday night) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now offered is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there. At 7:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+, $125 for the New Year's Eve gala. (Vivien Schweitzer)

'THE MAGIC FLUTE' (Today through Tuesday, and Thursday) Julie Taymor's whimsical, puppet-filled production has gone even more child-friendly, abridged by the director into a 100-minute version with a new English text by J. D. McClatchy. But the Met hasn't skimped on the casts. Today Matthew Polenzani sings Tamino, and Nathan Gunn is a lively, entertaining Papageno; they will be joined tomorrow by the fantastic German bass Rene Pape as Sarastro. James Levine conducts today through Sunday, and Jens Georg Bachmann conducts on Tuesday and Thursday. Today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 1 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. A live high-definition telecast will be shown tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809, filmlinc.com; $18; $15 for children. (Schweitzer)

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Monday and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. James Levine conducts a cast that also includes Rene Pape as Sarastro, Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Cornelia Gotz as Queen of the Night. On Thursday Scott Bergeson conducts, and Lisa Milne is Pamina. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 to $375 tickets remain for Monday, and $15 to $175 for Thursday. (Schweitzer)

Classical Music

AMOR ARTIS (Sunday) Johannes Somary and his fine chamber orchestra and choir have made their New Year's Eve Bach concert a tradition over the past two decades. This performance, the 22nd installment, includes three Cantatas -- Nos. 137, 191 and 200 -- as well as the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 3 and 5. At 9 p.m., St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-4513, amorartis.org; $40. (Allan Kozinn)

ARTEK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument group offers one of the last celebrations of the waning Mozart year, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Enrico Gatti, an Italian violinist, leads the orchestra in ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' ''Serenata Notturno'' and arias from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Il Re Pastore,'' ''La Clemenza di Tito'' and others, with Jessica Tranzillo, a soprano; Barbara Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano; Drew Minter, a countertenor; and Philip Anderson, a tenor. The pianists Gwendolyn Toth, Artek's director, and Dongsok Shin, her husband, perform Mozart's Concerto for two fortepianos (K. 365). At 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248, artekearlymusic.org; $35 and $20; $10 off for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Zubin Mehta returns to the Philharmonic next week. The opening work will be Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Mehta's old friend the violinist Pinchas Zukerman as soloist, followed after intermission by Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Mr. Mehta's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic has its defenders and detractors. But this Stravinsky score was a specialty of his back then. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Tommasini)

VASSILY PRIMAKOV AND KONSTANTIN SOUKHOVETSKI (Sunday) These two young pianists from the former Soviet Union, both in their 20s, play an interesting program of Beethoven, Czerny, John Corigliano and Tchaikovsky. Arium offers a little food and drink, and visual art as well. At 4 p.m., Arium Center for the Arts, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; sold out. (Bernard Holland)

'THE VERY LEAST OF P. D. Q. BACH' (Tuesday) Skewering the traditions of the classical music world is one thing; finding the comedic opportunities inherent in the music itself is another, and that is Peter Schickele's art. His canvas is the life and work of P. D. Q. Bach, the fictional ''last and least'' of J. S. Bach's progeny. With Mr. Schickele as guide and commentator, Xian Zhang will lead the New York Philharmonic in a program that includes the ''Desecration of the House'' Overture, the ''1712'' Overture, ''Eine Kleine Kiddiemusik,'' the Prelude to ''Einstein on the Fritz'' and a venerable P. D. Q. classic, the ''Pervertimento'' for bagpipes, bicycle, balloons and strings. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $30 to $90. (Kozinn)

Dance

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

* ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) The last three days of this vibrant company's annual City Center season, ending with a special New Year's Eve performance. Tonight at 8, tomorrow row at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, alvinailey.org or nycitycenter.org; $25 to $150. (John Rockwell)

Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Lots of men can wear tutus; point shoes are another matter. If you want to see how real men pirouette, check out the Trocks, as they are called, performing classics like ''Swan Lake'' and creepy 20th-century ballets like ''The Cage.'' (Through Jan. 7.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Claudia La Rocco)

KWANZAA CELEBRATION: REGENERATION NIGHT (Tonight) Forces of Nature Dance Theater, a troupe dedicated to expressing balance, healing and harmony through movement, collaborates with Spirit Ensemble and Vy Higginsen's Gospel for Teens in a Kwanzaa event with Hazelle Goodman as host. At 7:30, the Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $12; $10 for groups. (Jack Anderson)

* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow) The final three performances of the 2006 installment of George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker.'' It may have been hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to mention the orchestra and stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Tigers of Wrath: Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)

Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velazquezes and Zurbarans and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalis and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velazquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)

* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)

* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)

Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as of Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The show tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)

Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)

Galleries: Chelsea

* ATELIER VAN LIESHOUT: SLAVECITY In this only partly satirical show, architectural scale models, drawings, sculpture, a map and an extensive business plan propose a highly efficient, completely self-sufficient city whose ''participants'' each have a desk job, a farm job and very little time off. The tyranny of it all is brought home in the second gallery, which contains the ''Midi Disciplinator,'' a cell built to accommodate 18 people working in shifts, filing logs into sawdust for no good reason. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, through Jan. 6. (Smith)

* Noah Fischer, 'Rhetoric Machine' This young, Brooklyn-based artist has a winner of a first New York solo: a two-room, Rube-Goldbergesque kinetic environment set to a score of clips from doom-threatening speeches by United States presidents, ardent pop love songs and the baseline sound of jets and bombs. In sync with the soundtrack, low-tech, handmade light-projecting machines whir and jerk into life, turning the show into a combination of modernist ballet mecanique and gothic danse macabre. Technically ingenious and full of ideas, the show takes approximately 10 minutes to complete one sound-and-motion cycle. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)

* CANDIDA HOFER In large color photographs of the different galleries of the Louvre, taken on Tuesdays when the museum is closed, both the long, vaulted spaces and the painting and sculpture they contain speak of different times and styles. Equally effecting, if not a little frightening, is the lavish, timeless grandeur of these vistas. A palace that became a museum, the Louvre is also a precursor of the barrel-vaulted arcades that sprang up in Paris in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them are gone, but the Louvre's arcades live on. Sort of. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018. (Smith)

* CHEYNEY THOMPSON: 'QUELQUES ASPECTS DE L'ART BOURGEOIS: LA NON-INTERVENTION' A teasing, tantalizing, subtly beautiful show by one of the sharper young artists of the moment explores the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting and culture and commerce with seemingly abstract canvases, photographs framed by folding street-vendor tables and tinted off-set lithographs of the gallery's storage shelves. The title translates as ''Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Non-Intervention.'' Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, through Jan. 6. (Smith)

* 'When the Revolution Comes' The artist Michael St. John has brought some interesting people together in this scrappy, savory group show. It's great to revisit Nancy Grossman's leather-bound heads, looking as radical as they did 30 years ago, and Holt Quentel's distressed gray banners from the 1980s, out of view since but looking right, right now. Strong young artists like Nate Lowman, Joshua Weintraub and Josh White sustain growing reputations, and a bevy of less familiar figures -- Jamal Cyrus, A. J. Bocchino, Alex McQuilkan and Ellwyn Palmerton -- look good. Also in the gallery: a small solo of vivacious, minutely detailed drawings by Josedgardo Granados that bring pre-Columbian and post-Columbian worlds together in a cultural and psychic revolution still in progress. Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts, 508 West 26th Street, Suite 5A, (212) 463-8500, kathleencullenfinearts.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)

Other Galleries

* 'November' The Los Angeles- based curator Jeffrey Uslip put together this obliquely topical group show, which includes several young West Coast-based artists. In a Babel-ish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here, with Kara Tanaka's listening-booth sculpture transmuting past conversations into a melancholic music. Landscape as poisoned terrain is another. Surrealism, art's 21st-century Esperanto, is the prevailing language. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com, through Jan. 6. (Cotter)

Last Chance

* 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with the Pratt Institute in New York City, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age to the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794), by Gilbert Stuart, is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-World War II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com; closes today. (Glueck)

* Asia Society: 'Gilded Splendor: Treasures of China's Liao Empire (907-1125)' The first major display of Liao objects outside China, this show gives the lie to the idea of the Khitan as cultural nobodies. Among the more exotic exhibits are those that reveal Khitan burial customs for royal personages: the corpse was first embalmed and then carefully wrapped in silk, and the adornments included a whole-body netting, a metal mask of gold or lesser material, a burial suit and an overcoat. The Khitan taste for jewelry, too, is evident in the elaborate, exquisitely worked examples on display. Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts and other personal objects; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments, embroidered fabrics, miniature pagodas used as containers for Buddhist scriptures; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)

* Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT' Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)

* Frick Collection: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING' Weighing in at 6 works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works that highlight Cimabue's radicalness without letting it completely steal the show. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)

Museum of Modern Art: 'Eye on Europe: Prints, Books & Multiples, 1960 to Now' This is a woolly, at times idiosyncratic assemblage of more than 350 prints and multiple editions by 118 European artists. Although they are still often considered secondary mediums, the show charts how prints and multiple editions rose to prominence in the 1960s as an essentially democratic strategy, having largely to do with accessibility and affordability, as artists explored alternatives to conventional painting and sculpture. Following this are displays of artwork by contemporary artists working in these mediums. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Genocchio)

National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam, 1819-1865' This show is the first museum survey of the career of this 19th-century American painter and is accompanied by a weighty monograph. His early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were a talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org; closes on Sunday. (Genocchio)

Parrish Art Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters' Lichtenstein is more popularly associated with his Pop paintings, often based on comic book images, than with the works here. But in the 1950s, using a somewhat Cubist style, he explored mythic characters like medieval knights or cowboys and Indians. ''Chief Before Teepee,'' an abstract oil painting, and ''Two Wild Indians,'' a drawing, both from 1952, were unearthed by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation for the show's run at the Montclair Art Museum last year. Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, Ext. 32, parrishart.org; closes on Sunday. (Carol Vogel)

'Replanting the Community Garden' Organized by the artist Michael Tong, this show consists of two environmental pieces. William Brent, a professional landscape designer, contributes an ''Urban Air Scrubber,'' a closet-size smoker's lounge filled with air-purifying plants. A wood construction by Adam Brent is made of shelves holding miniature plants; it's a model for real plant holders and shelters that might be built in tight urban spaces, an idea that makes particular sense at this venerable, financially vulnerable gallery in a neighborhood where grass-roots empty-lot gardens have long been a source of local pride. Tribes Gallery, 285 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 674-3778, www.tribes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson River School Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum' Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)

Paul McCarthy: 'Between Beauty and the Beast' Despite the scattershot nature of this show, mostly of work from around 1990 to 2004, Mr. McCarthy's signature moves and gestures are all here. His scatological side is represented by a selection of drawings featuring crude, sexualized doodles and misspelled messages, unpublishable here, that recall graffiti in public restrooms. In ''Masks'' (1994), the abject and uncanny are explored in a suite of large-scale color photographs of soiled silicon masks that mix fear with surprising pathos. His work also continues to reveal itself as a corrective, or perhaps an addendum, to more antiseptic strains of 1960s Pop. Rather than celebrating or criticizing popular images, Mr. McCarthy plays the role of analyst, musing on the creepy cheerfulness of cartoon characters and their incarnations as amusement park mascots. The seven bright-hued sculptures of ''Dwarf Head'' (2000) borrow from Walt Disney's ''Snow White.'' Only here the dwarfs look decapitated and cryogenically preserved, their cuteness transformed into an eternal, chilling blankness. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy ZPark South, Suite 8D, (212) 955-1785, nyehaus.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A jazz listing yesterday in Weekend for the Bill McHenry/Ethan Iverson Quartet at the Fat Cat in the West Village included outdated information. After the section went to press, the shows scheduled for yesterday and tonight were canceled.
An art entry in the Listings pages of Weekend on Friday misstated the surname of the artist whose ''Urban Air Scrubber'' was at the Tribes Gallery on East Third Street in the East Village. He is William Meyer, not Brent. (Adam Brent is the artist who made another work that was on display.)

HEADLINE: To Buy or to Rent?

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
THE Napa Valley ranch house, built in the 1970s, wasn't much of a looker. And with a price tag of nearly $1.4 million, it wasn't cheap either. But its location on Highway 29, the main drag through wine country, on an acre of land in the undeniably quaint town of St. Helena caught the attention of Jocelyn Singh. She had spent the last 12 years driving north from her home in Modesto, Calif., to stay in rental homes and increasingly expensive hotels during her regular wine country retreats. 
 For Ms. Singh and her parents, the time was ripe to buy.
 Buy? In this market? 
 ''We ended up getting it for $975,000,'' said Ms. Singh, noting that the seller's final price wasn't too far from her initial offer of $950,000. 
 With the money saved on the purchase price, she was able to plow $120,000 into renovations, raising the ceilings and ripping down walls, and will soon plant grapes on the land. ''By the time we are done with it, it will look very wine country,'' Ms. Singh said.
 Thirty percent price cuts in asking prices for homes aren't the norm, but stories like this -- with sellers willing to negotiate or even drop their asking prices -- are increasingly popping up in suddenly cooling vacation home markets. 
 Among second-home shoppers these days, to buy or to rent is often the question. Until this year, the answer was pretty straightforward. Why rent when real estate prices in desirable areas -- from coastal enclaves in Florida to beach towns in the Northeast to desert hideaways out West -- saw a steady annual appreciation of 15 to 20 percent or more?
 The surge in prices had buyers lined up at developers' doorsteps, eager to pick up a condo (or two or three), and even the noninvestor types were patting themselves on the back watching their equity rack up.
 But it's no secret that real estate activity has nearly ground to a halt this year. Sales volumes are down, inventories of homes on the market are up, and it's simply taking longer, a lot longer in some cases, to move listings. 
 Now, in many areas where second-home buyers flock, prices are trending downward. Home prices have already taken well-publicized hits in areas like South Florida and the Phoenix area. 
 Similar areas have witnessed a slowing in sales and an increase in inventory, and price drops may be on the way in those places as well, according to Cynthia A. Kroll, a senior regional economist at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Since different factors motivate sellers of second homes (after all, a vacation home seller usually doesn't have to unload a property immediately to, say, move to a new job), they simply might take their homes off the market or wait longer to reduce prices.
 ''That's one of the reasons the price effect can lag,'' Dr. Kroll said. ''It can take awhile for the sellers to accept the reality of lower prices.'' 
 While second-home buyers aren't as sensitive to pricing as other buyers, slower appreciation sent investors -- who had fueled much of that appreciation -- out of the market. The National Association of Realtors predicts that 30 percent of all home sales for 2006 will have been second homes, down from 40 percent last year, and attributes much of that drop to the exit of investors. 
 And the places that saw the biggest influx of investors and the most heated activity are likely to see the biggest price drops. ''Areas that had the highest appreciation and that were the hottest can cool the most,'' said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Of course, the decision whether to rent or own might require the assistance of a crystal ball. After all, is $250,000 for a summer rental in East Hampton ever a wise financial move? Buyers hoping to swoop in on Hamptons bargains will probably be disappointed. 
 ''The sky is not falling,'' said Cee Scott Brown, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group in Sag Harbor, N.Y. ''There really are no good deals.''
 He said prices haven't budged much one way or the other because of ''the standoff'': ''The seller is saying 'I'm willing to sit here,' and the buyer is saying 'I don't want to pay what the last person paid,' '' he said. 
 A result is that the number of transactions in Hamptons towns like Sag Harbor are off 20 percent from last year, although Mr. Brown said there had been a small surge in recent weeks. 
 Farther south, the rental decision seems much clearer. 
 ''We are now in a market across the state of Florida of declining prices,'' said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., who tracks the rental market. ''No one wants to buy into a falling market and risk that their home might be worth less than the amount of their mortgage.'' 
 So there is a larger rental inventory than usual and ''right now it does make good sense to rent rather than buy,'' he said.
 Prices in some Florida communities have the potential to dip more, according to Mr. McCabe, because of continued activity among condominium developers. 
 ''Miami right now has over 22,000 condos that are under construction with tens of thousands more announced,'' he said. ''It is the poster child for the bubble. The vast majority will reach the market in 2007 and 2008 and that is when it will get bloody.'' 
 ACCORDING to the Florida Association of Realtors, median prices are already falling. In Port St. Lucie and Fort Pierce, median prices for single-family houses dropped around 5 percent in November from a year earlier. The median price for a house in Palm Beach County dropped 6 percent in August from the year before, the first such decline since 1999, and slipped even more the next two months compared to 2005. In Panama City, condo prices were down 28 percent in the third quarter.
 The real price pressure is even more pronounced when you consider that many sellers are resorting to incentives, anything from free flat-screen televisions to a few months of homeowners' association dues, to lure buyers and their agents. Cathleen Flanagan of ZipRealty in Hollywood, Fla., said she received a flier for a house offering the buyer's agent a commission of 4 percent plus $25,000, if the property sold by the end of the year.
 In Provincetown, Mass., there are signs that next summer's rental business might get a boost from the slow sales market. 
 ''We are getting more calls for rentals for next year over last year at least in the three- to four-bedroom range for single-family homes,'' said JD Bower, a sales associate with Provincetown Realty Group, noting that in early December he had already booked homes for July Fourth weekend and for August. ''Everyone across the board is holding off because they think prices are dropping. Sellers are hoping to have properties under contract within the next month and a half, and if they don't, then they will rent it out.''
 Home prices in North Carolina have held up better than most places, but the Outer Banks is among the toughest areas hit, with the average sales price dropping 13 percent in October, and volume off some 30 percent. Investors who bought beach homes to rent are facing higher insurance premiums and higher mortgage payments as adjustable-rate loans were reset to higher rates. 
 ''They bought these big homes expecting rental income,'' said Scott Leggat, vice president of marketing at Outer Beaches Realty. But he added that competition and higher costs has caused their rental income to erode. ''We are even seeing the occasional foreclosure,'' he said. 
 Renters on the Outer Banks should expect a flat market this year, according to Mr. Leggat, with only the most luxurious properties able to command higher rates, a 5 percent jump, over last summer.
 In Northern California, ''properties under $1 million have reverted back to last year's prices,'' said Mike Silvas, the owner of Morgan Lane, a real estate agency with offices in wine country and in coastal areas of Northern California. ''The Carmel market is the one that has really ground to a halt. Prices got to more than $1,000 a square foot and buyers finally balked.'' 
 In Carmel, prices were off 5 percent this year through October, said Mark Wilson, an agent with Morgan Lane in Carmel. Properties in Monterey County, which includes Carmel, are sitting on the market for an average of 113 days, more than twice as long as a year ago, while in Carmel the average home is taking 93 days to sell.
 Cape Cod has seen an influx of inventory this year, but that appears to be easing. Sellers, said Jack Cotton, the broker at Sotheby's International Realty of Cape Cod, are seemingly coming to grips with the realization that big-time appreciation is gone. He told of a house with an asking price of $995,000 that sat untouched until the sellers whittled it down. ''It dropped to $750,000 and had five offers,'' he said. 
 Renting, no doubt, isn't for everyone, and some buyers have already been waiting out the market, anticipating a dip. Cindy Lull bought a one-bedroom co-op in Fort Lauderdale this summer after several years of combing through listings, and paid about $75,000 less than the asking price. 
 ''Just as I was ready to tell my agent that we would meet their price, they came down another $1,000,'' Ms. Lull said. ''We waited it out and I'm very glad. We paid a lot less than we would have a year ago.''

HEADLINE: See How They Run

BYLINE: As told to Bethany Lyttle

 BODY:

WHO -- Steve Forseth, 44, swimwear retailer in Vancouver, British Columbia
WHERE -- Tofino, British Columbia
WHAT -- 6-bedroom house
 The west coast of Vancouver Island is on a primary migratory route for salmon going up and down the coast. Some fish are passing by; others are returning to spawn. Here in Tofino, which is on the Clayoquot Sound, the fishing is world class. You can fish most seasons of the year, weather depending.
I've been fishing since I was a little kid, and I'm an avid surfer, too. My sister and I bought this house, which is on Chesterman Beach, right on the Pacific, in 2002. The first night I was here, there was serious sideways rain, and I discovered that the house had leaks everywhere. Within a month, a low-pressure system had come in from Hawaii, bringing 20-foot swells that wiped out over 20 feet of our beachfront. We ended up replacing 38 windows, tearing off the decks and rebuilding several main walls. At one point my brother said: 'This house has lost its economics. Now it's a labor of love.' 
 It was worth it, though. When I'm here, I love to wake up, walk to the kitchen window and see what the surf is doing. When I'm fishing with friends, we'll get up according to the tides because the fish become active at tide change, and always, as I walk to the dock, I have this sense of anticipation, this sense that something good is going to happen. 
 I have an 18-foot boat, and we'll go about 10 or 15 miles out, southwest of here. Later, we'll cook or smoke the fish. I've got this great big table and often there will be about 15 friends here at a time. It's pretty much guaranteed that if you come over to visit, you're going to have salmon for dinner. As told to Bethany Lyttle

HEADLINE: A Body Is Discovered In a Wasteland of Emotions

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''The Dead Girl'' is a movie with a chip on its shoulder. The relentless emotional violence in it, a compendium of five vignettes related to a young woman whose naked, mutilated corpse is discovered on a barren hillside, is of a level rarely found in movies, even those steeped in gore. There is some gore in ''The Dead Girl,'' but it is eclipsed in intensity by the verbal abuse hurled by its desperately unhappy characters at the people closest to them. All five stories are set in the desolate outliers of Los Angeles, portrayed as a physical and emotional wasteland.
 Just when it seems as though the language of insult and humiliation couldn't get any nastier, the movie escalates the barrage. I think we're meant to take it personally, as though the director and writer, Karen Moncrieff, were slapping our faces and screaming at us to wake up and face the awful truth; this is how many people (maybe most people) really are. Rage rules. 
If the concentrated bile is bracing to a point, I don't totally buy it. Ms. Moncrieff, whose promising debut film, ''Blue Car,'' in 2002, explored the seduction of a high school student by her poetry teacher, simply doesn't know where to stop. ''The Dead Girl'' seizes on some of the same psychological forces and ratchets them downward on the economic ladder while turning up the volume. 
 The grim tone is established immediately with ''The Stranger,'' the story of the body's discovery by Arden (Toni Collette), a meek young woman caring for her aged mother (Piper Laurie), a foul-mouthed, bedridden termagant who demands to be served hand and foot and rewards that service by calling Arden a two-bit slut and worse. The story follows Arden (who has kinky bondage fantasies) on a date with Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi), a creepy supermarket clerk who recognizes her from the media coverage of the body's discovery and whose fascination with serial killers hints that he might be the murderer. 
 In ''The Sister,'' the weakest of the five pieces, Rose Byrne is Leah, a clinically depressed graduate student in forensics who hopes that the body proves to be that of her missing sister Jenny, who disappeared many years earlier. If it is, she can finally get on with her life and pursue her romance with Derek (James Franco), a gentle, sympathetic co-worker. Mary Steenburgen plays Leah's mother, Beverly, who stubbornly insists that her long-lost daughter is still alive.
 The angry tone returns with a vengeance in ''The Wife,'' in which Ruth (Mary Beth Hurt), a Bible-thumping harridan who lives in a trailer with her husband, Carl (Nick Searcy), harangues him mercilessly for his mysterious absences during which she is certain he is visiting prostitutes. Carl, who runs a storage facility, is so inured to her tirades that her fury seems to bounce off him. Rummaging through Carl's belongings while he is out, Ruth discovers evidence of a violent crime and must decide whether to report it or cover it up. 
 In ''The Mother,'' the most satisfying vignette, Melora (Marcia Gay Harden), the mother of the dead girl, who has been identified as Krista (Brittany Murphy), drives to the fleabag motel where her daughter shared a room with Rosetta (Kerry Washington), a drug addict and prostitute. Rosetta takes Melora, a typical middle-class mom, to meet Krista's 3-year-old daughter, Ashley. From Rosetta, Melora finally learns why Krista ran away from home and has her rose-colored vision of her idyllic family life shattered.
 The concluding story, ''The Dead Girl,'' backtracks to the last day of Krista's life, in which she buys a toy for Ashley's birthday, and then -- through a series of ugly mishaps involving her pimp and boyfriend (Josh Brolin) and a violent john who beats Rosetta -- ends up hitching a fateful ride to visit her daughter in a neighboring town. 
 Ms. Murphy's Krista is a terror: a flailing, spitting and cursing live wire whose emotional anchor in life is a child she is too unstable to care for. In this histrionic performance by an actor who even in roles that call for sweetness and charm conveys hardness and defiance, Ms. Murphy and her disagreeable character mesh. 
 The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, sexual situations and violence.

The Dead Girl

HEADLINE: Group Now Tied to an Inquiry Figured in Bruno's Day at a Track

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Joe Drape and Margot Williams contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
It was the second day of the three-week racing season at Keeneland, a thoroughbred track and auction house on the western outskirts of Lexington, Ky., in the heart of bluegrass country. The weather was cloudy. Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the New York State Senate, had traveled to join 20,200 people who paid $3 a head to watch the horses. 
 ''He was very affable, very inquisitive,'' said George E. Nicholson, the president of Keeneland, recalling Mr. Bruno's visit on Oct. 8, 2005. ''I could tell he knew the right questions to ask. I could tell he was knowledgeable about racing.''
Later that day, over catered hors d'oeuvres in the library of the 1,000-acre estate, Mr. Bruno met donors at a reception that raised money for the State Senate's Republican majority, which the senator has led since 1994. 
 The trip, which included three aides to the senator and a veterinarian who has been close to Mr. Bruno for years, would become a catalyst for investigations into the business activities of Mr. Bruno, a thoroughbred enthusiast who has long raised horses on his farm in Brunswick, N.Y., northeast of Albany.
 The trip to Kentucky was arranged by two officials at the Friends of New York Racing, a short-lived advocacy group formed by racing fans and executives intent on overhauling the Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga tracks, the centerpiece of an industry that generates $1.4 billion a year in economic activity in New York State.
 After producing a 20-page report in December 2005, the group dissolved this year amid infighting, with many of its top directors and staff members joining a consortium that is now vying for the state's lucrative horseracing franchise. 
 In recent months, the advocacy group and one of its founding directors, Jared E. Abbruzzese, have emerged as central elements of separate investigations by the state lobbying commission and a federal grand jury. 
 The lobbying commission is examining whether Mr. Abbruzzese, a businessman and longtime friend of Senator Bruno's, violated state law by giving free or discounted flights to the senator.
 Federal authorities are examining, among other things, whether substantial payments by Mr. Abbruzzese to Mr. Bruno's private consulting firm were part of an effort to influence the senator, who is likely to have a major say over who gets the racing franchise. 
 The authorities have also issued a subpoena to Wayne R. Barr Jr., a lawyer and business associate of Mr. Abbruzzese's, who helped arrange Mr. Bruno's trip to Kentucky. 
 The person behind the Friends of New York Racing was Timothy G. Smith, a former executive at the P.G.A. of America, the golf association, and at the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
 The new group was formed in late 2004 in response to the economic threat that video lottery terminals and casinos run by Indian tribes posed to the New York and national horse racing industries. 
 ''In the current political climate, there is a real risk that the needs of the racing, breeding and pari-mutuel industries simply will be ignored in favor of other revenue-raising options,'' the group said in a mission statement on its Web site.
 In a June deposition to the state lobbying commission, Mr. Smith said he was ''very alarmed'' when Gov. George E. Pataki raised the idea of expanding legalized gambling in a budget address in January 2005. 
 ''I concluded that horse racing had made itself largely irrelevant to the state,'' Mr. Smith said, adding that racing needed to demonstrate that ''we're important, we have a lot of jobs, we're politically relevant.'' 
 Mr. Smith, a lifelong Democrat, said he met Mr. Bruno in 1970 when they worked on the re-election campaign of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican.
 Mr. Smith enlisted 10 organizations -- a mixture of businesses and nonprofit groups -- to each contribute $100,000 to create the Friends of New York Racing. All 10 organizations worked in racing or gambling except one: Capital & Technology Advisors, a consulting firm founded by Mr. Abbruzzese, Mr. Bruno's longtime friend. 
 The Friends of New York Racing worked to curry favor with Mr. Bruno, playing host to a fund-raiser in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., on Aug. 12, 2005, and the Kentucky reception less than two months later. 
 Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Barr arranged Mr. Bruno's flight to Kentucky, according to the deposition and flight records. 
 Mr. Smith, who was on the Kentucky trip but did not travel with Mr. Bruno, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Barr declined to comment. 
 In its final report in December 2005, the Friends of New York Racing said that the industry was in financial jeopardy under the nonprofit New York Racing Association and that the state should ''permit any form of business or venture'' to compete for the franchise.
 The report was the group's final public act. Within two months, its board voted to dissolve. Two consortiums of horse racing and gambling interests quickly formed, each competing to bid for the work.
 The first consortium, Empire Racing Associates, included Mr. Abbruzzese and Mr. Smith, as well as Churchill Downs and the Magna Entertainment Corporation, which are leading owners of racetracks and founding members of the Friends of New York Racing. The former vice president of the Friends and two former members of its board of advisers are involved with Empire.
 The second consortium, Excelsior Racing Associates, includes Steve Swindal, a managing general partner of the Yankees; Richard Fields, a casino developer; Tishman Speyer Properties, a developer; Bill Mulrow, a former candidate for state comptroller close to Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer; and Jerry Bilinski, the veterinarian who accompanied Mr. Bruno to Kentucky. R. Wayne Diesel, a former state budget director who was on the board of the Friends, is advising Excelsior. 
 Several of the founders of the Friends of New York Racing said they were startled by how quickly the group disbanded. 
 ''When we entered into this arrangement, we assumed this body was going to be a completely neutral body to design the best method of making N.Y.R.A. effective,'' said Sherwood C. Chillingworth of the nonprofit Oak Tree Racing Association in Arcadia, Calif., which was one of the 10 groups that contributed $100,000 to the Friends of New York Racing.
 ''We're surprised to see so many people associated with that group spin off these into these competing organizations.'' 
 In November, a state advisory committee recommended that the franchise be awarded to Excelsior, but the decision is really up to Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Bruno and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. 
 Records of Mr. Bruno's trip to Kentucky, among other flights, have been turned over to federal prosecutors, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation. 
 With so much scrutiny on Mr. Bruno, ties to the senator may be more of a liability than an asset. This week, Empire announced it was severing all ties with Mr. Abbruzzese and buying out his 6 percent share, citing the ''distraction'' created by the inquiries.

HEADLINE: Bonding Over a Mascot

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
A few new statues of a Seminole family in 19th-century clothing stand outside the football stadium at Florida State University. The father holds a long gun, the son a bow and arrow, and the mother an infant in her arms as she looks warily to her right.
 The statues represent the era when the Seminoles and the United States were at war. The public art is part of a complex relationship between Seminole culture and sports at Florida State. This bond has strengthened since a crackdown by the National Collegiate Athletic Association last year against American Indian mascots, nicknames and imagery among sports teams.
Not every university enjoys a harmonious relationship with Indians. But a sense of cooperation seems to permeate the Florida State campus in Tallahassee, Fla., where Toni Sanchez was among 21 students to complete a new course this month called History of the Seminoles and Southeastern Tribes. 
 Sanchez, a senior majoring in English, called the N.C.A.A. edict ''beyond idiotic'' and offensive. She described the new statues as beautiful. 
 ''I know what a real Seminole is,'' she said. ''This Anglo guilt and regret don't affect me.''
 Sanchez is from a family with Seminole and Hispanic ancestry. Her father, once a farm worker, is now a casino operator. Her mother is a teacher. Sanchez also plays trumpet at football games in a marching band that wears arrowheads on the back of its uniforms.
 Of the tribal flag near the new statues, another recent addition, she said, ''Every time I look at it, I get really giddy inside.'' Of the use of the Seminole imagery for the university's sports, she said, ''I'm so proud of it.''
 Florida State was one of 18 institutions cited by the N.C.A.A. in August 2005 for ''mascots, nicknames or images deemed hostile or abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin.'' The institutions were forbidden to use the symbols in postseason events controlled by the N.C.A.A., like the national championship basketball tournament that begins in March.
 Five programs have since received permission to continue using their imagery because they received approval from specific Indian groups, in Florida State's case the 3,200-member Seminole Tribe of Florida. Five others have changed or are in the process of changing, said Bob Williams, an N.C.A.A. spokesman. The other eight, he said, remain on the list and are subject to the policy, including the Illinois Fighting Illini and the North Dakota Fighting Sioux.
 Myles Brand, the president of the N.C.A.A., said in a telephone interview last week that his organization made the right decision but witnessed more negative reaction to the ruling than expected. 
 ''What we've accomplished in part is to raise the level of awareness nationally about how we treat Native Americans,'' Brand said. ''If we don't stand by our values, we lose our integrity.''
 At times, Indians are reduced to casual caricature that would not be tolerated by other groups, he said, adding that the N.C.A.A. had been honored for its stance by Indian groups in Oklahoma and Indiana.
 Less complimentary is T. K. Wetherell, the president of Florida State, who said the N.C.A.A. was ''more interested in being politically correct'' and did not consult the Seminole tribe before making its decision.
 ''The way they weaseled out was to say, 'O.K., as long as the tribe continues to support it,' '' he said. 
 Wetherell, a former Florida State football player who also teaches history, wore a hunting outfit when interviewed recently in his office. He pointed to a team logo of an Indian's face that he said had elements of caricature. ''That's not really a Seminole-looking deal,'' Wetherell said. ''This is a marketing tool.'' He said the university might ''gradually let certain things fade.''
 He said he told the Seminole Tribe of Florida's council, ''If you don't want Florida State to be the Seminoles, we ain't Seminoles anymore.'' Wetherell said the tribe approved the use partly because the campus is in the capital and tribal leaders ''are not only good businessmen, they are great politicians.''
 He said the new history course was proposed before the N.C.A.A. edict. 
 But Neil Jumonville, the chairman of the history department, said the N.C.A.A. resolution accelerated the creation of the class and that his staff received advice from local Seminole leaders.
 ''These are people who are savvy about their place in the American myth,'' Jumonville said. ''And they are smart enough to manipulate the myth for their own good.''
 The first class was taught by Christopher R. Versen, who recently earned his doctorate in American history.
 ''I wanted to challenge students to think about identity,'' Versen said. ''What is it inside us that makes us identify ourselves one way or another? What external factors play into identity?''
 The Seminoles are an amalgam of several tribes, predominantly Creek, that included escaped slaves. They migrated south to the Everglades in retreat from the United States Army. Some were driven out during the Trail of Tears period under President Andrew Jackson.
 Those descendants live as the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. The Seminoles in Florida once had a commercial hunting economy. Since 1979, their economic status has improved because of casino gambling.
 Earlier this month, the Seminoles acquired Hard Rock International -- the music-themed chain of restaurants, hotels and casinos -- for $965 million.
 Versen said he did not discuss sports identity with his students because he was afraid it would become a distraction. But a guest speaker who raised the mascot issue was Max Osceola, one of three councilmen for the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
 ''If I had a child and named it after you, would you consider it an honor?'' Osceola said he asked the students. He also reflected on a former mascot, Sammy Seminole, who was retired in 1972.
 ''He had a big nose and he lived in a teepee,'' Osceola said. ''He looked like a buffoon.'' 
 The current mascot is named, coincidentally, Osceola, after a 19th-century warrior. A student dressed as Osceola rides a horse named Renegade onto the football field and throws a flaming spear. This mascot's clothing was designed by the tribe. 
 Tina Osceola, who is the executive director of the tribe's historical resources department and is a cousin of Max Osceola's, said, ''We've given them license to be theatrical.''
 A statue of the warrior riding atop Renegade stands outside the stadium above the word ''Unconquered,'' because the Seminoles never surrendered to the United States.
 When the Seminoles announced in New York the purchase of Hard Rock, Max Osceola joked that Indians once sold Manhattan for trinkets but were now ''going to buy Manhattan back, one burger at a time.''
 Not everyone outside the tribe approves of all of the Indian trappings at sporting events, including the tomahawk chop hand gesture and a droning cheer that sounds like background music heard in old western movies.
 Joe Quetone, the executive director of the nonprofit Florida Governor's Council on Indian Affairs Inc., said, ''Things fans do are outrageous and ridiculous.''
 Bobby Bowden, the head football coach, did not respond to four recent requests for comment on the issue placed with the university's sports information department. 
 From a student's perspective, Sanchez said that people who were genuinely concerned with the circumstances of Indians should concentrate less on sports iconography and more on alcoholism, suicide, teen pregnancy and high school dropout rates.
 ''After all those years of diseases, occupation and war, we're still here,'' she said. ''I refuse to believe that a silly mascot will take us down.''

PERSON: Mysore L. Nagaraja

HEADLINE: His Job: Make the Train System Expand on Time

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
FROM his office on the eighth floor of 2 Broadway, near the southern tip of Manhattan, Mysore L. Nagaraja can look out over New York Harbor to the Statue of Liberty. But don't let the view fool you. Mr. Nagaraja's thoughts these days are mostly underground. 
 Take that big hole beneath Mr. Nagaraja's window -- the immense excavation in Battery Park where workers are creating a new South Ferry subway station. As president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Construction Company, Mr. Nagaraja knows everything that goes on inside that hole: how many cubic yards of debris were removed, how thick the concrete slabs will be and above all how to get the work done while the trains keep running. Under his direction, the city's transit system is getting its most ambitious expansion in decades. 
His projects include the South Ferry station, which will replace an antiquated station too small for today's subway trains; a new transit hub at Fulton Street and Broadway; the first phase of a long-awaited new subway line beneath Second Avenue; a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal that will give the railroad's commuters direct access to the East Side of Manhattan; and the extension of the No. 7 subway line to the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
 In the transportation authority's parlance, these are known as the mega-projects, and they have a combined budget of more than $13 billion over the next seven years. ''Mega,'' however, is not a term that would normally come to mind in describing Mr. Nagaraja. A slight, deliberate, gentle-seeming man, he looks younger than his 65 years. That would seem to make him the antithesis of another mega-builder, the burly, brash Robert Moses. 
 But he is no less certain than Moses of the significance of what he is doing. 
 ''I think it's going to change the landscape of the city,'' he said. Once he is finished, the transit system will carry riders farther out to the east and west sides of Manhattan. And his Fulton and South Ferry projects will go a long way toward reviving downtown after the terror attack of Sept. 11, 2001. ''It's going to be a beautiful thing to get to Lower Manhattan,'' he said. He is also in charge of a major effort to make the transit system more secure.
 ''That is the satisfaction I get out of what I'm doing,'' he said.
 Mr. Nagaraja wears monogrammed shirts, bright ties and, frequently, steel-toed boots. These days his preoccupations include some of the biggest digging machines in the world. 
 Once work advances over the next year or two, the Second Avenue project, the No. 7 extension and the Long Island Rail Road connection will employ five tunnel-boring machines, immense contraptions that slowly grind their way through soil or solid rock. Two machines for use on the Long Island connector are already being assembled in Queens. Tunnel boring for the two subway projects will begin in 2008. 
 Mr. Nagaraja was born in India, the youngest of 11 siblings, in the city he was named after. His father, a lawyer active in the Indian movement to win independence from British rule, knew Mahatma Gandhi. In 1967, when he was in his 20s, Mr. Nagaraja came to the United States on a scholarship to study engineering at Brigham Young University, in Utah. Two years later, he got a job at an engineering firm in New York City. The office was at 150 Broadway, a few blocks north of his office today. 
 In the mid-1980s, Mr. Nagaraja took a job with the transportation authority, and by September 2001, he was the chief engineer for New York City Transit. When the twin towers came down, he was given the job of rebuilding more than 1,000 feet of crushed subway tunnel. Service resumed on the No. 1 and 9 lines in Lower Manhattan just after the first anniversary of the attack, far ahead of initial expectations.
 MR. NAGARAJA is hard to ruffle, though if anything seems to bother him it is speculation that he will not be able to complete his big projects without going wildly over budget. Asked about past increases in the budget for the Long Island Rail Road link, his voice took on an uncharacteristic edge. 
 ''Let me correct you,'' he said. He explained that when he took over capital construction in 2003, he was asked to make a thorough review of the Long Island project. Mr. Nagaraja determined that its $5.3 billion estimate was overly optimistic and that it would cost $1 billion more. ''Sitting here today,'' he said, ''the project is still $6.3 billion.'' 
 ''It's very important for the credibility of the organization,'' he said. ''So we have to make sure that when I come up with a number and when I tell my bosses, 'This is the number, this is the schedule,' that we can deliver.'' 
 Of course, there is always the unexpected. No one predicted that workers digging at South Ferry would uncover remnants of Colonial-era buildings. In planning for Fulton Street, he said, no one expected that a booming Manhattan real estate market would force the authority to go more than $100 million over budget to acquire property needed for the project. 
 South Ferry is scheduled for completion in 2008 and the Fulton Street hub in 2009. The other projects are to be finished in 2013. That is when Mr. Nagaraja plans to retire. ''I think it's a nice thing to end my career with.''

HEADLINE: In Minnesota Shift, Case Study For National Political Shake-Up

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
Somehow over the years it became embedded in the culture of the Minnesota Legislature that the party in control of the House of Representatives was entitled to the fourth- and fifth-floor offices across the street from the Capitol.
 The minority party, on the other hand, was relegated to the second and third floors, which are pretty much identical, legislators say, but for the connotations of history.
Now the upstairs-downstairs shift is on. Democrats, having taken power, are even shopping for the best digs on the upper floors while the current occupants are still inside.
 ''It's really a free-for-all,'' said State Representative Nora Slawik, a Democrat from the Minneapolis suburbs. 
 Who ends up where is only the beginning of the tumult under the Capitol dome here as eager new faces and deeply practiced old ones contemplate what Minnesota voters said on Election Day. Money, policy and tactical choices are all in play: how best to spend a $2 billion surplus and address what both parties see as a mandate for improving public education, health care and transportation and for making taxes more fair. 
 Nationally, the Democrats picked up more than 350 seats in state legislatures in November, 25 of them in Minnesota, and gained control of 10 chambers, including the Minnesota House. Two other states shifted either to Republican control or to a tie. The cumulative impact, deeper and broader than any election's since the Republican landslide of 1994, is still unfolding.
 Minnesota's capital is in many ways the perfect petri dish for testing what the nation's new political landscape may produce. Once predictably Democratic in national politics, the anchor of Upper Midwest liberal populism from the 1920s through Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale, Minnesota is now considered a battleground, with the Republicans scheduled to hold their national convention in 2008 in Minneapolis and St. Paul around that declaration. 
 A long tradition of social policy innovation in matters like welfare and health care sits alongside newer forces that are less predictable. Minnesota in recent years has elected as governor Jesse Ventura, an independent, and as senators, Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, and Norm Coleman, a Republican. And some political scholars say that much of the nation's next political direction could be forged here as well. 
 ''Nothing is for certain in Minnesota anymore,'' said Paul C. Light, a professor of political science at New York University, ''and that's a lesson for everybody.'' 
 But if Minnesota's capital, with all of its local quirks and traditions, shows where the election's wave may lead, it also confounds much of what may be expected. 
 The Democrats won big here -- taking the House for the first time since 1998, expanding their majority in the Senate, winning the secretary of state's and attorney general's offices and nearly defeating Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican. 
 But they emerged divided, too, owing much of their surge to newly elected moderates from the suburbs who are unlikely to embrace a pure liberal agenda. The Republicans lost big, but were pushed toward the center as well, led by Mr. Pawlenty, who has said since the election that many of his second-term priorities will overlap with those of the Democrats he fiercely battled in his first four years.
 And those pincer forces, both pushing toward the political center, will set the stage for everything to come when the Legislature convenes in January, elected officials and political experts here say. In the first Pawlenty term, a $4.5 billion budget shortfall was resolved through deep cuts in spending for health care, education and other programs, capped by a bitter shutdown of the government in 2005 when Mr. Pawlenty and the Legislature could not agree.
 The fight of 2007 will revolve around restoring some of the cut programs, and how far to go beyond that in pushing what both parties say is pent-up demand for property tax relief and for spending increases on education, health care and transportation. 
 One of the first tests could be a Democratic Party plan to extend health care benefits to 70,000 low-income children not covered by the MinnesotaCare program. That alone would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 And the magnifying glass of national politics hovers at the backdrop of everything. 
 Mr. Pawlenty, a 46-year-old son of working-class South St. Paul, is frequently mentioned as a possible contender for vice president in 2008. Senator John McCain of Arizona, a likely Republican presidential candidate, has already come to call since the election, offering praise and congratulations.
 ''The dynamic is one we've never had -- not in my lifetime, anyway,'' said Wyman L. Spano, a former lobbyist, now director of the Center for Advocacy and Political Leadership at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. 
 ''On the one hand, I see Democrats who are very much wanting not to look like classic Democrats, not wanting to raise taxes,'' Mr. Spano said. ''The flip side of the coin is that this governor really wants to get along because he'd like to have a nice high approval rating going into that convention.''
 Mr. Pawlenty, known for a sharp tongue and a sharper wit (he once quipped to a political opponent that ''everybody has the right to be wrong, but you do abuse the privilege''), barely kept his job in November, winning by a margin of about 22,000 votes of 2.2 million cast. 
 In an interview in his dark-wood-paneled office in the Capitol, its large windows giving a sweeping view of the city, Mr. Pawlenty said the election had to be read as new marching orders for every Republican. 
 ''Republicans love to talk about markets -- well, the market just told Republicans something,'' he said. ''The market just told them, 'We're not interested much in your product, and we're choosing to go to your competitor.' We need to hear that message.''
 One seemingly odd result of Minnesota's political shift, scholars and people in both parties say, is that the new Democratic majority, in keeping to a middle-ground agenda that its moderate members can support, could raise Mr. Pawlenty's profile in the process. 
 The incoming speaker of the House, Margaret Anderson Kelliher, a Democrat from Minneapolis, said she had no problem with that. If the governor's interests mesh with the Democratic majority's, for whatever reason, Ms. Kelliher said, it will be a victory for Minnesota.
 ''He has a real incentive to make his next four years work and gain some national attention,'' she said. ''Making this a state that gets things done will garner him national attention, and us, too.'' 
 Ms. Kelliher, who grew up on a dairy farm and can still recite the rhymes about cheese that she learned in 4-H, said her election as speaker reflected Democratic efforts to balance the factions of rural and urban, progressive and moderate in the caucus.
 So does the party's legislative plan, she said, called the ''stick to the basics agenda,'' which was put forward by Democrats at the Minnesota State Fair, before the election. Its goals were outlined on homey hand-held signs in the shape of the state, promising to improve public education, increase access to health care and provide property tax relief.
 How far the Democrats go with their ''basics'' agenda will be the real test in the year to come, political scholars say.
 ''This is not a progressive or liberal majority; the seats they picked up are in moderate or conservative districts,'' said Lawrence R. Jacobs, a professor of political scienceand director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. 
 ''The Democratic leadership is very much aware that they've got to be careful, that if they go for what they want in their heart of hearts they may end up with a two-year run.''
 But there is also still vehement debate here about what the voters were really saying on Election Day. 
 The departing speaker, Steve Sviggum, a Republican who will begin his 15th two-year term in the House when the session starts Jan. 3, said that in reading the election, Minnesota Republicans would be wrong to abandon their message of fiscal restraint and economic freedom or to see the vote as an endorsement of all things Democratic.
 ''It was about George W. Bush,'' Mr. Sviggum said in his office, which was lined with boxes ready for his move downstairs. 
 Governor Pawlenty seems to go further in his interpretation. The message, he said recently at a news conference in talking about the road ahead, is that people want certain basic things from government, and ''other than that,'' he added, they want government to ''get out of my face,'' an indication that socially conservative debates about abortion or same-sex marriage will not find center stage in his next term.
 ''I'm a Midwestern governor from a state that prides itself on a certain measure of populism, not to be confused with liberalism, but populism meaning stuff that helps people,'' Mr. Pawlenty said in an interview. ''That's what we've got to stand up for.''
 But the camaraderie of a Legislature that still prides itself on citizen-lawmaker traditions -- and enough old Scandinavian names to require a handy pronunciation list in the legislative guide book -- is not to be underestimated in shaping how the new terrain in St. Paul might unfold.
 Representative Kathy Tingelstad, a fourth-floor Republican, recently learned, for example, that when she goes downstairs, Ms. Slawik, a friend from across the aisle whose family goes to the same Y.M.C.A. camp each summer with the Tingelstads, will be taking her space. That has made Ms. Tingelstad happy.
 ''It's nice to know,'' she said. ''Nora will be a good caretaker.''

As St. Paul Goes
 This is the first in an occasional series of articles that will examine state government in Minnesota, one of several states in which Democrats made gains in the November elections.

To the Editor:
 ''Arizona Displaces Nevada as Fastest-Growing State'' (news article, Dec. 22) depicts the economic pull driving growth in urban Arizona. 
 My family and I recently spent nearly a decade in Tempe, Ariz. One of Arizona's economic draws, low property taxes, is a myth when you consider that outside affluent areas most schools are mediocre at best. We paid dearly for private schooling.
Here in Trumansburg, N.Y., we pay substantially higher property taxes, but the public school is excellent. Add the clean air, low crime, and a sense of culture and community that comes from living in a long-established place, and we are glad to have migrated from Arizona.

HEADLINE: Waiting List for AIDS Drugs Causes Dismay in South Carolina

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
More than 350 poor people infected with H.I.V. are on a waiting list for free life-saving drugs in South Carolina, by far the longest such list in the country. 
 Four people waiting for drugs supplied by the state have died, said Lynda Kettinger, the director of the state health department's H.I.V. division, and the wait is six months to a year.
The list is so long largely because the Legislature's contribution to the drug program is relatively tiny -- less than one-twentieth of North Carolina's, for example -- even though South Carolina has the ninth-highest AIDS rate and the fifth-highest H.I.V. infection rate among states that record such data. 
 ''There's only two ways to get off of the wait list right now,'' said Karen Bates, one of a group of South Carolina H.I.V. patients who have demanded that the state take emergency action. ''One of them is if somebody else dies and you get their slot. The other is if you die.'' 
 The program serves about 1,300 people a month, and patients are eligible for it if they are uninsured and cannot afford the drugs, which cost an average of $885 a month. State officials say it would cost South Carolina $3 million to clear the waiting list. The only other state with such a list right now, Alaska, has 13 people waiting. The number of states with waiting lists fluctuates. 
 Kelly Jepson, 43, who is on the South Carolina waiting list, said the uncertainty had only added to the stress of being homeless, unemployed and a recovering drug user. 
 ''I was trying to keep a job, pay for methadone, pay for a place to live, and I just couldn't swing it all,'' Ms. Jepson said, adding that she had recently been hospitalized for 10 days. ''Dementia has set in, my short-term memory is really bad, and because of neuropathy I've had a couple of bad falls.''
 Another AIDS patient on the waiting list who had agreed to be interviewed from his hospital bed, could not be reached because he had gone into intensive care.
 Most of the money for the medication programs, known as the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, comes from the federal government, supplemented by the states. In the South, the only region of the country where the number of AIDS deaths continues to rise, some state contributions have increased greatly. 
 North Carolina, which once had a waiting list of more than 800 people, now pays for 40 percent of its drug program, contributing $11 million a year. Georgia pays for 26 percent of the program, or $12 million. South Carolina's contribution, by contrast, has stayed at 3 percent, or $500,000 a year, even as demand has increased and federal financing has stayed flat. 
 Clair Boatwright, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina health department, said the department would request $3 million in supplemental money for the remainder of this fiscal year and a $4.5 million increase in annual financing when the Legislature convened on Jan. 9. Right now, Ms. Boatwright said, the department has no emergency money available to reduce the waiting list and no uncommitted cash to shift to the drug program.
 State lawmakers said the paltry contribution to AIDS financing was less because of conscious opposition on the part of Republicans, who controlled the Legislature, and more because there had been no strong push for an increase. 
 ''I don't think it was an issue where these guys were opposed to it,'' said Representative Leon Howard, a Columbia Democrat who has served on the health committee for 12 years and recently became its chairman.
 Mr. Howard said he could not recall a debate over AIDS money. 
 Because of the budget shortfall, state health officials, doctors and AIDS workers have begun preparing what they said was the first organized campaign to push AIDS financing onto the legislative agenda. Leading the effort is Representative Joseph H. Neal, a Democrat whose district includes Columbia. State financing has lagged, Mr. Neal said, not because of strong political opposition, but because the issue has remained low profile, and legislators do not understand that a lack of treatment translates into higher costs in hospitalization and lost productivity.
 ''To be honest with you, I think it's seen as a black disease, it's a poor people's disease, and it's easy to put these kinds of issues that are seen in that light out of mind,'' said Mr. Neal, who is black. ''These are people that are politically impotent and are not seen as part of the mainstream.''
 Carmen Julious, director of Palmetto AIDS Life Support Services in Columbia, agreed that ignorance played a crucial role. 
 ''You would be surprised at state and federal legislators who understand AIDS in Africa,'' Ms. Julious said, ''but they don't know anything about AIDS in South Carolina.''
 AIDS activism has long been surrounded by a debate over how confrontational advocates should be, and the South Carolina situation is no exception. The four deaths threw a wrench into the carefully laid lobbying plan, drawing protesters from outside the state and, in a place where the disease still carries a stigma so heavy that patients often do not tell their own family that they are infected, prodding H.I.V. and AIDS patients to speak out even after some groups advised them to wait. 
 ''I'm tired of being quiet about it,'' said Kiah Graham, 24, who said he was on the waiting list. ''All it's going to take is one cold, or pneumonia, and it's over with.''
 Bambi Gaddist, director of the South Carolina H.I.V./AIDS Council, and others in the coalition were quick to point out that there was no way of knowing whether the four deaths were caused by lack of drugs. Because of poverty, scarce money for testing and prevention, and the secrecy surrounding the disease, many H.I.V. infections in South Carolina are not discovered until they are already in the late stages, they said, making them more difficult to treat. 
 State health officials said that all but 10 of the people on the waiting list were now on so-called patient assistance programs, a stop-gap measure in which drug companies provide free medications for a limited time. If a patient needs drugs from more than one manufacturer, an application must be submitted to each, and experts say many do not get all the drugs they need, reducing the effectiveness of those they do get. 
 The state began training caseworkers to complete the paperwork for the programs last summer when the waiting list started, Ms. Kettinger said, but she could not say how long it took until people began receiving drugs. She also declined to say if the four who died were receiving drugs through such a program.
 The waiting list is only the most visible symptom of the lack of financing for AIDS prevention and treatment in South Carolina, where poor rural counties are among those with the highest rates of transmission and the biggest stigma. 
 ''That's just the focus right now,'' said Stephanie Williams, who is H.I.V. positive and a founder of the South Carolina Campaign to End AIDS. ''You have housing issues, you have transportation issues, you have clinics where the doctors don't want to touch people. We have all kinds of problems.''

HEADLINE: Farmers Are Wooed To Help Food Makers Reduce Trans Fat

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: DENISON, Iowa 

 BODY:
With some restaurants and even the city of New York swearing off trans fat, Monsanto recently sent representatives here with a mission: persuade farmers to grow a special kind of soybean that produces a valuable alternative to frying oil laden with trans fat.
 The company and its local soybean processor offered the farmers doughnuts and a simple pitch: an extra 35 cents a bushel to grow the special soybeans, instead of regular ones, and seemingly unlimited demand. The special soybeans contain less of the fatty linolenic acid than other soybeans.
 Some liked the offer, but others were not so sure, given the extra work involved and the allure of planting high-priced corn instead to feed the ethanol boom. 
 ''I think that the reason that farmers are not catching on to these 'low-lin' soybeans is the premium is not quite enough,'' said Fred Tilstra, a 69-year-old farmer in Steen, Minn. 
 As it now stands, there are not nearly enough of the special beans to fill the surging demand. That has created a tricky situation for major fast-food chains and manufacturers who want to stop using partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, a food industry workhorse that is the source of artificial trans fat.
 The reluctance of farmers is only one part of the problem. Monsanto and its competitors have not been able to create new varieties of trans-fat-free soybeans fast enough to meet the demand for more varied uses. And the situation is only going to get worse: in the three weeks since New York City announced it would ban trans fat from its restaurants, several major cities and some states, including California, have begun considering similar measures.
 ''Everybody knows the situation; you just can't pull this stuff out of a sock,'' said Kelly Brintle, senior vice president of Ventura Foods, a California company that processes and sells edible oils and is also trying to persuade farmers to produce a lot more of the special soybeans. ''Our phones are ringing off the wall.''
 Trans fat, which is in foods as diverse as cookies and French fries, is created when food manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil, a process called hydrogenation, to increase the shelf life of food and stabilize flavors. For several decades, it was considered a healthier alternative to butter and tropical oils, which contain saturated fats.
 But in the 1990s, scientists became convinced that trans fat was more dangerous than the fats it replaced. Not only does it raise the level of unhealthy cholesterol, it lowers the level of the kind of cholesterol that is considered desirable. 
 A strange twist to the current supply squeeze for trans-fat-free soybean oil is that the seeds were created more than a decade ago, but for years, there were no buyers. One seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, finally stopped research on new varieties in 1999 because of the dismal prospects.
 ''We waited and waited,'' said Russ Sanders, marketing director at Pioneer, which is now part of DuPont. ''Now the market is expanding faster than we can keep up.''
 As a result, seed companies and oil manufacturers are offering farmers 21 cents to 80 cents a bushel extra to grow the low-linolenic soybeans.
 Monsanto has made arrangements with 14 processing plants across the Midwestern corn belt to process the beans next year, and it has held several meetings with neighboring farmers at each plant to make their sales pitch. 
 ''Our guys are working really hard to sign up as many growers as possible, but obviously there are challenges,'' said Christopher R. Horner, a Monsanto spokesman.
 This year, farmers planted about three-quarters of a million acres of low-linolenic soybeans, about a third to a half of what is needed to meet the demand, said Steven W. Poole, a spokesman for Qualisoy, an association that researches and promotes soybeans with enhanced traits. 
 Ultimately, Mr. Poole anticipates that as many as five million acres of low-linolenic soybeans could be planted in the United States as more partially hydrogenated oils are replaced.
 The soybeans are not the only alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Some food companies have already switched to palm oil, canola oil or sunflower oil, all products that are growing rapidly. Given the difference between supply and demand, prices have risen for many of these oils as well.
 But palm oil is high in saturated fats, so health advocates argue that using it substitutes one problem for another. The other oils have their supporters -- Frito-Lay uses corn oil and sunflower oil, for example, while Wendy's uses a soybean-corn blend and Taco Bell recently switched to trans-fat-free canola oil.
 But many of the alternatives are more expensive than soybean oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the edible oils consumed in the United States.
 KFC decided to move away from partially hydrogenated soybean oil about three years ago. After testing a variety of oils and getting its food purchasing cooperative to line up farmers to grow low-lin soybeans, the fried chicken chain finally announced the switch in October.
 ''The soybean oils were the best fit for us because the flavor profile was closest to our original recipe,'' said Laurie Schalow, a spokeswoman for the company, which is a division of Yum Brands.
 McDonald's is still trying to figure out how to reduce trans fat in its cooking oil, even as pressure mounts from critics and governments intent on banning it. The company announced in 2002 that it was reducing trans fat in its frying oil, but it has struggled to find an adequate substitute that does not change the taste of its French fries.
 The trick for creating alternatives to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is maintaining the ability to be heated -- or in the case of frying, reheated -- without ruining the taste or texture of foods. Low-lin soybeans are popular because their oil can be repeatedly reheated without changing the flavor of foods much, if at all. But while it often works in fast-food restaurants, where the fried food is served promptly, the oil is not as successful in products that require a longer shelf life.
 A much larger market depends on several soybean seeds that are not yet available in large quantities: increased-oleic soybeans for processed foods like cookies and chips and increased-oleic, high-stearate soybeans for baked goods like cakes and pies.
 The holy grail remains finding a trans-fat-free soybean shortening for baked goods with just enough saturated fat to remain solid.
 ''To make a nice biscuit or a nice cake, you have to have a solid fat,'' said Bill Hitz, director of food and feed research at Pioneer. ''You need some saturates.''
 All of this, of course, is good news for Iowa's farmers, who should benefit from new varieties of soybeans that offer premiums. Those fortunate enough to live close to both an ethanol plant and a soybean plant that processes low-linolenic beans find themselves in a relatively rare circumstance: choosing between high-priced soybeans or higher-priced corn, at least as long as the ethanol boom continues.
 ''It's going to be a real hard decision for farmers,'' said Paul Bruett, a sales representative for BB& P Feed and Grain in Winterset, Iowa. ''Right now, the economic return is better for corn. So it's going to be a real tug of war as we get closer to planting season.''
 He estimated that corn would return $60 to $100 more an acre than low-linolenic soybeans.
 But not every farmer in Iowa has that choice.
 James Devin, 35, of Knoxville, Iowa, said farmers south of Interstate 80, where he lives, generally have to rotate growing corn and soybeans because the land is rolling and prone to erosion, so it cannot support corn year after year. Mr. Devin said a 50-cent a bushel premium was easy money, since all he had to do was keep the low-linolenic beans separate from his conventional soybeans. 
 ''Here's your chance to increase your revenue by 50 cents without really doing anything,'' he said. ''The yields are about the same or better. I'd say they are my best bean.''
 But he acknowledged that most of his neighbors had not planted low-linolenic soybeans because of the inconvenience of keeping the beans separate and transporting them separately for processing.
 While Mr. Tilstra, from Steen, Minn., used to grow half soybeans and half corn, he now plants two-thirds of his land with corn. For soybeans, he said, ''the premium is 21 cents. We're not going to do a lot of work for that. You'll always go corn unless that premium is outlandish, $1 or $1.25.'' 
 Kenneth Fawcett, 57, of West Branch, Iowa, said he, too, is the exception in his part of eastern Iowa. He has planted low-lin soybeans for three years and collected premiums as high as 80 cents a bushel because his soybeans are not genetically modified to be herbicide-resistant, and thus can be sold at a higher price.
 But he said most of his neighbors are more likely to plant corn or regular soybeans because low-linolenic soybeans are too much work. In addition to the need to keep them separate, he said, the processing plant accepts them only a couple of days each month.
 ''I think a lot of people want to grow the beans because it's the right thing,'' Mr. Fawcett said, but, ''the economics have to be there to reward them.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption in Business Day on Dec. 29 about an effort to persuade farmers to grow a low-linolenic soybean, which produces cooking oil with reduced or no trans fat, referred imprecisely to the qualities of the soybean. Oil from the low-linolenic soybeans has many of the same characteristics of regular cooking oil with less need for hydrogenation, a process that creates trans fat. Soybeans themselves do not contain trans fat.

One of James Devin's soybean fields in Knoxville, Iowa, is prepared for growing corn next year. Mr. Devin says farmers in his area rotate corn and soybeans because the land is prone to erode on a steady diet of corn.
Low-linolenic soy beans are delivered for processing in Creston, Iowa. Some farmers say these beans are too much trouble because only certain processors will take them, and then sometimes only a few days a month.

HEADLINE: Opposites Pull Together in Overhauling Mercantile Exchange

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
As president and chief executive of Nymex Holdings, James E. Newsome, was fiddling with his sportcoat buttons on a December afternoon in preparation for a photograph, the chairman, Richard Schaeffer, eyed him for a second, and then offered him some fashion advice.
 ''Keep it buttoned,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''You want to look slimmer.'' 
Mr. Newsome laughed. The jacket was buttoned.
 They are, by their own acknowledgement, the odd couple in commodities: Mr. Schaeffer is the loud and plainspoken Long Island native with an occasional blue streak; Mr. Newsome, a quiet, self-described farm boy from Florida. About the only personal quality they have in common is that their daughters compete in equestrian events. 
 ''I'm the hard-lined businessman in the relationship,'' Mr. Schaeffer said, laughing. ''I'm the bottom-line guy. Jim is the C.E.O. who runs operations and gets people to work together.''
 Yet the two men insist that they run the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, one of the largest marketplaces for energy and metals trading, as partners. Their offices at the exchange's headquarters in Manhattan are less than a hundred feet apart, and they share the same secretary. And they have worked closely together to transform the 134-year-old Nymex into a public company, one of the last exchanges in the United States to do so.
 ''I like to say that this is a 134-year-old institution that just found itself over the past year,'' Mr. Schaeffer said.
 So far, it has also found success. Nymex's initial public offering on Nov. 17 was the among the most successful of 2006. The exchange's share price more than doubled on its first day of trading, jumping to $132.99 from its $59 opening price. (The stock closed yesterday at $122.40.)
 Now, Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome are looking for further growth, though both men were silent about whether Nymex might seek a merger partner. In April, Nymex signed a deal to list its energy futures and options contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Globex electronic exchange, supplanting its own smaller system. And two weeks ago, Nymex announced the introduction of its new reinsurance contracts, which will allow for the trading of property damage risk exposures.
 The exchange will also continue work on the start of the Oman crude oil futures contract, a project with the Dubai government. Mr. Newsome said the contract was three years in the making and one that could play a significant role in Asian markets.
 ''That will be our crown jewel,'' he said. ''It's something no one's ever done before.''
 Staying competitive will be the challenge as electronic trading, consolidation and new products transform the world's exchanges. Nymex had long been the leader in energy trading, but earlier this year, its younger rival, the InterContinental Exchange, or ICE, introduced an all-electronic trading operation for energy contracts and quickly swiped a big share of that market from Nymex. 
 With the introduction of its own electronic-trading system via the Globex network, Nymex regained much of that. But as ICE prepares to acquire the New York Board of Trade, it remains a fierce rival for Nymex's business. 
 Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome first came together over how to fight off ICE. The two men had taken different roads to Nymex. 
 For Mr. Schaeffer, the chairmanship was the culmination of more than two decades working at the exchange: he first joined in 1981, buying a seat at the behest of a friend who taught him how to trade commodities. The former accountant worked at trading companies like the Chicago Corporation and the energy trading operation of ABN Amro. He became Nymex's treasurer in 1993 and vice chairman in 2004.
 Mr. Newsome took a more circuitous route. After growing up in Plant City, Fla., he studied food and resource economics, eventually becoming a professor at Mississippi State University and then a cattle trade executive. But it was not until 1998, when he joined the Commodity Futures TradingCommission, the federal regulator of futures exchanges like Nymex, that Mr. Newsome seriously entered the world of commodities trading.
 He then began serving as director in 2000, just as Congress broadened the mandate of the commission and just before the Enron scandal exploded. Mr. Newsome said he then began working with Nymex both to put in place the agency's new rules and to investigate the nature of Enron's energy-trading operation. 
 After his term was up in 2004, he was approached by Vincent Viola, then Nymex's chairman, who told the commissioner that he could do some good at the exchange.
 ''I was in such shock that I didn't tell my wife at first when I got home,'' he said.
 When he arrived, Mr. Newsome said he did not know Mr. Schaeffer particularly well. But the two found that they had a similar idea of how to shore up Nymex's position against the ICE. 
 Supported by the private-equity firm General Atlantic, which took a 10 percent stake in Nymex last year, the two began talking with members to gain support for their plan, intended to provide the exchange with the freedom and the capital to compete against its nimbler competitors.
 But other Nymex members saw things differently. The shift to a public company demanded a smaller board. Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome also sought to push for more electronic trading, alongside the open-outcry system of specialists' shouting orders that had long characterized the exchange's operations. Combined, the moves represented a sea change for the exchange.
 ''Culturally, some people were very dug into the current process,'' Mr. Newsome said. ''There was some pushback every step of the way.''
 One longtime Nymex trader, Daniel Dicker, spoke out this year about his concerns over the exchange's future. Today, he says that he is fine with the progress Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Newsome have made.
 ''They've taken on some very difficult decisions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Estimates For Pensions To Tighten

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The states of New York, New Hampshire, Tennessee and about a dozen other governments may no longer be able to say their pension funds are fully funded no matter how the markets perform.
 Accounting rule makers have proposed an amendment that would force these governments to provide a more realistic estimate of how much they owe retirees over time. They would also have to compare this with the assets they have set aside, showing whether they have enough to make good on their promises.
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent body that sets the rules for state and local governments, is also proposing that an outside auditor be required to vet this new financial snapshot. That is not now required of the pension funds that would be affected by the rule change, believed to make up about 8 percent of the nation's public pension funds.
 ''That's just the first step,'' said Timothy S. Lucas, a former research director for the accounting board's sister organization, the Financial Accounting Standards Board. He oversaw that body's slow and tortured efforts years ago to issue pension accounting rules for corporations. 
 ''Small changes are important,'' said Mr. Lucas, who now has his own consulting firm in Connecticut. ''A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.'' 
 It is not yet clear whether the rule change will give rise to any big new pension shortfalls in New York or elsewhere. The new rule is expected to take effect near the end of 2007, and the market conditions prevailing then will determine whether any shortfalls -- or surpluses -- appear.
 Officials representing the New York State pension funds say they stand behind the existing financial report. But, they added, if there were changes, the effects would not be damaging.
 The rule change would also force the incoming governor, Eliot Spitzer, to modify his previous assertion that the state pension fund ''is fully funded,'' and that the numbers his predecessors issued were accurate.
 The method Albany has been using ''doesn't provide adequate information for disclosure purposes,'' said David R. Bean, director of research and technical activities for the government accounting board, known as GASB and pronounced ''gaz-b.''
 New York City, meanwhile, will not be directly affected by the proposed rule change, because it does not use the same method of tracking its pension fund as New York State and the others in the affected group. But New York City's unique methodology also greatly distorts its pension fund's appearance, experts agree. 
 The city's chief actuary, Robert C. North, suggested that the city might voluntarily provide the same type of numbers the accounting board will be requiring the state to report. He declined to be specific, saying he had not had a chance to study the accounting proposal yet, or discuss it with the city's pension trustees. 
 Perhaps more important than the proposed rule change, GASB said it was beginning to research other possible changes in pension accounting, long one of the most controversial areas of financial reporting.
 The board is responding to mounting concern about whether the benefits being promised to retired public workers are being accurately measured. Because employee compensation is usually a big part of government budgets, miscalculating benefits can cause significant problems.
 Officials could award benefits that are unaffordably rich, for instance, or unions could sign off on benefits plans that are not really secure. Local residents may not understand why taxes are going up. Credit analysts might rate municipal bonds inaccurately. 
 Similar problems have already come to light with the pension accounting rules for the private sector -- the ones Mr. Lucas helped to draft. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission told the rule makers to make improvements. 
 The S.E.C. has not delved into accounting rules for the public sector, but other authorities are venturing in. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, has been studying the rules for public pensions and retiree health plans at the request of the Senate Finance Committee. The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board issued a proposal in October for making public pension disclosures more comparable from one country to another. 
 Closer to home, the New York State Insurance Department has been reviewing the public pension funds in the state, over which it has regulatory authority. 
 The governmental accounting board has no legal authority to enforce the rules it issues, and must therefore rely on each pension fund's outside auditor to provide monitoring and enforcement. But the outside auditor's ability to be a whistle-blower is severely limited by client confidentiality rules. 
 The audit industry itself got its own oversight body, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, after the scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other companies in 2002. But this new watchdog has no jurisdiction over the auditors working for governments.
 Jack R. Buchmiller, a risk management specialist with the New York State Insurance Department, said he had taken a professional and personal interest in the controversy over pension measurements -- particularly the question of whether the sector is habitually underestimating its obligations to retirees through the use of faulty actuarial methods and assumptions. 
 Public pension plans usually make assumptions about their investment income over the long term, then use these assumptions to measure the value, in today's dollars, of the benefits they must pay in the future. Many economists consider this practice incorrect, and corporate pension plans are not permitted to use it. 
 ''It's circular logic,'' Mr. Buchmiller said.
 Pension funds in the private sector are required instead to measure their obligations using a conservative bond rate. The thinking is that an interest rate associated with a safe bond is appropriate because the pensions themselves are supposed to be safe. 
 Mr. Buchmiller, who worked on Wall Street before going to work for the state, has been completing a study of what the nation's public pension funds would look like if they were required to calculate their obligations in a way closer to what corporate plans must do -- though he noted that economists criticize corporate pension measurements, too. A draft of his paper, which he hopes to publish in a financial journal, showed that when potentially misleading investment assumptions were replaced with conservative bond rates, tens of billions of dollars worth of unfunded obligations appeared. 
 Mr. Buchmiller stressed that the views expressed in his paper were his own, and his calculations should not be taken as a sign of any coming regulatory changes.
 For now, the only imminent change is the one being proposed by GASB for the New York State pension fund and others like it. The board will be receiving public comments on the proposal until the end of February.
 The rule change takes aim at a type of pension calculation that makes public pension funds look fully funded at all times. Normally, values float up and down in response to changes in the financial markets. 
 Actuaries use the calculation at issue as a tool for tracking pension costs over time and helping local governments decide how much money to put into their pension funds each year. Experts say the calculation -- called the aggregate cost method -- is a good one for that purpose because it tends to force governments to put money behind their pension promises more quickly. 
 The accounting board is not disputing that. But it said that when the numbers generated by the aggregate cost method were picked up by accountants and included in annual reports, they often ended up being misinterpreted.
 If New York City were to voluntarily follow the proposed new method, it could reduce the friction that became apparent last summer, after a report in The New York Times cited accounting experts who said the city's pension disclosures were not compliant with the rules. 
 New York City maintains that there is nothing wrong with its pension accounting.
 When asked about the accounting proposal, Mr. North, the city's chief actuary, said he would reserve comment until he had had a chance to study it. 
 ''The New York City Retirement Systems, and the City of New York,'' he said, ''have always followed and will continue to follow the GASB rules and provide whatever information GASB requires, and more.'' 
 That suggested the way to a truce, in which New York City could start disclosing the type of numbers the accounting board will be making the state provide -- while continuing to disclose the type of numbers it already publishes.
 Because of his own concerns about the confusion that actuarial methods can cause, Mr. North has already been offering additional pension values as a supplement for the last few years. He is believed to be the only actuary for any public pension fund to report the financial condition of its fund on a market basis -- the sort of calculation Mr. Buchmiller has been trying to devise.
 New York City's most recent supplementary numbers showed a $49 billion shortfall. Mr. North's calculations for the fiscal year that ended last June are scheduled to appear in January.

PERSON: Edwin David Edwards

HEADLINE: Edwin Edwards, 62, Figure In Citibank Currency Case

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Edwin David Edwards, whose accusations of improper currency transactions at Citibank mired it in scandal, died Dec. 21 at a hospice care center near his home in Wichita Falls, Tex. He was 62. 
 The cause was cancer, his brother, Mark Edwards said.
 Mr. Edwards, known as David, was the Citibank employee at the center of the so-called Edwards Affair in the late 1970s to early 1980s that raised questions about the bank's foreign exchange trading practices and eventually entangled the company under the watch of its chairman, Walter Wriston. 
 In 1975, Mr. Edwards, then a junior executive, accused a senior trader of taking kickbacks and suggested that Citibank was improperly shifting, or ''parking,'' profits from European currency transactions to countries like the Bahamas where they would be taxed at lower rates. He also accused Citibank of booking false transactions through its Bahamas branch.
 Though Citibank brushed off his concerns and eventually fired Mr. Edwards, his suspicions triggered eight years of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and six European regulators. The S.E.C. ultimately declined to take action, and other investigations cleared the trader of the kickback charges and caused Citibank to pay back taxes and minor fines. 
 But the author, Phillip L. Zweig, noted in his 1995 biography of Mr. Wriston that the episode was the wake-up call or more accurately, the bomb blast, that signaled that the bank's size had far outpaced its ability to manage itself. 
 In his 30 years as an international banker, Mr. Edwards was known as much for his expertise in operating in global markets as for his diverse set of friends. During his career, he developed close relationships with central bankers in North Africa as well as Saudi government officials and merchant families.
 His circle of friends included authors, restaurateurs, professors and even a future president. As a banker in London, he met a young Bill Clinton who was studying at the University of Oxford at one of the gatherings Mr. Edwards held at his London apartment. 
 Mr. Clinton became a frequent houseguest and a close friend for nearly 40 years.
 Mr. Edwards was born in Wichita Falls, on Aug. 23, 1944, and after attending the University of Texas and Midwestern University in Wichita Falls, he studied at the London School of Economics. He began his Citibank career in the early 1970s. 
 In 1986, he initiated an international banking group for Stephens Inc., an investment bank based in Little Rock, Ark.; and in 1990, he and his brother, Mark, founded Edwards Brothers, an investment placement firm. His ties to Saudi officials helped establish a Middle Eastern Studies Center at the University of Arkansas.
 Mr. Edwards is survived by his mother, Katherine Edwards of Wichita Falls; his brother, Robert, of Los Angeles; his sister, Katherine McGregor of Wichita Falls; and his brother Mark, of Wichita Falls.

HEADLINE: Despite a Lull At Holidays, Beirut Digs In For a Struggle 

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Nada Bakri contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
Sleigh bells jingled, Christmas carols blared from loudspeakers and dancing Santa Clauses and street vendors offering Christmas trinkets lent downtown Beirut the feel of a Christmas fair for much of this week. 
 If not for the razor wire and heavily armed soldiers ringing much of the area and the posters of the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, one could almost have forgotten the continuing crisis in this country.
But even the Christmas celebration turned political. 
 ''We are Muslims and Christians standing together to tell the world this is Lebanon,'' a speaker with the opposition Free Patriotic Movement announced, shortly before the cutting of a cake about 30 yards long in celebration of Christmas on Monday night. ''The future is ours, and after the feast, we will resume our protest until victory.''
 Almost one month since Hezbollah and Christian opposition parties took over the center of Beirut seeking to bring down the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, they have dug in for a long fight. After the war between Hezbollah and Israel during the summer, from which Hezbollah emerged stronger and the Lebanese government weaker, Hezbollah and its allies -- Christian groups and a Druse group that were once mortal enemies -- began to press for more power. 
 In Riyadh al Solh square, where protesters have camped out in a tent city, Hezbollah and its allies are demanding that Mr. Siniora resign and are saying he should be put on trial for treason and corruption. Last week, they ratcheted up their demands, calling for early parliamentary elections. Up above in the Grand Serail, the government headquarters, Mr. Siniora, urged to stand firm by Saudi Arabia and the United States, shows no signs of wavering, insisting that Hezbollah and its allies come off the streets and return to the negotiating table. 
 ''Their sit-in did not produce what they thought it would,'' said Marwan Hamadeh, minister of telecommunications, who predicted the crisis could last until Lebanon's presidential elections next November. ''They simply cannot win.''
 The rallies have been muted in recent days so families could celebrate Christmas or prepare for Id al-Adha, the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice, at the weekend. But opposition leaders threaten to raise the pitch next week, suggesting that they may block highways and access to Beirut's airport.
 The business of governing Lebanon has come to a virtual halt, with President Emile Lahoud unwilling to consider any legislation offered by the cabinet, the cabinet unwilling to speak to Mr. Lahoud, and the speaker of Parliament, the Shiite Amal leader Nabih Berri, unwilling to convene a session or speak to the president. Opposition members of Parliament walked out in late November and have not returned. 
 ''Each side is supported by people that don't want them to give up a thing,'' said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, speaking of both internal and foreign backers. ''It's becoming more likely that a very long, drawn-out stalemate will take hold.'' 
 Gradually, Mr. Salem and others here say, Beirutis are growing used to the demonstrations in the center of town, finding ways around the traffic snarl the protests have caused, and feeling less urgency to resolve the standoff. Some restaurants are asking their patrons -- and individual Lebanese are asking their friends -- not to discuss politics.
 ''The easiest thing for people to do now is to postpone, to stall,'' Mr. Salem said. 
 Hezbollah and its allies took to the streets on Dec. 1 after the governing coalition led by Mr. Siniora rejected their demands. They set upon the center of Beirut with a noisy but peaceful protest mirroring the one led by the March 14 movement last year that forced Syria out of Lebanon and swept its leaders into power. 
 Much like the March 14 movement, the opposition has sought to emphasize its sectarian mix, insisting it represents the true Lebanese. 
 The protests continue to sap Lebanon's economy, already damaged by Israel's bombardment of the country during the summer. Store owners in downtown Beirut briefly opened this week but they saw few customers.
 ''We will carry on with this campaign until we topple the government,'' said Nabil Nicola, a Parliament member with the Free Patriotic Movement of Michel Aoun, a Christian allied with the opposition. ''We still have not used all the peaceful weapons available to us, and it's just the beginning of the road.'' 
 On Saturday, Amr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League, said he had been unable to negotiate a solution in two weeks of shuttle diplomacy but promised to resume his efforts after the Muslim holiday. He said the impasse had been made worse by the fact that the sides refused to communicate with each other. Hezbollah accuses him of backing the governing coalition. 
 ''Unfortunately Amr Moussa was taking a side during his last round of negotiations and unfortunately some Arab countries are taking sides too, but there are talks about a new, less biased Arab initiative,'' said Nawar Sahili, one of Hezbollah's members of Parliament. ''We are hoping it will solve the crisis.''
 Analysts and officials close to the discussion said the most contentious issue remains a bill rushed through to Parliament days after the opposition walked out. The ruling coalition has a majority in Parliament but Mr. Berri has refused to hold a meeting of Parliament. The bill calls for formation of an international tribunal with sweeping powers to prosecute suspects implicated in the February 2005 assassination of the former prime minister, Rafiq Hariri, and other assassinations. 
 Mr. Moussa, speaking to reporters in Beirut on Saturday, said he had managed to coax both sides to agree to the outlines of a national unity cabinet in which major decisions would be made by consensus. 
 But in Riyadh al Solh square, many said they were ready for a long fight. ''When Omar Karami was prime minister, one person said a word and he resigned,'' Ali al-Faqih, a protester, said of the interim prime minister forced to resign during the anti-Syrian protests. ''Now, one million people have come and said 'Leave,' but this guy is still clinging on. He's no gentleman.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 2, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the continuing political gridlock in Lebanon misstated the action taken in November by opposition ministers aligned with Hezbollah. They quit the cabinet, not the Parliament.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Bolster Iraq Force By Delaying Exit of Units

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD and JEFF ZELENY; David S. Cloud reported from Washington, and Jeff Zeleny from Crawford, Tex.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is considering an increase in troop levels in Iraq of 17,000 to 20,000, which would be accomplished in part by delaying the departure of two Marine regiments now deployed in Anbar Province, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
 The option was among those discussed in Crawford, Tex., on Thursday as President Bush met there with his national security team, and it has emerged as a likely course as he considers a strategy shift in Iraq, the officials said. 
Most of the additional troops would probably be employed in and around Baghdad, the officials said.
 With the continuing high levels of violence there, senior officials increasingly say additional American forces will be needed as soon as possible to clear neighborhoods and to conduct other combat operations to regain control of the capital, rather than primarily to train Iraqi forces.
 ''The mission that most people are settling on has to do with using them in a security role to quell violence in Baghdad and the surrounding area,'' said a senior Pentagon official involved in the planning.
 Any plan to add to American forces in Baghdad would have to be negotiated with the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, which has expressed interest in using Iraqi forces, not American ones, to assert more control over the capital.
 The idea of extending the deployments of two Marine units has emerged in part because most of the marines in Iraq are on seven-month rotations and keeping them there longer is considered more palatable than holding over Army brigades, which are already serving tours of a year or longer, one official said.
 Additional troops would come from sending into Iraq a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division headed for the region next month and possibly by speeding up the deployment of several Army brigades now scheduled to go to Iraq by next spring.
 But officials said a brigade of the First Armored Division now in Anbar Province would probably go home as planned in January, because the unit had already been kept in Iraq more than 40 days beyond its scheduled tour.
 Other options remain under consideration, the officials said, noting that a decision to speed up deployment schedules would put more strain on Army and Marine equipment and personnel. But other options, like mobilizing reserve units, would take months, officials said.
 After meeting with his top military and diplomatic advisers at his Texas ranch, Mr. Bush said his administration was making ''good progress'' in fashioning a revised Iraq strategy. But he said he intended to consult with Congress when it convenes next week before presenting his plan to the nation.
 ''I fully understand it's important to have both Republicans and Democrats understanding the importance of this mission,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking to reporters after a three-hour meeting. ''It's important for the American people to understand success in Iraq is vital for our own security.''
 The meeting, according to a senior administration official, focused on the security, economic and political situation in Iraq. But the bulk of the discussions focused on the security issue and the option of sending more American troops to Baghdad, the official said.
 Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emerged from the meeting with the president. The national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, and his top deputy, J. D. Crouch, also attended the meeting and joined the others for a working lunch at the ranch.
 The White House initially intended to announce a new Iraq policy before Christmas but delayed those plans so the president could consider a range of diverging views inside his administration. For weeks his advisers have been locked in internal debates about how to proceed, but it is an open question whether the meeting on Thursday brought clarity to the discussions.
 ''I've got more consultation to do until I talk to the country about the plan,'' said Mr. Bush, who did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
 Mr. Bush said he had received a briefing from Mr. Gates, his new defense secretary, and General Pace, who recently returned from Iraq. White House aides said the president did not want to offer his new plan for Iraq before Mr. Gates had an opportunity to study conditions on the ground in Iraq.
 ''It's an important part of coming to closure on a way forward in Iraq that will help us achieve our objective,'' Mr. Bush said, ''which is a country that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself.''
 How additional American troops would be employed in Baghdad remains a central point of discussion among Mr. Bush's top advisers and top ground commanders in Iraq, officials said. But two officials said there was growing agreement that most would not be attached to American teams training Iraqi Army and police units, because doing so would not necessarily yield the quick improvements in security the White House wants.
 But it is also unclear to what extent the additional forces would be employed to curb the power of militias associated with Shiite groups that form a key constituency for Mr. Maliki.
 The two units whose stay could be extended are the Marines' Fifth and Seventh Regiment combat teams in Anbar Province, which are scheduled to begin leaving Iraq in February when two replacement regiments are due to arrive, officials said. 
 It is unclear which Army brigades could be sent early. A 3,500-soldier brigade of the Third Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, Ga., is scheduled to arrive in Iraq in mid-January, followed in subsequent months by units from the First Infantry Division, at Fort Riley, Kan., and the Second Infantry Division, at Fort Lewis, Wash.
 The Third Brigade of the Third Infantry Division, based at Fort Benning, Ga., is scheduled to go to Iraq in the spring, according to a spokesman, Kevin Larson, who said he had not heard any discussion of accelerating that timetable. But he said, ''We're ready to answer whatever call may come up.''
 How long beyond February the Marine units would remain is unclear, but officials emphasized that the goal was a temporary increase in the American presence. It is also unclear whether a decision to speed up the deployment of two Army brigades would mean that other units scheduled to be deployed would go to Iraq earlier than planned later next year. Currently there are about 134,000 American troops in Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Failed Revolution

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
After first attempting to deny the scale of last month's defeat, the apologists have settled on a story line that sounds just like Marxist explanations for the failure of the Soviet Union. What happened, you see, was that the noble ideals of the Republican revolution of 1994 were undermined by Washington's corrupting ways. And the recent defeat was a good thing, because it will force a return to the true conservative path.
 But the truth is that the movement that took power in 1994 -- a movement that had little to do with true conservatism -- was always based on a lie. 
The lie is right there in ''The Freedom Revolution,'' the book that Dick Armey, who had just become the House majority leader, published in 1995. He declares that most government programs don't do anything ''to help American families with the needs of everyday life,'' and that ''very few American families would notice their disappearance.'' He goes on to assert that ''there is no reason we cannot, by the time our children come of age, reduce the federal government by half as a percentage of gross domestic product.''
 Right. Somehow, I think more than a few families would notice the disappearance of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and those three programs alone account for a majority of nondefense, noninterest spending. The truth is that the government delivers services and security that people want. Yes, there's some waste -- just as there is in any large organization. But there are no big programs that are easy to cut.
 As long as people like Mr. Armey, Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay were out of power, they could run on promises to eliminate vast government waste that existed only in the public's imagination -- all those welfare queens driving Cadillacs. But once in power, they couldn't deliver. 
 That's why government by the radical right has been an utter failure even on its own terms: the government hasn't shrunk. Federal outlays other than interest payments and defense spending are a higher percentage of G.D.P. today than they were when Mr. Armey wrote his book: 14.8 percent in fiscal 2006, compared with 13.8 percent in fiscal 1995.
 Unable to make good on its promises, the G.O.P., like other failed revolutionary movements, tried to maintain its grip by exploiting its position of power. Friends were rewarded with patronage: Jack Abramoff began building his web of corruption almost as soon as Republicans took control. Adversaries were harassed with smear campaigns and witch hunts: Congress spent six years and many millions of dollars investigating a failed land deal, and Bill Clinton was impeached over a consensual affair. 
 But it wasn't enough. Without 9/11, the Republican revolution would probably have petered out quietly, with the loss of Congress in 2002 and the White House in 2004. Instead, the atrocity created a window of opportunity: four extra years gained by drowning out unfavorable news with terror alerts, starting a gratuitous war, and accusing Democrats of being weak on national security. 
 Yet the Bush administration failed to convert this electoral success into progress on a right-wing domestic agenda. The collapse of the push to privatize Social Security recapitulated the failure of the Republican revolution as a whole. Once the administration was forced to get specific about the details, it became obvious that private accounts couldn't produce something for nothing, and the public's support vanished.
 In the end, Republicans didn't shrink the government. But they did degrade it. Baghdad and New Orleans are the arrival destinations of a movement based on deep contempt for governance. 
 Is that the end for the radical right? Probably not. As a long-suffering civil servant once told me, bad policy ideas are like cockroaches: you can flush them down the toilet, but they keep coming back. Many of the ideas that failed in the Bush years had previously failed in the Reagan years. So there's no reason to assume they're gone for good.
 Indeed, it appears that loss of power and the ensuing lack of accountability is liberating right-wingers to lie yet again: since last month's election, I've noticed a number of Social Security privatizers propounding the same free-lunch falsehoods that the Bush administration had to abandon in the face of demands that it present an actual plan.
 Still, the Republican revolution of 1994 is over. And not a moment too soon.

Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Regulators Give Corporations a Gift 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
DISAPPOINTED by the holiday selling season, the nation's retailers put their faith in a second season: the weeks after the holiday when shoppers tend to flood back into stores to snap up markdowns and spend gift certificates.
 Securities regulators, meanwhile, delivered a present to corporations, rewriting the rules to let them conceal from their own shareholders precisely how much they are paying senior executives.

THE SECOND SEASON -- Despite a final burst of buying in the days before Christmas, the crucial holiday retailing season fell short of expectations and stores began to prepare for the postholiday crush of bargain hunters and gift card users. 
Based on purchases by credit and debit card holders, Visa USA estimated that retail sales rose 6.5 percent in November and December from the same period last year, down from its initial forecast of a 7.5 percent gain.
 The lackluster performance, well below the 8.3 percent increase in 2005, came despite respectable last-minute sales over the weekend. 
 Industry analysts said that consumer spending was strong after Thanksgiving, helped by early discounting, but slowed in December and never fully recovered. A soft housing market and high fuel prices pinched consumer spending, while unseasonably warm temperatures damped sales of cold weather clothing from New York to Chicago. 
 Stores are now focusing on shoppers holding gift cards. Retailers like Coach and Bloomingdale's are introducing dozens of products to encourage shoppers to spend their gift cards quickly. 

CHRISTMAS SURPRISE -- In a move announced late on the last business day before Christmas, the Securities and Exchange Commission changed the way companies disclose stock-option grants, letting many companies report significantly lower total compensation for top executives.
 The new rule, which overturns a decision the S.E.C. had made in July to great fanfare, is a victory for corporations that had always opposed fuller disclosure to shareholders and a defeat for institutional investors that had backed the S.E.C.'s original rule.
 Ann Yerger, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, called the decision, which was made to take effect immediately without seeking comment from the public, ''a holiday present to corporate America.''
 Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, said there was no time to seek comment before approving the rule if the change was to take effect in time to affect proxies to be issued in coming months.
 The commission said it would now accept public comments on the change, but added that the new rules were final and would not be changed.

BUYERS' MARKET -- Sales of new homes picked up last month after a big drop in October, but sales were 15 percent lower than they were a year earlier and the backlog of unsold houses was almost 30 percent higher.
 The Northeast was particularly hard hit, with sales falling 42 percent from a year ago. Sales in the South declined 19 percent, and they slipped 9 percent in the West. In the Midwest, however, sales rose slightly more than 1 percent.
 Despite the rise in the national median price, which climbed 5.8 percent over the same month last year to $251,700, economists said buyers still enjoyed a market tilted in their favor.
 The Commerce Department will release its latest data on construction spending next Wednesday. Analysts expect a decline of 0.6 percent.

SUDDEN SALE -- In a move that came as a surprise even to its workers, the McClatchy Company agreed to sell The Star Tribune newspaper of Minneapolis to a private equity firm, Avista Capital Partners, for $530 million.
 McClatchy, which bought the newspaper for $1.2 billion in 1998, said it would use the proceeds to help reduce debt after the purchase of the Knight Ridder chain for more than $4 billion. McClatchy also said it would receive a $160 million tax benefit from the sale.
 The company, which is based in Sacramento, made news in June with its purchase of Knight Ridder, saying it believed in the future of newspapers. It chose to sell The Star Tribune because of that paper's lagging performance.
 The publisher, Keith Moyer, told the newspaper's employees that there would be no layoffs, at least until the deal was completed in the spring.

AD CREEP -- Verizon Wireless, one of the biggest cellular phone companies, said it would solicit banner advertisements on news, weather, sports and other Internet sites that users visit and display on their mobile phones beginning early in 2007.
 The development is a significant advance toward the widespread appearance of marketing messages on cellphones. Advertisers have been increasing the amount they spend on mobile marketing, despite lingering questions about the effectiveness of ads on portable phones.
 The amount of money spent to advertise on mobile phones is small but growing rapidly. Advertisers spent $45 million on such messages in 2005, and probably spent about $150 million in 2006, according to Ovum Research, which forecasts that spending will reach $1.3 billion by 2010.
 Advertisers are looking for reliable data on whether these so-called mobile ads are affecting consumer behavior.

HEADLINE: Travel Habits Must Change To Make a Big Difference In Energy Consumption 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency kicked off Energy Awareness Month in October with the slogan ''change a light, change the world,'' and encouraged Americans to buy compact fluorescent lights instead of conventional incandescent bulbs.
 Useful as that may be, picking a large sport utility vehicle that goes two miles farther on a gallon of gasoline than the least-efficient S.U.V.'s would have an impact on emissions of global warming gases about five times larger than replacing five 60-watt incandescent bulbs. The dollar savings would be about 10 times larger. And the more-efficient light bulbs would have a negligible effect on oil consumption.
Almost everything Americans do uses energy, making the earth warmer and purses thinner, and often raising demand for oil from unstable places. People eager to reduce their consumption can take many steps, but the size of their benefit -- or cost -- is not always evident. 
 The New York Times compared a number of such steps by three standards -- reduction in global warming gases emitted, reduction in oil consumed and the dollar savings. 
 The calculations, shown in the accompanying chart, found that while choosing energy-efficient lighting and appliances makes a difference, changing how we travel would make by far the biggest difference. 
 Energy-saving light bulbs, the experts say, are relatively easy to adopt, and if everybody used them, the collective difference would be large. But they do not rival vehicles in potential savings.
 Changing to a light bulb that gives three times as much light per watt of electricity means reducing energy use by cutting ''a big share of a small thing,'' said Lee Schipper, research director of the World Resources Institute, an environmental group. But picking a better vehicle, or using it less, is ''a small share of a big thing.'' And that has more potential, he said. 
 The larger the vehicle, the bigger difference even a small increase in fuel economy makes. For example, buying an S.U.V. with fuel economy rated at 16 miles per gallon instead of 14 -- say a Chrysler Pacifica or a Buick Rendezvous, instead of a Chevrolet Tahoe or GMC Yukon -- cuts oil consumption and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by three and a half times more than saving 2 miles per gallon in a typical car -- going from, say, the 23 miles per gallon consumption of a V-6 Camry to the 25 miles per gallon of a Saturn Ion or a Honda Accord hybrid. 
 Of course, driving a car far more fuel-efficient than an S.U.V. saves the most of all. But many people will not consider such a vehicle, so they can help by picking a better model in the class they prefer. 
 Two miles per gallon may mean nothing more than picking a vehicle with the standard engine instead of the souped-up version, or picking the vehicle that has the best fuel economy in its size class.
 The 16-mile-per-gallon models (as measured in road tests by Consumer Reports magazine) are very big S.U.V.'s, although not as large as the 14-mile-per-gallon models. Mr. Schipper said it was a change ''that your neighbors won't notice. They won't look down on you.'' 
 There are lots of choices available beyond compromising on the size of an S.U.V. Some of the biggest also involve travel. 
 Commuting by train or bus, when that choice is available, will make the biggest difference. Consider the average round trip to work -- 23 miles. In the average sedan, which gets 23 miles to the gallon, that is 250 gallons of gas a year and about 5,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. 
 In cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, consumers can help by saving either gasoline or electricity. But as for cutting consumption of oil, saving electricity provides little help, because only 3 percent of electricity comes from burning oil.
 That said, there are changes around the house that make a big difference. In many parts of the country, for example, heating a home for a winter takes about as much energy as running a car for a year. In a climate like Boston's, replacing single-pane windows and storm windows with new thermal windows in a two-story, 2,000-square-foot house would save about 100 gallons of heating oil (about two-thirds as much oil as the switch to a 16-mile-per-gallon S.U.V). It would also reduce carbon dioxide production by more than 2,000 pounds. If the heating fuel is natural gas, the savings is about 1,600 pounds.
 The next biggest energy user at home -- again, depending on climate -- is the air-conditioner. Replacing a 10-year-old air-conditioner with a new one would save about 871 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, although only a little more than a gallon of oil. 
 Even the most significant energy savings mentioned here are modest when compared with what it would take to limit global warming. Joseph J. Romm, an analyst at the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions and a head of the Energy Department's efficiency and renewable energy program during the Clinton administration, said American carbon dioxide emissions come to about 44,000 pounds per person per year. Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide would require cutting that by 26,000 pounds to 35,000 pounds. 
 But the more modest goal set by the Kyoto Protocol, which would have required the United States to cut emissions by about 3,100 pounds per person annually, are well within reach.
 Mr. Romm, the author of a new book about energy and climate change, ''Hell and High Water,'' said that eventually the world's industries would have to switch to lower-carbon fuels, but before that time individuals and industries could take plenty of action. ''You use efficiency to stop demand growth,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 30 about energy efficiency and carbon dioxide reductions misstated the relative savings a driver could achieve by switching to a large sport utility vehicle that got an additional two miles per gallon compared with switching to a car that got two more miles per gallon. Savings in the large S.U.V. are two and a half times larger, not three and a half times.

HEADLINE: Maybe Developing Nations Are Not Emerging but Have Emerged

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN the old developed world, this is an era of solid but moderate economic growth. In the new world, the so-called emerging economies is where most of the growth now resides. 
 The chart shows the most recent annual real rates of increase in gross domestic product in six major developed economies around the world: the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan and the Euro-zone, the countries that use the euro as their currency although they remain politically independent.
The leader in the group is the United States, with a year-over-year growth rate of almost 3 percent. That is hardly soaring, but it is respectable.
 Then the chart shows the rates of 26 developing countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Chile, with a growth rate of 2.93 percent, grew just a bit slower than the United States, but every other country on the list did better.
 The star, to no one's surprise, is China. But there are 10 other countries on the list, including Peru and Bulgaria, that grew at least twice as fast as the United States.
 ''What this means for the global economy is that looking at growth rates, economic slack, inflation or monetary conditions in the developed world alone would result in a fairly distorted picture of the global economy,'' said Jason Rotenberg, a senior research associate at Bridgewater Associates, which compiled the figures.
 There have been periods of rapid growth in developing economies before, and they have sometimes ended in disaster. The most recent was in the mid-1990s, when booming Asian countries fell victim to currency crises that damaged economies and led to, among other things, a default by Russia on some foreign debt.
 But this time is different in one important way, as can be seen from the other chart. It combines current account surpluses of developing countries over time, leaving out Mideast oil exporters but including some others, like Venezuela and Mexico. The current account is dominated by trade surpluses and deficits, although it includes some other items.
 In the mid-1990s, developing countries as a group were relying on borrowed money for their growth, and their current account deficits climbed to as much as a quarter of a percent of total world G.D.P. That left countries vulnerable to capital flight when investors grew nervous about lending to them.
 Now, however, Mr. Rotenberg said, ''emerging markets are accumulating wealth and exporting capital,'' and are not exposed to a sudden withdrawal of foreign money. 
 Most emerging markets, he added, are ''booming because of significant productivity growth, and the resulting export market-share growth rates,'' or because they are exporting commodities to competitive emerging economies.
 It is the developed countries that are running the big current account deficits, led, of course, by the United States. There have been fears that the lending would stop, or at least slow, but so far it has not. And that has enabled the developed world to keep consuming and provide the demand that has led to booms in the developing world.
 Mr. Rotenberg expects this to continue. ''What the global economy has experienced over the last few years is just the start of a major wealth shift from developed economies -- that is, from less-skilled labor in developed economies -- to emerging market workers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Despite Struggles, the Goal Is Always to Be Productive

BYLINE: By ALEXIS REHRMANN

 BODY:
At 7 o'clock on Monday evenings, a tutor comes to Serita Armstrong's Brooklyn apartment, and Ms. Armstrong's 8-year-old identical twins, Nailah and Nabilah, head to the kitchen table and start their lessons. 
 The third graders see their tutor four times a week. Ms. Armstrong, 37, wants a better and bigger life for her twins and their 12-year-old sister, Medina Singletary. She wants them to excel.
''There's more to life than just living on this block,'' she said. 
 But physical and financial limitations have made living beyond their tough neighborhood in East New York difficult. After a fall at work left her disabled, Ms. Armstrong struggles just to pay her rent. ''It's really a never-ending battle,'' she said. ''I've always been productive.'' 
 A single mother, Ms. Armstrong has worked as a residential counselor at a home for the mentally disabled, a phlebotomist, a paralegal, and as a traffic enforcement agent with the New York City Police Department.
 But on Oct. 13, 2003, she slipped at work. ''I fell and I haven't been to work since,'' Ms. Armstrong said. She injured her left knee and required two operations in two years, leaving her with two screws in the knee, a joint implant, arthritis and continuing pain. In one day, her $33,000 yearly salary was replaced with a snaking trail of disability paperwork and bureaucracy. 
 She has only recently started to walk without a cane. She is in pain if she sits for a while, and it also hurts to climb the stairs to her third-floor walk-up. 
 Ms. Armstrong received workers' compensation and disability pay, but her income dwindled by more then half and she fell behind on rent. In the middle of eviction proceedings, Ms. Armstrong applied for help from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In late 2003, shortly after she fell and started having immediate financial problems, she received $644 in Neediest Cases money for the back rent. 
 Ms. Armstrong's injury has left her unable to do the physical work required of a traffic enforcement agent. During her first year on disability, she applied to return to work in a desk job, but according to Ms. Armstrong, ''The N.Y.P.D. didn't want me back in a different capacity.''
 The family lives on $1,222 a month from workers' compensation and Social Security disability. She receives $200 a month in food stamps. Rent on the three-bedroom apartment is $731, car insurance is $400 and the girls' tutor is $280 a month. 
 ''I still worry about the rent,'' she said. ''I can manage with everything else. I sacrifice the money that I give the tutor.''
 Last December, Ms. Armstrong again approached the federation for help to pay back rent. The federation usually provides one-time emergency assistance, but made an exception for Ms. Armstrong. 
 ''She had struggled to keep things up,'' said Laura DeMaio, a social worker at the federation. Ms. Armstrong received $1,500 of Neediest Cases money for rent she owed. 
 ''It really makes a difference,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ''That is the worst thing that a person could really be in fear of. Not even homeless, just not being able to make ends meet.'' 
 A year later, Ms. Armstrong again has fallen behind on her rent and owes $1,000. However, she recently started receiving a housing subsidy from the Administration for Children's Services for $300 a month. With that help, she was able to pay her November rent and $300 toward her owed balance last month. 
 In the fall, Ms. Armstrong began studying mental health case management at Kingsborough Community College. She hopes that more skills will enable her to find work she can do. 
 ''I don't know if I could physically,'' she said, ''but I know that I'm going to be trying. At least I'll be productive.'' 
 She also wants to set an example for her daughters, saying that she will show them ''if nothing else, that you've got to be productive.'' 
 The twins returned to the living room and reported that they had practiced their spelling words. Each girl read aloud an essay written with the tutor. 
 Medina repeated fifth grade, but is more confident in the sixth grade. ''Now I understand more things,'' Medina said. ''My fifth-grade teacher, she helped me a lot to make me understand how to do sixth-grade work.''
 Last summer, Ms. Armstrong, who also has a 21-year-old daughter who has two children of her own, started taking Medina, Nailah and Nabilah to family counseling at Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, an agency that is also supported by Neediest Cases. She wants her children to stay in school. She wants ''to break the cycle of promiscuity, teenage pregnancy. It's a whole cycle that happens in economic situations such as these.'' 
 Ms. Armstrong wants her girls to know what she reminds herself of every day. ''You are not your situation,'' she said. ''You are not your circumstances. It feels like forever, but it doesn't last always.''

HEADLINE: The Last Race Problem

BYLINE: By ORLANDO PATTERSON. 
Orlando Patterson, a professor of sociology at Harvard, is a guest columnist.; Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
When W. E. B. DuBois, the patrician black leader, predicted in 1903 that the problem of the 20th century would be the color line, he had in mind an ethno-racial problem with a dual character. One side was the near complete exclusion of African-Americans and other minorities from the upper echelons and leadership of American society, public life and national identity. The other was the segregation of blacks from the social, communal and intimate cultural life of white Americans.
 America's resolution of the public side of the color line would have amazed DuBois. The nation stands today as a global model in the sophistication and enforcement of its civil rights laws, the diversity of its elite, the participation of blacks and other minorities in its great corporations and its public cultural life, and in the embrace of blacks as an integral part of the nation and what it means to be an American. 
 A black man has led the world's most powerful military machine and stood a good chance of winning the presidency on the Republican ticket had he run; another is now a leading challenger for the Democratic nomination. A black woman, Oprah Winfrey, is perhaps the nation's most powerful cultural force; another, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, is one of the world's most powerful people and is the nation's public face before the world. The recent decisive gubernatorial victory of Deval Patrick in Massachusetts is yet another instance of full public integration. And in popular culture, blacks' presence is out of all proportion to their numbers.
 But when we turn to the other side of DuBois's color line, we find a stunning paradox: accompanying this public integration has been the near complete isolation of blacks from the private life of the white majority. Recent modest improvements notwithstanding, blacks, including the middle class, are nearly as segregated today as they were in DuBois's day. The typical black child now goes to a school that is more segregated than in the late '60s. Segregation is the last major race problem because poverty, per se, is no longer mainly the result of discrimination but part of a broader national crisis that includes whites. Poverty's greater incidence among blacks is largely due to segregation.
 Compounding the paradox is the fact that the highest metropolitan segregation rates are now in the ''liberal'' regions of the Northeast and the Midwest, including New York. The paradox deepens when we learn from repeated polls that whites say they are comfortable living in neighborhoods that are approximately 25 percent black. 
 The celebrated tipping-point theory of Thomas Schelling, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has long appeared to offer a pessimistic answer to the puzzle. It holds that even where a majority of whites favor having black neighbors, the all-white preference of just a few will always rapidly escalate into total segregation. 
 However, the economist William Easterly, after examining data on segregation over the past three decades, has demonstrated conclusively that Schelling's theory is groundless in regard to race. In the vast majority of neighborhoods studied, Easterly found no pattern of acceleration of white decline, no evidence of a sudden, extreme exodus at the fabled tipping point, but instead a steady, almost constant decline in the proportion of whites from one decade to the next. Moreover, the typical neighborhoods that did change from being predominantly white to predominantly black in this period still had a significant proportion of whites living in them. 
 So why does segregation persist? The evidence seems clear that, in sharp contrast with the past, the major cause is that blacks generally prefer to live in neighborhoods that are at least 40 percent black. Blacks mention ethnic pride and white hostility as their main reasons for not moving to white neighborhoods. But studies like Mary Pattillo-McCoy's ethnography of middle-class black ghettos show that the disadvantages, especially for youth, far outweigh the psychic gains.
 It would be naive to discount persisting white racism, but other minorities, like Jews, have faced a similar dilemma and opted, with good reasons, for integration. The Jewish-American experience also shows that identity and integration are not incompatible, and that when the middle class moves, others follow. If America is ever to solve the second part of DuBois's color problem, it will be on the shoulders of the black middle class.

HEADLINE: A City of Memorials Finds Itself Filling Up

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
This supremely political city has a keen sense of history and its uses. So, not surprisingly, it also has a thing for memorials: marble, granite and otherwise. Six presidents and seven wars have monumental tributes in or near downtown Washington. 
 But presidents are not the only people so honored. Ground was broken for the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial on the Mall six weeks ago, and Congress has approved a monument to Francis Marion, the ''Swamp Fox'' of the Carolinas during the Revolutionary War. Most recently, it approved one to millions of victims of the 1932-33 Ukrainian Holodomor, or famine. 
Wait. The Ukrainian famine? A monument to be built on federal land by the Ukrainian government? Whose history is this?
 That question, raised in the 1990s about another foreign memorial, has since ricocheted around the National Park Service and the National Capital Planning Commission, the agencies most responsible for monitoring the conception, creation and placement of new museums and commemorative works in the federal city.
 ''I think there's a heightened sensitivity to where we place these memorials and museums, and whom we venerate,'' said the planning commission's chairman, John V. Cogbill III. ''I don't know how that is going to shake out.'' 
 Mr. Cogbill was sanguine, however, about the potential for future conflict over allocations of available memorial space, saying, ''We view ourselves as a world city, so I think in that respect you want to embrace something that is not indigenous to our own culture.''
 The language of the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, which set out procedures for the creation of memorials on federal land here, is a little less inclusive than Mr. Cogbill is. It envisions commemorative works that evoke ''the memory of an individual, group, event or other significant element of American history.'' 
 In the two decades since Congress enacted that law, about 30 memorials have been approved, four of which did not conform to the provision about American history. 
 Two of the four honor foreign leaders. Mohandas Gandhi, the apostle of nonviolence who led the movement that freed India from British rule, strides forward in front of the Indian Embassy on Q Street N.W. Tomas G. Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia, looks out over the World Bank on H Street N.W. 
 The other two honor victims of Communist rule. The first is a bronze replica of the ''Goddess of Democracy'' erected in Tiananmen Square during the Chinese student protests of 1989, is dedicated to the ''victims of Communism'' and will rise not far from Union Station. The latter is to the victims of the Ukrainian famine, a monument whose site and design have yet to be determined.
 In 2005, John Parsons, an associate regional director of the National Park Service, advised Congress that the proposed Ukrainian memorial, which was in legislation sponsored by Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, duplicated the purpose of the Victims of Communism Memorial.
 ''While the victims of the Ukraine famine obviously deserve recognition,'' Mr. Parsons testified, ''we believe that creating separate memorials for individual groups would detract from the overall message of the Victims of Communism Memorial and could, potentially, create an unfortunate competition amongst various groups for limited memorial sites in our nation's capital.''
 There are more than 160 memorials in the city, and 75 museums, said Lisa N. MacSpadden, the spokeswoman for the National Capital Planning Commission. The inventory goes up, on average, by one memorial a year and one museum a decade, Ms. MacSpadden said. 
 The commission's most recent map shows 100 memorial-worthy sites remaining to commemorate all the country's history to date and all its history to come.
 Statues of foreigners are, of course, nothing new: the Marquis de Lafayette looks down on the White House from a high pedestal in his eponymous park, with Thaddeus Kosciusko a stone's throw away. 
 Simon Bolivar, who freed much of South America from Spanish rule, looms over the intersection of 18th and E Streets N.W., and a statue of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko was unveiled by President Dwight D. Eisenhower near the eastern end of the P Street Bridge. That monument was championed by one of Mr. Levin's predecessors who also represented heavily Ukrainian areas of Michigan like Troy and Warren. 
 (History buffs have created Web sites memorializing Washington memorials, like one at www.kittytours.org/thatman2/index.html.)
 The history of the Ukrainian famine -- in which Moscow's requisitioning of the Ukrainian harvest, along with its orders to collectivize agriculture, caused the starvation of millions of people -- was long caught in the disinformation and silence imposed by Stalin. Not until a few weeks ago did the Ukrainian Parliament enact a law paying tribute and providing for the creation of a memorial to the famine's victims. The law came weeks after the United States Congress voted to approve the memorial in Washington, to be paid for by the government of Ukraine.
 The initial push for the memorial came from Ukrainian-Americans in Michigan, said Borys Potapenko, president of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America. 
 The strongest push, in 2004 and 2005, coincided with the Orange Revolution that brought Viktor A. Yushchenko the presidency. Mr. Potapenko said in a telephone interview that he was nervous about the memorial's future in the wake of recent political developments, which have left Mr. Yushchenko to share power with his former opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, who had Moscow's support. 
 But Iryna Bezverkha, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Embassy, said embassy officials met in December with members of a Park Service advisory commission to discuss the steps to be followed to win approval for a design and site.
 City planners, however, are more concerned with Congress's ability to come to terms with the physical limits of the land.
 ''We are starting to realize that there are a limited number of places left'' for memorials, said Mr. Cogbill of the planning commission. ''That means we have to start to think carefully.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 6, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about memorials in Washington, D.C., that are dedicated to the history of other countries misstated the location of a statue to Tomas Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia. It is at the intersection of 22nd Street, Massachusetts Avenue and Q Street -- not in front of the World Bank on H Street.

HEADLINE: Countdown To 2007 Starts Early 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are not typically ones to start the party early, or even start it at all. The church disapproves of drinking, smoking and other indulgences. 
 But this year in Utah, at least two cities will celebrate New Year's Eve on New Year's Eve Eve, eagerly embracing 2007 a full 24 hours before it actually arrives in order to appeal to Mormons.
The premature celebration does not reflect a new emphasis on revelry, church officials assure. It is simply that New Year's Eve this year falls on a Sunday, the Sabbath, and the two cities, St. George and Provo, know that in a state with about 1.75 million Mormons, faith can trump Father Time when it comes to planning a party.
 ''It's cultural slash religious, but primarily it's economic-based,'' said Marc Mortensen, the coordinator for First Night St. George, the city's version of the alcohol-free New Year's Eve celebrations held in more than 100 cities nationwide. ''We're just not going to get good enough attendance if we hold it on Sunday.''
 Utah is just one of many places where the calendar is complicating New Year's Eve. 
 In Connecticut, retail beer, wine and liquor sales are suspended on Sundays and holidays, prompting people to stock up early.
 And in Georgia, many nightclubs cannot open on Sundays.
 The Star Bar, in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta, is having its ''big fat honkin' New Year's Eve party'' on Dec. 30.
 ''It's the first time in 15 years that I haven't worked in a bar on New Year's Eve,'' said Dave Parker, the owner. ''Even though it's killing business for us, it's making my wife very happy.''
 In Utah, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not request that the parties in Provo and St. George be moved up. In fact, a philanthropic arm of the church is among the sponsors of First Night Salt Lake, which is being held, as usual, on Dec. 31.
 ''People have this impression that us doing the event on Sunday is thumbing our noses at the people who have religious beliefs,'' said Kim Angeli, the coordinator of the Salt Lake event. ''That's not it at all. It's just that there is a specific time when New Year's Eve does exist.''

HEADLINE: Elder-Care Costs Deplete Savings Of a Generation

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
To care for her ailing 97-year-old father over the past three years, Elizabeth Rodriguez, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, has borrowed against her 401(k) retirement plan, sold her house on Staten Island and depleted nearly 20 years of savings. 
 The money has gone to lawyers' fees ($50,000) to win a contested guardianship. It has gone for home-care equipment like the mattress for his hospital bed (about $3,000 in all) and for a food service to deliver meals ($400 a month).
It has gone for a two-bedroom rental apartment big enough for herself, her dad and a home aide ($1,600 a month more than a one-bedroom apartment in the same building), and for a wheelchair-accessible van to get him to doctors' appointments ($330 a trip). 
 Asked to tally the costs, Ms. Rodriguez, 58, said she had no idea how much she was spending. ''A shower chair, body cream with no alcohol, new shoes,'' she said. ''You don't stop and calculate. You just buy what you have to buy.''
 Ms. Rodriguez is among the legion of adult children -- more than 15 million, according to various calculations -- who take care of their aging parents, a responsibility that often includes paying for all or part of their housing, medical supplies and incidental expenses. Many costs are out of pocket and largely unnoticed: clothing, home repair, a cellular telephone. 
 Adult children with the largest out-of-pocket expenses are those supervising care long distance, those who hire in-home help and those whose parents have too much money to qualify for government-subsidized Medicaid but not enough to pay for what could be a decade of frailty and dependence.
 The burden is compounded by ignorance, according to a study by AARP, released in mid-December, which found that most Americans have no idea how much long-term care costs and believe that Medicare pays for it, when it does not.
 Families have always looked after their elderly loved ones. But never has old age lasted so long or been so costly, compromising the retirement of baby boomers who were expecting inheritances rather than the shock of depleted savings.
 ''There is a myth out there that families abandon their frail elders,'' said Dr. Robert L. Kane, a geriatrician at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. ''Instead, across the income spectrum, children are sacrificing to care for their parents to the limit of their means and sometimes beyond.''
 Researchers have documented the time spent by adult children, and others, caring for ailing relatives. But data is woefully inadequate on how much they actually spend, health economists say, because most people do not keep itemized entries as they write checks, use their credit cards or pocket money to meet the demands of the day. 
 ''When you're in the middle of the forest, with so many things coming at you, you can't really see the trees,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''But each one of those trees has actual dollars connected to it.''
 Costs are astronomical for long-term, low-tech care, the sort most often needed by those who linger with Alzheimer's disease or are too frail to get around on their own. Medicare is of almost no help, since it covers only acute episodes like a heart attack, cancer or repair of a broken hip. 
 That means the elderly and their families are left to pay for assisted living (which averages $35,000 a year), nursing homes ($74,000) or home health aides. Only the very poor receive Medicaid, which pays nursing-home bills nationwide but home care in only a few states (New York among them), and nothing toward assisted-living rent.
 Nor does Medicare cover equipment like grab bars for the shower and incontinence supplies, which alone can run $2,000 a year, or travel expenses for an adult child responding to medical emergencies. 
 Marilyn de Leo, for instance, has made two trips from New York City to Los Angeles since September, when her mother fell in the bathroom and broke her neck and both ankles. Ms. de Leo, 62, an associate director in the development office of Mount Sinai Medical Center, spent $800 on airfare for the first frantic trip , plus $50 a day on taxis, since she had left her eyeglasses behind in a mad dash to the airport and therefore could not rent a car. Ms. de Leo has no savings left, and is $5,000 in debt. When asked about her own future, she said, ''I'll have to work till I drop.''
 Only one authoritative survey, in 2004, has even asked adult children how much they contribute to their parents' support. Half said they did, and the average monthly expenditure was $200. Respondents who looked after their parents at least 40 hours a week said they spent an average of $324 a month. 
 But those figures were based on ''quick, top-of-the-head estimates,'' said Gail Hunt, president of the National Alliance for Caregiving, which conducted the survey. 
 Knowing the extent of these expenses might inform public policy, some experts say, calling attention to a gap in the government safety net for the elderly. 
 ''Should this burden fall solely on the individual and the family?'' asked Judy Feder, dean of the Public Policy Institute at Georgetown University. ''And can we really expect this arrangement to keep doing the job as a larger and larger population comes to grips with it?''
 Congress recently passed a poorly financed bill that would help family members who need a break to pay for substitute care of an ailing loved one. But the Bush administration, to date, has preferred a private sector solution, recommending long-term insurance and reverse mortgages.
 For spouses, most expenses are tax-deductible if they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. But children cannot claim parental expenses unless they pay more than half of a parent's support, which is often not the case when the parents are on Medicaid, likeMs. Rodriguez's father, or have savings, like the Schoengood family. 
 The elder Schoengoods, both 86, own a home in Yonkers and a condominium in Florida and have assets enough for round-the-clock care, which can cost $100,000 a year. Still, their son, Matthew G. Schoengood, 49, vice president of student affairs at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, has kicked in at least $1,000 a month since 2005, when his mother had the first of two strokes. 
 Mr. Schoengood flew his family nanny to Florida, for example, to look after his father. Now that his parents are permanently up north, Mr. Schoengood orders their groceries online along with his own. ''As a child, it's just something you do,'' he said. ''Mostly you don't even think about it.''
 His father makes a half-hearted effort to pay him back, but Mr. Schoengood always says, jokingly, ''I'll put it on your tab, Dad.'' Typical of their generation, his parents fret about every penny. His father asks, incessantly, ''Do we have enough?'' Mr. Schoengood tells him not to worry. 
 For sure, he hopes his own children will do for him what he is doing for his parents, but he cringes at the prospect of burdening them -- one reason long-term care insurance is becoming attractive. 
 Mr. Schoengood's out-of-pocket spending is not sensible, elder-care experts say, but the result of the awkward minuet of preserving a parent's pride. 
 If families behaved logically, said Steven Schurkman, an elder-care lawyer in White Plains, all expenses would be paid from the parents' money, which if depleted would entitle them to Medicaid. ''What most of us do isn't sound financial planning,'' Mr. Schurkman said. ''But it's healthy for the family dynamic.''
 Carol Levine, director of the Families and Health Care Project at the United Hospital Fund in Manhattan, said that paying for her mother's needs required delicacy, even subterfuge. When Ms. Levine went shopping, her mother would say, ''Take $5 out of my purse.'' Her daughter would return with 10 bags of groceries, and both would pretend that was all she had spent. 
 Both Mr. Schoengood and Ms. Rodriguez say their out-of-pocket expenses will not ruin them. Others are not so lucky. 
 Take Patrice B., 47, who returned to her childhood home in Jacksonville, Fla., seven years ago to move in with her mother, 84, who has Alzheimer's disease, and her father, 86, who has congestive heart failure. (They requested that the family's last name be omitted so neighbors would not know their plight.)
 In their African-American culture, Ms. B. said, putting her parents in a nursing home would have been shameful. Plus, they could pay for some home care out of pensions as well as military disability checks. She, on the other hand, after years of sporadic part-time work and untallied out-of-pocket expenses, is broke. 
 She has catastrophic health insurance, but it will not pay for the hysterectomy she needs. She has lost her credit cards after accumulating $20,000 in debt. ''Honestly,'' Ms. B. said, ''I've got nothing anymore. I go from very angry to very depressed.''
 Kate Mesmer, a single mother in Northern California who had always worked for nonprofit organizations, was living paycheck to paycheck when her mother had a stroke in 2001. Ms. Mesmer took a tenant into her house so she could contribute to her mother's $6,000-a-month rent at an assisted living center. 
 Then Ms. Mesmer lost her job and had to move her mother to a board-and-care home. A second stroke forced her mother into a nursing home, where she qualified for Medicaid. That is where she died last year, with nothing left but an $18,000 I.R.A. The State of California is seeking that, contending the $18,000 should have gone toward nursing-home fees. 
 Given what she learned in the final years of her mother's life, Ms. Mesmer said: ''I have a panic attack at least once a day. It's frightening to think about our generation and what's going to happen to us.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about adult children who take care of their aging parents referred incorrectly to expenses for the care of a spouse that are tax deductible if they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. They are medical expenses, not any expenses.

HEADLINE: For Gibbs, the Sequel to Success Has Been Disappointment 

BYLINE: By DAMON HACK

DATELINE: ASHBURN, Va., Dec. 27 

 BODY:
In the days after the Washington Redskins lost their ninth game of this season, a rumor circulated through this region that Coach Joe Gibbs had been involved in a car accident. A radio outlet said Gibbs had been taken to a hospital. Gibbs, listeners were told, was going in and out of consciousness.
 In truth, Gibbs was in the glass-paneled offices at Redskins Park, trying to fix a faulty team that has his fingerprints all over it.
''There were just some people wishing I was in a car wreck,'' Gibbs said earlier this month. ''The only way that would have happened was if a car had driven into the building.'' 
 That anyone would create a hoax involving Gibbs owes in part to the heavy disappointment in his third season back with a team he led to three Super Bowl titles in the 1980s and 1990s.
 When Daniel Snyder, the Redskins' owner, persuaded Gibbs in January 2004 to turn over the day-to-day operation of his successful Nascar team, Joe Gibbs Racing, to his son J. D. and return to coaching, the sentiment around Washington was nearly unanimous: The Redskins were going to need a bigger trophy case.
 Instead, if Washington (5-10) loses to the Giants (7-8) on Saturday at FedEx Field, this will be Gibbs's worst season in 15 years as a head coach. (The mark would eclipse Gibbs's previous low of 6-10, set in 2004, his first year back with the team.)
 Gibbs coached the Redskins to a 10-6 record and an appearance in the National Football Conference divisional playoffs last year, but the encore has left the Redskins an afterthought. In a watered-down conference, the Redskins are among the dregs.
 ''When I came back, I said this is where I felt like I was supposed to be and I had prayerfully gone through that,'' Gibbs said during a conference call Wednesday. ''I was starting over. I said the past really doesn't buy you anything. I said it could be I have been brought back to go through a lot of adverse situations. I was hoping that wouldn't be the case, but, certainly, this year it has been.''
 Despite the results, the 66-year-old Gibbs says he plans to return to the Redskins next season. He has two years remaining on a deal that pays him $5 million annually, and according to several players, Gibbs also has the faith of the locker room.
 But to see a Gibbs team out of the playoff equation is a rarity in the N.F.L. and to see him presiding over a losing team rarer still. Gibbs had one losing season in his first 12 with the Redskins before coaching Washington to two losing seasons in the past three years. 
 ''When we lined up before the season, I thought this team could go to a Super Bowl,'' Redskins defensive end Phillip Daniels said. ''I know he takes a lot of the blame if a guy leaves or stays, but I think he's taken too much. It's unfair for people to say we haven't gotten where we want to be. We're going to get there. Joe Gibbs didn't win three Super Bowls for nothing.''
 Gibbs's credentials carry weight in the locker room and beyond. More quietly than Bill Parcells and less stylishly than Bill Walsh, Gibbs led teams that dominated for a decade and sent him to the Hall of Fame. When Snyder handed Gibbs the keys to the coach's office anew, the Redskins' fan base ignored the date on the calendar and partied as if it were 1989.
 ''Everyone sees Joe show up and it's like, 'Great, we're going to win a championship,' '' Joe Theismann, Gibbs's winning quarterback with the Redskins in Super Bowl XVII, said in a telephone interview. ''But this is a different era of football. He brought back a sense of pride and work ethic and toughness, but he found out that he wasn't as in tune with the league from a play-calling aspect as he needed to be.''
 Theismann added: ''When you're a storied coach in a franchise with expectations, and it falls short, everybody wants to find fault with it. You can't lose sight in our business that the game runs in cycles, teams run in cycles, philosophies run in cycles. And because of economics and personnel, the cycle goes away for a while.''
 Some of Gibbs's personnel moves have clearly not panned out. Receiver Antwaan Randle El, an off-season acquisition from the Pittsburgh Steelers, has had his receiving yards dip to 298 from 558 a season ago. The free-agent pickups Adam Archuleta, a safety, and Andre Carter, a defensive end, have not kept the defense from sliding to 30th in the league.
 After calling the offensive plays for his entire career, Gibbs turned over the duty this season to Al Saunders, the associate head coach, whom Gibbs hired from the Kansas City Chiefs. Saunders, as the Chiefs' offensive coordinator, helped make Kansas City the No. 1 offense in 2004 and 2005. The Redskins? They are ranked 15th on offense.
 One factor could be traced to Gibbs's decision not to bench quarterback Mark Brunell earlier in the season. In nine starts, Brunell threw eight touchdown passes and four interceptions. The Redskins were 3-6 before Gibbs inserted Jason Campbell, a second-year quarterback from Auburn.
 ''I am also a product of Joe Gibbs's loyalty to players,'' Theismann said. ''He stayed with me in 1985 probably four games longer than he should have. He probably could have gone to Jason earlier, too. You cannot win without consistent quarterback play, and Joe hasn't had it. Mark was more of a keeper of the castle than someone who was going to go out and win football games for you. Jason is showing that he can be someone who does, but he's a young guy going through the process of learning how to win.''
 To hear the Redskins tell it, the players are not the only ones learning new things. Gibbs spent 11 years away from an N.F.L. sideline, a time in which new rules and strategies developed. When Gibbs coached previously, the N.F.L. did not have a salary cap, 2-point conversions or the coach's replay challenges. 
 ''The game has changed a little bit,'' Daniels said. ''Linemen that used to be 265 are now 340 and run a 4.6 in the 40. He's handling the team and salary-cap issues, and he's learned on the fly.''
 Left tackle Chris Samuels said it would be unreasonable to speculate that football had passed Gibbs by.
 ''We have to play better, simply,'' Samuels said. ''He's still sharp, he's a great coach, and we respect him.''
 Theismann said he walked off the practice field with Gibbs a couple of weeks ago. ''He told me, 'I just feel like I should be able to do more to make us better,' '' Theismann said. ''That, to me, was classic Joe Gibbs. There wasn't one excuse. That's why Joe Gibbs is a Hall of Fame coach and why he'll get this right.''

HEADLINE: SADDAM HUSSEIN HANGED IN BAGHDAD; SWIFT END TO DRAMA; TROOPS ON ALERT 

BYLINE: This article is by Marc Santora, James Glanz and Sabrina Tavernise.; Reporting was contributed by Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi and Khalid al-Ansary from Baghdad, Eric Lichtblau from Washington and Jeff Zeleny from Crawford, Tex.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Saturday, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein, the dictator who led Iraq through three decades of brutality, war and bombast before American forces chased him from his capital city and captured him in a filthy pit near his hometown, was hanged just before dawn Saturday during the morning call to prayer.
 The final stages for Mr. Hussein, 69, came with terrible swiftness after he lost the appeal, five days ago, of his death sentence for the killings of 148 men and boys in the northern town of Dujail in 1982. He had received the sentence less than two months before from a special court set up to judge his reign as the almost unchallenged dictator of Iraq.
His execution at 6:10 a.m. was announced on state-run Iraqiya television. Witnesses said 14 Iraqi officials had attended the hanging, at the former military intelligence building in northern Baghdad, now part of an American base. Those in the room said that Mr. Hussein was dressed entirely in black and carrying a Koran and that he was compliant as the noose was draped around his neck. 
 ''He just gave up,'' said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Iraq's national security adviser. ''We were astonished. It was strange. He just gave up.'' 
 He added: ''Saddam Hussein is gone. All Iraqis will look to the future after the end of this era.'' 
 At President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said Mr. Bush had gone to bed before the execution took place and was not awakened. Mr. Bush had received a briefing from his national security adviser Friday afternoon, when he learned the execution would be carried out within hours, Mr. Stanzel said. Asked why Mr. Bush had gone to sleep before hearing the news, he said Mr. Bush ''knew that it was going to happen.'' 
 In a statement written in advance, Mr. Bush said Mr. Hussein ''was executed after receiving a fair trial -- the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime.''
 ''Saddam Hussein's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror.''
 There were conflicting accounts about whether two of Mr. Hussein's co-defendants were also hanged. The Iraqi state television said the co-defendants, Mr. Hussein's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, were hanged after Mr. Hussein. But Mr. Rubaie could not confirm this.
 Concerned that the execution could incite violence, United States forces were placed on stepped-up alert and Iraqi officials suggested that the daily curfews here might be extended throughout the weekend. Even as the executions appeared inevitable, many were skeptical or disbelieving that the noose could drop around Mr. Hussein's neck so soon. One Western official said that some of the American legal advisers working on the case appeared stunned at the hasty pace of events late Friday as they walked through the corridors of the Republican Palace, once Mr. Hussein's grandiose center of power.
 When Mr. Hussein came to power three years before the Dujail killings, he ruled over an oil-rich country that was an economic and technical powerhouse in the Middle East with rising cultural and political influence. When he hurtled through the trap door of the gallows Saturday morning, the nation he left behind was a smashed and traumatized remnant, desperately trying to restore its own identity and its place in the world.
 In between, Mr. Hussein invaded Iran and Kuwait in wars that cost over a million lives and left his military in a shambles, brutally suppressed a Shiite uprising in the south and saw his country become isolated and impoverished under the weight of United Nations-imposed sanctions. Finally, he was ousted by an American-led invasion force in 2003 and the country fell into a new round of internal violence as the rule of law disintegrated and the Western invaders proved unable to control a country in the aftermath of totalitarian rule.
 Those developments, so unwelcome to the Americans who so easily conquered this nation, showed that Mr. Hussein was also a unifying force whose painful grip held together Iraq's many ethnicities and sects. Now, three years after his fall, Iraq has descended further into chaos.
 As Iraqis across the country were trying to process the scope of what had happened, early reactions mirrored the deep sectarian divide that has been driving much of that violence and threatens to pull the country apart.
 ''Today is the best day we have seen since the fall of Saddam's regime,'' said Ayad Jamal al-Deen, a moderate Shiite political leader. ''The death of this man will help to release many Baathists from Saddam's mafia. The violence will be reduced.''
 But a Sunni tribal sheik expressed a thought typical of the hard-line Sunni minority, which has held tenaciously to the memory of being favored under Mr. Hussein.
 ''The execution of Saddam means that the flame of vengeance will be ignited and it will hurt the body of Iraq with unrecoverable wound,'' the sheik said.
 As Mr. Hussein awaited the hangman, he was apparently unaware that the American military was already making plans to dispose of his personal effects.
 Iraqi officials were vague to the end about when the execution would happen. ''We will do it very soon,'' said Munir Haddad, a judge on the Iraqi High Tribunal who represented the body at the execution.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was still conferring with American officials late Friday night to work out the timing and resolve key details, like what to do with Mr. Hussein's body, a Western official said. 
 But Mr. Maliki's comments on Friday to the families of people who were killed while Mr. Hussein ruled left no doubt about where the prime minister stood on the time frame of the execution.
 ''Anyone who rejects the execution of Saddam is undermining the martyrs of Iraq and their dignity,'' Mr. Maliki said. ''Nobody can overrule the execution sentence issued against Saddam.''
 Without specifying a time, date or place, he said, ''There is no review or delay in implementing the execution verdict against Saddam.''
 Esam al-Gazawi, another lawyer representing Mr. Hussein who is currently in Jordan, expressed the views of many by suggesting that the timing of the execution was determined by the highest levels of the American and Iraqi governments.
 ''No one knows when it's going to happen except God and President Bush,'' he said shortly before Mr. Hussein was executed.
 Mr. Hussein spent his final hours in a dreary cell on an American base near the Baghdad airport, and there were indications that he was unaware that the end was drawing near.
 Iraqi and American officials kept outsiders, including his legal team, from contacting him all day, according to Najib al-Nauimi, one of Mr. Hussein's lawyers, who was in Qatar.
 But the legal team received a request late Friday asking for formal requests from people who could receive Mr. Hussein's effects, another of his lawyers said.
 ''I gave them a request that my colleagues and I are authorized to get Saddam's personal stuff,'' said the lawyer, Wadood Fawzi.
 In Washington, a United States District Court rejected an emergency motion filed Friday afternoon by lawyers for Mr. Hussein seeking to halt the execution on the grounds that it would interfere with pending civil litigations against him. Judge Kathleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled shortly after 9 p.m. that her court did not have jurisdiction to intercede.
 Mr. Hussein's trial and conviction have been mostly welcomed by the Iraqi Shiites and Kurds who suffered under his rule, but it has angered Sunni Muslims, helped to fuel a Sunni-led insurgency and done nothing to calm the increasingly chaotic sectarian violence here. 
 Iraqi officials said the execution would be filmed, both for the historical record and as proof for those who may doubt the word of both the Americans and Iraqis.
 As of late Friday, some Iraqi officials remained engaged in a heated debate about how swiftly to carry out Mr. Hussein's death sentence.
 An Iraqi official close to the negotiations expressed deep disappointment that, after years of forensic investigation, detailed litigation and careful deliberation, the process could be compromised in the final hours by politically driven haste.
 ''According to the law, no execution can be carried out during the holidays'' said another official, ''After all the hard work we have done, why would we break the law and ruin what we have built?''
 The Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha begins Saturday for Sunnis and Sunday for Shiites, who now control the government.
 Iraqi law seemed to indicate that executions were forbidden on the holiday.
 But Judge Haddad was dismissive of those concerns, injecting some of the sectarian split that is pervading the country. ''The official Id in Iraq is Sunday,'' he said.
 As for Mr. Hussein's sect, he said, ''Saddam is not Sunni. And he is not Shiite. He is not Muslim.''
 Mr. Gazawi, the lawyer, said he was told that Mr. Hussein had met with two half-brothers, who are also in custody, but no other relatives.
 ''His sons are dead, and his daughters are here in Amman,'' he said. Mr. Hussein's two sons, Uday and Qusay, were killed by American soldiers after the 2003 invasion.
 After his government collapsed, Mr. Hussein went into hiding and was eventually found in a hide-out near his hometown of Tikrit.
 Once in custody, there were three cases brought against Mr. Hussein for crimes against humanity.
 The first case to begin hearings, and the simplest in terms of details, involved the executions of residents of Dujail after an attack on his motorcade there. Mr. Hussein was found guilty on Nov. 5 and sentenced to die by hanging. An appeals court upheld the ruling on Tuesday and said the sentence had to be carried out within 30 days.
 A trial on the far more sweeping charges that he directed the killing of 50,000 Kurds in an organized ethnic-cleansing campaign is still under way and will continue despite Mr. Hussein's execution.

PERSON: Saddam Hussein

HEADLINE: Saddam Hussein, Defiant Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence and Fear

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
The hanging of Saddam Hussein ended the life of one of the most brutal tyrants in recent history and negated the fiction that he himself maintained even as the gallows loomed -- that he remained president of Iraq despite being toppled by the United States military and that his power and his palaces would be restored to him in time. 
 The despot, known as Saddam, had oppressed Iraq for more than 30 years, unleashing devastating regional wars and reducing his once promising, oil-rich nation to a claustrophobic police state.
For decades, it had seemed that his unflinching hold on Iraq would endure, particularly after he lasted through disastrous military adventures against first Iran and then Kuwait, where an American-led coalition routed his unexpectedly timid military in 1991. 
 His own conviction that he was destined by God to rule Iraq forever was such that he refused to accept that he would be overthrown in April 2003, even as American tanks penetrated the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in a war that has become a bitterly contentious, bloody occupation. 
 After eluding capture for eight months, Mr. Hussein became the American military's High Value Detainee No. 1. But he heaped scorn on the Iraqi judge who referred to him as the ''former'' president after asking him to identify himself on the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, which ultimately lead to his execution.
 ''I didn't say 'former president,' I said 'president,' and I have rights according to the Constitution, among them immunity from prosecution,'' he growled from the docket. The outburst underscored the boundless egotism and self-delusion of a man who fostered such a fierce personality cult during the decades that he ran the Middle Eastern nation that joking about him or criticizing him in public could bring a death sentence. 
 If a man's life can be boiled down to one physical mark, Mr. Hussein's right wrist was tattooed with a line of three dark blue dots, commonly given to children in rural, tribal areas. Some urbanized Iraqis removed or at least bleached theirs, but Mr. Hussein's former confidants told The Atlantic Monthly that he never disguised his. 
 Ultimately, underneath all the socialist oratory, underneath the Koranic references, the tailored suits and the invocations of Iraq's glorious history, Mr. Hussein held onto the ethos of a village peasant who believed that the strongman was everything. He was trying to be a tribal leader on a grand scale. His rule was paramount, and sustaining it was his main goal behind all the talk of developing Iraq by harnessing its considerable wealth and manpower. 
 Mosques, airports, neighborhoods and entire cities were named after him. A military arch erected in Baghdad in 1989 was modeled on his forearms and then enlarged 40 times to hold two giant crossed swords. In school, pupils learned songs with lyrics like ''Saddam, oh Saddam, you carry the nation's dawn in your eyes.'' 
 The entertainment at public events often consisted of outpourings of praise for Mr. Hussein. At the January 2003 inauguration of a recreational lake in Baghdad, poets spouted spontaneous verse and the official translators struggled to keep up with lines like, ''We will stimulate ourselves by saying your name, Saddam Hussein, when we say Saddam Hussein, we stimulate ourselves.'' 
 While Mr. Hussein was in power, his statue guarded the entrance to every village, his portrait watched over each government office and he peered down from at least one wall in every home. His picture was so widespread that a joke quietly circulating among his detractors in 1988 put the country's population at 34 million -- 17 million people and 17 million portraits of Saddam. 

Battles and Bloodshed
 Throughout his rule, he unsettled the ranks of the Baath Party with bloody purges and packed his jails with political prisoners to defuse real or imagined plots. In one of his most brutal acts, he rained poison gas on the northern Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988, killing an estimated 5,000 of his own citizens suspected of being disloyal and wounding 10,000 more. 
 Even at the end, he showed no remorse. When four Iraqi politicians visited him after his capture in December 2003, they asked about his more brutal acts. He called the Halabja attack Iran's handiwork; he said that Kuwait was rightfully part of Iraq and that the mass graves were filled with thieves who fled the battlefields, according to Adnan Pachachi, a former Iraqi foreign minister. Mr. Hussein declared that he had been ''just but firm'' because Iraqis needed a tough ruler, Mr. Pachachi said.
 It was a favorite theme, one even espoused in a novel attributed to Mr. Hussein called ''Zabibah and the King.'' 
 At one point, the king asks the comely Zabibah whether the people needed strict measures from their leader. ''Yes, Your Majesty,'' Zabibah replies. ''The people need strict measures so that they can feel protected by this strictness.''
 Aside from his secret police, he held power by filling the government's upper ranks with members of his extended clan. Their Corleone-like feuds became the stuff of gory public soap operas. Mr. Hussein once sentenced his elder son, Uday, to be executed after he beat Mr. Hussein's food taster to death in front of scores of horrified party guests, but later rescinded the order. The husbands of his two eldest daughters, whom he had promoted to important military positions, were gunned down after they defected and then inexplicably returned to Iraq.
 Continual wars sapped Iraq's wealth and decimated its people. In 1980, Mr. Hussein dragged his country into a disastrous attempt to overthrow the new Islamic government in neighboring Iran. By the time the war ended in stalemate in 1988, more than 200,000 Iraqis were dead and hundreds of thousands more wounded. Iran suffered a similar toll. Iraq's staggering war debt, pegged around $70 billion, soon had wealthy Arab neighbors demanding repayment. Enraged, he invaded Kuwait in August 1990, only to be expelled by an American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war seven months later. 
 Yet in the language of his Orwellian government, Mr. Hussein never suffered a setback. After the gulf war ended with the deaths of an estimated 150,000 Iraqis, he called ''the Mother of All Battles'' his biggest victory and maintained that Iraq had actually repulsed an American attack.
 ''Iraq has punched a hole in the myth of American superiority and rubbed the nose of the United States in the dust,'' Mr. Hussein said. 
 His defeat in Kuwait, followed by more than a decade of tense confrontations with the West over his suspected weapons programs, ultimately led to his overthrow. The extended bloodbath that followed the invasion, with the monthly death toll of Iraqi civilians estimated roughly at 3,000 by the end of 2006, made some nostalgic for even the oppressive days of Mr. Hussein, when public security was not an issue. His repressive ways were credited with keeping the fractious population of 26 million -- including 20 percent Sunni Muslims, who dominated; 55 percent Shiite Muslims; 20 percent Kurds plus several tiny minorities including Christians -- from shattering along ethnic lines.

The Pathway to Politics
 Saddam Hussein was born on April 28, 1937, in a mud hut on stilts near the banks of the Tigris River near the village of Tikrit, 100 miles northwest of Baghdad. He was raised by a clan of landless peasants, his father apparently deserting his mother before his birth. (Government accounts said the father died.) 
 ''His birth was not a joyful occasion, and no roses or aromatic plants bedecked his cradle,'' his official biographer, Amir Iskander, wrote in ''Saddam Hussein, the Fighter, the Thinker and the Man,'' published in 1981.
 Mr. Hussein told his biographer that he did not miss his father growing up in an extended clan. But persistent stories suggest that Mr. Hussein's stepfather delighted in humiliating the boy and forced him to tend sheep. Eventually, he ran away to live with relatives who would let him go to school. 
 Mr. Hussein's first role in the rough world of Iraqi politics came in 1959, at age 22, when the Baath Party assigned him and nine others to assassinate Abdul Karim Kassem, the despotic general ruling Iraq. Violence was a quick way for a young man who grew up fatherless in an impoverished village to get ahead; bloodshed became the major theme of his life. 
 During the failed assassination, Mr. Hussein suffered a bullet wound to the leg. The official version portrayed him as a hero who dug the bullet out with a penknife, while the other version suggests that the plot failed because he opened fire prematurely. 
 He sought asylum in Egypt, where President Gamal Abdel Nasser nurtured the region's revolutionary movements. Soon after returning to Iraq, Mr. Hussein married his first cousin and the daughter of his political mentor, Sajida Khairallah Tulfah, on May 5, 1963. The couple had two sons, Uday and Qusay, and three daughters, Raghad, Rana and Hala. He had mistresses, including prominent Iraqi women, but never flaunted them. 
 His wife, three daughters and roughly a dozen grandchildren survive him. Uday and Qusay, along with Qusay's teenage son, Mustapha, died in July 2003 during a gun battle with American forces in a villa in the northern city of Mosul. Denounced by an informant, they had been the two most wanted men in Iraq after their father. 
 The first years of Saddam Hussein's marriage coincided with political tumult in Iraq, with at least six coups or attempted revolts erupting between the assassination of King Faisal II in 1958 and the July 1968 putsch that brought the Baath Party to power.
 Mr. Hussein's main role while still in his early 30s was organizing the party's militia, the seed of the dreaded security apparatus. By November 1969, he had eliminated rivals and dissidents to the extent that President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr appointed him vice president and deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, as the cabinet was known. Mr. Hussein remained head of the intelligence and internal security agencies, in effect controlling Iraq. 
 The Arab Baath Socialist Party, whose name means ''renaissance'' in Arabic, had been formed in the 1930s to push a secular, socialist creed as the ideal path to achieving Arab unity. But that dogma proved a sinister excuse for the imprisonment, exile or execution of all potential rivals. 
 No other Arab despot matched the savagery of Mr. Hussein as he went about bending all state institutions to his whim. His opening act, in January 1969, was hanging around 17 so-called spies for Israel in a downtown Baghdad square. Hundreds of arrests and executions followed as the civilian wing of the Baath Party gradually eclipsed the Iraqi military. 
 Mr. Hussein staged perhaps his most macabre purge in 1979, when at age 42 he consolidated his hold on Iraq. Having pushed aside President Bakr, he called a gathering of several hundred top Baathists. 
 One senior official stepped forward to confess to having been part of a widespread plot to allow a Syrian takeover. After guards dragged the man away, Mr. Hussein took to the podium, weeping at first as he began reading a list of dozens implicated. Guards dragged away each of the accused. Mr. Hussein paused from reading occasionally to light his cigar, while the room erupted in almost hysterical chanting demanding death to traitors. The entire dark spectacle, designed to leave no doubt as to who controlled Iraq, was filmed and copies distributed around the country. 
 Firing squads consisting of cabinet members and other top officials initially gunned down 21 men, including five ministers. Iraq's state radio said the officials executed their colleagues while ''cheering for the long life of the Party, the Revolution and the Leader, President, Struggler, Saddam Hussein.'' 
 Mr. Hussein invariably ensured that those around him were complicit in his bloody acts, which he masqueraded as patriotism, making certain that there would be no guiltless figure to rally opposition. 
 In an authoritative account of Mr. Hussein's government called ''The Republic of Fear,'' the self-exiled Iraqi architect Kenaan Makiya (writing under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil) estimated that at least 500 people died in the purge that consolidated Mr. Hussein's power. 
 Mr. Hussein's titles reflected his status as an absolute ruler modeled after one of his heroes, Josef Stalin of the former Soviet Union. They included president of the republic, commander in chief of the armed forces, field marshal and prime minister. In addition, the state-owned news media referred to him repeatedly as the Struggler, the Standard Bearer, the Knight of the Arab Nation and the Sword of the Arabs. 
 Mr. Hussein saw his first opportunity for Iraq to dominate the region in the turmoil that swept neighboring Iran immediately after its 1979 Islamic revolution. In September 1980, Mr. Hussein believed that by invading Iran he could both seize a disputed waterway along the border and inspire Iranians of Arab origin to revolt against their Persian rulers. Instead, they resisted fanatically. Mr. Hussein never acknowledged making a gross miscalculation; rather, he vilified the Iranian Arabs as traitors to the Arab cause. 
 Iraq fared badly in the war, not least because Mr. Hussein interfered in the battle plans despite a complete lack of military training, even issuing orders based on dreams. When strategies urged by Mr. Hussein failed, he often accused the commanders of betrayal, cowardice and incompetence and had them executed.

The Field Marshal
 Mr. Hussein adored the macho trappings of the armed forces, appointing himself field marshal and dressing his ministers in olive-green fatigues. If he was a poor military strategist, he was fortunate in his first choice of enemy. The fear that an Islamic revolution would spread to an oil producer with estimated reserves second only to Saudi Arabia tipped the United States and its allies toward Baghdad and they provided weapons, technology and, most important, secret satellite images of Iran's military positions and intercepted communications. 
 The war lasted for eight years until Iran accepted a cease-fire in July 1988, with both sides terrorizing each other's civilian populations by rocketing major cities. But the March 1988 mustard gas attack on the Iraqi village of Halabja by its own government was perhaps the most gruesome incident. 
 Mr. Hussein waged war while investing in massive development that markedly improved daily life. Rural villages were electrified and linked by modern highways. Iraq boasted some of the best universities and hospitals in the Arab world -- all free. Its painters, musicians and other artists, helped by government subsidies, were also the most accomplished in the region. Mr. Hussein had his own development methods. Anyone who avoided mandatory adult literacy classes in rural areas faced three years in jail. 
 Official corruption was unknown in Iraq in the 1980s, and religious worship somewhat free. Mr. Hussein occasionally took populist measures to underscore the importance of the public welfare. Once, for example, he decided that his ministers were too fat and he demanded that they diet, publishing their real weights and their target weights in the news media. Mr. Hussein's own weight could fluctuate from chubby to relatively trim, although well tailored suits hid his paunch. Around six feet tall, he was stocky and wore a trademark moustache. 
 In keeping with a ruler who used violence to achieve and sustain power, Mr. Hussein's most widespread investments were in his military. He ended the Iran-Iraq war with one million men under arms. 
 By then Iraq had embarked on extensive projects to acquire a homegrown arsenal of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Iraq had also become a regional power, and Mr. Hussein expected to dominate the Arab world. In March 1990, he threatened to ''burn half of Israel'' if it ever acted against Iraq, even though the Israeli Air Force had humiliated the Iraqi leader by destroying his country's nuclear research center at Osirik in June 1981.
 Mr. Hussein's next target was another neighbor, Kuwait, which Iraq had long considered part of Iraq and coveted for its deep-water port. On Aug. 2, 1990, his army swiftly occupied the tiny, immensely wealthy emirate, provoking an international crisis. Mr. Hussein declared the country Iraq's 19th province, installing a puppet government. Saudi Arabia and other conservative Arab states were shaken and outraged, while the United States and other Western countries feared for the oil fields ringing the Persian Gulf. The United Nations imposed a trade embargo and economic sanctions.
 The United States and eventually 33 other nations deployed forces to the region and warned of a wider war if Mr. Hussein did not withdraw. He held onto Kuwait despite repeated threats from the United States, which dominated the military coalition by dispatching some 500,000 American soldiers. Mr. Hussein portrayed the invasion as the start of an Islamic holy war to liberate Jerusalem. He declared that the ''throne dwarfs'' of the gulf must be overthrown so their wealth could finance the Arab cause. 
 His public aims resonated among many Arabs in Jordan, Yemen and elsewhere, particularly because the brutality of Mr. Hussein's government had never been detailed by the state-controlled media of other Arab states. In addition, Mr. Hussein's Scud missiles crashing into Tel Aviv, however ineffective, created a stir in the Arab world. 
 Washington and its coalition allies hoped that the war would bring Mr. Hussein's downfall. Even before the war ended, President George H. W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to overthrow him, but there was no coherent plan. The ground offensive against Iraq ended after 100 hours, partly out of concern that American troops not occupy an Arab capital, partly because Arab allies feared the disintegration of Iraq and partly because a ''100-hour war'' made a good sound bite. Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, warned that sending American forces to Baghdad would get them stuck in a ''quagmire.'' 
 This decision enabled much of the elite Republican Guard to escape with minimal losses. The first Bush administration did little to support Shiite and Kurdish uprisings that erupted immediately after the war. Mr. Hussein crushed them.

Oil, Food and Weapons
 For the next decade, Mr. Hussein repeatedly brought Iraq to the brink of renewed warfare by refusing United Nations weapons inspectors the access required to catalog and destroy Iraq's arsenal of unconventional weapons, as specified in the cease-fire agreement. 
 The United Nations maintained strict economic sanctions against Iraq until 1996, when some oil exports were allowed to pay for food, medicine and war reparations. The sanctions, devastating to Iraqis, proved a boon to Mr. Hussein and his subordinates. The Government Accountability Office in the United States Congress estimated that the Iraqi leader siphoned at least $10 billion from the program by making oil trades off the books and demanding kickbacks. 
 Still, in an effort to end sanctions, Baghdad over the years offered at least five ''full, final and complete'' weapons disclosures, which the United Nations dismissed as incomplete. Some of the most extensive revelations emerged after the astonishing August 1995 defection of Mr. Hussein's two sons-in-law and his two eldest daughters to Jordan. The Iraqi government was apparently worried that Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a son-in-law and the minister in charge of weapons development, would disclose all that he knew. Six months later, the general and his brother abruptly declared they had accepted amnesty and returned. Within days, Mr. Hussein's daughters divorced them, and they died in a violent shootout. 
 Although family feuds often descended into bloodshed, Mr. Hussein tried to maintain strict control of his own image. He dyed his hair black and refused to wear his reading glasses in public, according to interviews with exiles published in The Atlantic Monthly in March 2002. Because a slipped disc caused him to limp slightly, he was never filmed walking more than a few steps. Each of his 20 palaces was kept fully staffed, with meals prepared daily as if he were in residence to disguise his whereabouts. Delicacies like imported lobster were first dispatched to nuclear scientists to be tested for radiation and poison. 
 His wine of choice was Portuguese, Mateus Rose, but he never drank in public to maintain the conceit that he was a strict Muslim. He even had genealogists draw a family tree that linked him to Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad. 
 He kept an immaculate desk, with reports from all the ministries neatly stacked. He usually read only the executive summaries, but would occasionally dig deeper and always complained that he was being deceived. He often was, with even his son Qusay telling military commanders to lie if Mr. Hussein thought something had been accomplished that was not. 
 He was particularly phobic about germs. Even top generals summoned to meet him were often ordered to strip to their underwear and their clothes were then washed, ironed and X-rayed before they could get dressed to see him. Mr. Hussein's American jailers reported that he tried to maintain those precautions, using baby wipes to clean meal trays, his table and utensils before eating. 
 Rarely traveling abroad, and surrounded by often uneducated cousins, he had a limited worldview. He once reacted with wonder when an American reporter told him that the United States had no law against insulting the president. Former officials portrayed him as a vain, paranoid loner who no longer believed he was a normal person and considered compromise a sign of weakness. 
 Saad al-Bazzaz, an Iraqi writer and editor, said that Mr. Hussein, having risen so far beyond the village and cheated death so often, believed that God anointed him. 
 Mr. Bazzaz told The Atlantic that even Mr. Hussein's speeches echoed Koranic texts. ''In the Koran, Allah says, 'If you thank me, I will give you more,' '' Mr. Bazzaz said. ''In the early '90s, Saddam was on TV, presenting awards to military officers, and he said, 'If you thank me, I will give you more.' ''

Controlling a Nation
 Iraq under Mr. Hussein had a stifled quality. Imprisonment, torture, mutilation and execution were frequent occurrences, at least for those who chose to dabble in anything vaguely political. Simple information like the weather report was classified. There was no freedom of expression -- even foreign newspapers were banned -- and no freedom to travel. Contact with foreigners was proscribed. 
 There were widespread reports that Mr. Hussein himself periodically carried out the torture or even execution of those he felt had crossed him. In the summer of 1982, for example, Riyadh Ibrahim Hussein, the health minister, suggested during a cabinet meeting that Mr. Hussein step down to ease the negotiation of a cease-fire with Iran. Mr. Hussein recommended that the two retire to another room to discuss the proposal. When they did, a shot rang out. Mr. Hussein returned to the cabinet meeting alone, although in later interviews he denied killing anyone. The minister's widow was sent his dismembered corpse. 
 While assassinating Shiite Muslim religious leaders who opposed him, Mr. Hussein ordered mosques constructed around Baghdad on a scale not seen since it was the medieval capital of the Muslim caliphate. Perhaps the most striking was the Mother of All Battles mosque completed in 2001, the 10th anniversary of the Persian Gulf war. The minarets resembled Scud missiles, and the mosque held a Koran written with 28 gradually donated liters of Mr. Hussein's blood. 
 Evidence from inside Iraq after the invasion confirmed what United Nations weapons inspectors anticipated before -- that Mr. Hussein abandoned the attempt to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons after his 1991 defeat. Orders from Mr. Hussein to destroy vestiges of the program, interpreted before the 2003 invasion as an attempt to hide their development, turned out to be an effort to comply with the ban. 
 The fatal controversy over whether Iraq was still developing unconventional weapons stemmed in part from Mr. Hussein's desire to convince different audiences of different things, a postwar study by the Defense Department concluded. He wanted the West to believe that he had abandoned the program, which he had. Yet he also wanted to instill fear in enemies like Iran and Israel, plus maintain the esteem of Arabs, by claiming that he possessed the weapons. 
 Some Bush administration critics argued that the accusations over unconventional weapons were a smoke screen, that government hawks were determined to topple Mr. Hussein as a way of reasserting American power. Richard Clarke, a former national security adviser to three presidents, described in his 2004 book ''Against All Enemies'' the scene in the White House in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States, with President Bush and other senior officials trying to link Mr. Hussein directly to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization. No such link was ever established. 
 Just before the invasion, Mr. Hussein, cigar in hand, appeared on television almost nightly, belittling American forces to small groups of Republican Guard commanders. 
 Yet his main concern was preserving his government, which the United States military discovered in interviews with his captured aides. Some of the unclassified results were published in a 2006 article in Foreign Affairs titled ''Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside.''
 By 2003, Iraq's military was anemic, weakened by sanctions and constant changes in command, not to mention the fact that Mr. Hussein, suspicious of coup attempts, barred any rigorous maneuvers and repeatedly created new popular militias. Commanders also constantly lied to him about their state of preparedness. The United States report quoted Mr. Hussein's personal interpreter as saying that the president thought that his ''superior'' forces would put up a ''heroic resistance and inflict such enormous losses on the Americans that they would stop their advance.'' 
 Mr. Hussein cited both Vietnam and the hasty American withdrawal from Somalia in 1994 as evidence, and did not take the threat of regime change seriously. He so much believed his own publicity about his success in fighting the first gulf war that he used it as a blueprint for the second. Hence, his main worry during the invasion was to avoid repeating the Shiite and Kurdish internal rebellions of 1991. He did not blow up the bridges over the Tigris and Euphrates to slow the American advance, for example, out of concern that he would need to rush troops south to quell any uprising. 
 The war plan as described in the 2006 book ''Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq'' states that while Republican Guard troops were supposed to seal off the approaches to Baghdad, only the Special Republican Guard was permitted inside the capital, again as insurance against a coup. The collapse came so quickly that Mr. Hussein was still issuing orders to units that had ceased to exist. 
 After an April 9 sighting in public, he disappeared, apparently using up to 30 hiding places and the aid of loyal tribesmen to escape capture despite a $25 million reward. He often traveled as he had during the first gulf war, in a battered orange and white Baghdad taxi. He issued periodic messages encouraging the insurgency. 
 In a letter dated April 28 that was faxed to Al Quds al Arabi, an Arabic newspaper published in London, he blamed traitors for his ouster and urged Iraqis to rebel. ''There are no priorities greater than expelling the infidel, criminal, cowardly occupier,'' he wrote.

A Leader's Legacy
 In December 2003, his location was divulged by a clan member captured in a raid on a Baghdad house. Less than 11 hours later, 600 American soldiers and Special Operations forces supported by tanks, artillery and Apache helicopter gunships surrounded two farmhouses near the banks of the Tigris in Ad Dwar, a village about nine miles southeast of Tikrit, the tribal seat. The soldiers -- no Iraqis were involved -- found nothing on the first sweep. But on the second, more intensive search, under a trap door, Mr. Hussein was discovered lying at the bottom of an eight-foot-deep hole. 
 His first words when he emerged, nervous and disoriented, were, ''I am Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq, and I am willing to negotiate,'' in halting English. 
 A Special Operations soldier there shot back, ''President Bush sends his regards,'' the military said later. The main indication that the filthy, dilapidated concrete hut close by had been used by the former Iraqi president was a battered green metal suitcase holding $750,000 in neatly bundled bills. 
 Mr. Hussein, sporting a bushy salt-and-pepper beard, was first shown on television undergoing a medical exam for head lice. The pictures electrified and shocked Iraqis and the larger Arab world, with some cheering and some appalled to see a captive Arab leader put on undignified display.
 He was imprisoned at Camp Cropper, near the international airport some 10 miles from Baghdad, on the grounds of a former palace complex that the United States military turned into a prison for senior members of the government. The prison consisted of three rows of single-story buildings surrounded by a double ring of razor wire. 
 Mr. Hussein was kept in solitary confinement -- letters and care packages including cigars sent via the Red Cross from his wife and daughters living in Qatar or Jordan were his main contact with the outside world. He lived in a relatively spartan cell consisting of a bed, a toilet, a chair, a towel, some books and a prayer rug.
 Some of his former American guards, interviewed for a July 2005 story in GQ magazine, said he acted in a fatherly way, offering advice on finding a good wife -- ''neither too smart nor too dumb, not too old nor too young'' -- and invited them to hang out in one of his palaces after he was restored to power. He claimed that President Bush had always known he had no unconventional weapons. His favorite snack was Doritos corn chips, his guards said. 
 Mr. Hussein was combative throughout his trial, using it as a platform to encourage the insurgents. The proceedings frequently seemed to slide toward chaos, with the star defendant and the judges shouting at each other. The trial, held in one of the grandiose buildings erected not far from Mr. Hussein's former presidential palace, proved something of a security nightmare, with three defense lawyers assassinated. 
 At one point, something he said prompted guffaws from a spectator in an overhead gallery. Mr. Hussein turned and pointed a finger, saying, ''The lion does not care about a monkey laughing at him from a tree.''
 Mr. Hussein often tried to draw parallels between himself and the famous leaders of Mesopotamia, the earliest civilization in the region, as well as Saladin, the 12th-century Kurdish Muslim military commander who expelled the crusaders from Jerusalem. 
 What preoccupied him, he said, was what people would be thinking about him in 500 years. To the horror of historic preservationists, he had the ancient walls of the former capital, Babylon, completely reconstructed using tens of thousands of newly fired bricks. An archaeologisthad shown him bricks stamped with the name of Nebuchadnezzar II in 605 B.C. 
 After the reconstruction, the small Arabic script on thousands of bricks read in part, ''In the reign of the victorious Saddam Hussein, the president of the Republic, may God keep him, the guardian of the great Iraq and the renovator of its renaissance and the builder of its great civilization, the rebuilding of the great city of Babylon was done.''

HEADLINE: Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence Is Hanged for Crimes Against Humanity

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA, JAMES GLANZ and SABRINA TAVERNISE; Reporting was contributed by Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi and Khalid al-Ansary from Baghdad, Eric Lichtblau from Washington and Jeff Zeleny from Crawford, Tex.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein, the dictator who led Iraq through three decades of brutality, war and bombast before American forces chased him from his capital city and captured him in a filthy pit near his hometown, was hanged just before dawn Saturday during the morning call to prayer.
 The final stages for Mr. Hussein, 69, came with terrible swiftness after he lost the appeal, five days ago, of his death sentence for the killings of 148 men and boys in the northern town of Dujail in 1982. He had received the sentence less than two months before from a special court set up to judge his reign as the almost unchallenged dictator of Iraq.
His execution at 6:10 a.m. was announced on state-run Iraqiya television. Witnesses said 14 Iraqi officials had attended the hanging, at the former military intelligence building in northern Baghdad, now part of an American base. Those in the room said that Mr. Hussein was dressed entirely in black and carrying a Koran and that he was compliant as the noose was draped around his neck, refusing a hood
 He was remarkably calm in the video of the hanging by iraq's government, His final words, according to one witness, were to repeat twice a Muslim prayer. 
 Before the rope was slipped around his neck, according to a witness, he was asked if he was afraid. 
 ''No, he said without visible emotion. ''Anyone who takes this route should not be afraid.'' 
 Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who had pressed for a swift execution, said in a statement: ''To you who have endured the anguish of the years, and suffered from the injustice of the tyrants during the era of odious dictatorship, your pure land has gotten rid of impurity of the dictator.'' 
 At President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said Mr. Bush had gone to bed before the execution took place and was not awakened. Mr. Bush had received a briefing from his national security adviser Friday afternoon, when he learned the execution would be carried out within hours, Mr. Stanzel said. Asked why Mr. Bush had gone to sleep before hearing the news, he said Mr. Bush ''knew that it was going to happen.'' 
 In a statement written in advance, Mr. Bush said Mr. Hussein ''was executed after receiving a fair trial -- the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime.''
 ''Saddam Hussein's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror.''
 Concerned that the execution could incite violence, United States forces were placed on stepped-up alert and Iraqi officials suggested that the daily curfews here might be extended throughout the weekend.
 In the capital, streets and city blocks were subdued, with shoppers picking out cakes and fruit for the Muslim holiday that is just beginning. But the country was not entirely subdued. Sunni militants struck back in Baghdad, where three car bombs exploded in rapid succession in Huriya, a neighborhood in northern Baghdad, killing 25 and wounding 65. An in Kufa, a sacred Shiite town in the south, another bomb killed 36 people and wounded 58.
 Even as the executions appeared inevitable, many were skeptical or disbelieving that the noose could drop around Mr. Hussein's neck so soon. One Western official said that some of the American legal advisers working on the case appeared stunned at the hasty pace of events late Friday as they walked through the corridors of the Republican Palace, once Mr. Hussein's grandiose center of power.
 When Mr. Hussein came to power three years before the Dujail killings, he ruled over an oil-rich country that was an economic and technical powerhouse in the Middle East with rising cultural and political influence. When he hurtled through the trap door of the gallows Saturday morning, the nation he left behind was a smashed and traumatized remnant, desperately trying to restore its own identity and its place in the world.
 In between, Mr. Hussein invaded Iran and Kuwait in wars that cost over a million lives and left his military in a shambles, brutally suppressed a Shiite uprising in the south and saw his country become isolated and impoverished under the weight of United Nations-imposed sanctions. Finally, he was ousted by an American-led invasion force in 2003 and the country fell into a new round of internal violence as the rule of law disintegrated and the Western invaders proved unable to control a country in the aftermath of totalitarian rule.
 Those developments, so unwelcome to the Americans who so easily conquered this nation, showed that Mr. Hussein was also a unifying force whose painful grip held together Iraq's many ethnicities and sects. Now, three years after his fall, Iraq has descended further into chaos.
 As Iraqis across the country were trying to process the scope of what had happened, early reactions mirrored the deep sectarian divide that has been driving much of that violence and threatens to pull the country apart.
 ''Today is the best day we have seen since the fall of Saddam's regime,'' said Ayad Jamal al-Deen, a moderate Shiite political leader. ''The death of this man will help to release many Baathists from Saddam's mafia. The violence will be reduced.''
 But a Sunni tribal sheik expressed a thought typical of the hard-line Sunni minority, which has held tenaciously to the memory of being favored under Mr. Hussein.
 ''The execution of Saddam means that the flame of vengeance will be ignited and it will hurt the body of Iraq with unrecoverable wound,'' the sheik said.
 As Mr. Hussein awaited the hangman, he was apparently unaware that the American military was already making plans to dispose of his personal effects.
 Iraqi officials were vague to the end about when the execution would happen. ''We will do it very soon,'' said Munir Haddad, a judge on the Iraqi High Tribunal who represented the body at the execution.
 The entire proceeding was brief, efficient and largely lacking in ceremony. Four executioners, drawn from the ranks of the Iraqi police, wearing black ski-masks, shepherded him to where the thick rope resting on red railing at the ready.
 After he refused the hood, he was given a black scarf to swath his neck, protecting it from being sliced open.
 Other video footage showed the dead body of Mr. Hussein, draped in a white shroud. Lying on his back, his head turned unnaturally far to his right, he seemed to be vacantly gazing into the distance.
 In the end, the hanging was carried out with such haste that an ad hoc air at times overshadowed the historical import. 
 Prime Minister Maliki was still conferring with American officials late Friday night to work out the timing and resolve key details, like what to do with Mr. Hussein's body, a Western official said. 
 But Mr. Maliki's comments on Friday to the families of people who were killed while Mr. Hussein ruled left no doubt about where the prime minister stood on the time frame of the execution.
 ''Anyone who rejects the execution of Saddam is undermining the martyrs of Iraq and their dignity,'' Mr. Maliki said. ''Nobody can overrule the execution sentence issued against Saddam.'' 
 Without specifying a time, date or place, he said, ''There is no review or delay in implementing the execution verdict against Saddam.'' 
 Esam al-Gazawi, another lawyer representing Mr. Hussein who is currently in Jordan, expressed the views of many by suggesting that the timing of the execution was determined by the highest levels of the American and Iraqi governments.
 ''No one knows when it's going to happen except God and President Bush,'' he said shortly before Mr. Hussein was executed.
 Mr. Hussein spent his final hours in a dreary cell on an American base near the Baghdad airport, and there were indications that he was unaware that the end was drawing near.
 Iraqi and American officials kept outsiders, including his legal team, from contacting him all day, according to Najib al-Nauimi, one of Mr. Hussein's lawyers, who was in Qatar.
 But the legal team received a request late Friday asking for formal requests from people who could receive Mr. Hussein's effects, another of his lawyers said.
 ''I gave them a request that my colleagues and I are authorized to get Saddam's personal stuff,'' said the lawyer, Wadood Fawzi.
 In Washington, a United States District Court rejected an emergency motion filed Friday afternoon by lawyers for Mr. Hussein seeking to halt the execution on the grounds that it would interfere with pending civil litigations against him. Judge Kathleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled shortly after 9 p.m. that her court did not have jurisdiction to intercede.
 Mr. Hussein's trial and conviction have been mostly welcomed by the Iraqi Shiites and Kurds who suffered under his rule, but it has angered Sunni Muslims, helped to fuel a Sunni-led insurgency and done nothing to calm the increasingly chaotic sectarian violence here. 
 Iraqi officials said the execution would be filmed, both for the historical record and as proof for those who may doubt the word of both the Americans and Iraqis.
 As of late Friday, some Iraqi officials remained engaged in a heated debate about how swiftly to carry out Mr. Hussein's death sentence.
 An Iraqi official close to the negotiations expressed deep disappointment that, after years of forensic investigation, detailed litigation and careful deliberation, the process could be compromised in the final hours by politically driven haste.
 ''According to the law, no execution can be carried out during the holidays,'' said another official, ''After all the hard work we have done, why would we break the law and ruin what we have built?'' 
 The Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha begins Saturday for Sunnis and Sunday for Shiites, who now control the government.
 Iraqi law seemed to indicate that executions were forbidden on the holiday.
 But Judge Haddad was dismissive of those concerns, injecting some of the sectarian split that is pervading the country. ''The official Id in Iraq is Sunday,'' he said.
 As for Mr. Hussein's sect, he said, ''Saddam is not Sunni. And he is not Shiite. He is not Muslim.'' 
 Mr. Gazawi, the lawyer, said he was told that Mr. Hussein had met with two half-brothers, who are also in custody, but no other relatives.
 ''His sons are dead, and his daughters are here in Amman,'' he said. Mr. Hussein's two sons, Uday and Qusay, were killed by American soldiers after the 2003 invasion.
 After his government collapsed, Mr. Hussein went into hiding and was eventually found in a hide-out near his hometown of Tikrit.
 Once in custody, there were three cases brought against Mr. Hussein for crimes against humanity.
 The first case to begin hearings, and the simplest in terms of details, involved the executions of residents of Dujail after an attack on his motorcade there. Mr. Hussein was found guilty on Nov. 5 and sentenced to die by hanging. An appeals court upheld the ruling on Tuesday and said the sentence had to be carried out within 30 days.
 A trial on the far more sweeping charges that he directed the killing of 50,000 Kurds in an organized ethnic-cleansing campaign is still under way and will continue despite Mr. Hussein's execution.

HEADLINE: Not Everbody Loves Patricia

BYLINE: By JESSE GREEN

 BODY:
AT Frank E. Campbell's funeral chapel on Madison Avenue two weeks ago, friends and colleagues gathered to remember the actor Peter Boyle, who died on Dec. 12 at 71. They told stories about his impishness, his artfulness, his liberal fervor. Judy Collins sang ''Amazing Grace.''
 In the pews Patricia Heaton couldn't stop sobbing. For the nine seasons she had played Debra Barone on the sitcom ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' Mr. Boyle had played her Neanderthal father-in-law. They passed much of their downtime jousting about politics.
More conservative than he, she would call him a ''pinko flag-burning Commie.'' He would counter, ''So tell me about this Christian God of yours.'' Feeling unarmed for such battles, Ray Romano, the show's star, said he usually hustled off ''to see what the new doughnut was at the craft table.'' He needn't have. Their differences were serious, but the jibes were good-natured: tokens of closeness, not distance. And now he was gone. 
 And not just him. In the nearly two years since ''Raymond,'' one of America's most popular television shows, went off the air, a lot of the former givens have disappeared. ABC toyed with but chose not to broadcast a new sitcom Ms. Heaton developed; a documentary that she produced (and that her husband, David Hunt, directed) had trouble finding a distributor. 
 ''It was like I had been the queen of a planet where everyone loved me and did everything I asked, and suddenly I was back home on Earth,'' she said with a laugh over breakfast recently. ''I wasn't worshiped anymore.''
 She was speaking, in part, about the instant downgrading of her self-image from celebrity mother to plain old mom, complete with soccer schedules and puky laundry. (She and Mr. Hunt have four boys: 13, 11, 9 and 7.) But she was also speaking about the difficulty of finding satisfying film and television projects at 48, a difficulty that has led her to risk a return to the theater, which she pretty much ditched 16 years ago as one might ditch an abusive lover. In defiance of the usual Hollywood patterns, she is appearing not in a diva role, but as part of the ensemble cast of Theresa Rebeck's new play ''The Scene,'' which opens off Broadway on Jan. 11 at Second Stage Theater. 
 For those familiar only with Ms. Heaton's light comedy or political profile, her gale-force performance and her gleeful way with the obscenity-packed dialogue may come as a surprise. This is, after all, the same woman who walked out of the 2003 American Music Awards telecast, before her scheduled appearance, in disgust over the language and behavior of some presenters. 
 It's also the woman who in 1998 became honorary co-chairwoman of Feminists for Life, a group whose goals include economic and social support for women who ''refuse to choose'' abortion. Ms. Heaton's campus speeches and Washington lobbying resulted in the occasional snub from strangers (and the argumentative attention of friends like Mr. Boyle), but she managed to avoid the organized wrath of the left. More recently, however, she has found that the protective varnish of sitcom stardom degrades very quickly and that the ideal of affection, or even civility, among people who disagree is not widely upheld. 
 Her latest skirmish began several months ago when an industry friend expressed his concerns about embryonic stem-cell research. In Missouri, he explained, voters were considering a constitutional amendment that would permit the harvesting of stem cells from donated eggs and aborted fetuses. Because of the close race for control of Congress, the proposal drew national attention; the Democratic candidate for the Senate supported the amendment, while the Republican opposed it.
 ''I told my friend: 'I don't want to do anything about this. It's not even my state,' '' Ms. Heaton recalled. ''But he said: 'I just feel like I can't sit by. I have to answer for my actions at the end of my life.' And I'm like, 'Well, thanks a lot, now I have to too, because you told me about it.' 
 ''In the end,'' she said wistfully, while nevertheless digging into a plate of blueberry pancakes, ''you're responsible for the knowledge you have.''
 So she agreed to tape a 12-second message for a fund-raising video, in which she said: ''Amendment 2 actually makes it a constitutional right for fertility clinics to pay women for eggs. Low-income women will be seduced by big checks, and extracting donor eggs is an extremely complicated, dangerous and painful procedure.'' 
 But the video, which also included St. Louis sports figures, turned into a Mel Gibson-size nightmare when it got onto the Internet and, without her knowledge, was then shown as an advertisement on television during Game 4 of the World Series. It didn't help that it looked so cheesy or that it began, inexplicably, with the actor Jim Caviezel (who had played Jesus in Mr. Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ'') staring weirdly at the camera and speaking in Aramaic.
 ''Oh my God, it was a disaster,'' Ms. Heaton acknowledged. ''And then there was the whole Michael J. Fox aspect.''
 Also unbeknownst to Ms. Heaton, Mr. Fox, his Parkinsonian tremors clearly visible, had just appeared in an ad supporting the amendment. Because of the timing, her comments looked like a response to his and became associated with Rush Limbaugh's suggestion that Mr. Fox was faking his symptoms for sympathy. 
 Ms. Heaton was appalled, she said. ''Not only was the ad so bad, but why was it put on? It took the focus off of what we're talking about, which is very serious, and made it look like a feud or something, a Hollywood tabloid subject, a media thing of pitting people against each other.''
 The Internet floodgates opened. Web sites weighed in on ''Fox v. Heaton'' and generally eviscerated her. On YouTube.com, April Winchell, a California radio personality, posted a 38-second remix of Ms. Heaton's clip. It starts out saying, ''I'm Patricia Heaton, and I'm a religious zealot who thinks she knows what's best for everybody'' and gets uglier from there: ''I could give you the whole story, but I'd rather beat you over the head with my Bible. And besides it's not like stem-cell research makes you look younger. I mean, if it did, I'd be all over it.''
 That last dig was a reference to Ms. Heaton's plastic surgeries, about which she has been unusually candid. In her 2002 book, ''Motherhood and Hollywood'' (Villard), less a celebrity memoir than a collection of spiky, self-deprecating essays, she described herself as a ''5-foot-2 runt'' whose stomach, ''after four C-sections and too many years of nursing,'' had become ''a big old wrinkly suede bag hanging down,'' and whose breasts ''had to be folded up like origami'' to fit into strapless gowns. Now she looks toned and lovely.
 If Ms. Heaton has made her surgery fair game, her political views are not so easily pigeonholed. Some derive from the ''seamless garment'' doctrine of her ''devout Catholic upbringing'' (she opposes both abortion and the death penalty) while others are clearly her own. (She supports gay rights and the use of most birth control.) And she is not, in person, prudish or judgmental. Most of her friends have had abortions, she said, and they're still her friends. 
 It isn't so much her views that cause her trouble as her unwillingness to finesse them for public consumption. She is compulsively honest, though she feels that's not so much a virtue as ''an illness, like Tourette's.'' Even her more extreme positions are stated without hedging: If it were up to her, she said, there would be no abortion for any reason. But she offers such thoughts with a sense of helplessness, as if she were trapped by the implications of her core principles.
 And then there is her un-wingnutlike desire for conciliation. As soon as she realized what had happened, she sent Mr. Fox a message saying that she was sorry and that she prayed for his recovery. He responded graciously (the amendment passed with 51 percent of the vote) and later said, ''If we can have a healthy dialogue about issues that people see differently, that's marvelous.'' 
 That's a big if. Most of the dialogue, Ms. Heaton said, has been brutal: ''People saying they hope my kids get sick and die so I'll know what it's like to need medical research.'' Colleagues have attacked her at industry functions; gossips claiming to know her have described her as a horrible person. A theater Web site recently ran a discussion thread on boycotting ''The Scene.'' And castmates have told Ms. Heaton that their friends were saying things like: ''You're working with her? You know what her thing is, right?''
 Ms. Rebeck, the playwright, knew and didn't care. ''That's flawed thinking,'' she said of the boycott chatter, ''like what happened with the Dixie Chicks. And I would hate to think of liberals as the new conservatives. I don't agree with all of Patty's politics, but she's not the kind of political thinker who drives you crazy with their solipsism, and I think the country might be in better shape if we could engage with each other in the way she does. Anyway, she's pretty great in the play'' -- she called Ms. Heaton's comic timing ''something I dream about'' and her emotional availability ''staggering'' -- ''so that's where I come down.''
 There's a connection between responding credibly to a fictional situation and responding to real-world issues. But Ms. Heaton mistrusts that connection, even in herself, because she has seen how easily actors can manipulate emotions and turn an embarrassing need for attention into a cause. 
 ''Being an actor, I love what we do,'' she said, ''but I don't have that high a regard for it. And when embarrassing people, myself included, talk about their views, you just have to laugh. Who cares? And yet somebody's given you a pulpit, so you do it. On the other hand, you can do a lot of good without going on CNN, and I totally respect actors who never discuss their views. I wish I was one of them. Too late now. I'm trying to get back in the box.''
 It's hard to see how she can do that while simultaneously exploring more and deeper means of expression. On ''Raymond'' she took a character who was something of a cipher in the pilot episode and filled her in with despair; her anger at being stuck with all the domestic chores was so visceral that it often seemed like a brick lobbed through the screen. Mr. Romano said that's what got Ms. Heaton the job; it also won her two Emmys. She says she drew that anger directly from her experience as a wife in the middle passage -- ''the seething years'' -- of marriage.
 But there was only so far she could take such insights within the confines of the sitcom format. ''The Scene,'' which is billed as a ''brutal comedy,'' is what might have happened if ''Raymond'' had been written for HBO and doctored by Dickens. In it Ms. Heaton plays Stella, a talk-show booker whose marriage to an out-of-work actor, played by Tony Shalhoub, spirals out of control. All of Stella's carefully balanced disappointments and color-coded accommodations collapse in the face of something very much like evil.
 Ms. Heaton knew instantly upon reading the play that she had to take the role. She understood Stella subcutaneously; when one of the characters described her as a ''frigid Nazi priestess,'' she felt it was almost a compliment. But she also understood the play's unflinching moral outlook. Though it is set in high-rise Manhattan instead of a Cleveland suburb, it felt like home to her, with its portrait of people who know life is a battle between right and wrong but who don't always have the will to join the right team. 
 Ms. Heaton's parents left no doubt as to which team was which. They attended Mass every day, and their taste in interior decoration ran to pictures of St. Lucy holding her eyeballs on a platter. There wasn't much room for young Patty's ''Look at me!'' demands for attention, but her childhood was marked by nothing much worse than benign neglect until she was 12, when her mother died. The resulting flare of grief seemed to etch the pattern of her mother's standards on her forever, and also her distance from them.
 In college, and especially during eight subsequent years of hapless struggle in New York, that distance became a kind of no-man's-land she had to traverse daily, from bad job to binge to church and back again. The churches varied: Catholic, Calvinist, New Age cult. (She now attends Sunday school, but not services, at a Presbyterian church.) Nothing closed the gap, not an early marriage or quick divorce, not sinning or atoning or jobs modeling shoes. By the time she left for Los Angeles in 1990, her ''slightly annoying Ohio enthusiasm'' had been expunged, and she was ''emotionally battered.'' 
 What finally helped was meaningful work, marrying Mr. Hunt and the huge responsibility of caring for children. (''And thank God I found somebody good to do it for me,'' she said. ''I mean, I wouldn't hire just any Swedish nanny.'') The chaos of otherness calmed her down, brought her closer to her parents' ideal of the sacrificial life, of ''dying to yourself.'' But living that ideal when you are an actor can be somewhat contradictory, which is pretty much the heart of Ms. Heaton's artistic and personal drama as she awakes from a ''16-year coma.'' What is she good for? What is she called on to do? 
 She knows she often flubs the answers. ''But I take comfort,'' she said, ''in noticing that all the people that God chose had problems and failings: David, Peter, Paul, Mary Magdalene.'' She spoke these names without special deference, as if they were pals from high school glee club. ''God reached out to them specifically. And I've always felt closest to God when I'm on a stage. I guess it's really useful to be damaged in this business, because it makes it possible for you to express things -- and get paid for it.'' 
 She laughed at herself. ''Though it can,'' she admitted, ''be inconvenient in real life.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Problem? Check the American Psyche

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
WHAT is the most pressing problem facing the economy? A good case can be made for the developing health care crisis. Soaring costs, growing ranks of uninsured and a steady erosion of corporate health benefits add up to a giant drag on the nation's future prosperity.
 While the outlook seems scary, it doesn't have to be. There is a solution, proven effective for hundreds of millions of people: single-payer health insurance.
Yes, single-payer -- that much-maligned idea that calls for everyone to pay into one insurer, typically the government or a public agency. The insurer then pays doctors, pharmacists and hospitals at preset rates. Patients who want unapproved procedures and doctors not willing to accept the standard payment remain free to deal with one another directly, outside the system.
 Such a system makes it much easier to deal with the growing costs of medical care, like administrative expenses and prescription drugs. It could also reduce the mountains of paperwork plaguing the current system and provide insurance coverage for the 46 million Americans now doing without it. 
 What's more, as demonstrated in France, Britain, Canada, Australia and other countries with functioning single-payer systems, significant savings can come without hurting the overall health of the population.
 There's only one catch. Most Americans just don't believe it can be done. The health care crisis may turn out to be more of a problem of ideology than economics.
 The economic case for a single-payer system is surprisingly strong. Start with what we already know. Countries with single-payer systems have long records of spending less on health care than the United States does. The United States spent an average of $6,102 a person on it in 2004, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, while Canada spent $3,165 a person, France $3,159, Australia $3,120 and Britain just $2,508.
 At the same time, life expectancy in the United States, a broad measure of health, was slightly lower than it was in those other countries in 2004, the latest year for which complete figures are available. And the United States had a higher rate of infant mortality.
 To be sure, a single-payer system has plenty of critics. Unattractive features of some such systems, including waiting lists for particular types of care, are often highlighted by skeptics. But supporters note that the overall health of people fares well in those countries.
 ''The story never changes,'' said Gerard F. Anderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ''The United States is twice as expensive with about the same outcome.
 ''As a consumer, I don't mind paying more if I'm getting more, but that's just not the case in the U.S.,'' said Professor Anderson, who publishes an annual review comparing the American health care system with those of its peers.
 What may be less well known is the level of administrative waste in the United States health care system, versus that of well-designed systems elsewhere. Although Americans tend to equate efficiency with private enterprise, that's not the case with the current system.
 The American system, based on multiple insurers, builds in more unnecessary costs. Duplicate processing of claims, large numbers of insurance products, complicated bill-paying systems and high marketing costs add up to huge administrative expenses.
 Then there's an enormous amount of paperwork required of American doctors and hospitals that simply doesn't exist in countries like Canada or Britain.
 ''There's little disagreement among economists today that a single-payer system would lead to lower administrative costs,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist with the New America Foundation, a policy research organization in Washington. But he said that estimates varied widely over how big the savings could be.
 One of the first major studies to quantify administrative costs in the United States was published in August 2003 in The New England Journal of Medicine by three Harvard researchers, Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell and David U. Himmelstein. It concluded that such costs accounted for 31 percent of all health care expenditures in the United States.
 More recently, in 2005, a study by the Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm commissioned to examine a proposal to provide universal health coverage in California, estimated that administrative costs consumed 20 percent of total health care expenditures nationwide.
 Then there's the test of time. Health care costs tend to rise over time as new technology and procedures are introduced. Yet here, too, government-funded systems appear to help contain long-term costs.
 Consider Canada's system. Professor Anderson points out that in the 1960s, Canada and the United States spent roughly the same per person on health care. Some three decades later, though, Canada spent half as much as America. How did Canada manage this? By controlling the use of medical equipment and hospital resources, which statistics show has helped Canadians keep a lid on costs without measurably compromising the overall health of the population.
 Economic studies also show that a government-funded system could reduce costs while providing coverage for everyone. The Lewin report on the proposal to provide universal health coverage in California calculated that if such a system had been operating in 2006, it would have saved $8 billion, or around 4.3 percent of total health spending in the state. From 2006 to 2015, it estimated, savings would total $343 billion. Currently, California spends about $180 billion a year on health care.
 Despite everything that is known about the economic benefits of a single-payer system, there's one big stumbling block: many Americans don't believe in it. They have heard horror stories from abroad, often spread by partisan advocates, focusing on worst-case examples. Such tales play upon the aversion of many Americans to government involvement in the economy.
 Victor R. Fuchs, an economics professor at Stanford and a specialist in health care economics, explained it this way: ''The Canadian system is a nonstarter for the U.S. even though it's a good system for Canadians. You're dealing with two very different countries. We were founded on life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They were founded on peace, order and good government. It's a difference of values.''
 Others in the field echo his skepticism. But that raises questions about how well Americans understand the system they have, and what the alternatives are.
 JUDGING from other countries, many features that Americans really like -- being able to choose their own doctor, for example -- would remain available in a well-designed single-payer system. And a single-payer system need not mean government-provided care: it often means government-provided insurance that encourages competition among providers.
 Much of the resistance to a single-payer system appears to stem from a lack of confidence in the nation's ability to make positive change. With all of its prowess in research and technology, can't the United States match the efficiency of other developed nations, or do even better?
 Changing the minds of so many millions of people isn't done overnight. But sooner or later, persuading people to do something that's in their own economic interest ought to succeed.

HEADLINE: Tax Doubles on Flights Leaving Britain

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
Be warned, Anglophiles, if the weak dollar was not enough to discourage you from visiting Britain, the recent decision by the British government to double the air passenger duty on all flights leaving Britain is about to make a trip across the pond even more financially punitive. 
 Starting Feb. 1, economy passengers on all short-haul domestic and European Union flights leaving Britain will pay a departure tax of $:10, or $20 at $2 to the pound, and those in business and first class will pay $:20.
Even more significant for American travelers is the long-haul tax on flights departing for locations outside Europe. Returning to the United States from London, for instance, economy passengers will now be charged $:40 (up from $:20), and business and first-class clients will pay a tax of $:80. 
 The tax also applies to tickets bought for travel after Feb. 1 but before the tax was announced. But some airlines may pay the fee at first. British Airways, for example, will absorb the cost for tickets bought before Dec. 13.

HEADLINE: A New Way to Gauge a Start-Up's Worth

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
INVESTORS in young, fast-growing companies have a new way to calculate their value without regard to the prices of other companies' stocks. This is an important advance, because most other appraisal methods for start-ups are based on relative valuation, which -- as we saw at the top of the Internet bubble -- grossly overvalues a new company when comparable companies in the same industry are also overvalued.
 The new approach is the brainchild of Andrew Metrick, an associate professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He calls it a ''reality check model,'' and he introduced it in his new book, ''Venture Capital and the Finance of Innovation'' (Wiley & Sons, 2006). 
Relative valuation is widely used to analyze start-ups because there seems to be no other choice. After all, a brand-new company has little hard financial data to plug into the standard valuation models that analysts use for mature companies. But by using relative valuation -- basing stock value on that of others in the industry -- a young company's share price can occasionally become wildly divorced from reality. 
 In an interview, Professor Metrick acknowledged the dearth of hard data on start-ups. But he also said that this should not be used as an excuse for ''anything goes.'' By substituting some reasonable assumptions for the data otherwise needed to apply the conventional models, his model provides its reality check.
 One important assumption deals with how fast a start-up's revenue will grow. Investors are especially prone to exaggerating this, because before a start-up goes public its typical growth rate is very high. 
 To arrive at a realistic assumption for a specific start-up, Professor Metrick looks at the revenue growth rates of all other companies in its industry after they went public. He assumes that the start-up's revenues will grow faster than those of 75 percent of the comparable initial public offerings -- an assumption that gives the start-up a big benefit of the doubt.
 Another crucial assumption involves how long a start-up can grow faster than its industry average. In his research, Professor Metrick found that the median start-up does so for five years after going public. Again, to give start-ups the benefit of the doubt, he assumes they can outpace their industry for seven years.
 Armed with these and other assumptions, he can calculate the present value of a start-up's future earnings. This approach, known as the discounted cash flow model, is perhaps the one most widely to value mature companies. He concedes that the number produced by his model is by no means perfect. But because it makes generous assumptions about start-ups' growth in several crucial ways, he said, it sends a warning signal if the valuation it reaches is significantly less than the market's.
 Consider Riverbed Technology, a data network company that went public in October. Professor Metrick's model calculates a value for the company of $184 million, or less than 10 percent of its market capitalization of $2 billion. To bet on Riverbed Technology at its current price, you presumably would need to believe that its revenue growth rate will be even higher than his model already assumes, and that it will beat the industry average for far more than the next seven years. Those are high hurdles, Professor Metrick reminds us.
 As an example of a new issue that may be more fairly valued, he offers InnerWorkings, which provides printing solutions to corporate clients. His model calculates a value for this company that is nearly double its current market cap of $702 million. 
 His model is also helpful as a reality check on companies that have been public for a couple of years and that investors may be valuing on the assumption that their high growth rates will continue forever. In such cases, analysts' estimates of growth are now available, so the model can rely on them. 
 Consider the conclusion reached by this model when retroactively applied to Cisco Systems in early 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst. At the time, the market valued Cisco as the most profitable public company. If applied to Cisco then, the model would have calculated it was worth only about one-tenth as much.
 That's a remarkable conclusion, because the analysts themselves were then wildly optimistic about Cisco's future growth. ''The model at that time would have shown that the analysts' growth assumptions, high as they were, were not nearly high enough to justify Cisco's valuation,'' Professor Metrick said. Cisco's stock, of course, fell to less than $10 a share in 2002 from more than $80 in early 2000. 
 AND what about Google, which has risen to around $460 a share from an initial offering price of $85 in August 2004? As with Cisco, Professor Metrick fed into his model the consensus of analyst estimates for Google, rather than basing his growth-rate assumptions on an average of other young tech companies. His model values Google at more or less its current price.
 But that doesn't necessarily mean Google is a good investment at the current price, he says. To believe that it is, you presumably have to believe in the consensus growth assumptions of analysts. Still, he added, his model shows that the market is not overvaluing Google anywhere nearly as much as it did Cisco in 2000.

LENGTH: 1110 words

HEADLINE: A Little Style, a Little Room and a Little Price

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, Americans looking for affordable lodging in Europe essentially had two choices: book with a familiar American hotel chain or stay at one of the many independently run hotels and bed-and-breakfasts in Britain and on the continent.
 Neither solution was perfect. Bed-and-breakfasts could be hit or miss. And though American hotels provided a certain level of quality assurance, finding one outside a major city was difficult.
But thanks to a new wave of European hotel chains designed with price-sensitive travelers in mind, vacationers have affordable new options. For the budget-minded, there has been strong growth in the economy market. For the style-conscious traveler looking for reasonably priced hotels with a cool bar scene and trendy rooms, boutique hotels are multiplying and forming minichains. 
 Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the serial entrepreneur who founded the British budget airline easyJet, introduced a new budget concept to Europe in 2005 when he opened the first easyHotels (www.easyhotel.com) in London and Basel, Switzerland. For as little as $:30 a night ($60 dollars at $2 to the pound), guests get a tiny hotel room, as small as 65 square feet, with a flat-screen television, a private bathroom with a shower and one towel each. Daily housekeeping services and extra towels are available for a fee. The idea is that customers will accept less space and service in return for a better price. EasyHotels have no restaurants or bars, so guests must go elsewhere for meals. 
 The rooms are ''purely a function of sleep,'' said Sir Stelios, who also pointed out the hotels are aimed at travelers on short stays. The main design criteria for the concept were simple, he said: ''You have to be able to stand up and have a bathroom.'' 
 Two more easyHotels, in the Earls Court and Victoria neighborhoods of London, will begin taking reservations as soon as February. Over the next five years, three more are planned in London, one in Budapest and another in Switzerland.
 For travelers who want a larger room and a restaurant, there is Premier Travel Inn, Britain's biggest hotel chain, created in July 2004 when Whitbread P.L.C., owner of the Travel Inn chain, acquired Premier Lodge. Now, the company has more than 475 locations including roughly 30 hotels in London, more than 30 in Scotland, 8 in and around Cardiff and more than 40 in Greater Manchester. It has plans to open eight new hotels next year from Belfast, Ireland, to Bracknell, England.
 Each Premier Travel Inn (www.premiertravelinn.com) has a restaurant and bar, either as part of the hotel or adjacent to it. Rooms, most of which have king-sized beds, full bathrooms, and tea and coffee makers, start at $:47 a night. 
 Working with Hypnos, the British bedmaker that designs Queen Elizabeth's beds, Premier Travel Inns overhauled its beds over the summer to offer new mattresses, a choice of pillows and white bed linens with purple throws. The chain promises to refund the cost of the room if a guest doesn't get a good night's sleep. An independent audit of each hotel is conducted at least twice a year to check for consistency and involves a ''mystery sleeper'' who tests for cleanliness, friendliness and comfort. 
 Don't expect these options to bring you any closer to the local culture. Rooms are typically cookie-cutter affairs. But as Tom Meyers, editor of Eurocheapo.com says, ''Sometimes you just want a nice, clean, air-conditioned, reasonably priced room.''
 Eurocheapo recommends Ibis hotels (www.ibishotel.com), in several cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin, Munich and London. Ibis, one of the economy brands of Accor, the giant French hotel company, has 651 hotels in Europe, most of them in France and Germany. Rooms typically cost around 100 euros, $134, at $1.34 to the euro, a night, or less and are no-frills affairs. But the chain promises to solve any problem with a room in 15 minutes or let the customer stay free. 
 For the style-conscious traveler willing to pay a bit more for a hotel with a cool bar scene and trendy rooms, two chains worth considering are Malmaison (www.malmaison.co.uk) and Hotel du Vin (www.hotelduvin.com), which are both owned and operated by Marylebone Warwick Balfour Group P.L.C.
 The chains were created separately in the 1990s from landmark buildings like churches and warehouses that were gutted and given new, stylish interiors behind the original facades. With average prices of $:100 to $:145, they offer high style at a reasonable cost. 
 Malmaison, named after the Empress Josephine's chateau on the outskirts of Paris, is now found in nine British cities. Its newest hotel, opening in Liverpool on Jan. 29, will have 128 rooms with high-speed Internet access and two suites with teak bathtubs, large flat-screen televisions and table-top soccer. Opening rate: $:99 a night. 
 Hotel du Vin puts more emphasis on the sybaritic. Food is cooked with local ingredients, and extensive wine lists include bottles at reasonable prices. Each of the chain's eight hotels has suites with ''party showers'' that can fit up to 12 people. There is also bathside waiter service and walk-in humidors.
 DAKOTA (www.dakotahotels.co.uk) is a two-year old boutique hotel chain created by Ken McCulloch, the Scottish hotelier who also started Malmaison and is often credited with setting off the boutique hotel craze in Britain. The hub of a Dakota hotel is its restaurant, called the Bar & Grill, and these dining spots usually fill up so quickly with locals on weekends that guests are advised to make reservations well in advance. 
 ''Essentially, Dakota is a Bar & Grill with bedrooms, not a 92-bedroom hotel with a Bar & Grill,'' said Kevin Farey, a spokesman. 
 Rates range from $:86 pounds a night at the Dakota Nottingham to $:249 pounds for the top rooms at the Dakota in Farnborough, England. There are no discounts. The rate you see is the rate you get. 
 The growth in affordable options is particularly welcome relief for American travelers who have watched the value of their money plunge against European currencies. In mid-December, the dollar reached a 20-month low against the euro and was at a 14-year low against the pound.
 ''I was in London just last week, and I paid $2.13 to convert to pounds,'' said Jeff Max, chief executive of an e-commerce company, who travels there frequently. ''It's not unusual to go out and have a mediocre Indian or Chinese meal in London now and spend $120. It's shocking, shocking, shocking.''
 Lately, he has taken to staying at Malmaison because it offers ''the quality and the style of a much more expensive line and brand at something more affordable.''

LENGTH: 1245 words

HEADLINE: Away From the Limelight, A Builder Makes His Mark

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
IN the sometimes flamboyant world of property development, Joshua L. Muss has established a reputation as an unobtrusive builder. 
 ''He just quietly goes ahead and figures out how to develop a project,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, who has known Mr. Muss for about 25 years.
Recently, at a site in Flushing, Queens, where Mr. Muss is planning a 3.3-million-square-foot retail and residential complex, ''I was impressed by the fact that he didn't say, 'I've got this site -- tell me what I can build on it,' '' Mr. Spinola said. ''Instead, he was thinking about how he was going to change the neighborhood.''
 This understated style has also benefited Muss Development, the family-owned company based in Forest Hills, Queens, that Mr. Muss has been running for the past 23 years, after his father and grandfather. The company has been in business for 100 years. 
 Under his leadership, the company has expanded in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island with several large developments, including the 656-room New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge and the 850-unit Oceana Condominium and Club in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. 
 The evolution from builder to community visionary has been generations in the making. At the start of the 20th century, Mr. Muss's grandfather, Isaac Muss, emigrated from Russia to South Africa, where he built barracks during the second Boer War, and then to Brooklyn, where he immediately began building housing in order to support his family, which grew to 11 children. Six of them were boys, and the five surviving ones became builders, including Mr. Muss's father, Hyman Muss. 
 The family was one of 123 builders featured in the book ''Building Up Greater Brooklyn'' (Brooklyn Biographical Society, 1925). Mr. Muss said Muss Development has developed about 18 million square feet of space over its 100-year history, surviving the ups and downs of the economy. 
 ''The Depression virtually wiped my grandfather out, but the family continued in business,'' said Mr. Muss, who is 65. ''To support himself during the Depression, my father, who had graduated law school, became an ordained rabbi. He couldn't make a living as a developer or a lawyer, so he became a pulpit rabbi.''
 Mr. Muss said he knew from childhood that he, too, was destined to be a builder. After graduating from Yeshiva College and Harvard Law School, he joined the company in 1965 and spent a decade learning the business.
 ''For five years, I listened to everything my father said and did, and everything he said was right,'' Mr. Muss said. ''The next five years, I figured that everything he said and did was wrong. After that, I came to appreciate what he did right and what he did wrong, and I started to contribute.''
 When his first development attempt went awry after the financier ran out of money in the mid-1970s, Mr. Muss took on a project from the home builder Kaufman & Broad, which had struggled for more than a decade to get development approvals for a tract of land on the South Shore of Staten Island.
 Mr. Muss received the necessary approvals within two years. He said he learned that intestinal fortitude was sometimes necessary to close a deal.
 ''The final approval was to get a sewer outfall permit, which went over somebody else's property, which was a ship junkyard,'' he recalled. ''I went out with one of my contractors, who knew the landowner, and for the first time ever, started drinking.
 ''We sat on the porch in the middle of this desolate area, talking to the owner, and I don't know what I was drinking, but it had a kick,'' he continued. ''After about six or eight sessions, we convinced him to give us the approval to go across his land.''
 Before his father caught on, Mr. Muss went back to being a virtual teetotaler. He then developed a 75-acre patch into Woodbrooke, a large residential community on Staten Island with about 1,200 condominium units.
 ''To be a developer in the true sense of the word, you have to have anywhere from 10 to 20 years of experience to understand the risks that are inherent, the time frames, the disappointments, the costs, the rewards, the net gross and the income levels,'' Mr. Muss said. ''Honestly, unless you've suffered a little bit, you really don't appreciate what it takes.''
 Mr. Muss's wisdom has helped to get Muss Development -- which still does all its own construction -- through the real estate market's leaner times. It took the company 15 years to develop the first phase of the Marriott in Brooklyn, beginning in 1983. 
 ''We started this project in times of greatness; it evolved into an era of hunger,'' Mr. Muss said.
 Downtown Brooklyn at the time was not the competitor it is today to office markets in Lower Manhattan and New Jersey. But Muss Development persisted and, when the hotel succeeded, started an expansion to make it one of the larger hotels in New York City.
 Big projects with sweeping timelines are common in the boroughs outside Manhattan, Mr. Muss said. Though the costs of development can be comparable to Manhattan's, he said, the financial rewards can be smaller. 
 Because those boroughs see the spotlight less often, other Brooklyn developers like the Walentas family consider Mr. Muss not just a notable competitor but also an ally.
 ''Rising tides certainly lift all boats,'' said Jed Walentas, whose father, David Walentas, originally envisioned the neighborhood now known as Dumbo. ''I think in Brooklyn there's more of a collegial atmosphere than you have in Manhattan,'' he said. ''Josh has been a wonderful partner.''
 Joseph J. Sitt, the founder of Thor Equities, another large Brooklyn developer, said that family-owned developers have distinct advantages but that Mr. Muss has distinguished himself with the transformation of a faded beach club into Oceana in Brighton Beach. It is one of the largest housing communities to be built in the city outside of Manhattan in more than a half-century.
 ''His family owned Oceana for years, and it has definitely been a strategic advantage of his, but I think that if he had paid the market price, he'd still be one of the best developers in town,'' Mr. Sitt said.
 The Oceana property had been owned by Alexander Muss, Mr. Muss's uncle, since the early 1950s. Alexander Muss received local government approval to build four towers in the early 1990s after a protracted community battle, but financing had become difficult. Mr. Muss bought the property from his uncle in 1996 and decided instead to build 15 lower-rise buildings that better fit in with the neighborhood. That helped to obtain financing. ''We decided that we'll build less units and have less traffic, and they'll give us a ticker-tape parade,'' Mr. Muss said.
 The 15th building is currently under construction. Oceana's units range from two-bedroom homes to penthouses, and have prices from $600,000 to more than $2 million.
 Mr. Muss says he will apply lessons learned there to his development in Flushing. The $600 million project will have 1,100 residential units and an 815,000-square-foot retail center.
 And what about venturing into Manhattan? That effort is being led by the fourth generation of Muss Development, primarily by his son Jason. Mr. Muss seems to think that it is a good idea, but he would rather that few people know. 
 ''I don't want it known that I'm into Manhattan,'' he said. ''That's one of my strengths. People don't worry about me. They think I'm under the radar.''

HEADLINE: Is It Time to Add a Parking Lot to Your Portfolio?

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
A PARKING lot near the Philadelphia International Airport offers a host of high-end services: valet assistance, online reservations, even a loyalty rewards program. But the niceties can't hide an outback location. Tucked between Interstate 95 and a field of chemical storage tanks, it lies at the end of a boulevard lined with body shops and strip clubs. About a mile from the airport's terminals, it's an alternative to the more costly municipal parking choices there.
 The lot and dozens like it around the United States are owned by the Macquarie Infrastructure Company, an investment trust directed by the Macquarie Bank of Australia. The trust, which buys entire businesses, is among three Macquarie affiliates -- the others are closed-end mutual funds -- that trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
This Aussie trio gives retail investors the chance to invest in infrastructure -- a more formal term for workaday enterprises like parking lots, toll roads, bridges, airports and aviation services. 
 This year, the Macquarie Infrastructure Company returned 15.2 percent, compared with 13.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Macquarie's two closed-end funds in the United States are Macquarie Global Infrastructure Total Return, up 38.4 percent this year, and Macquarie/First Trust Global Infrastructure/Utilities Dividend & Income, up 16.2 percent. (Macquarie Bank is the subadviser of the second fund for First Trust Portfolios of Lisle, Ill.)
 All three have been listed in the last three years, and neither of the closed-end funds can hold shares of the trust. All three are distinct from the Macquarie Infrastructure Group, which trades in Sydney and has made several high-profile investments in American highways, including the Indiana Toll Road, the Skyway in Chicago and the Dulles Greenway in Virginia.
 Macquarie Bank says parking lots and roadways are potentially as valuable as oil pipelines or electric companies. It views a private parking lot, for example, as operating much like a utility: throwing off lots of cash, increasing its rates as the economy grows and often chugging along with little direct competition.
 Macquarie Bank holds a dominant position in this fledgling niche. It invests worldwide through more than 30 listed and unlisted funds and manages more than $35 billion worth of infrastructure equity. Its success has spawned imitators: such well-known firms as Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group have been creating infrastructure funds, typically geared to institutional investors.
 Some analysts raise questions about the amount of debt sometimes carried by the Macquarie Infrastructure Company for acquisitions and the fees Macquarie Bank charges for the management and investment banking provided to its United States affiliates. Before a recent secondary stock offering, the Macquarie Infrastructure Company had a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.49, compared with 0.73 for the average company in the S.& P. 500, Reuters said. A higher ratio indicates potentially more risk for investors.
 And Macquarie Bank charges its affiliates handsomely for its services, as when the Macquarie Infrastructure Company hires the bank when acquiring assets. The fund also pays a flat management fee as well as a chunk of its profits to the bank.
 Ted Gardner, an analyst based in Houston for Raymond James Financial, compared the compensation arrangement to that of a private equity firm. ''They're definitely taking care of themselves on the advisory fees,'' he said. But the Macquarie Infrastructure Company has a longer investment horizon than private-equity competitors. ''They're not trying to get out in five to seven years,'' he said.
 Even a fan said that the bank receives a lot for what it gives. ''The fees are rich, but most of them are performance-based, and as a result, I think they earn what they get,'' said Donald B. Gimbel, senior managing director at Carret Asset Management in New York.
 Macquarie defends the fees and its use of debt, pointing out that the fees depend largely on its performance and that its steady assets generate plenty of cash for debt repayment.
 No one questions Macquarie's smarts in infrastructure. It was a pioneer in this area; Australia's government was one of the first to privatize roads and airports, helping to create the niche. The company has grown into Australia's largest investment bank on the strength of its international expertise.
 ''They've got people looking at deal flows worldwide, and they're very good at locating deals,'' said Babak Zenouzi, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Delaware Investments in Philadelphia. ''Then they've got 450 or so people who help manage the assets.''
 Macquarie executives say infrastructure is a new asset class, deserving a place in investors' portfolios alongside the usual stocks, bonds, cash and real estate. According to this line of thinking, the durability and stability of the assets protect against the zigzags of stocks and bonds. In other words, London Bridge may fall down, but only long after Enron has crashed. Infrastructure can help to hedge a portfolio against inflation, said Martin A. Jaugietis, a senior consultant in the asset consulting group at Towers Perrin. ''When prices rise, infrastructure assets tend to be able to increase prices in concert,'' he said. ''The cash flows are similar to the rent you'd get from a building.''
 But Alan J. Marcus, a finance professor at Boston College, questioned whether infrastructure assets were ''enough different that they warrant separate treatment'' in a portfolio. ''I doubt that this would be the case for most investors,'' he said. ''Gas versus electric utilities also are different, but would anyone make a case that they provide important opportunities for diversification?''
 Macquarie's work with toll roads and airports tends to grab attention, but its American mutual funds also own hefty stakes in utilities and related businesses like gas pipelines. At the end of August, for example, about three-fourths of the money in the Macquarie Global Infrastructure fund was invested in utilities or pipelines. 
 Although Macquarie says its closed-end funds belong to a unique asset class, some analysts see similarities to utility funds. ''An easy way to think about Macquarie is as a utility player,'' said Norman Young, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.
 Jon Fitch, portfolio manager for Macquarie's American closed-end funds, points out that utilities share a lot of characteristics with roads, bridges and airports. ''If you look at what infrastructure is, it's really the hard assets that provide essential services to a community,'' he said. ''It includes energy infrastructure like pipelines and power transmission. What we typically avoid are competitive types of businesses'' like unregulated power generation.
 Even the Macquarie Infrastructure Company trust, which collects much of its income from selling fuel for private aircraft, owns a natural-gas company in Hawaii.
 A trait of Macquarie's American offerings -- and an attraction for income-oriented investors -- is their high yield. Consider the Infrastructure trust. As a matter of policy, it pays out most of the cash its businesses generate, resulting in a yield of 6.2 percent. Each of the closed-end funds has a yield of more than 5 percent. 
 HOLDING little cash leaves scant room for mistakes or economic shocks, but it also disciplines Macquarie Infrastructure, said Josh Peters, editor of Morningstar DividendInvestor. ''When they want to make acquisitions, they have to go to the capital markets, and that gives the market a veto,'' he said. ''If the market doesn't like what the management has done,'' the market ''might be closed,'' with investors unwilling to provide more money.
 So far, the market seems impressed. This fall, Macquarie Infrastructure was able to raise $291 million in a secondary stock offering. It will use the money to pay off debt from a recent spate of acquisitions. And it will continue to prowl for future deals. 
 ''People in the United States are used to infrastructure assets being in public hands, but that's changing,'' said Peter R. Stokes, chief executive of Macquarie Infrastructure. ''Municipalities are challenged for tax revenues, and they're evaluating what they're spending money on.''

HEADLINE: Megadeal: Inside a Real Estate Coup

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
WHEN the phone finally rang early on a mid-October evening in the New York headquarters of Tishman Speyer Properties, it startled Rob Speyer, the firm's 37-year-old heir apparent. He and two colleagues had spent the afternoon talking nervously about anything but the call that they desperately hoped would come. 
 On the phone was Darcy A. Stacom, the broker handling the multibillion-dollar sale of two huge, adjacent Manhattan tracts -- Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village -- for the properties' owner, Metropolitan Life Insurance. Ms. Stacom asked Mr. Speyer to hustle eight blocks south from his Fifth Avenue conference room to a skyscraper on 45th Street, telling him to bring along representatives of his partner, BlackRock Inc., and his bankers and lawyers. She also cautioned him that they should arrive in groups of two, not en masse, to avoid any unwanted attention -- there were eight other potential buyers waiting for the same phone call that Mr. Speyer had just received. 
Mr. Speyer's team and MetLife then wrestled through the night over the terms of a possible sale, with an occasional round of five-card stud during the lulls. A bleary-eyed Mr. Speyer finally signed the documents at about 9:30 the next morning, plunking down a $400 million deposit on what would be the biggest real estate deal of all time: the $5.4 billion purchase of 80 acres of prime Manhattan land that included 110 buildings and 11,232 apartments.
 The price tag grabbed headlines around the world, generating commentary from the lobbies of Stuyvesant Town's red brick buildings to the newsrooms of National Public Radio to the set of Bill Maher on HBO. The initial bidding had attracted an international Who's Who in real estate and finance, ranging from the Rothschilds and the Safras to the Prince of Qatar and the investor Simon Glick, not to mention New York's leading real estate families, various publicly traded companies and a host of international banks. By the time it was over, the bidders had collectively amassed a staggering $35 billion for bidding rights in the deal. 
 It was, as Daniel Garodnick, a New York city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village, put it, a ''defining moment in city history.'' International players who had single-mindedly pursued glamorous landmarks like the Chrysler and G.M. buildings in New York and the Sears Tower in Chicago were loudly proclaiming their appetites for humble, ''plain vanilla'' apartment buildings and a willingness to pay up -- way up -- to unlock future profits in the sprawling Manhattan properties.
 At the same time, the sale of what had traditionally served as an affordable, middle-class oasis for firefighters, civil servants and nurses hit a nerve in a city exhausted by skyrocketing real estate prices that had sent the cost of an ''average'' condominium well beyond $1 million. Tenants, housing advocates and much of the rest of the public feared that the new owners would remold the complexes in a way that would put them beyond the financial reach of many New Yorkers -- a process already under way in most of Manhattan and a good portion of Brooklyn.
 But for deal makers counting trophies and lucre, the transaction was a coup. It was the fifth and biggest sale by MetLife of its real estate assets, raising its total proceeds to $9.5 billion since 2003. MetLife alienated some top politicians in New York with its decision to sell the Manhattan complexes, which were built with public subsidies, and its high-handed refusal to meet with local officials before the sale to discuss tenant concerns. But Wall Street was exultant about the sale; analysts upgraded the company's stock, predicting that MetLife would outperform other insurers.
 The deal was also a very public introduction for Rob Speyer, a thin, wiry-haired man with a secret passion for professional wrestling, who joined his father's company a decade ago after stints as a reporter for two local newspapers. Mr. Speyer, who once handled dreary leasing assignments, was responsible for leading his team into the real estate record books. The previous record holder was his father, Jerry I. Speyer, 66, who led the group that bought Rockefeller Center for $1.85 billion in 2000.
 The elder Mr. Speyer is still very much in charge of his company, but executives say his son has come into his own. ''He's very talented,'' said Laurence D. Fink, the chairman of BlackRock, who said that Rob Speyer oversaw the deal for Tishman Speyer. ''His father treats him like a lead partner. I saw no evidence of Jerry interfering.''
 The transaction also broadened the reach of Tishman Speyer, which had already built an international inventory of high-profile commercial properties, ranging from the Chrysler Building in Manhattan to the CityPoint building in London, the Leumiere office tower in Paris, and a host of residential and commercial developments in Brazil. In one fell swoop, Tishman Speyer inflated its already sizable portfolio by landing the biggest -- and one of the most contentious -- real estate prizes ever. 
 ''It's a great, great transaction for them,'' said the developer Richard LeFrak, a rival who dropped out of the bidding after making a $4.3 billion offer. ''It puts them in a whole different space in terms of the variety of their activities.''
 FOR all of the deal's accolades, it also illuminates the financial leaps of faith that real estate buyers are increasingly taking. Once, buyers priced properties based on existing cash flow. Real estate executives say that calculus would have generated a $3.5 billion price for the two Manhattan complexes that Tishman Speyer bought. But buyers are now looking to the future, building models of anticipated cash flow when determining how much to bid. The Stuyvesant Town deal, with its $5.4 billion price tag, reflects the new math, and analysts and rival bidders say the hefty price means that the deal will not show a profit for as many as six years. 
 Tishman Speyer declined to discuss financial terms of the transaction. But in the view of most real estate executives, the apartments in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village will emerge from price caps imposed by rent regulation laws at an increasing rate. When that occurs, the executives say, rents and profits will then rise steadily. If that doesn't happen, however, the deal could turn out to be a very costly minefield.
 Some longtime residents of Stuyvesant Town say they got their first hint that changes were afoot in their complex four years ago, when a plaque disappeared from the development. The plaque had sat for decades on the lushly landscaped oval that forms the center of Stuyvesant Town and commemorated the vision of the development's founder, Frederick H. Ecker, a former MetLife chairman who led the effort 60 years ago to build thousands of apartments for middle-class New Yorkers. 
 The plaque's inscription was a relic of a bygone urban era when Mr. Ecker and MetLife conceived of a project where ''families of moderate means might live in health, comfort and dignity in park-like communities and that a pattern might be set of private enterprise productively devoted to public service.'' When the complex underwent renovations in 2002, the plaque was consigned to the MetLife archives.
 MetLife got its start 143 years ago in rented rooms on Broadway in Lower Manhattan. As the company prospered, it played a key role in the civic life of the city and helped underwrite high-profile projects like Rockefeller Center. Mr. Ecker, who had started at MetLife as a 15-year-old mail boy in 1883 and rose to become chairman, was the driving force behind the company's development of large-scale housing complexes in the 1940s. 
 At the urging of both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert Moses, the New York public works czar, Mr. Ecker set out to address a general housing shortage and to provide homes for returning World War II veterans. MetLife ultimately built more than 24,000 apartments in New York City and an additional 9,420 units in Alexandria, Va. (Parkfairfax), San Francisco (Parkmerced) and Los Angeles (Parklabrea).
 None were bigger than Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, between 14th and 23rd Streets, overlooking the East River. To make way for the development, the city and MetLife leveled the gas tanks, industrial buildings and tenements on 18 blocks that had made up the Gas House District, at one time the roughest neighborhood in New York.
 Under its deal with the city, MetLife got lucrative tax breaks and help in acquiring the land in return for limiting its profit to 6 percent for 25 years and maintaining below-market rents for Stuyvesant Town's 8,749 apartments. The lobbies were nicer and the apartments larger at the slightly more upscale Peter Cooper Village. When the complexes opened in 1947, MetLife was flooded with more than 100,000 applications.
 ''It's like a small town,'' said Soni Fink, who has lived in Peter Cooper Village for 45 years. ''People take care of each other. You don't get that in any old apartment building in New York.''
 But if Mr. Ecker wanted to create solid communities whose landscaped grounds had a suburban sensibility, he was equally clear when he said: ''Negroes and whites do not mix.'' The company visited prospective tenants in their homes and excluded black families from the development. While MetLife built a separate, far smaller, complex in Harlem called Riverton for African-American families, there would be years of protests, litigation and political pressure before the company lifted the racial barriers at Stuyvesant Town. 
 Over the years, MetLife sold many of its residential complexes, but it held on to Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which were only blocks from the company's landmark headquarters on Madison Avenue. 
 In 2000, MetLife transformed itself from a mutual company owned by its policyholders into one owned by shareholders, with a greater emphasis on cost-cutting and enhanced profitability. With a shrunken payroll in New York, it moved most of its operations and top executives from Manhattan to less expensive quarters in Queens. MetLife also began shedding some of its prized assets in favor of a more diversified portfolio.
 It sold a tower it owned at 11 Madison Avenue for $675 million in 2003 and the Sears Tower for $835 million in 2004. The next year it unloaded its historic headquarters at 1 Madison Avenue for $918 million and the former Pan Am Building, at 200 Park Avenue, for $1.72 billion. The buyer of 200 Park Avenue was Tishman Speyer. 
 As it sold its trophy real estate, MetLife pumped up its insurance operations, buying Travelers Life and Annuity in 2005 in an $11.5 billion deal that made it the largest insurer in North America. That acquisition also left MetLife hamstrung with debt, said Saul Martinez, an analyst at Bear Stearns. Rating agencies recommended that the company cut its debt, which Mr. Martinez said compelled MetLife to take advantage of rising real estate values by putting up for sale Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village -- which represented about 40 percent of its real estate equity. 
 MetLife went about its business very quietly. Last July, it said it was planning to sell the two complexes, offering few details beyond a terse announcement. The company said it was declining interviews because of potential tenant lawsuits and because of concerns that the New York City comptroller raised about whether the company had complied with state housing laws. 
 Critics and some local officials viewed MetLife's silence as calculated stonewalling that amounted to a rejection of the company's legacy. ''At one time, they were the model of a New York corporate citizen,'' said Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker whose request to meet with MetLife to discuss the sale was rejected. ''The commitment they once had to New York City is gone.''
 Though the announcement that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were for sale initially escaped much public attention, it sent the real estate industry into a frenzy. And for good reason: a sizable chunk of Manhattan was now up for grabs.
 ONCE MetLife put the complexes into play, it immediately interviewed brokers, settling on Ms. Stacom and William Shanahan, at CB Richard Ellis. The pair hired a helicopter to get aerial views of the complexes and bought the rights to use ''New York State of Mind,'' the Billy Joel song, in a promotional video.
 Little of that was necessary, however. More than 100 investors and companies lined up to look at the deal shortly after Labor Day, including some of the biggest names in New York real estate: the Durst, Milstein, LeFrak and Rudin families, as well as Vornado Realty Trust, Archstone-Smith Trust and the Related Companies. It was a unique opportunity, bidders said, to corner a considerable swath of Manhattan where rents were a third to a half of market rates.
 It was also clear that bidding would go well over $4 billion and that no single buyer had deep-enough pockets to handle the deal on its own.
 ''There's nothing like the 11,200 units sitting over there,'' said William P. Dickey, president of the Dermot Company, which had teamed up with Apollo Real Estate to bid for the property. ''It doesn't take a genius to figure out: that's the plum; go after it.''
 Mr. Dickey said the two companies had offered MetLife more than $4 billion for the properties before the insurer even announced that they were for sale. Although many real estate investors had eschewed plain brick buildings in the past, they have become increasingly attractive to buyers because of the lack of developable land in Manhattan, the high cost of new construction, the continuing housing demand in the city and the seemingly endless potential for rising rents.
 Lots of available cash also helps. Insurance companies and pension funds now have billions to put into real estate, and foreign capital has flooded the New York market because of a weak dollar and low real estate costs relative to those of Hong Kong and London.
 For Tishman Speyer, the push for Stuyvesant Town began, as most real estate deals do, with a conversation. Mr. Fink, chairman of the BlackRock investment firm, said he was in a meeting with Jerry and Rob Speyer last September when talk turned to the huge properties that MetLife had put up for sale.
 ''Why don't we do it together,'' Mr. Fink asked the Speyers. 
 Rob Speyer, who would eventually visit the complexes a half-dozen times on his own, was intrigued. ''You can't help feeling that Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper Village are a special piece of real estate, just like Rockefeller Center,'' he said later in an interview. 
 Fred Lieblich, who oversees BlackRock's real estate investments, said the Speyers were a logical choice as partners. ''They're one of the largest landlords in New York City, with significant architectural, engineering, construction and design capability,'' said Mr. Lieblich, who as a young MetLife executive in 1991 lived in Peter Cooper Village. 
 Logical, indeed. Tishman Speyer is one of Manhattan's largest real estate operators; it controls 120 office buildings around the world, comprising 74 million square feet of space. Jerry Speyer, who started the company with his father-in-law in the 1970s, has spent decades burnishing his image as a man who can move easily among the worlds of real estate, finance, entertainment, art and politics. 
 Mr. Speyer is the only real estate tycoon who has served as chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's powerful lobbying arm, and as co-head of the organization founded as a counterweight to the influence of developers, the Partnership for New York City (an influential nonprofit group made up of leading chief executives who promote economic development). He is now vice chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, an owner of the New York Yankees, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (He becomes chairman, effective tomorrow.) Over the years he has gained the confidence of pension fund and insurance chiefs and shown a special talent for lining up blue-chip investors, like the Crown family of Chicago and the Agnelli family in Italy. 
 Those are, of course, very large shoes to fill. People close to the Speyers say that the two men share huge ambitions for their company and a desire to cultivate their image as a trusted landlord for some of the world's most famous structures. 
 Rob Speyer, who often seemed easygoing and carefree when he was younger, has grown into a ''straight shooter'' who works long hours, according to descriptions by some who know him. He struggled with ''anger management issues'' early in his career but has developed into a shrewd, confident businessman, they say.
 In addition to his role at Tishman Speyer, Rob Speyer serves on the executive committee of the Real Estate Board and has a seat on the board of Columbia College. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg picked him to be chairman of the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, which promotes public-private partnerships to address issues like poverty. But for now, he says, he is focused on business.
 In talking about the division of labor between himself and his father (whom he calls ''Jerry'') Rob Speyer says: ''We have a very close working relationship. Sometimes we divide and conquer, sometimes we work together.''
 Jerry Speyer speaks glowingly of his son. ''Obviously Rob is on the deal side and has taken a leading role in the company as the heir apparent -- Rob has always been a very serious person,'' he said. ''At the same time, he's kind, diligent and demanding. I expect he'll be far more successful than I was. He has great vision, wonderful people skills and, above all, loves what he does.''
 BY mid-September, Rob Speyer and Mr. Lieblich were consumed by the Stuyvesant Town deal, each leading a team of about 20 people, poring over records provided by the insurer's brokers and assessing the value of the property. MetLife put the bidders on an extremely tight timeline, with first bids due on Oct. 5, only a month after information about the sale first became available.
 The pending sale created a panic among many tenants of the two complexes, where nearly three-quarters of the apartments have regulated rents at a third to half of market rates. An apartment can be decontrolled after it becomes vacant, or the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants' income rises above $175,000 over two years. As a result, MetLife had brought about 27 percent of the units in the two complexes to market rates. Tenant activists feared that a new buyer paying nearly $500,000 per apartment would be financially pressed to accelerate the process and transform the complexes by jacking up rents. 
 A political uproar surrounding the sale worried many bidders, with some, like the Dursts, dropping out. Other bidders met with tenants in an attempt to quell the hostility or to consider a possible alliance. The only leading bidder that did not meet with tenants was Tishman Speyer. ''We kept focused on the real estate and let the situation evolve,'' Rob Speyer said.
 MetLife was also unfazed. Executives told reporters that the company had kept its promise to the city for more than 25 years and had no continuing obligation to keep rents low, or to meet with local officials. Privately they told reporters that many tenants were wealthy people, not the struggling petit bourgeois. Mayor Bloomberg opted to stay out of the dispute.
 On Oct. 5, some 16 prospective buyers, in a variety of combinations, made offers for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, including a tenant coalition that offered $4.5 billion. (That bid entailed preserving 20 percent of the units as rent-regulated rentals and selling 20 percent to existing tenants at below-market prices.) Afterward, the Tishman Speyer-BlackRock group and the Apollo-Dermot-led group emerged as top contenders for a second round of bids due on Oct. 16.
 ''About a week beforehand, we circled in on $5.4 billion,'' Rob Speyer said. ''We decided to put our best foot forward in the second round, hopefully grabbing the deal and short-circuiting other rounds. We took a chance.''
 But when it came time to open nine envelopes containing bids and proposed contracts for the complexes, Ms. Stacom said it looked as if the bidding was spiraling downward. 
 ''The first one was really low, $4.7 billion, from someone I expected to be really high,'' Ms. Stacom said. ''I had a heart attack. My career flashed in front of my eyes.''
 The bidding did go up, though, with Mr. Glick offering $5.1 billion and the Apollo group $5.33 billion. According to people involved in the bidding process, Tishman Speyer won the battle with a high bid of $5.4 billion. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock each put up about $125 million in equity, with the Crown family of Chicago chipping in money as part of the Tishman Speyer group. The rest of the money came from two banks, Merrill Lynch and Wachovia.
 Before the Speyers could be notified, however, the selection had to go to the MetLife board, which met on the 57th floor at 200 Park Avenue and approved the sale -- setting off the night of bargaining over the fine points.
 Both Rob Speyer and BlackRock declined to discuss the financing of their deal, or any specifics about their plans, other than to repeat a mantra designed to calm more than 20,000 residents of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village: ''There'll be no radical changes,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''It'd be premature to get into the specifics. We are looking for ways to improve the quality of life.'' 
 Even with such reassurances, many tenants say they worry that Tishman Speyer plans to convert Peter Cooper Village into condominiums or simply build new luxury towers on the site.
 The Tishman Speyer victory came as a shock to the Apollo group, which thought it had made the highest offer. Some executives suspected that Tishman Speyer had unfairly gotten a ''last look'' at the offers and an opportunity to top the highest bid because of Jerry Speyer's close ties to MetLife.
 Similar concerns arose less than a year earlier, during MetLife's sale of 200 Park. Scott H. Rechler, chairman of Reckson Associates, had complained to MetLife and to many in the real estate industry that the insurer's brokers had initially notified him that Rechler had won that bidding contest. But MetLife subsequently told him that it was going with Mr. Speyer, even though his offer was slightly lower.
 The Apollo group was so incensed about losing the bidding for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village that it took the unusual step of holding a traditional closing dinner anyway for 60 people at Cafe Gray, an upscale restaurant in the Time Warner Center. Morgan Stanley, the Apollo group's banker, distributed blank Lucite trophies at the dinner to commemorate a deal that never happened. 
 MetLife and Tishman Speyer declined to comment directly on the integrity of the bidding process, but Ms. Stacom and other executives who have been briefed on the deal by MetLife and Tishman Speyer say that it ''was a very clean process and everyone was treated fairly.'' They say that any carping about the bidding subsided before Tishman Speyer closed the deal on Nov. 17.
 TISHMAN Speyer wasted little time asserting its presence in Lower Manhattan. Three weeks after the deal closed, Rob Speyer raised a 42-foot Christmas tree on the oval at Stuyvesant Town, much like the one his father's company puts up every year at Rockefeller Center. 
 Some bidders maintain that the price that Tishman Speyer paid was overly lush and may come back to haunt it in future years. Others, however, say they anticipate feeling something more akin to deal-envy.
 ''We'll look back at this in 10 or 15 years as the one that got away,'' said Jeffrey A. Barclay, a managing director of ING Clarion, which bid with Apollo.

HEADLINE: For Better Care, Work Across Lines

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Directorship magazine.

 BODY:
THE American medical system is failing to deliver affordable health care because it is too fragmented and poorly regulated, and it therefore needs a major cross-industry consolidation, says Clayton Christensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School and author of such books as ''The Innovator's Dilemma'' (1997) and ''The Innovator's Solution'' (2003). Here are excerpts from a conversation: 


Q. Do you think that the United States medical system is woefully inefficient?

A. It is. In many industries, the ability to provide the product or service far more cost-efficiently and far more conveniently has moved at a pace that really outstrips the progress the medical industry has made.

Q. How much does the system cost in whole?

A. Between 13 and 17 percent of the economy, depending on how you measure it.

Q. The nation's medical system is regularly offering increasingly advanced procedures and treatments. Isn't that a good thing?

A. If you look at the progress that today's hospitals and the medical profession have made, they continue to push the leading edge of what's very difficult to do. But that's a very different dimension of performance improvement than the one that makes more people better off, and that is making it affordable and accessible. In other industries, whenever affordability and accessibility have come, it has not come from making mainframe computers better but rather from commoditizing mainframes so that average people with average money can have access to high-quality computing, meaning personal computers. It came from disruptive technology rather than improvements on the existing system. Michael Dell could assemble one of these things in his dorm room.

Q. What's the relevance to health care?

A. In health care, rather than replicating the expensive expertise of Mount Sinai Medical Center or Mass General Hospital or replicating the expensive expertise of doctors, we have to commoditize their expertise. That comes through the precise ability to diagnose the diseases that people have. Our ability to diagnose the diseases is moving ahead at a breathtaking pace, but regulation and reimbursement are trapping the delivery of rules-based medicine in high-cost business models.

Q. An example of what you mean?

A. A hundred years ago, there was a big disease that nobody understood and was often fatal, called consumption. Little by little, medical science began to unpack that symptomatic description, which was that your lungs filled up with gunk and you died. The reason we couldn't cure it was that what we thought was a single disease was a whole bunch of different diseases. You had tuberculosis there, at least three types, and you had pneumonia. We thought it was all one disease. So the care had to be left with doctors because they were the ones with the training and the judgment, but once you could precisely diagnose the cause of the disease, you could then develop a cure. It was so rules-based that you didn't need a doctor any longer. Today a technician can diagnose those diseases and a nurse can treat them.

Q. Are you saying doctors rather than the pharmaceutical industry are the root cause of what's gone wrong?

A. The pharmaceutical industry has been focused on therapy, not diagnosis. The medical profession has simply accepted that many of these diseases are well-diagnosed, when in fact they aren't. As a consequence, we haven't moved the health care profession into a world where nurses can provide diagnosis and care. Regulation is keeping the treatment in expensive hospitals when in fact much lower cost-delivery models are available.

Q. Wouldn't your solution require a dramatically different regulatory environment?

A. It differs state by state. In Massachusetts, nurses cannot write prescriptions. But in Minnesota, nurse practitioners can. So there has emerged in Minnesota a clinic called the MinuteClinic. These clinics operate in Target stores and CVS drugstores. They are staffed only by nurse practitioners. There's a big sign on the door that says, ''We treat these 16 rules-based disorders.'' They include strep throat, pink eye, urinary tract infection, earaches and sinus infections.
 These are things for which very unambiguous, ''go, no-go'' tests exist. You're in and out in 15 minutes or it's free, and it's a $39 flat fee. These things are just booming because high-quality health care at that level is defined by convenience and accessibility. That's a commoditization of the expertise. To have those same disorders treated in Massachusetts, you've got to go to a regular doctor, go through a long wait in their office, you go in and see the doctor for two minutes. He says, ''You have an earache,'' which you knew already, and then they charge you $150.

Q. Aren't the pharmaceutical companies also profiting?

A. They are. But in general, pharmaceutical breakthroughs that involve a precise diagnosis of a disease and an effective therapy save the system a tremendous amount of money even though the drugs may appear to be high-cost.

Q. There are many other players in the system, including hospitals and insurance companies. What's your prescription for them?

A. The whole system is broken. It will take a major overhaul to unlock it. Forgive me by talking by analogy, but when color TV was first invented by RCA, nobody would broadcast in color because nobody had color TVs and nobody would buy color TVs because nobody was broadcasting in color. They just couldn't make the system come together until David Sarnoff, who ran RCA, bought NBC. By integrating across the whole system, he made it all happen.
 The current health care system is divided into buckets. You have the insurers, the employers who put up the money, the providers such as doctors and nurses, and the hospitals. Because they exist as independent companies, they can each improve themselves, but they can't re-architect the system in the way that it needs to be changed. 
 There are two health care systems in the West, Intermountain Health Care in Utah and Kaiser Permanente in California, that are in fact integrated across each of those pieces of the system. They are far ahead of the rest of the world in bringing rules-based diagnosis and therapy in cost-effective business models to their patients.

Q. Who would make such a sweeping transformation happen?

A. What we are hoping to do with our research is to bring to this disparate community an understanding of the root cause of the problem. Giving them a common language and a common way to frame the problem takes you a huge distance toward a solution. We're targeting the chief executive officers of the major insurance companies and hospital companies and medical schools and drug companies to help them understand where we are today and where they need to go. Once they frame the problem correctly, smart people can come up with pretty good solutions.
 The government will be the hardest because a lot of the regulations that require that care be given by people with particular expertise and in expensive hospitals were put in place during a prior era when the science was not really as well-defined. The regulations just haven't kept up with the science.

HEADLINE: Elegant Surprises on Both Sides of the Rio Grande

BYLINE: By HENRY SHUKMAN

 BODY:
WHAT is it about borders? Why are they inherently exhilarating? 
 El Paso likes to say that it and Ciudad Juarez form the largest cross-border city on earth, with a combined population of about two million, and there's a constant buzz in the air. This is the mother of frontiers, the Berlin Wall of the Americas: On one side of the Rio Grande lie the towers and comfortable houses of the wealthiest imperial power, and on the other, across a razor-wired canal of brown water, 50 yards and a trillion dollars away, the cheap homes of the developing world.
When the Rio Grande became the border in 1848 after the Mexican-American War and El Paso del Norte found itself in America, the usual evolution happened: the poorer side became the shadow city, where you could find delights denied at home. Liquor and prostitution mostly, but also drugs and donkey shows (don't ask). 
 It remains much the same, with Cuban cigars and drink for college kids too young to imbibe in America. Every other store along the Avenida Juarez strip is a cut-price dentista or a farmacia selling prescription drugs (without prescriptions). 
 And Juarez still has bars whose heyday was the '30s, offering the oak-bound authority and peace that only decades of decorous drinking confer -- places like the Kentucky Club. Once graced by Ernest Hemingway and William Carlos Williams, it is now tragically blighted by wide-screen TVs, but still serves the best and tartest margaritas on the planet, little cupric charges of lucidity. 
 But the area has been a focus of interesting cross-border cuisine, too, and on either side of the river there are restaurants offering the old-school bon-vivant elegance of Mexico as well as some excellent culinary innovation. A couple of months ago, I sampled a few of them.

Billy Crews Dining Room
 In ''El Paso City,'' Marty Robbins sang about ''a city with a legend,'' but when I lived in nearby Las Cruces, N.M., a few years ago, the real legend of El Paso was the wine list at Billy Crews. Before crossing the river into Mexico, my friend David and I fortified ourselves with a visit to this institution in the El Paso suburbs, just across the state line in New Mexico. 
 Mr. Crews is a modest man, and part of the strange charm of his restaurant is its understatedness. There's a liquor store at the back, for example, along with a bar that can get rowdy at weekends -- hardly what you'd expect in an establishment selling Pomerols and Pauillacs whose vintages go back four or five decades.
 There's nothing like a restaurant that does only one thing but does it perfectly. A few daunting hunks of well-aged steaks -- rib-eye, New York strip, porterhouse -- wait on a butcher-block bar where you can choose your cut. If you go with the standard dinner package, you'll get a small plate of shrimp with a squeeze of lemon, then a salad delivered in the outer leaves of half an iceberg lettuce. 
 Yes, in a way it's that kind of place: iceberg and ranch dressing. But that's not the whole story. The steaks are very, very good, and the wine list, which runs to 112 densely typed pages, has been winning national awards for decades. 
 Even more remarkably, you don't have to spend a lot. An eight-ounce filet mignon sets you back $12. Wines that would go for $400 in New York City restaurants can be picked up for something much closer to liquor store prices. Indeed, nothing irks Mr. Crews like the standard restaurant wine markup. 
 ''There's nothing worse,'' he told us as we discussed the wine list with him. ''Why? Everyone knows what the prices are.''
 After our shrimp and salad, we tried some euphemistically named calf fries -- deep-fried bullocks' testes -- which I felt obliged to order just because they were on the menu. One is enough. But our two steaks, a filet mignon and a rib-eye, were perfectly a point (which our waiter called ''rare plus'') in a peppery jus -- the ideal foil for our 1995 Lynch-Bages ($187). 
 To come to an oasis of fine, underpriced wines in a desert and not choose something good would be morally, fiscally, spiritually wrong. And anyway, this is hardly a wine you can get anywhere. Our young waiter, who had been itching to pour the bottle finally had his moment -- and we ours with this dark and complex wine. 
 There's something almost strange about finding such an oasis of viticultural heritage at the edge of a cowboy city. Here Crews is, a stone's throw from the shanties of Juarez, with a cellar worthy of the Ritz.

Mision Guadalupe
 As soon as you walk across the Santa Fe Bridge and find yourself in Mexico, there's the immediate pleasure, dismay and comfort all at once of being back in a culture that values the street and the pedestrian, rather than the freeway and the automobile. Everywhere, you're hit by small-scale marketing: stalls selling nopal and guava juice, shoeshines, hats and tobacco, and beggars hawking their penury. Cab drivers loiter, calling out: ''Whatever you want I got it. Chicas? Coca?''
 But Juarez also offers more sedate pleasures, especially since one of the best new restaurants for hundreds of miles, the Mision Guadalupe, opened in 2004. Run by two young prodigies from the Culinary Academy in Mexico City, with impressive track records in American restaurants, it is spearheading the expansion of sophisticated, authentic Mexican food.
 Mexicans possess a cuisine every bit as elaborate as the best of Europe's, but the news has been late in reaching the rest of the world. Only now are the false stereotypes of the Mexican plate -- burritos and tacos smothered in chili and cheese (more Tex-Mex and Southwestern) -- beginning to yield.
 Mision Guadalupe is chic, modern and comfortable. Three alabaster plinths define the space, along with a glowing backlighted bar of the same stone. A cellar beneath the bar holds a fiercely patriotic and reasonably priced array of Mexican wines. 
 ''Mexico always had better wines than Spain,'' Sergio Remolina, who was the general manager but has since left, told me. ''At independence, the Spaniards burned as many vineyards as they could, to prevent competition on Spanish soil, but over the last 50 years, the wines of Baja California especially have been coming back fast.''
 Indeed, the 2002 Santo Tomas barbera we tried was very good and a great value at $30.
 We started with a few excellent appetizers: superb smoked marlin in green spinach tortillas, achiote-marinated shrimp panuchos from the Yucatan (tiny deep-fried tacos with mashed black beans) and quesadillas with wonderful huitlacoche (corn fungus). Then came cabrito -- succulent kid cooked with wine, lime, jalapeno and avocado, and served on banana leaves -- and rare seared salmon with chili, salt and corn relish, and shrimp in adobo (a sauce of dried chili, vinegar, garlic and spices). 
 But the highlight was the beef tenderloin with chichilo negro (''ashes sauce''), a thick black sauce made with avocado leaves and oja santa, the leaf of the sarsaparilla plant integral to root beer. This is one of the seven moles of Oaxaca, which are in turn just some of Mexico's many different moles.
 ''Mole is the chief expression of the Baroque epoch in Mexico,'' said Alejandro Dimakis, the chef. ''The churches of that period are complex and exaggerated -- mole, too. Many things go into it.'' 
 Some moles have over 25 ingredients and require that each element be prepared separately before combining (''mole'' means something like ''blending''). Mr. Dimakis declared that Mexican cuisine had a different language and ingredients from European cooking but is every bit as sophisticated, and his dishes made it hard to disagree.

Martino
 In this timepiece of a place, where you could imagine Cary Grant having a good time, being a waiter is not just a job but a career. This place has that deep-sprung air of repose, of the well-oiled fluency of a restaurant that knows exactly how to do what it does -- a sense largely bestowed by the ancient and skillful waiters in their white coats and crimson bowties.
 The menu is from another time, too: cordon bleu cuisine: oysters Rockefeller, escargots, chateaubriand au poivre, tenderloin medallions flambee, filet tornedos, steak tartare, frog's legs, halibut sauteed in butter and garlic. This once-traditional haute cuisine has become so rare it'll surely sooner or later be the new nouvelle.
 At the next table an elderly couple had a Beefeater martini each, shaken tableside by one of the septuagenarian waiters with great fluency and economy of movement. It seemed a good way to start, but it was lunchtime and we resisted. 
 Instead, we began with guacamole in an avocado skin, then cream of elote, or corn, soup -- delivered whether you order it or not, along with a dish of green chili salsa strong enough to bring out a small bloom of sweat on the forehead. Then a platter of hot, briny, sweet oysters Rockefeller.
 For main dishes, we had slim bass fillets grilled to a faint brown, dusted with chili and garlic, along with one of Martino's flaming swords, this one of shrimp doused in blue-flickering brandy. 
 It's the kind of rich, slow-paced meal that sends one out into the afternoon with a glow.

Cafe Central
 Then it was over the bridge and back into America, for an adventurous cross-border revival. Cafe Central occupies the ground floor of a grand old Art Deco building in the Deco heart of downtown El Paso. The decor is Art Deco, too -- zebra-striped chairs, black table linens and a long low bar shimmering at the far end.
 Why are restaurant linens always white? I like black. It feels glamorous, like a 1940s nightclub. Which is appropriate, since the Cafe Central began its life in 1918 on the other side of the border, when Juarez was a small precursor of Las Vegas. Then after decades near Martino, it moved north to El Paso in 1980.
 Two items survive from the original menu, and we tried both. The first was a smooth rich cream of green chili soup: memorable. Other starters we sampled were escargots, dripping in melted butter, shaved parmesan, garlic and herbs; cumin-rubbed tuna sashimi, brought to life by the spice; and dark-gold deep-fried Dungeness crab cakes, with an herb remoulade. 
 The other original dish is puntas de filete. As a lifelong devotee of Worcestershire sauce, I was delighted to find it in a 1918 Juarez recipe. Floppy medallions of steak fillets and rubbery strips of fresh green chili come in the Worcesterhire with capers and a roasted jalapeno. There's a pleasing unfussiness about the dish; it would go well with Studebaker running boards and wide gangster lapels on 1930s suits. Another good main dish is shrimp tacos -- deep-fried corn tortillas, not too crispy under the fork, but bursting open between the teeth -- with sweet and spicy shrimp and guacamole, and a drum of chipotle rice on the side. 
 Innovative Mexico and old Europe: there are tastes of both on either side of the border. In a way, for the diner, the two cities are one, even though this is not the case for the teeming populace.

HEADLINE: Year of the Stans

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
''Sometimes I get confused with all these stans,'' said Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, then the military dictator of Pakistan, ''but as long as I don't say Hindustan'' -- a Persian name for India that once included what is now Pakistan -- ''I'll be O.K.''
That 1982 citation of the suffix -stans in the form of a noun -- rooted in the Persian for ''home of'' -- was dug up by the phrasedick Paul McFedries of wordspy.com. Zia picked up the suffix used by critics of South Africa's proposed black African homelands in 1949; they had nicknamed the impoverished areas bantustans after the Bantu language spoken by the tribes. 
 At the turn of the new millennium, attention was called to newly independent states on the fringe of the former Soviet Union -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan -- which the BBC identified as ''collectively known as the Central Asian 'stans.' '' They were derogated by Stephen Kotkin in The New Republic in 2002 as ''a dreadful checkerboard of parasitic states and statelets, government-led extortion rackets and gangs in power, mass refugee camps and shadow economies. Welcome to Trashcanistan.''
 That pejorative use of the suffix -stan to describe a place largely populated by Muslims -- in 1990, Islamistan -- was applied by Time magazine to the city of London in 2001: ''So many volunteers to the bin Laden cause use the British capital as a base between visits to Afghan camps that French antiterrorist officials now call the city 'Londonistan.' '' In 2006, The Weekly Standard wondered who, if our efforts in Iraq did not succeed, ''would take the trouble to ensure that some portions of Iraqi territory do not become little al Qaeda-stans?'' U.S. News & World Report discovered Hamastan at about the same time The New Yorker coined Hezbollistan.
 Because of these plays on names, many moviegoers in 2006 thought that the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen -- creator of the obnoxious character Borat, in the film titled ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'' -- had concocted the name of a fictional foreign land ending in -stan. It remained for the offended spokesman for the Embassy of Kazakhstan in Washington to set the record straight about Cohen's suddenly famous character of Borat: ''What he represents is a country of Boratastan -- a country of one!''

Urge to Purge Surge
 Increase is on the wane; rise, mount and soar are falling; escalation and growth are too gradual; peak is in a valley and spike has been spiked.
 We are now inundated by the billowing wave of surge. Put the words Iraq and surge together in a splashy Google search and you can wade into nine million usages of that swell noun and verb. (Inundate, billow, wave, wade, splash and the standard sense of swell are all watery words that evoke the rolling power of the ocean.) Surge may spring from spring, source of fountains, streams and seas, and in a mysterious undulation of the English language, seems to share a root with the Latin surgere, ''to rise,'' as the source of the French surgeon. 
 To lexicographers, surge means ''an onrush, a rapid increase''; a specialized sense to sailors is ''the sudden strain of a rope wound round a windlass or capstan.'' To consumers of news on all its platforms, however -- and the reason for the elevation of the term to a raging buzzword -- surge is the word that the military uses to describe a rapid (and like a wave, temporary) buildup of between 15,000 and 40,000 U.S. troops to establish order in Baghdad and its environs.
 The word encapsulates a controversy: ''U.S. Officials Split Over Troop Surge in Iraq,'' headlined The Timaru Herald in New Zealand; ''Purge the Surge,'' demanded The Belleville News in Illinois; ''Iraqi Vice President Hashemi Backs U.S. Troop 'Surge,' '' Web-cast Bloomberg News, putting the buzzword in quotation marks. 
 At a recent news conference, asked if he would overrule military commanders if they disagreed about a surge, President Bush declined to respond to a ''hypothetical question'' (F.D.R. used to call those ''iffy questions'') but promised to gather recommendations and ''report back to you as to whether or not I support a surge or not.'' (His use of or not after whether is correct, although once is enough.)
 Tangent: That repeated or not was a slip of the tongue; Bush has been careful about words lately, adopting success and winning as less provocative than victory, of which Gen. Douglas MacArthur said there was no substitute for, and which Barry Goldwater adopted as his flight plan in a biographical book title. In wartime rhetoric, the word victory is losing, succeeded by success. More recently, when Gen. Colin Powell declared the U.S. Army to be ''nearly broken,'' the president countered with a carefully considered and less drastic ''I've heard the word 'stressed.' '' End tangent. 
 When a term like surge stimulates controversy on one subject, it rolls through the language on others: ''Surge in Violent Crime Likely to Be Part of Trend'' was a Washington Post headline; The Ithaca Times noted, ''Surge in Spam E-mails Reported'' (yeah, right), and a Helsinki newspaper headlined, ''Surge in Productivity Brings Exceptional Growth to Finnish Economy.'' Sports editors are required to hail last-minute comebacks by basketball teams as surges. What buzzword buzzards could use from headline writers is what electronics salesmen call ''surge protection.''

Todd Pruzan is senior editor at Details and the author of ''The Clumsiest People in Europe.''

 BODY:

ALLIGATOR. By Lisa Moore. (Black Cat, paper, $13.) It's hard to think of a more uncomfortable pleasure -- or maybe a more pleasing discomfort -- than good, strong black comedy. Moore is a Newfoundland writer who brings the pain; her first novel, ''Alligator,'' intertwines several lives in the maritime harbor city of St. John's, and the book's brutal humor may, at its best, put you in mind of Flannery O'Connor. Bad impulses seize each of Moore's beguiling characters: an obsessed filmmaker who ignores ominous cardiopulmonary warnings; her niece, who experiments with petty thievery and politically motivated vandalism; a young hot-dog vendor who feels threatened by the Russian hoodlum living upstairs. ''Alligator'' swerves chaotically among their viewpoints, but Moore's spare, economical writing is full of offhand beauty. Her images are so surefooted they give the impression of having been rendered not merely in the best words available but in the only words imaginable. The nonchalant horror of ''Alligator'' is gripping, too, as when Moore documents a spreading arson fire: ''It traced the invisible ropes of gasoline, it ran down the hallway and into the living room and kitchen and the flames looked like something that had always been there, but had been lying in wait.'' 


NOT ENOUGH INDIANS. By Harry Shearer. (Justin, Charles & Company, $19.95.) Shearer's first novel is about a destitute town in upstate New York called Gammage. The national chains have fled the place, leaving retail backwash like T.G.I. Edy's and Oarlucks Coffee in their sorry wake, and the town's desperate ''board of selectpersons'' imposes a $50-a-month garbage tax to cough up some loose change. Things are looking grim. But a chance cocktail-lounge encounter between the town rainmaker, Dick Dirigian, and the fist of a Vegas casino lord, Tony ''Loose Slots'' Silotta, blooms into an ingenious scheme whereby Gammage gets itself recognized as the Filaquonsett reservation, and the town's library is replaced with the world's largest Indian casino. There's satiric promise here, particularly given Shearer's credentials as a comic writer and actor (he's best known for performing several voices on ''The Simpsons'' and for playing the deadpan Derek Smalls in ''This Is Spinal Tap''). Yet Shearer's onscreen poker face belies his insecurity as a storyteller; on the page, he flails for endless rimshots. Readers might overlook the occasional bewildering joke about Ed Begley Jr.'s house if Shearer didn't also lard sentence after sentence with borscht belt elbow-jabbers: ''Dick Dirigian was enough of a salesman to know that this filet mignon of an idea was in dire need of the A1 sauce of charm right about now.'' The steak-to-sauce ratio is a problem for ''Not Enough Indians.'' Shearer understands how to apply his wit sparingly; from him, we've come to expect so much less.

THIRD CLASS SUPERHERO. By Charles Yu. (Harvest/Harcourt, paper, $12.) The opening page of each story in ''Third Class Superhero'' bears a faint portrait of a chipper cold-war-era man who grins broadly beneath his perfect Brylcreemed haircut. In case its function isn't obvious, Brylcreem Man has long served as the universal pop-culture symbol for capital-i Irony, and it's as tired a cliche as the laugh-track sensibility it once subverted. The unfortunate small-i irony of this collection of experimental metafiction is that Yu, a Los Angeles writer, seems to have big ideas about conspicuous consumption and emotional longing, but he rarely bothers to sculpture grounded stories from such raw, vague abstractions. The droll title story is an enjoyable exception, hinting at Yu's potential. His third-class superhero applies for higher status -- he is saddled with the fairly pointless ability to shoot water in two-gallon streams -- but gets rejected, via mail, for the ninth consecutive year. More often Yu maintains a cool, disrespectful distance from the worlds he creates, writing in such tediously clever formats as mathematical problems and disjointed field notes. And Yu populates his fiction not with evocative characters but with generic types (Pretty Girl in Import Beer Commercial, Man of Quiet Desperation), as though he fears concrete details might overwhelm the cosmic jokes.

THE BLUE TAXI. By N. S. Koenings. (Little, Brown, $23.99.) A first-time visitor to any East African city needs an experienced guide. And a visitor to 1970s Vunjamguu, Koenings's imaginary town, needs something more: an omniscient narrator, attuned to both the streets and the small seismic dramas unfolding in upstairs rooms. When a bus in Kikanga, the city's Indian enclave, severs the leg of a boy named Tahir Jeevanjee, the accident disrupts a whole range of lives. Tahir's luckless father, Majid, is a reclusive widower who receives a visit from a witness to the accident, his Belgian-born neighbor, Sarie. Their meeting disrupts Sarie's soporific marriage to an aimless British buffoon, Gilbert. While her young daughter ministers to the recovering boy, Sarie and Majid fall in love. And Gilbert, oblivious, also discovers a belated purpose, after his indulgent great-uncle threatens to withdraw his financial support. ''The Blue Taxi'' spins with the languor of a dusty ceiling fan: nobody in Vunjamguu is in a hurry to conduct their daily lives, much less to resolve their mounting tensions. Koenings examines the minutiae of her endearingly flawed characters in slow motion and at high, exacting resolution.

NEWSWORLD. By Todd James Pierce. (University of Pittsburgh, $24.95.) The table of contents in Pierce's collection portends glib, gimmicky spoofs (''Columbine: The Musical,'' ''Wrestling Al Gore''). But the unsettling fiction beyond it generally avoids easy slapstick. ''Newsworld'' examines, in 10 adroit stories, our codependency with the news industry. In ''Arise and Walk, Christopher Reeve,'' an elderly neighbor of the paralyzed actor monitors Reeve's futile therapy, hoping for progress that could indicate that his anguished wife's dementia might be medically slowed. The narrator of the title story, which is set backstage at an Atlanta amusement park featuring attractions about Watergate, Tiananmen Square and O. J. Simpson, gets so immersed in designing an exhibit called ''L.A. Riots: Flashpoint of Violence'' that he loses the will to stop his boyfriend, a fellow Newsworld employee, from drifting away. We're clearly in George Saunders territory here, and Pierce's stories suffer in comparison. What separates ''Newsworld'' from Saunders's wicked absurdism, though, is its abundance of sympathy. While Pierce's comedic realism unfolds in the background, his heroes ache in their offices and bedrooms -- so desperate to communicate through press releases and letters to the editor that they've forgotten how to whisper into a lover's ear.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL! CRY FOR HELP: 36 Scam E-Mails From Africa. Illustrated by Henning Wagenbreth. (Gingko, paper, $14.95).

TALES OF THE OUT & THE GONE
 By Amiri Baraka.
 221 pp. Akashic Books. 
 Paper, $14.95.
You're a very intelligent brother,'' a guy named Conrad Loomis says to the unnamed narrator of Amiri Baraka's short story ''Conrad Loomis & the Clothes Ray.'' ''But see, I'm outtelligent.''
 The narrator, who seems to be a dyspeptic African-American intellectual not unlike Baraka himself, figures this out after some puzzling. ''Intelligent deals with the in stuff,'' he summarizes. ''Outtelligent deals with the out stuff.'' As this new collection of short fiction (most of it previously unpublished) makes clear, the writer formerly known as LeRoi Jones possesses an outtelligence of a high order.
 Baraka is such a provocateur, so skilled at prodding his perceived enemies (who are legion) in their tender underbellies, that it becomes easy to overlook that he is first and foremost a writer. And a specific kind of writer at that: an old-guard, avant-garde dinosaur, devoted to left-wing politics and formal experimentation. There's no understanding him without understanding that. 
 ''Somebody Blew Up America,'' the post-9/11 poem that briefly made Baraka notorious (and cost him his position as New Jersey's poet laureate), is a howl of outrage set to bebop tempo, more concerned with its own musicality than with logical or thematic coherence. You could call it reckless, unhinged and paranoid in tone, but to call it anti-Semitic is (as Baraka himself has argued) a gross distortion. ''Somebody Blew Up America'' touches briefly on outrageous conspiracy theories linking the Israeli (and American and British and Russian) governments to the 9/11 attacks, but along the way it mourns Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, the Rosenbergs and those who died in the Holocaust, along with all other victims of history. Allen Ginsberg could almost have written it (and would surely have loved it).
 Baraka is a poet down to his bones, and the wildly uneven stories of ''Tales of the Out & the Gone,'' which veer from broad, Pynchonesque satire to pointed science-fiction parable to jazz-infused Joycean linguistic games, are unmistakably poet's prose. One might be tempted to argue that Baraka lacks the skills required to write conventional, magazine-style short fiction, but as he demonstrates in the erotic horror story ''Norman's Date'' (published in Playboy, of all places, in 1983), that simply isn't true. He writes crisp, punchy sentences and has a fine ear for dialogue, especially of the masculine, in-joke variety. He just can't be bothered, most of the time, with story structure, with beginnings and endings. Reading Baraka's fiction is all about enjoying the journey, and never mind the destination.
 Those who regard Baraka as an anti-Semite or a white-hater may be surprised by a story like ''Mondongo,'' a sweet-tempered autobiographical reminiscence of a friendship between a bookish black kid and a gangly Lower East Side Jew, a pair of budding intellectuals stuck on a remote Air Force base in Puerto Rico. More to the point, perhaps, is ''Neo-American,'' a ruthless satire of the black-on-black political infighting in a New Jersey city that strongly resembles Newark, Baraka's birthplace.
 Nothing intemperate that Baraka has ever said about whites can match the bitterness of his portrayal of Tim Goodson, the fat, corrupt, ''burpin' black bastard'' who has become the city's first African-American mayor (a thinly-disguised caricature of Kenneth Gibson, Newark's former real-life mayor, whom Baraka supported and then turned against). Goodson runs the city with his clique of ''WaBenzis'' (Swahili, Baraka informs us, for ''those who drive the Mercedes-Benzes''), but little has changed. ''And what we got here in this town?'' one community activist asks. ''Niggers in high places, black faces in high places, but the same rats and roaches, the same slums and garbage, the same police whippin' your heads, the same unemployment and junkies in the hallways muggin' your old lady.''
 In the second half of this collection, covering the years 1988 to 2003, his stories become shorter, increasingly abstract and increasingly fanciful. (In the introduction, he tells us his inspirations include Franz Kafka, Ray Bradbury and Mao Zedong.) Some of these are inaccessible to the point of incomprehensibility, like fragments of ''Finnegans Wake'' retold by Sun Ra, but as that suggests, they're often rhythmically exciting. Here's a typical passage, from ''Retrospection'' (2000): ''A quest lit with reality -- terrible name, this place. Sound thrown as chance, head beat ing of under standing. Get up then. Blow that note. Be its endless substance. An us.''
 In other stories, the dead (including the author's mother and Thelonious Monk) make return visits. There are references to the ''Matrix'' movies, the ''Fugitive'' TV series, and Mick Jagger. (Baraka really does not like Mick Jagger.) Conrad Loomis and other inner-city guerrilla entrepreneurs create various wondrous inventions: a ray-gun that instantaneously makes any kind of clothing the user wants, a method of traveling via music, customized Reeboks that actually make the wearer fly. These science-fiction stories are goofy and half-baked, more like sketches than finished pieces. But taken together, they evoke a mood of revolutionary disorder, conjuring an alternate universe in which a dangerous African-American underground, or a dangerous literary underground -- hell, any kind of an underground -- still exists. 
 In his prose as in his poetry, Baraka is at his best as a lyrical prophet of despair who transfigures his contentious racial and political views into a transcendent, ''outtelligent'' clarity. In the poem-within-a-story ''Dig This! Out?'' (1995), he imagines America in 2031, when Christmas is replaced by Halloween, and ''The Devil became / Santa Claus / & Death was celebrated / Instead of birth.'' (Some might argue it didn't take nearly that long.) In another 1995 story, ''Heathen Technology at the End of the Twentieth Century,'' he writes: ''So like gigantic nuclear-force wheels, the present sped into the future and the past carried garbage across the horizon. No one could be anywhere unless they didn't yet exist. What existed changed and changed. The buildings rotted and the people disappeared. Reappeared. And the people whose metaphor had been stolen could not imagine what was going on. And they disappeared anyway.'' Has any writer captured the unreal quality of contemporary reality more succinctly than that?

SEAN HOLMES, a 39-year-old executive with the Fitzpatrick Hotel Group, can identify an Irishman at a glance. ''It's that fresh skin of 'you don't see too much sun,' '' he said the other day, nodding toward a pink-faced patron of the bar at his company's hotel on Lexington Avenue near 57th Street. ''A lot of mist.'' 
 Mr. Holmes, himself a native of Galway, has had practice spotting Irishmen. For the Irish, the Fitzpatrick is virtually synonymous with New York. The last three prime ministers have stayed there, as have the country's last two presidents. A portrait of the sitting president, Mary McAleese, hangs near the reception desk.
A popular Irish radio program, ''The Gerry Ryan Show,'' sometimes broadcasts from the lobby. And during the Christmas holiday season, the hotel is packed with Irish tourists; over the last month, Mr. Holmes said, roughly 65 percent of its guests have been Irish.
 At an average of $430 a night in December, the Fitzpatrick's 43 rooms are not cheap. (The hotel also has 49 suites, which cost more.) But that price is increasingly within the reach of many Irish, who are blessed with a buoyant economy, now Western Europe's fastest growing. There are few better vantage points than the Fitzpatrick from which to observe how the country's economic surge has sent many Irish on visits to New York.
 ''A lot of Irish were coming here to work 15 years ago,'' said Des Murtagh, a ruddy oil truck driver in a striped polo shirt who was sipping a beer in the bar. ''But now that's stopped, because there's plenty of work at home. Now people come to shop.''
 His wife, Anne, giggled. ''We're very good friends with Tommy,'' she said. The couple had just visited the Tommy Hilfiger store at Macy's, not to mention Levi's, where they bought seven pairs of jeans for a total of $215, half of what they would have paid back home. 
 ''When you come here, you realize how bad the shopping is over there,'' added another visitor from Ireland, 20-year-old Ana Reape, who was wearing an Abercrombie T-shirt. Her friend Geraldine Curry, clad in a Yankees T-shirt, agreed. ''People even come to New York for weekends now,'' she said. 
 Did she mind staying in a hotel full of other Irish people? ''It's nice. You hear the accent, and you know you can sit down and have a bit of craic with them,'' Ms. Curry said, using a Gaelic word that means fun. 
 Colm Bowden, who was sitting nearby, begged to differ. ''When I get away from home,'' he said, ''I like to remain anonymous.'' A police official back in Ireland, Mr. Bowden has begun keeping silent to mask his telltale accent. ''If I'm coming down the elevator here,'' he said, ''I don't even talk. If I don't speak, nobody will ask me any questions.'' ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: In This Jackpot, 22 Affordable Homes

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

DATELINE: SOUTHOLD 

 BODY:
FORTY-NINE slips of paper with names printed on them tumbled around inside a spinning gold-colored drum at Southold Town Hall one day in early December, as a crowd of nearly 100 waited to see who would be the 22 given the chance to buy homes at prices they could afford.
 Alison Reiter, 31, an X-ray technician who is living with her parents in nearby Cutchogue, was the first to have her name called. She strode to the front of the room, seeming more nervous than excited. ''I'm still in shock,'' Ms. Reiter said later.
She now has the opportunity to buy one of 22 homes to be built on a 7.4-acre wooded parcel in the hamlet of Mattituck, in the town of Southold on Long Island's eastern North Fork. But despite her good fortune, Ms. Reiter is not certain at this point that she will buy one of the houses. 
 The Community Development Corporation of Long Island, a nonprofit housing organization, bought the land in May for $895,000. Over the previous year working with the town, the group gained approval to rezone the parcel from two-acre residential to ''affordable housing district.''
 That zoning code, created in 1985, has been amended over the last two years to include restrictions on the prices that owners can set when ready to sell. The new rules also limit owners' rights to alter the property or to create accessory apartments.
 The 22 houses in the development, called the Cottages at Mattituck, will all be two-bedroom 1,100-square-foot single-family homes. Work is to start in January. Prices will be $175,000 for those earning up to 80 percent of the median income on Long Island ($81,900 for a family of three), or $214,000 for those earning 80 percent to 100 percent of the median. 
 The 49 whose names were in the hopper came from a pool of nearly 150 who applied to be in the drawing in August 2005. Applicants were required to meet the income guidelines, be Southold residents and show an ability to secure a mortgage.
 The Community Development Corporation counseled the prospective buyers and approved them for the lottery, said Marianne Garvin, president of the organization. Suffolk County will buy the land from the corporation and transfer ownership to the town, removing the land costs from the purchase price of the homes.
 Southold's affordable-housing initiatives are similar to others across the New York metropolitan region. On the East End of Long Island, where some hamlets have median prices topping $1 million, the lack of housing within reach of teachers, police officers, firefighters and others is most acute.
 ''If you lose your middle class,'' said Thomas Ruhle, director of housing and economic development for the town of East Hampton, ''what you're left with is poor people and wealthy second-homeowners.'' The town has built about 53 homes in the last five years and is now building 26 affordable rental apartments and planning 26 more homes.
 The Long Island Housing Partnership, another nonprofit in the field, has helped to build 115 affordable homes in the five East End towns (East Hampton, Southampton, Riverhead, Southold and Shelter Island). More are planned or under way. 
 One Southampton development, called the Bridgehampton Mews, will have 12 homes, 4 with accessory apartments for elderly residents to rent below market rates.
 Suffolk County is creating an affordable-housing project in Yaphank that would guarantee a percentage of homes for local fire and emergency medical volunteers. These services are suffering from the strain of expensive real estate.
 ''It used to be that folks would work 9 to 5 and have some time to volunteer for community service,'' said Steve Levy, the Suffolk County supervisor. ''Now that time is dedicated to a second job to pay the bills.''
 In Southold, the median home price has shot up over the last few years to $500,000, according to Phillip Beltz, Southold special projects coordinator, who was closely involved in creating the Mattituck development. That is well beyond what local people can afford, he said. 
 As names were called at the lottery, reactions were eloquent. Some embraced; one woman bowed her head and cried.
 When Russell Smith, 39, heard his name, he jumped up, pumped his first and burst out with ''Yesss!'' Moments beforehand, he said, he had been praying. ''I had my church family praying for me,'' he added. ''My co-workers were praying for me.''
 Mr. Smith grew up in Greenport and still lives with his parents in their house. ''I don't want a handout,'' he said, explaining that he works two jobs, totaling 60 hours a week, teaching and assisting developmentally disabled adults in Greenport, Jamesport and Westhampton. 
 As for Ms. Reiter, she said she was still weighing the restrictions that come with buying the homes. The most important, she said, is the limit on the resale price. It must be no higher than the original price plus the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, a federal measure of price changes, during the time of ownership. In recent years, house prices have tended to rise much faster than the overall price index.
 The restriction on the resale price is a result of lessons learned from past affordable-housing attempts, Mr. Beltz said. ''We were trying to find something that would allow homeowners to make some profit, but to limit that,'' he said. 
 Some ''affordable'' homes of the past are sold today at market rates, Mr. Beltz pointed out. Houses bought for $125,000 in 1992, for example, were on the market in 2004 for $450,000. Without the resale restriction, he maintained, ''you're never going to have an inventory of affordable homes.'' 
 Yet Ms. Reiter says she is apprehensive. ''I always thought that if you buy a home, you will make money on it,'' she said. At first blush, that might sound opportunistic. But, for many, making money on a real estate sale on the East End has become a requirement for staying.
 Though Ms. Reiter is not yet married, she foresees a future that includes children. By then, two bedrooms may not be enough.
 ''I think prices will go up in Southold a lot,'' Ms. Reiter said. ''So if I sell, I won't be able to afford to buy another house here.''
 Mr. Smith, however, agrees with the restrictions on the Mattituck homes, believing they will ensure that other working people can buy homes there.
 ''My goal is just to have my own home,'' he said. ''If I have to sell, then I have to do what I'm supposed to do. It should always remain affordable.''
 From a builder's perspective, affordable prices lower the risk of developing a project as long as there are enough units per acre to offset land costs.
 ''It's good work because affordable housing sells no matter what the market is,'' said Michael Dubb, whose firm built Southwind Village, a 78-unit affordable community in Bay Shore, that many credit with helping to start a revitalization in that village. 
 On Long Island and in other suburbs, Mr. Dubb said, communities often resist allowing builders to exceed town limits on the number of homes per acre. That is why fewer affordable homes are built, he said.
 Ms. Reiter, meanwhile, said her reservations had not completely overshadowed her excitement about the idea of having her own home. She makes about $48,000 a year, she said, working a full-time and a part-time job. She also volunteers as an emergency medical technician.
 ''To stay in Southold,'' she said, ''the cheapest house is $400,000. That's just way above my means.''

HEADLINE: Priced-Out Buyers In the Virgin Islands

BYLINE: By JENNIE GREEN

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE AMALIE, V.I. 

 BODY:
COLLEEN WILSON, a lawyer who relocated her family to St. Thomas for a job at a multinational insurance company this spring, has not rented a home since she was 21. Not in Britain, nor in Jamaica, nor in Florida. Here in the Virgin Islands, however, she has been renting a three-bedroom house for more than eight months. And she doesn't like it. 
 ''Renting seems like such a waste,'' she said, of the modest house on a small lot in the eastern Red Hook section of the island that could be hers to own for slightly more than $1 million.
''But I'm just not comfortable with the range of prices here,'' she said. ''Based on the property values in Miami, where we lived before, I expected to purchase something nice for $500,000 or under within six to eight months of exploring the island. Everything I'm interested in is $1.2 million, and I can't see myself mortgaging my entire lifestyle to incur that kind of debt.'' 
 The high prices would not have been an issue had Ms. Wilson and her husband, Ludlow Bailey, moved here five years ago, before a new government program to attract investment and businesses to the Virgin Islands drove up prices. 
 Until recently, homes on the United States Virgin Islands -- made up of St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix -- were widely considered undervalued. The traditional housing market was dominated by a small group of retired or semiretired second-home buyers from the mainland who were undaunted by the prospect of growing old in an outpost environment that was not home to an abundance of medical specialists, state-of-the-art hospitals, department stores or even paved roads. 
 In 1989, all three islands were ravaged by Hurricane Hugo, and in 1995, Hurricane Marilyn destroyed nearly 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas. The economy sagged and the housing market softened further. 
 Afterward, initiatives were undertaken to strengthen and diversify the economy, and in 2001 the Economic Development Commission was created. 
 The commission offers companies a number of inducements, including a 90 percent exemption on local income taxes; a 90 percent exemption on dividends; a 100 percent exemption on gross receipts taxes; a 100 percent exemption on property taxes; a 100 percent exemption on excise taxes; and 1 percent customs duties. The creation of the commission was accompanied by an aggressive marketing campaign, which resulted in about 100 companies' moving to or expanding on the islands between 2002 and 2004, employing nearly 3,100 people.
 ''Of course there's a trade-off,'' said Nadine Marchena, the commission's assistant chief executive. ''In exchange for the benefits, we expect our companies to invest in the community. We ask them to buy locally, support regional charities and establish residency -- anything that demonstrates an intention to stay.'' 
 The commission does not require the companies or their employees to buy real estate. But it did not take long for most of the newly imported chief executives to realize the tax benefits of buying. 
 ''They made it their business to know everything there was to know about the agency and its benefits,'' Ms. Marchena said, ''to the point where they were functioning as ambassadors for the E.D.C., telling their clients why it would be beneficial for them to buy this or that property.''
 The Virgin Islands housing market has changed dramatically since 2002. On St. Thomas, there are now 110 homes for sale, 44 of them listed for more than a $1 million. In 2006, 17 homes have sold for over $1 million, compared with one home that sold for $1.01 million in 2002. 
 The St. John market has risen, too, because of a severely limited supply of housing: two-thirds of the island is a national park. And in St. Croix property values have also increased, though much less dramatically, because of its distance from the economic and tourism hub of St. Thomas and its less densely populated area. 
 While the commission's efforts attracted wealthy professionals, they also gained the attention of federal officials. In 2004, the United States Treasury Department concluded that the commission's efforts were costing the federal government more than $1 billion a year in lost tax revenue. An investigation revealed a smattering of financial abuses coupled with lax residency requirements. The findings resulted in new residency rules, requiring all employees to be physically on the island for 183 days a year. 
 ''Enrollment in the E.D.C. program has been adversely affected,'' said Nick Bailey, co-owner of John Foster Real Estate. ''Several of the E.D.C. companies were audited or couldn't meet the residency requirements, so they left. That put the brakes on the rapid, artificial inflation of the real estate market.''
 Those people who bought or built expensive luxury homes were not in a hurry to sell for less than what they considered these homes to be worth, which resulted in a glut of high-end properties. 
 ''The market has leveled off, but it isn't going down,'' said Dawn Wheatley, a broker with John Foster Real Estate, ''and the reason is a limited supply of inventory. Almost no new housing has been built in more than 20 years, and we're back to our original client base of second-home buyers from the U.S. The downside is that there are very few homes available in the under-$300,000 range.''
 ''Even the average two-bedroom, two-bath condominium is going for between $400,000 and $700,000 now,'' she added. 
 Prospective home buyers with limited resources might hope for some break in the market. For now, though, the market is strong, and residents breathed a sigh of relief this year when a gentle hurricane season left all three islands intact.
 More than eight months after her relocation, Colleen Wilson has put house-hunting on the back burner. ''We're still ready to buy the right property for the right price,'' she said. ''But I don't want a damaged place. Neither of us are particularly hands-on people.''
 Yet not everyone is complaining about the market here. Aaron Black, a developer with a company called Labal, says he is not concerned about the flat property values. Labal was founded by Mr. Black's father, Gordon, who fashioned a viable business from a hobby of transforming hurricane-damaged properties into luxury homes and villas, then flipping them for a handsome profit. 
 ''Fortunately for us,'' the younger Mr. Black said, ''a key factor beyond the E.D.C. that sustained real estate values here was and continues to be an abundance of baby boomer wealth. Don't forget, this is a generation that has been driven by their dreams and desires, and the kinds of properties we've been developing are compatible with that common fantasy of escaping to a tropical paradise.'' 
 Neither of the men expressed concern about finding buyers for their two luxury properties on Frenchman's Bay and Magens Bay, listed at $4.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. 
 ''It'll probably sell to someone from the States,'' said Gordon Black, standing beside a new infinity pool on the deck of his recently finished 4,250-square-foot property, Villa Cote Sud, on Frenchman's Bay. From there, a long staircase pauses at an outdoor shower before leading directly into some of the finest snorkeling grounds on the island. ''It might not go as quickly as it would have a couple of years ago,'' he said, ''but we can always rent it out in the meantime.''

HEADLINE: Long-Ago Snow

BYLINE: By MITCH KELLER

 BODY:
ON Monday, Jan. 18, 1909, New Yorkers woke to a city transformed. A weekend storm of snow and sleet had left everything -- the biggest trees and the smallest bushes, the trolley wires and street lamps -- coated and gleaming with ice, as if made of glass. It was, wrote a reporter for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, ''as if the fairy queen of childhood days had waved her magic wand and transported us to the kingdom of ice and snow.''
 ''In Prospect Park,'' the reporter continued, ''the scenes witnessed were beyond description. Nothing like it has been seen for years, and thousands of persons walked through a perfect garden of wonder.''
We have a good idea what Prospect Park looked like that day because one of the thousands of Brooklynites who went there was a serious amateur photographer named Clinton Irving Jones. Using a 4-by-5 view camera, Mr. Jones took carefully composed photos of the scenes before him. They captured the ice sparkling on the trees like tiny holiday lights, the weaker trees bending under the burden of the ice on their branches, the tracks of the people who went to see it all. 
 In these photographs, which are on display at the Underbridge Pictures gallery in Dumbo through Jan. 28, Mr. Jones recorded the friendlier aspect of a winter storm, its visual beauty in a pastoral place. But his photos did not, of course, reflect the larger reality of that storm. 
 With the exception of the rare power blackout, nothing disrupts life in New York like a winter storm. This was especially true a century ago, long before conveniences like the Weather Channel and 24/7 takeout, and devices like computers and cellphones that make instant communication possible. 
 In those years, even a relatively modest storm like the one that transformed Prospect Park into the proverbial wonderland -- several inches of snow and sleet, a little rain mixed in, followed by an ice-up -- might play havoc with the lives of New Yorkers. When a warm home depended not on the turn of a thermostat dial but on the availability of coal at the grocer's, and when milk was delivered each morning door to door, the inability of horse-drawn delivery vehicles to move about could mean days of hardship. Nor did it take much bad weather to disable the overhead wires that provided telephone and trolley service, or to seriously complicate the efforts of horse-drawn fire and rescue vehicles to reach people in need.
 DURING the storm in January 1909, for instance, beyond the peaceful confines of Prospect Park, ice-laden trolley wires collapsed in many parts of the city, badly interfering with streetcar traffic and clogging up the streets. Horse-drawn trucks kept getting stuck, further hindering the streetcars, because the horses couldn't advance in the ice and snow; at the Williamsburg Bridge, The Eagle reported, ''The horses attached to a truck fell down and the cars were blocked from 7:35 to 7:55.'' 
 In Long Island City, Queens, telephone wires collapsed onto trolley lines, causing ''a big electrical display'' and a traffic jam. In Manhattan, ice on the third rail was believed to have caused a short circuit that set fire to a car on the Sixth Avenue el. Back in Brooklyn, according to The Eagle, the weather ''put almost the entire fire alarm system in the borough out of commission and created grave danger.''
 Emanuel Brutto, a 30-year-old ship's cook from Barbados, was found frozen to death beneath a tarpaulin in a truck on South Street. The New York Times reported that a barge captain had died of ''apoplexy'' during the storm, a condition caused, his crew said, by ''anxiety for the safety of the barge.'' 
 Then, as now, New York had a conspicuous population of homeless people, many hundreds of whom turned to the Department of Public Charities for shelter that weekend. ''Practically all the men and women who applied for shelter were poorly clad, some miserably,'' The Eagle said, ''and many of them were suffering with frostbitten feet and hands.''
 All things considered, New York's winters are far from arduous, but the city has been struck by plenty of big storms over the years, many of them notable for one reason or another. The storm of last Feb. 11-12 brought the biggest official snowfall in the city's history, 26.9 inches. The storm of Feb. 9-10, 1969, almost cost Mayor John Lindsay the next election because of his failure to clear the streets of Queens. 
 After the Blizzard of '61, Mayor Robert Wagner banned cars in New York for almost a week, sealing off the city with police checkpoints. During the Depression, storms like the Blizzard of '35 meant government-sponsored snow-removal jobs for thousands of unemployed men. The cleanup of the Blizzard of 1920 included the bizarre sight of soldiers from the chemical warfare service of the United States Army using fuel-spewing flamethrowers to melt snow and ice. 
 Then, of course, there was the legendary Blizzard of '88. It is probable that no inhabitants of the area that is now New York, going all the way back to the Lenape Indians, ever had so hellacious an experience of winter as the New Yorkers of March 1888 did. It wasn't so much the 21 inches of snow, a total surpassed not just last February but also on Dec. 26-27, 1947 (26.4 inches). It was more the winds gusting as high as 85 miles an hour and the single-digit temperatures, and of course the fact that the late-19th-century metropolis simply wasn't sturdy enough to withstand the onslaught, the likes of which it could never have imagined. 
 Given modern New York's far stronger infrastructure, mechanized snow removal and infinitely better communications, it is tempting to believe that no weather event could ever replace that one as the worst in New York history. But one effect of global warming, scientists say, may be more volatile weather, with storms that, if not greater in number, are more intense. So it is probably inadvisable to assume that the worst Mother Nature can inflict on New York has already occurred. 
 WRITTEN accounts of the Blizzard of '88, which killed about 100 people in New York and 300 elsewhere, reveal a basic way in which people were different then. When New Yorkers woke up on the morning of Monday, March 12, and beheld what was clearly an awful and even dangerous day to go out -- snow rapidly accumulating in big drifts, winds gusting at gale force, temperature in the low 20s and dropping -- most of them seem not to have given much thought to staying home. 
 They did not have radios, of course, and could not really have known how much worse things were going to get. Beyond that, though, job protection and workers' benefits were essentially unheard of. People were afraid, and rightly so, that if they didn't show up for work, they would lose not just a day's pay but their livelihood.
 By that afternoon, New York had become virtually cut off from the rest of the world. The telephone, telegraph, electrical and fire alarm wires strung so precariously above the streets tumbled down. Service on the four elevated train lines was all but knocked out, stranding thousands. 
 Horse-drawn streetcars ground to a halt in the snow and were abandoned, a blessing to the homeless and the lost who took refuge in them. Horses got stuck in the massive drifts and froze to death, only their heads visible above the drifts. Large numbers of sparrows froze to death, too, their lifeless bodies dropping to the street or floating through the air on the wind.
 Pedestrians became disoriented and fatigued in the blinding snow. The wind was unbelievable, the streets littered with people's hats and headwear. 
 James Algeo, who lived on East 84th Street near the East River, wrote years later about how he and two companions got caught bya gust of wind as they crossed the intersection of Dey Street and Broadway. ''I went sailing up Broadway and landed against the newsstand at Knox Hat Store,'' he recalled. ''One of my companions landed in the Western Union Building, the other went up Park Row and landed at the old World Building.'' 
 New York's streets at the time were notoriously filthy, and the faces of many pedestrians were left blotched and scratched not just by the searing, horizontally blowing snow, itself like tiny particles of glass raked against the skin, but also by the grit and trash that had lain on the streets and was wedged between the cobblestones.
 Frostbite was a major problem. Police officers kept an eye on pedestrians' ears, and if they saw a pair that looked too white, they took the person aside and rubbed the suspect ears with snow, in the mistaken belief that such an action would prevent frostbite. 
 Another old wives' tale of the time was that alcohol was a good way to fortify oneself against the extreme cold. The city's saloons were packed during the Blizzard of '88, and many a pickled townsman made the mistake of trying to negotiate the perilous streets, only to end up floundering in a snowdrift. Not all were lucky enough to be pulled out while they were alive.
 Clinton Irving Jones, the almost forgotten photographer of the New York ice storm of 1909, was a native of Tompkins County, far upstate, and it is not known if he was living in the city during the Blizzard of '88. But his photos of Prospect Park suggest that as devastating as the storm was, he would have liked to be around for it.

HEADLINE: A Glance Over the Shoulder at the Double Takes of 2006

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
IT'S natural at the end of the year to pause, clear the throat and conjure up thoughtful analysis that brings meaning and context to the previous 12 months -- never mind that we've barely had a chance to digest the buffet of news events. To tide you over until hindsight bestows perspective, if not wisdom, here is a sampler of happenings in the automotive world of 2006 that deserve reflection. 


A PLAN BY ANY OTHER NAME The Ford Motor Company, in a deep financial funk, began the year in search of a new strategy to chart the automaker's success. The plan formulated by 10 teams commissioned to study the situation, announced in January, was named the Way Forward. In December, the report of the Iraq Study Group emerged with a strategy for success, and this subtitle on its cover: The Way Forward -- A New Approach. It is not clear to what extent the plans are interchangeable.

TOTAL RECALL, LACK OF Marketing executives at the Chrysler division, courageously making a decision on a day the company's Department of Nomenclature was perhaps off to its annual lawn bowling tournament, chose an evocative name for their version of the Dodge Durango: the Chrysler Aspen. While the intent may have been to evoke the self-indulgent pleasures of Colorado's tony mountain resort, the name instead triggered flashbacks among those still recovering from encounters with the reliability-challenged Dodge Aspen and its twin, the Plymouth Volare. Introduced in 1976, the Aspen was so bad it was declared Lemon of the Year by the Center for Auto Safety.

WHAT GOES AROUND In need of a different spin to promote a car that had already been on sale in Europe for two years, Volkswagen also reached into its past for nomenclature. The Germans were clever enough, though, to revive a name whose nostalgic connection preceded its dive into the quality sub-basement. Thus the not-so-new Golf became the Rabbit in the United States, reversing a change of two decades earlier -- when the Rabbit was renamed Golf.

HAVE YOU DRIVEN A MAHINDRA LATELY? An Indian automaker, Mahindra & Mahindra, said it would start selling small S.U.V.'s and pickups in the United States through Global Vehicles U.S.A. in Georgia. M. & M. is best known for its farm tractors, already sold in this country.

THE SKY IS NO LONGER THE LIMIT Seeking to enter a vehicle class with fewer competitors, Honda began taking orders this fall for a $3.65 million made-in-America business jet, with the first planes to be delivered in 2010. The basic model has room for two pilots and five passengers; Honda said that fuel economy will be 30 percent better than its competition.

RENAULT ALLIANCE, STILL DEAD Kirk Kerkorian used his stock in General Motors to pressure the automaker into holding talks with Carlos Ghosn, president and chief executive of Nissan and Renault, but the forced slow dancing did not blossom into romance. Mr. Ghosn did not get involved in an overhaul of G.M. and the French connection was severed. Mr. Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation later sold its G.M. shares.

NASHVILLE CATS Mr. Ghosn moved Nissan's North American headquarters from California to Nashville, closer to its factories. Some employees stamped their feet and held their breath; others simply left the company rather than move. While those who went east appeared safe from earthquakes and wildfires, they risked death by shock at the comparatively low prices of homes.

CHERY PICKING A plan by Malcolm Bricklin and the Chery Automobile Company to import cars from China to the United States by late 2008 was cancelled in a dispute over the design of the vehicles. Mr. Bricklin is exploring alternatives, which may or may not include Chery, a spokeswoman said, adding, ''We certainly haven't abandoned China.''

PORSCHE TO THE RESCUE? Porsche indicated that it wanted to expand its 27.4 percent share of Volkswagen, raising the possibility that the small sports car company might gain control of a stumbling German giant. Porsche's chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, would not spell out the plan, but he told reporters that by ''acquiring a share in Volkswagen, Porsche has become another company.'' He added, ''We have come out of our warm comfort zone.''

ALPHABETICAL DITHERING Trailing virtually every other luxury automaker, Lincoln finally decided to ride the horse the way it was going and switch to alphabetical model designations. The larger challenge proved to be pronunciation. Initially, the 2007 Lincoln MKZ (the renamed 2006 Lincoln Zephyr) was to be called the Mark Z. In what may be the first recall of car pronunciation, Lincoln executives later said the vehicle was to be called the Lincoln M-K-Z.

ALPHABETICal DITHERING, THE SEQUEL In January, Honda sued Ford over the name MKX. Regardless of how the name of the Lincoln sport wagon was supposed to be pronounced, Honda contended the name was too close to that of the Acura MDX, its competing S.U.V.

GET SMART After years of hand-wringing over whether to sell the teensy Smart car in the United States, DaimlerChrysler announced that Roger Penske, racecar driver turned entrepreneur extraordinaire, would sell the European city car starting in 2008 through a new company, Smart USA. Prices are expected to start at less than $15,000.

BRAND LOYALTY As the year drew to a close, Ford tried to revitalize its sputtering introduction of the 2007 Edge, hiring the hip-hop artist Kelis to draw attention to the crossover it hopes will help save the company. The singer's come-on includes lyrics like, ''So clean in my Edge/Steady headed to the spot/Speakers bump thump thump/All you hearin' on the block.''
 Kelis's other work includes the song ''Milkshake.'' In video form, she waves her upper torso and sings ''My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.'' A Ford marketing executive said the artist's image was a good match for the Edge because ''our target buyer can easily relate to Kelis' sharp and sophisticated style.'' 
 But wait, who is this on the May page of Chevrolet's 2007 Year in Rock calendar, promoting the Equinox, a direct Edge competitor? Why, it's Kelis, showing relentless energy in boosting the economy.

DOUBLE AGENT, MAN To keep the design details of future models secret until the public unveiling, automakers routinely camouflage prototypes with padded foam covers. The competition among car magazines for photos of these advance models is intense -- and so, apparently, is the temptation to snooker competitors.
 The editors of the Web magazine Winding Road (windingroad.com) borrowed a Corvette Z06, found a guy on staff who could sew and made cover-up panels to dress the car as a prototype of the Blue Devil Corvette -- a rumored ultrahigh-performance Corvette that G.M. has not confirmed it will build. ''Everybody is aching to get the shot, so what we looked at is how ridiculous that whole game has become,'' said Reilly Brennan, the editor of Winding Road. Photos quickly appeared on the Web sites of Winding Road competitors like Motor Trend and the Car Connection.com.
 But perhaps the bigger and more serious question for Winding Road is not the ethical implications of fooling the competition, but why a car magazine has a guy on its staff who can sew so well.

HEADLINE: Around the Scene, a Whirl of Change 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE FALKENSTEIN

 BODY:
AT the ribbon-cutting ceremony last month for the opening of the South Orange Performing Arts Center, high-powered klieg lights streaked across the sky, and the Columbia High School marching band from Maplewood struck up a tune.
 ''People kept saying, 'What's going on?' '' said Ondine Landa Abramson, the center's acting artistic director. 
 The arts center, which consists of a 415-seat live performance space and a five-screen movie complex, had its genesis 12 years ago when a study commissioned by South Orange Village found that such a center would help revitalize downtown.
 The performance space was opened by the comedian Paula Poundstone on Nov. 3, and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the jazz clarinetist Paquito D'Rivera performed at the center's fund-raising gala later that month. Upcoming events include appearances by the jazz pianist Eddie Palmieri on Jan. 25, the sitarist Anoushka Shankar on March 13 and the singer Nancy Wilson on April 14.
 The opening of the arts center, known as Sopac, was perhaps the most dramatic development of the year, but only one of many among New Jersey's arts organizations. Following are some highlights.
 The Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn announced in November that its president and chief executive, Michael Gennaro, would be leaving in January of 2007 to become the executive director of Trinity Rep in Providence, R.I. Mr. Gennaro joined Paper Mill in April 2003. The theater's board of trustees has formed a committee to select new top leadership for the theater. A new leader on the arts scene was announced in October by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in Newark. After a year-and-a-half-long search, Andre Gremillet, 40, was named president and chief executive. 
 ''I'm a musician who manages,'' said Mr. Gremillet, a pianist with an M.B.A. who will join the orchestra at the end of January. 
 He said he was ''very impressed by the people here,'' citing ''a high collaborative spirit, unlike what I've seen in other places.'' 
 Mr. Gremillet, who is French-Canadian, had been president of Casavant Freres, a builder of pipe organs near Montreal.
 Two of the five members appointed to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in December may be familiar to audiences in the state: Savion Glover, the dancer and choreographer, and Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company. While the two are not the first artists on the NJPAC board (the actress Olympia Dukakis once served), they are the only two currently serving among the 44 members and seven ex-officio members. 
 ''It's important, in our view, for art centers to have this,'' said Lawrence Goldman, president and chief executive of NJPAC. ''We're probably a little slow, but I'm glad we're doing it, and we'll probably do more of it.'' 
 NJPAC also unveiled the New Jersey Walk of Fame in May, with 30 performers with ties to the Garden State being honored with cast-bronze reliefs in the inaugural installation in front of the center, including Whitney Houston, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra, Meryl Streep and John Travolta. 
 Among the collaborations this year, Paper Mill and McCarter Theater in Princeton co-produced a play for the first time in the spring, Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Directed by Tina Landau and featuring music by the pop trio GrooveLily, the play ran at both theaters. 
 The Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company of Fort Lee performed in October at a concert presentation of Puccini's ''Turandot'' with the Westfield Symphony at the PNC Bank Arts Center. Last month, the dance company collaborated with the Boheme Opera Company in Trenton to present a fully staged ''Turandot'' at the Patriot Theater of the War Memorial, also in Trenton.
 One of the expansion programs on New Jersey's arts scene took a step forward earlier this month when the Newark Museum was given permission by the New Jersey Historic Preservation office to demolish one of its five buildings, a former Y.M.C.A. built in 1913. The structure's facade will be preserved and moved back to line up with the facade of the museum's main building.
 The demolition, which has met with resistance from some preservationists, is part of a planned $135 million expansion that will double the museum's size to 400,000 square feet. 
 Expansion is also under way at the Community Theater in Morristown, which announced in June that it had broken ground on a $6 million, 18-month expansion project. A new stage was to be completed before the opening of the new season on Nov. 3, but the project fell behind. ''There have been delays, but construction is ongoing,'' said Ed Kirchdoerffer, the theater's marketing director. ''We are hopeful that the stage will be completed in early 2007.'' 
 At the Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, the big change in October was a new name: the Judith K. and David J. Brodsky Center for Print and Paper. The center was renamed after a major contribution from its founder, Judith K. Brodsky. 
 ''I had the idea that if I jump-started an endowment, it would help,'' Ms. Brodsky said. ''Our goal for the endowment is $1 million, and we're almost at that goal.'' 
 On Jan. 13, the Brodsky Center, as it is commonly known, will hold a fund-raising gala and silent auction at the Mason Gross School of the Arts in New Brunswick. 
 New Jersey rockers also fared well in 2006. The neo-punk band My Chemical Romance, whose members hail from Belleville and Kearny (except for their Chicago-born drummer), released a live album, ''Life on the Murder Scene,'' in March, and their second album of new material, ''The Black Parade,'' on Halloween.
 Bruce Springsteen, who grew up in Freehold, served up the critically acclaimed ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' in April, and the singer Jon Bon Jovi, who was raised in Sayreville, and his band's guitarist Richie Sambora, from Woodbridge, will be immortalized as action figures next July by McFarlane Toys, it was announced in October. 
 In November, Discover Jersey Arts, a project designed to increase awareness of and participation in the arts, unveiled the Jersey Arts Gift Card, which can be purchased for $5 to $500 and used at 30 locations statewide for admission, tickets to events, tours, classes and in gift shops.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face of the Suburbs

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
THE rich are getting richer, while most families in the region's suburbs have been losing economic ground since 1999.
 The suburbs are becoming increasingly diverse as Asian and Hispanic immigrants bypass New York City, traditionally the first stop for new arrivals.
And among those who commute between the suburbs and New York City, the trend is toward traveling in reverse: from homes in the city to jobs outside it. 
 These are among the changes that have taken place across the metropolitan region since 1999, according to an analysis of data released in bits and pieces by the Census Bureau over the last six months. 
 A review of the census data and other demographic information for Long Island, three counties in Connecticut, five in the Hudson Valley and 14 in northern and central New Jersey shows that the region is undergoing significant demographic change and other shifts. The data support some commonly held beliefs about income distribution, housing, and commuting. 
 For example, the cost of housing is consuming an increasingly higher percentage of household income. When that is coupled with a huge increase in home equity borrowing, a result is that many families are mortgaged to an extent unheard of just a few years ago. 
 Also, for most residents of the region's suburbs, taxes are rising faster than income.
 Instead of commuting to the city, an increasing number of suburban residents work closer to home. 
 And thousands of people are leaving the more affluent towns and suburbs close to New York City, bound for more affordable locales that may be a county away, or across the country. Many students from around the region who have gone off to college are not coming back, helping to turn the suburbs, increasingly, into a land of 50-somethings. 
 Jobs in the region are drifting to opposite ends of the income scale: Sharp declines in the number of people working in manufacturing and clerical jobs have been accompanied by modest increases in finance and professional work, and big jumps in lower-paid jobs like food service, maintenance and personal services.

Slumping Income
 From 1999 to 2005, the median household income in the region fell, dropping to $67,165 from $69,750 for households outside the city. (The 2000 census measured the level of income in 1999, and the numbers are adjusted for inflation.) The period covers the end of the stock market boom in 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Only in those growing towns and suburbs at the region's periphery -- Mercer and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey, and Suffolk, Orange and Dutchess Counties in New York -- did the median income rise, as people moved to find bigger homes than they could afford closer to the city.
 ''Since 2001, incomes haven't kept pace with inflation, because we had slow job growth,'' said Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group.
 From 1998 to 2000, Long Island added more than 30,000 jobs a year, Dr. Kamer said, but since 2001, job growth on the Island has been just 7,000 a year. ''It's as if the suburbs hit a wall in terms of job growth,'' she said. 
 The median income masks a growing inequality in the region, as earnings for those at the top of the scale increased. There are more rich people in the region, and more poor people, than in 2000, but the middle has been squeezed. 
 The number of households making less than $50,000 increased 5.4 percent -- to 1.77 million from 1.68 million -- from 1999 to 2005. Similarly, the number making more than $200,000 grew 6.7 percent, to about 410,000 households in 2005 from about 384,000 in 2000.
 But the households in the middle -- those with family income from $50,000 to $200,000 -- contracted, falling to 2.54 million from 2.60 million.
 ''There was growing inequality between the haves and the have-nots -- those who got advanced education and skill levels, and those who didn't,'' Dr. Kamer said.
 This trend has brought benefits to some parts of the region. In Westchester, and in Fairfield County, Conn., home to many commuting Wall Street workers (and the growing hedge-fund industry in Fairfield itself), peak incomes are way up. The top 10 percent of earners in Fairfield made $343,000 or more in 2005, up from an inflation-adjusted figure of $268,000 in 1999.
 But for many others, income has not risen.
 ''Business has seen 16 or 18 straight quarters of double-digit profit increases,'' said James T. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Affairs at Rutgers University. ''That money isn't filtering down. Lower incomes are the result of minuscule new hiring and minuscule pay raises.''
 Recent national data indicate that wage increases have been more broadly distributed. In October, for the first time in four years, the average hourly wage outpaced inflation over the previous October, indicating that some outside the top echelons of income have begun to see their real incomes rise.

Loss of Young Workers
 The low rate of job growth comes at a time of extremely low unemployment in the region, which some economists say suggests that employers are having a hard time finding workers.
 Part of the explanation for that could be the striking decline in the number of regional residents in their 20s and 30s, another trend that emerged from this year's census release.
 In just five years, the number of people in the region who are 20 to 35 dropped from 2.41 million to 2.26 million. 
 Seth Forman, the acting executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said unemployment in Nassau and Suffolk Counties fell to 3.3 percent in October from 3.8 percent in October 2005, while the region gained 4,878 new jobs.
 ''This is not a high number of new jobs, of course,'' Mr. Forman said. ''But at 3.3 percent unemployment, there is a question as to just how many more jobs the region can add without pulling in significant numbers of workers from other regions, or increasing residential development.''
 Where are the young workers? There is evidence that some are moving farther from New York City. 
 Migration from the region to exurban places like Pike and Monroe Counties in northeastern Pennsylvania has increased in the last several years -- especially among young families who make about 30 percent less than the median income for the region, according to Internal Revenue Service data.
 And many are probably living in the city now. The fastest growing segment of commuters from 2000 to 2005 was reverse commuters, the census shows, those living in the city and taking trains or driving to the suburbs for jobs.
 ''One of the biggest growth areas on Metro-North is going north from Fordham Road in the Bronx to jobs in White Plains and elsewhere in Westchester,'' said Gerry Bogacz, director of planning for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council.
 But some workers are just leaving the region, which has experienced a net loss of taxpayers to Sun Belt destinations like central Florida. The median income of the people leaving is about half that of those staying in the region, the I.R.S. data show.
 ''Young people to Florida is part of the new New-York-to-Florida migration,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.

The Cost of Shelter
 A major culprit in the shortage of young workers is the high cost of housing. 
 From 2000 to 2005, the median price of homes in the region more than doubled, to $391,151 from $188,785, according to the census. What the data show is that people have stretched their incomes to get into homes. 
 According to the census, the number of homeowners in the region grew to 3.3 million in 2005 from 3.1 million in 2001. 
 But an increasing number of them are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the level that the federal government considers the limit of affordability. Property taxes grew, from a median of $4,800 to $5,800. And homeowners borrowed heavily, either to get into a more expensive home or to extract equity from the homes they already owned.
 That combination pushed the proportion of homeowners in the region who were spending upward of 30 percent of their income on housing to 38.2 percent in 2005 from 29.5 percent in 2000, the census data show. More ominously, the number of households paying 50 percent or more of their income for housing grew to 15.6 percent from 10.9 percent.
 ''It's eating up such a large share of homeowners' budgets now, and that may be untenable, particularly if their income is disrupted in any way,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. New buyers who put down little on their homes are especially vulnerable, Mr. Zandi said.
 Nationwide, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show, delinquencies on prime-rate mortgages rose in the second quarter of 2006, after four years of declines.

Retirees Staying Put
 While younger adults are leaving the region, retirees are not racing each other to the Sun Belt as they used to. 
 The segment of people in the region who are older than 75 swelled by 10 percent in five years, and providing appropriate health care, housing and other services for the elderly is a major concern for many families and a growing challenge for the suburbs. 
 ''There will be more people with the chronic diseases of aging,'' said Renee Pekmezaris, vice president for community health for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. ''We need to find better ways to manage this population at home, because that's where they're staying.''
 The number of regional residents 45 to 60 years old grew 24 percent -- to 1.44 million in 2005 from 1.16 million in 2000 -- setting off a boom in age-restricted apartments for empty nesters and retirees in New Jersey and Connecticut. Jane O'Connor, a consultant in Hawley, Mass., who specializes in over-55 housing developments, estimated that there are 200 such communities in Connecticut now, up from 50 in 2000.
 ''That's a hot part of the housing market, because it doesn't generate any schoolchildren,'' said Dr. Hughes of the public affairs school at Rutgers. Municipalities that once encouraged the development of offices because they generated commercial property taxes but not pollution are now encouraging the development of older-adult communities. 
 Ms. O'Connor said that such developments have been far less numerous in New York because the process of obtaining permits is more difficult.

The New Immigrant Wave
 The racial and ethnic makeup of the region is changing rapidly, as the white population shrinks and minority groups grow.
 Whites still constitute a majority in the suburban region, but the number of white residents dropped to 8.6 million in 2005 from 8.8 million in 2000. The 2005 total amounted to 66 percent of the region's population, down from 69 percent five years earlier.
 Most of the racial and ethnic demographic changes are being driven by recent immigrants. 
 With large numbers of people arriving from India, China and the Philippines, the Asian-American population has increased 29 percent in five years. And with tens of thousand of new Mexicans and Ecuadoreans, the Hispanic population has grown by 21 percent, according to the census.
 The African-American population in the region has also grown, but more modestly, about 6 percent.
 The bulk of new immigrants since 2000 have bypassed New York City, where previous immigrant waves entered to gain an economic foothold before dispersing across the region and the country.
 ''They're jumping over the urban centers, because there's work in the suburbs,'' said James Claffey, a board member of the Long Island Immigrant Alliance. ''It's simple, really: It's labor following capital.''
 The changes have led to friction in parts of the region.
 Several suburban communities have turned to ordinances and enforcement dragnets to try to banish Hispanic day laborers from gathering on street corners in search of jobs. And in Edison, tension between the police and the booming Indian community has set off protests and name-calling.
 ''Local municipalities are just beginning to grapple with their burgeoning immigrant populations,'' said Ryan Lilienthal, the acting director of the New Jersey Immigrant Policy Network, an immigrant advocacy group. ''Because they haven't been at it as long as the city, it's not always playing out as smoothly.''
 The immigrants have also begun to transform the region's schools, which are adopting new roles in assimilating them. In the process, many schools have had to shift from a historic mission of educating a largely affluent, white, English-speaking population.
 Now their responsibility includes many students whose native language is not English and who may also be financially disadvantaged. Helping them achieve the educational standards required of workers in a region that demands higher skills can be demanding.
 ''A lot of people being educated here cannot participate in this economy,'' said Joseph J. McGee of the Fairfield Business Council. ''It's hard to bring middle-income people into these areas, because even at a good salary of $60,000 to $80,000, they can't afford housing. So the indigenous labor force is your labor pool.''
 Dr. Kamer said: ''The jobs are there, but there's a structural mismatch. They don't have the job skills or the language skills, so there's the challenge of integrating them into the economic mainstream.''

HEADLINE: The Changing Face of the Suburbs

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
THE rich are getting richer, while most families in the region's suburbs have been losing economic ground since 1999.
 The suburbs are becoming increasingly diverse as Asian and Hispanic immigrants bypass New York City, traditionally the first stop for new arrivals.
And among those who commute between the suburbs and New York City, the trend is toward traveling in reverse: from homes in the city to jobs outside it. 
 These are among the changes that have taken place across the metropolitan region since 1999, according to an analysis of data released in bits and pieces by the Census Bureau over the last six months. 
 A review of the census data and other demographic information for Long Island, three counties in Connecticut, five in the Hudson Valley and 14 in northern and central New Jersey shows that the region is undergoing significant demographic change and other shifts. The data support some commonly held beliefs about income distribution, housing, and commuting. 
 For example, the cost of housing is consuming an increasingly higher percentage of household income. When that is coupled with a huge increase in home equity borrowing, a result is that many families are mortgaged to an extent unheard of just a few years ago. 
 Also, for most residents of the region's suburbs, taxes are rising faster than income.
 Instead of commuting to the city, an increasing number of suburban residents work closer to home. 
 And thousands of people are leaving the more affluent towns and suburbs close to New York City, bound for more affordable locales that may be a county away, or across the country. Many students from around the region who have gone off to college are not coming back, helping to turn the suburbs, increasingly, into a land of 50-somethings. 
 Jobs in the region are drifting to opposite ends of the income scale: Sharp declines in the number of people working in manufacturing and clerical jobs have been accompanied by modest increases in finance and professional work, and big jumps in lower-paid jobs like food service, maintenance and personal services.

Slumping Income
 From 1999 to 2005, the median household income in the region fell, dropping to $67,165 from $69,750 for households outside the city. (The 2000 census measured the level of income in 1999, and the numbers are adjusted for inflation.) The period covers the end of the stock market boom in 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Only in those growing towns and suburbs at the region's periphery -- Mercer and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey, and Suffolk, Orange and Dutchess Counties in New York -- did the median income rise, as people moved to find bigger homes than they could afford closer to the city.
 ''Since 2001, incomes haven't kept pace with inflation, because we had slow job growth,'' said Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group.
 From 1998 to 2000, Long Island added more than 30,000 jobs a year, Dr. Kamer said, but since 2001, job growth on the Island has been just 7,000 a year. ''It's as if the suburbs hit a wall in terms of job growth,'' she said. 
 The median income masks a growing inequality in the region, as earnings for those at the top of the scale increased. There are more rich people in the region, and more poor people, than in 2000, but the middle has been squeezed. 
 The number of households making less than $50,000 increased 5.4 percent -- to 1.77 million from 1.68 million -- from 1999 to 2005. Similarly, the number making more than $200,000 grew 6.7 percent, to about 410,000 households in 2005 from about 384,000 in 2000.
 But the households in the middle -- those with family income from $50,000 to $200,000 -- contracted, falling to 2.54 million from 2.60 million.
 ''There was growing inequality between the haves and the have-nots -- those who got advanced education and skill levels, and those who didn't,'' Dr. Kamer said.
 This trend has brought benefits to some parts of the region. In Westchester, and in Fairfield County, Conn., home to many commuting Wall Street workers (and the growing hedge-fund industry in Fairfield itself), peak incomes are way up. The top 10 percent of earners in Fairfield made $343,000 or more in 2005, up from an inflation-adjusted figure of $268,000 in 1999.
 But for many others, income has not risen.
 ''Business has seen 16 or 18 straight quarters of double-digit profit increases,'' said James T. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Affairs at Rutgers University. ''That money isn't filtering down. Lower incomes are the result of minuscule new hiring and minuscule pay raises.''
 Recent national data indicate that wage increases have been more broadly distributed. In October, for the first time in four years, the average hourly wage outpaced inflation over the previous October, indicating that some outside the top echelons of income have begun to see their real incomes rise.

Loss of Young Workers
 The low rate of job growth comes at a time of extremely low unemployment in the region, which some economists say suggests that employers are having a hard time finding workers.
 Part of the explanation for that could be the striking decline in the number of regional residents in their 20s and 30s, another trend that emerged from this year's census release.
 In just five years, the number of people in the region who are 20 to 35 dropped from 2.41 million to 2.26 million.

 Part of the explanation for that could be the striking decline in the number of regional residents in their 20s and 30s, another trend that emerged from this year's census release.
 In just five years, the number of people in the region who are 20 to 35 dropped from 2.41 million to 2.26 million. 
 Seth Forman, the acting executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said unemployment in Nassau and Suffolk Counties fell to 3.3 percent in October from 3.8 percent in October 2005, while the region gained 4,878 new jobs.
 ''This is not a high number of new jobs, of course,'' Mr. Forman said. ''But at 3.3 percent unemployment, there is a question as to just how many more jobs the region can add without pulling in significant numbers of workers from other regions, or increasing residential development.''
 Where are the young workers? There is evidence that some are moving farther from New York City. 
 Migration from the region to exurban places like Pike and Monroe Counties in northeastern Pennsylvania has increased in the last several years -- especially among young families who make about 30 percent less than the median income for the region, according to Internal Revenue Service data.
 And many are probably living in the city now. The fastest growing segment of commuters from 2000 to 2005 was reverse commuters, the census shows, those living in the city and taking trains or driving to the suburbs for jobs.
 ''One of the biggest growth areas on Metro-North is going north from Fordham Road in the Bronx to jobs in White Plains and elsewhere in Westchester,'' said Gerry Bogacz, director of planning for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council.
 But some workers are just leaving the region, which has experienced a net loss of taxpayers to Sun Belt destinations like central Florida. The median income of the people leaving is about half that of those staying in the region, the I.R.S. data show.
 ''Young people to Florida is part of the new New-York-to-Florida migration,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.

The Cost of Shelter
 A major culprit in the shortage of young workers is the high cost of housing. 
 From 2000 to 2005, the median price of homes in the region more than doubled, to $391,151 from $188,785, according to the census. What the data show is that people have stretched their incomes to get into homes. 
 According to the census, the number of homeowners in the region grew to 3.3 million in 2005 from 3.1 million in 2001. 
 But an increasing number of them are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the level that the federal government considers the limit of affordability. Property taxes grew, from a median of $4,800 to $5,800. And homeowners borrowed heavily, either to get into a more expensive home or to extract equity from the homes they already owned.
 That combination pushed the proportion of homeowners in the region who were spending upward of 30 percent of their income on housing to 38.2 percent in 2005 from 29.5 percent in 2000, the census data show. More ominously, the number of households paying 50 percent or more of their income for housing grew to 15.6 percent from 10.9 percent.
 ''It's eating up such a large share of homeowners' budgets now, and that may be untenable, particularly if their income is disrupted in any way,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. New buyers who put down little on their homes are especially vulnerable, Mr. Zandi said.
 Nationwide, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show, delinquencies on prime-rate mortgages rose in the second quarter of 2006, after four years of declines.

Retirees Staying Put
 While younger adults are leaving the region, retirees are not racing each other to the Sun Belt as they used to. 
 The segment of people in the region who are older than 75 swelled by 10 percent in five years, and providing appropriate health care, housing and other services for the elderly is a major concern for many families and a growing challenge for the suburbs. 
 ''There will be more people with the chronic diseases of aging,'' said Renee Pekmezaris, vice president for community health for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. ''We need to find better ways to manage this population at home, because that's where they're staying.''
 The number of regional residents 45 to 60 years old grew 24 percent -- to 1.44 million in 2005 from 1.16 million in 2000 -- setting off a boom in age-restricted apartments for empty nesters and retirees in New Jersey and Connecticut. Jane O'Connor, a consultant in Hawley, Mass., who specializes in over-55 housing developments, estimated that there are 200 such communities in Connecticut now, up from 50 in 2000.
 ''That's a hot part of the housing market, because it doesn't generate any schoolchildren,'' said Dr. Hughes of the public affairs school at Rutgers. Municipalities that once encouraged the development of offices because they generated commercial property taxes but not pollution are now encouraging the development of older-adult communities. 
 Ms. O'Connor said that such developments have been far less numerous in New York because the process of obtaining permits is more difficult.

The New Immigrant Wave
 The racial and ethnic makeup of the region is changing rapidly, as the white population shrinks and minority groups grow.
 Whites still constitute a majority in the suburban region, but the number of white residents dropped to 8.6 million in 2005 from 8.8 million in 2000. The 2005 total amounted to 66 percent of the region's population, down from 69 percent five years earlier.
 Most of the racial and ethnic demographic changes are being driven by recent immigrants. 
 With large numbers of people arriving from India, China and the Philippines, the Asian-American population has increased 29 percent in five years. And with tens of thousand of new Mexicans and Ecuadoreans, the Hispanic population has grown by 21 percent, according to the census.
 The African-American population in the region has also grown, but more modestly, about 6 percent.
 The bulk of new immigrants since 2000 have bypassed New York City, where previous immigrant waves entered to gain an economic foothold before dispersing across the region and the country.
 ''They're jumping over the urban centers, because there's work in the suburbs,'' said James Claffey, a board member of the Long Island Immigrant Alliance. ''It's simple, really: It's labor following capital.''
 The changes have led to friction in parts of the region.
 Several suburban communities have turned to ordinances and enforcement dragnets to try to banish Hispanic day laborers from gathering on street corners in search of jobs. And in Edison, N.J., tension between the police and the booming Indian community has set off protests and name-calling.
 ''Local municipalities are just beginning to grapple with their burgeoning immigrant populations,'' said Ryan Lilienthal, the acting director of the New Jersey Immigrant Policy Network, an immigrant advocacy group. ''Because they haven't been at it as long as the city, it's not always playing out as smoothly.''
 The immigrants have also begun to transform the region's schools, which are adopting new roles in assimilating them. In the process, many schools have had to shift from a historic mission of educating a largely affluent, white, English-speaking population.
 Now their responsibility includes many students whose native language is not English and who may also be financially disadvantaged. Helping them achieve the educational standards required of workers in a region that demands higher skills can be demanding.
 ''A lot of people being educated here cannot participate in this economy,'' said Joseph J. McGee of the Fairfield Business Council. ''It's hard to bring middle-income people into these areas, because even at a good salary of $60,000 to $80,000, they can't afford housing. So the indigenous labor force is your labor pool.''
 Dr. Kamer said: ''The jobs are there, but there's a structural mismatch. They don't have the job skills or the language skills, so there's the challenge of integrating them into the economic mainstream.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A chart with an article last Sunday about the changing demographics of the suburbs contained incorrect percentages for levels of education reported by the census in 2000 and 2005. In 2000, the proportion of the population over 25 with some college was 22.6 percent, not 28.1 percent. In 2005, the proportions in all groups were slightly higher than those reported: The proportion with less than a high school degree was 15.8 percent; the proportion with a high school degree was 27.7 percent; with some college, 23.7 percent; with a college degree, 19.3 percent; with a master's degree, 9.1 percent; with a professional degree, 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Globalization's Winners and Losers 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Still Flying High'' (editorial, Dec. 25):
 It is a distraction to cast the debate about America's economic future as an argument about ''free trade'' versus ''protectionism.'' The real challenge is whether the United States can ignore the erosion of its manufacturing capacity and still expect rapid innovation, high productivity growth and robust economic performance.
In this debate, the welcome news about Boeing's sale of 747s is Exhibit 1 for the argument that the United States needs a high-productivity-growth manufacturing sector to reap the benefits of globalization and trade. Boeing was positioned to respond competitively to revived demand with increased domestic production and strong exports. 
 In contrast, strong sales of electronics this holiday season will not have the same impact. These items are no longer produced here. The United States has given up industries capable of rapid innovation and productivity growth and has watched the trade deficit balloon out of control as suppliers move production out of the United States to meet the ''China price'' demanded by our large retailers.
 The debate we urgently need in 2007 is about the competitiveness of the United States economy as it allows its manufacturing capacity to erode.

To the Editor:
 The benefits of free trade are clear: larger markets, lower prices and a diversity of product choices, to name a few. 
 But the losers in free trade, including textile workers in North Carolina and garlic farmers in California, are just as evident.
 The answer to the losers does not rely in restricting trade; rather, what is needed is a social system of job training and equitable financial support that can sustain those who lose their jobs. 
 Job loss is inevitable as markets mature and consumer tastes change. It is unclear how a restricted trade regime that leads inevitably to higher prices, lower product diversity and smaller markets for companies like Boeing will help either the unemployed or society. 

David Abraham
Washington, Dec. 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 Looking for good news stories to help sell the benefits of free trade to American labor is as out of place as the Bush administration looking for good news stories to help sell the Iraqi war to the American people. Doing so is a form of denial that refuses to see the big picture.
 Countries engaged in free trade experience factor-price equalization: as price finds its equalization point, so will the cost of labor and capital. That's the big picture, and it's bad news for high-wage American labor whose wages will be seeking an equalization point with low-wage labor.
 The era of wage stagnation is upon us. A stronger social safety net can help mitigate the damage, but it can't stem the damage done by factor-price equalization. That job requires international economic standards that carry enforceable sanctions. One such standard should be the right for labor to associate. Otherwise, countries without it, like China, can more easily keep their labor wages from rising, which in turn puts even more downward pressure on high-wage countries.
 Enough denial about free trade; enough cherry-picking over isolated instances like the Boeing story. Say it loud: the era of wage stagnation is upon us. That's the big picture for labor in high-wage countries.

To the Editor:
 Boeing is a poor example to teach the general benefits of globalization. It is exceptional in every sense, being one of only two large civilian aircraft manufacturers in the world. Its recent success with the 747, moreover, is directly due to Airbus's getting tangled in its own wiring, delaying deliveries of its A380. Boeing's monopoly on very large jets for the next few years is therefore hardly a testament to the ''win-win'' of globalization.
 The central problem is that labor in an increasingly globalized environment is increasingly fungible. There is no fundamental solution to this other than wage equalization, probably a combination of lower wages here and higher wages overseas.

Andrei Moskowitz
New York, Dec. 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 When the United States has a government that's bought and paid for by the wealthiest 5 percent, how can we be surprised that while globalization has bolstered the economy, ''the benefits in this country have gone disproportionately to the wealthy''?
 So to claim that government needs to provide for ''a stronger safety net for workers cut loose in the upheaval of a changing economy,'' and that the United States ''needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs'' is disingenuous at best.
 What's the answer? Change the game. Those in the middle class have to learn to become savvy investors, and in this respect they must transform themselves. If the ''game'' no longer works because you're in a ''losing'' position, change the game! I'm betting on the ingenuity of the United States middle class.

Richie Kessler
Vieques, P.R., Dec. 25, 2006

To the Editor:
 You are right: ''The United States needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs.''
 Readers might remember our nation's last major ''ideological conflict.'' During and after World War II, the top income tax bracket was 91 percent.
 Returning to such a system would accomplish both your objectives. It would help pay for health care, education and countless other needs. In addition, it would restrain the obscenely high compensation of many corporate executives and other believers in ''greed is good,'' and reduce the alarming gap between the haves and the have-nots.

HEADLINE: A New Year for School Reform

 BODY:
The No Child Left Behind Act broke new ground when it required the states to educate impoverished children up to the same standards as their affluent counterparts, in exchange for federal aid. The law did not just drop out of the sky. It represented a deliberate attempt by Congress to ratify and accelerate the school reform effort that swept the country in the early 1990's, when the states began to embrace standards-based accountability systems that quickly showed promising results.
 The achievement gains have fallen far short of what Congress hoped for when it passed the landmark federal law -- and also far short of what the country needs to keep pace with its economic rivals. In addition, student performance has flattened in recent years. In many cases, that is because states that reaped all of the early, easy gains that are typically achieved by merely paying attention to a long-neglected problem failed to do the tougher work necessary to sustain their reforms. 
Recent studies offer sobering news about the challenges that lie ahead. Happily, there is also encouraging news from the states that have stayed the course and continued to build rigorous, standards-based reforms. 
 The value of the standards movement itself was underscored this year in an analysis that was part of Education Week magazine's annual survey of student achievement. Analyzing student performance between 1992 and 2005, the study found clear signs of progress, especially in fourth-grade math performance, which had gone up nearly two grade levels since 1992. Black and Hispanic students, by the way, showed larger gains than their white counterparts over that same period. Had the scores of white students not risen at all, the progress by black and Hispanic students would have substantially erased the white-minority achievement gap.
 The news was less heartening in reading performance, which inched up only about two points over the same time period. Even so, Education Week found that reading achievement for black, Hispanic and low-income fourth graders had risen at nearly three times the national average.
 Low-income students still lag far behind their affluent counterparts. But the data in a subsequent study by the Fordham Foundation shows that states that commit to rigorous standards and accountability systems can make progress in this difficult area. The bad news is that only eight states even achieved what Fordham described as ''moderate progress.'' 
 Those states are: Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington and California. In California especially, statewide reforms (and, in Los Angeles, dynamic leadership by the former superintendent, Roy Romer) are clearly having an effect. These gains are tentative and will certainly evaporate if the states lose momentum. But they show that performance for low-income students can be nudged upward if states hew to rigorous reforms. 
 That bad news is that too few states are actually doing that. 
 With the easy achievement gains already behind us, the next level of progress will require rigorous systemic change. The states, for example, will need to adopt rigorous examinations that track the federal test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, more closely. They will have to crack down on state teachers colleges that turn out poor graduates, and devise ways -- including differential pay -- to persuade highly qualified teachers to work in failing schools that they have historically avoided. To move forward, the country must also find new ways to support and transform failing schools, beyond labeling them failures and presuming that the stigma will inspire better performance.
 These are difficult issues. But they are the ones that Congress needs to focus on as it moves toward reauthorizing No Child Left Behind.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face of the Suburbs

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
THE rich are getting richer, while most families in the region's suburbs have been losing economic ground since 1999.
 The suburbs are becoming increasingly diverse as Asian and Hispanic immigrants bypass New York City, traditionally the first stop for new arrivals.
And among those who commute between the suburbs and New York City, the trend is toward traveling in reverse: from homes in the city to jobs outside it. 
 These are among the changes that have taken place across the metropolitan region since 1999, according to an analysis of data released in bits and pieces by the Census Bureau over the last six months. 
 A review of the census data and other demographic information for Long Island, three counties in Connecticut, five in the Hudson Valley and 14 in northern and central New Jersey shows that the region is undergoing significant demographic change and other shifts. The data support some commonly held beliefs about income distribution, housing, and commuting. 
 For example, the cost of housing is consuming an increasingly higher percentage of household income. When that is coupled with a huge increase in home equity borrowing, a result is that many families are mortgaged to an extent unheard of just a few years ago. 
 Also, for most residents of the region's suburbs, taxes are rising faster than income.
 Instead of commuting to the city, an increasing number of suburban residents work closer to home. 
 And thousands of people are leaving the more affluent towns and suburbs close to New York City, bound for more affordable locales that may be a county away, or across the country. Many students from around the region who have gone off to college are not coming back, helping to turn the suburbs, increasingly, into a land of 50-somethings. 
 Jobs in the region are drifting to opposite ends of the income scale: Sharp declines in the number of people working in manufacturing and clerical jobs have been accompanied by modest increases in finance and professional work, and big jumps in lower-paid jobs like food service, maintenance and personal services.

Slumping Income
 From 1999 to 2005, the median household income in the region fell, dropping to $67,165 from $69,750 for households outside the city. (The 2000 census measured the level of income in 1999, and the numbers are adjusted for inflation.) The period covers the end of the stock market boom in 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Only in those growing towns and suburbs at the region's periphery -- Mercer and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey, and Suffolk, Orange and Dutchess Counties in New York -- did the median income rise, as people moved to find bigger homes than they could afford closer to the city.
 ''Since 2001, incomes haven't kept pace with inflation, because we had slow job growth,'' said Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group.
 From 1998 to 2000, Long Island added more than 30,000 jobs a year, Dr. Kamer said, but since 2001, job growth on the Island has been just 7,000 a year. ''It's as if the suburbs hit a wall in terms of job growth,'' she said. 
 The median income masks a growing inequality in the region, as earnings for those at the top of the scale increased. There are more rich people in the region, and more poor people, than in 2000, but the middle has been squeezed. 
 The number of households making less than $50,000 increased 5.4 percent -- to 1.77 million from 1.68 million -- from 1999 to 2005. Similarly, the number making more than $200,000 grew 6.7 percent, to about 410,000 households in 2005 from about 384,000 in 2000.
 But the households in the middle -- those with family income from $50,000 to $200,000 -- contracted, falling to 2.54 million from 2.60 million.
 ''There was growing inequality between the haves and the have-nots -- those who got advanced education and skill levels, and those who didn't,'' Dr. Kamer said.
 This trend has brought benefits to some parts of the region. In Westchester, and in Fairfield County, Conn., home to many commuting Wall Street workers (and the growing hedge-fund industry in Fairfield itself), peak incomes are way up. The top 10 percent of earners in Fairfield made $343,000 or more in 2005, up from an inflation-adjusted figure of $268,000 in 1999.
 But for many others, income has not risen.
 ''Business has seen 16 or 18 straight quarters of double-digit profit increases,'' said James T. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Affairs at Rutgers University. ''That money isn't filtering down. Lower incomes are the result of minuscule new hiring and minuscule pay raises.''
 Recent national data indicate that wage increases have been more broadly distributed. In October, for the first time in four years, the average hourly wage outpaced inflation over the previous October, indicating that some outside the top echelons of income have begun to see their real incomes rise.

Loss of Young Workers
 The low rate of job growth comes at a time of extremely low unemployment in the region, which some economists say suggests that employers are having a hard time finding workers.
 Part of the explanation for that could be the striking decline in the number of regional residents in their 20s and 30s, another trend that emerged from this year's census release.
 In just five years, the number of people in the region who are 20 to 35 dropped from 2.41 million to 2.26 million. 
 Seth Forman, the acting executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said unemployment in Nassau and Suffolk Counties fell to 3.3 percent in October from 3.8 percent in October 2005, while the region gained 4,878 new jobs.
 ''This is not a high number of new jobs, of course,'' Mr. Forman said. ''But at 3.3 percent unemployment, there is a question as to just how many more jobs the region can add without pulling in significant numbers of workers from other regions, or increasing residential development.''
 Where are the young workers? There is evidence that some are moving farther from New York City. 
 Migration from the region to exurban places like Pike and Monroe Counties in northeastern Pennsylvania has increased in the last several years -- especially among young families who make about 30 percent less than the median income for the region, according to Internal Revenue Service data.
 And many are probably living in the city now. The fastest growing segment of commuters from 2000 to 2005 was reverse commuters, the census shows, those living in the city and taking trains or driving to the suburbs for jobs.
 ''One of the biggest growth areas on Metro-North is going north from Fordham Road in the Bronx to jobs in White Plains and elsewhere in Westchester,'' said Gerry Bogacz, director of planning for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council.
 But some workers are just leaving the region, which has experienced a net loss of taxpayers to Sun Belt destinations like central Florida. The median income of the people leaving is about half that of those staying in the region, the I.R.S. data show.
 ''Young people to Florida is part of the new New-York-to-Florida migration,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.

The Cost of Shelter
 A major culprit in the shortage of young workers is the high cost of housing. 
 From 2000 to 2005, the median price of homes in the region more than doubled, to $391,151 from $188,785, according to the census. What the data show is that people have stretched their incomes to get into homes. 
 According to the census, the number of homeowners in the region grew to 3.3 million in 2005 from 3.1 million in 2001. 
 But an increasing number of them are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the level that the federal government considers the limit of affordability. Property taxes grew, from a median of $4,800 to $5,800. And homeowners borrowed heavily, either to get into a more expensive home or to extract equity from the homes they already owned.
 That combination pushed the proportion of homeowners in the region who were spending upward of 30 percent of their income on housing to 38.2 percent in 2005 from 29.5 percent in 2000, the census data show. More ominously, the number of households paying 50 percent or more of their income for housing grew to 15.6 percent from 10.9 percent.
 ''It's eating up such a large share of homeowners' budgets now, and that may be untenable, particularly if their income is disrupted in any way,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. New buyers who put down little on their homes are especially vulnerable, Mr. Zandi said.
 Nationwide, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show, delinquencies on prime-rate mortgages rose in the second quarter of 2006, after four years of declines.

Retirees Staying Put
 While younger adults are leaving the region, retirees are not racing each other to the Sun Belt as they used to. 
 The segment of people in the region who are older than 75 swelled by 10 percent in five years, and providing appropriate health care, housing and other services for the elderly is a major concern for many families and a growing challenge for the suburbs. 
 ''There will be more people with the chronic diseases of aging,'' said Renee Pekmezaris, vice president for community health for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. ''We need to find better ways to manage this population at home, because that's where they're staying.''
 The number of regional residents 45 to 60 years old grew 24 percent -- to 1.44 million in 2005 from 1.16 million in 2000 -- setting off a boom in age-restricted apartments for empty nesters and retirees in New Jersey and Connecticut. Jane O'Connor, a consultant in Hawley, Mass., who specializes in over-55 housing developments, estimated that there are 200 such communities in Connecticut now, up from 50 in 2000.
 ''That's a hot part of the housing market, because it doesn't generate any schoolchildren,'' said Dr. Hughes of the public affairs school at Rutgers. Municipalities that once encouraged the development of offices because they generated commercial property taxes but not pollution are now encouraging the development of older-adult communities. 
 Ms. O'Connor said that such developments have been far less numerous in New York because the process of obtaining permits is more difficult.

The New Immigrant Wave
 The racial and ethnic makeup of the region is changing rapidly, as the white population shrinks and minority groups grow.
 Whites still constitute a majority in the suburban region, but the number of white residents dropped to 8.6 million in 2005 from 8.8 million in 2000. The 2005 total amounted to 66 percent of the region's population, down from 69 percent five years earlier.
 Most of the racial and ethnic demographic changes are being driven by recent immigrants. 
 With large numbers of people arriving from India, China and the Philippines, the Asian-American population has increased 29 percent in five years. And with tens of thousand of new Mexicans and Ecuadoreans, the Hispanic population has grown by 21 percent, according to the census.
 The African-American population in the region has also grown, but more modestly, about 6 percent.
 The bulk of new immigrants since 2000 have bypassed New York City, where previous immigrant waves entered to gain an economic foothold before dispersing across the region and the country.
 ''They're jumping over the urban centers, because there's work in the suburbs,'' said James Claffey, a board member of the Long Island Immigrant Alliance. ''It's simple, really: It's labor following capital.''
 The changes have led to friction in parts of the region.
 Several suburban communities have turned to ordinances and enforcement dragnets to try to banish Hispanic day laborers from gathering on street corners in search of jobs. And in Edison, N.J., tension between the police and the booming Indian community has set off protests and name-calling.
 ''Local municipalities are just beginning to grapple with their burgeoning immigrant populations,'' said Ryan Lilienthal, the acting director of the New Jersey Immigrant Policy Network, an immigrant advocacy group. ''Because they haven't been at it as long as the city, it's not always playing out as smoothly.''
 The immigrants have also begun to transform the region's schools, which are adopting new roles in assimilating them. In the process, many schools have had to shift from a historic mission of educating a largely affluent, white, English-speaking population.
 Now their responsibility includes many students whose native language is not English and who may also be financially disadvantaged. Helping them achieve the educational standards required of workers in a region that demands higher skills can be demanding.
 ''A lot of people being educated here cannot participate in this economy,'' said Joseph J. McGee of the Fairfield Business Council. ''It's hard to bring middle-income people into these areas, because even at a good salary of $60,000 to $80,000, they can't afford housing. So the indigenous labor force is your labor pool.''
 Dr. Kamer said: ''The jobs are there, but there's a structural mismatch. They don't have the job skills or the language skills, so there's the challenge of integrating them into the economic mainstream.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A chart with an article last Sunday about the changing demographics of the suburbs contained incorrect percentages for levels of education reported by the census in 2000 and 2005. In 2005, the proportion of the population over 25 with some college was 22.6 percent, not 28.1 percent. In 2000, the proportions in all groups were slightly higher than those reported: The proportion with less than a high school degree was 15.8 percent; the proportion with a high school degree was 27.7 percent; with some college, 23.7 percent; with a college degree, 19.3 percent; with a master's degree, 9.1 percent; with a professional degree, 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: The Bleeding-Heart Rationalist: WILLIAM C. NORRIS b. 1911

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN

 BODY:
William Norris was a can-do optimist whose faith in human goodness would have played well in a feel-good movie, but his Capra-esque worldview complicated his career in business.
Norris grew up a farm boy in Nebraska, served as a code breaker in the U.S. Navy and was the founder of Control Data Corporation, the Minnesota-based company, now defunct, which at one time was the nation's fourth-largest computer-manufacturing concern. Control Data, under Norris's leadership, originated the so-called supercomputer, beating out I.B.M. and other competitors. The firm was smaller than many of its rivals and decidedly less conventionally structured. Its lead engineer, a genius named Seymour Cray, perfected the supercomputer by secluding himself and his team -- with Norris's permission -- in the small Wisconsin town of Chippewa Falls, where his bosses could visit him only after requesting and being granted permission. 
 Cray's largely unsupervised endeavors often took longer than they were supposed to, but Norris was patient and forbearing. Thomas J. Watson Jr., the head of I.B.M., which was famed for its militaristic corporate culture, was incredulous over Norris's operation. So lean, so ragtag, so bafflingly humane. In a 1963 memo, Watson wondered how Control Data achieved with just a few dozen people what he had not with several thousand. Control Data later went on to defend its supercomputer innovation in an antitrust suit against Big Blue. It prevailed and won a settlement of $600 million.
 But the advantage the company gained was temporary. By the '80s, the firm lost its edge in pricing and engineering, and as the market turned away from massive mainframes to personal computers, the company shrank, disintegrated and failed. 
 The blame for this failure fell on Norris, who was widely charged with neglecting his business interests in favor of his social ideals. The man was not some dispassionate nerd. Far from it. By harnessing the financial resources of a major modern corporation to his somewhat rustic notions of the greater good, he hoped to make the world a better place. What's more, he believed that his efforts could be profitable -- not immediately but eventually. This isn't exactly a controversial idea now, in the age of Starbucks, Newman's Own and other merchants of commercial virtue, but in Norris's era it was heresy. 
 A partial list of Norris's corporate projects conveys the essence of his character. He was a shade-tree mechanic, a tinkerer, who proceeded one inspiration at a time. For starters, he located Control Data's production plants in riot-torn inner cities and poor small towns. He built some of America's first wind farms. He started agricultural projects in Alaska. He spent a billion dollars on a computer-based education system, offered his workers the benefit of corporate day care for their children -- unheard-of at the time -- and even financed a program to lease automobiles to former prison inmates. He did a lot of other things too, and what his ideas had in common was mostly this: They cost a lot of money up front and they promised unspecified dividends ... maybe someday. In the meantime, they merely helped people live their lives.
 But Norris, the bleeding-heart rationalist, was a mutation. And though, in the end, his environment got the best of him, for a while he got the best of it. In retirement, he founded an institute that promoted education and small-business growth. He may also have inspired a few successors and pushed evolution in a new direction. Bill Gates's midcareer turn toward global philanthropy is reminiscent of Norris at his loftiest: the utilitarian redeemer. Because who really cares now that Control Data's computers were superseded by other firms' devices? Yes, in the field of data processing, the race may be to the swiftest, but the world has other fields. The one that Norris ran first in was all his own.

 BODY:
Stocks finished 2006 on a high note. Though they slipped a bit on Friday, the Dow Jones industrials ended the year up 16.3 percent and less than 50 points from their record high of 12,510.57 reached on Wednesday. 
 Most of the market gains came in the last half of the year, as oil prices started to retreat from their record highs, signs began to appear that the worst of the housing slump may have passed and the Federal Reserve stopped raising short-term interest rates.
On Friday, shares of Apple Computer rose nearly 5 percent on news that the company had exonerated its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, of any wrongdoing in a stock options backdating inquiry.
 The stock markets will be closed tomorrow for New Year's Day and on Tuesday for a national day of mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford.
 For the week, the Dow rose 119.93 points, or 1.0 percent, to close at 12,463.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.54 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,418.30. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 14.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,415.29. The Nasdaq finished the year 9.5 percent higher, and the S.& P. 500 ended 2006 up 13.6 percent.
 The 10-year Treasury note's yield rose to 4.70 percent from 4.62 percent a week earlier. JUSTON JONES

HEADLINE: New York, Where the Dreamers Are Asleep

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
NEW YORK, get ready. You are thriving and growing, but aging. Adjust, modernize, it's later than you think.
 So advised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently, predicting that by 2030, the city will be home to another million people -- 9.2 million New Yorkers clogging already congested streets, overtaxing energy supplies, burdening services. Plan for the future now, said the mayor, promising details later.
The mayor's warnings drew a ho-hum reaction from a tough public focused on daily survival rather than problems a quarter-century away. But the suspicion here is that even if Mr. Bloomberg tried to plan ambitiously for 2010, New Yorkers would cast a skeptical eye. 
 The city that once lived to dazzle seems no longer able to think big or much past tomorrow. That was for its optimistic youth, when dreamers built Central Park, the marvel of a subway system, the wonder that is the Brooklyn Bridge and an advanced network of reservoirs and water tunnels. A younger New York dared to stage a World's Fair in the shadow of the Depression.
 But the bills came due, bankruptcy loomed, President Gerald R. Ford threatened to leave the city in the lurch and the place turned practical. Today's New Yorkers want to know what something costs and who will pay. Turning landfill into a park, or building a new basketball arena and apartment-retail complex in Brooklyn if private dollars foot a healthy part of the bill -- fine. Risking citywide gridlock to impress the world by playing host to the Olympics? Not so fine. 
 It's not as if the mayor's goal of moving traffic and keeping the lights on are utopian concepts. But the public has learned that New York does not follow a script. 
 The first plan for reviving a blighted Times Square goes back to the late 1970s. But one plan gave way to another for more than 20 years, until the market took over and created today's tourist and entertainment magnet.
 Westway was a bold government plan in the 1970s to build an underground interstate highway along the Hudson, with housing, commercial development and parks built above. After a decade of legal battles, the government abandoned Westway, and today, to get to waterfront parks later built downtown, pedestrians must navigate dense traffic.
 In ''Our Changing City,'' a series of articles in this newspaper in 1955, officials envisioned a civic plaza in downtown Brooklyn that Robert Moses promised would rival the Piazza San Marco in Venice; a grandiose development over the Sunnyside rail yards in Queens; and a Palace of Progress devoted to world trade atop a new Pennsylvania Station. All that and a Second Avenue subway.
 Didn't happen. Other things that few anticipated did: the recovery of the South Bronx, the gentrification of Harlem, the drop in crime, sturdy growth in the immigrant population, now approaching record levels. Where is the expert who knew that Internet businesses would replace garment factories, that newspapers would fall on hard times, that the meatpacking district would develop cachet, that coffee houses would dominate every corner?
 And then there is the starkest example of the unexpected -- Sept. 11 and the city's arc from devastation to renewal.
 Projections can go awry, based as they are on assumptions sometimes trumped by the unforeseen. Population predictions are especially tricky, because they can be affected by factors like national and foreign policies, economic swings and politics. 
 In 1929, the Regional Plan Association predicted that the city would grow to 11.3 million people by 1965 (the figure turned out to be 7.7 million) and that the population in the metropolitan region would double to 20 million over 1,000 square miles. The region grew to 17 million over 2,000 square miles; the association attributed this to a failure to improve the railways.
 The city's population has had a way of taking on a life of its own. Zoning consultants in the 1960s advised city officials that New York's population would grow to 8.5 million in 1975 -- it may well have if not for the fiscal crisis that was at its worst in 1975. Instead, the numbers dropped so sharply -- to 7.2 million in 1980 from 8 million in 1970 -- that some social scientists advocated ''planned shrinkage'' in city services. 
 Then, as if overnight, the city began growing again, to 7.6 million people by 1990, and to more than 8 million in another 10 years -- an increase that was also unanticipated. The public schools in some neighborhoods, instead of needing cuts, had to create annexes in prefabricated trailers. 
 What happened? Washington passed the liberalized Immigration Act of 1965, which encouraged greater immigration. At the same time, baby boomers began having children, and the city was recovering, so more people who might have left for the suburbs stayed.
 Now Mr. Bloomberg anticipates more growth, based on city projections of factors like current birth and mortality rates, and aging, migration and disease patterns. 
 The analysis anticipates, for instance, that Staten Island and Queens will continue to outpace the other boroughs, as they have for years, attracting New Yorkers who might otherwise head to the suburbs. The city's demographers also expect immigration to continue at a healthy clip, and that people will continue to live long lives. 
 They could be wrong about any of their assumptions. Maybe Congress will quell immigration and build more walls. Maybe an economic downturn will stall housing development and people will leave for the suburbs instead of moving to Rego Park. Maybe mortality rates will change.
 All possible, said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division. ''Are our projections reasonable?'' he said. ''Absolutely. Accurate? We'll have to wait until events unfold. It doesn't mean you don't go ahead and plan for the future.'' 
 Especially since the future is now. Traffic is already congested, blackouts are increasingly common, the parks too crowded, the air too dirty. It could be that the mayor didn't generate any excitement with his 2030 announcement because New Yorkers, a practical lot, as noted, don't see the big deal about their city retooling -- as long as Mr. Bloomberg keeps his promise to tell them what it will cost and who pays.

HEADLINE: Moderate? Conservative? With Gerald Ford, Take Your Pick

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LYNDON JOHNSON in 1973. Richard Nixon in 1994. Ronald Reagan in 2004.
 The last three former presidents to die dominated the world stage. They bent history to their will, for better or worse, and became the subjects of a crowded shelf of biographies. For the writers of memorials and obituaries, they were easy.
Not so Gerald R. Ford, who served only 29 months, never won a national election, and was constricted by an overwhelmingly hostile Congress. He is remembered mainly for the pardon of his predecessor, an act that ultimately doomed his bid for re-election. 
 Yet the public ritual surrounding the death of a former president demands a period of public rumination, and partisans across the political spectrum have been finding substance to admire in Mr. Ford. 
 There are, of course, the common sentiments that he was a decent, humble, calming leader at a precarious time. But peering back at his modest and often overlooked legacy many have also found elements in concert with their own views, variously honoring him as an icon of moderate Republicanism, a conservative budget hawk, an accidental apostle of Reaganism, a critic of the Iraq war and a proponent of gay rights.
 ''You can pick and choose,'' said Richard Norton Smith, the historian and former director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. ''The Ford presidency is a very good example of how history is argument without end, and the thing is, that we haven't had this argument until recently because we are so mesmerized by Nixon. Historians have always tended to look at the Ford presidency as a kind of coda, the un-expired Nixon term.''
 For those who never thought highly of him, the change in tone was striking. An online column last week in the left-leaning Nation magazine, which railed against Mr. Ford's pardon of former President Nixon, commended President Bush for being ''appropriately respectful'' toward Mr. Ford. 
 The column urged Mr. Bush to heed Mr. Ford's criticism of the Iraq war, made during a 2004 interview with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post reported after the former president's death. ''I just don't think we should go hellfire damnation around the globe freeing people, unless it is directly related to our own national security,'' Mr. Ford was quoted as saying. 
 In television coverage of his death, the Iraq war comments soon received as much attention as anything he did in office. ''He was atrocious at P.R. when he was president, but getting the Woodward interview released after his death was a pretty savvy P.R. move on Ford's part,'' said Franklin Foer, editor of The New Republic, who added that the magazine did not plan any Ford coverage because of a holiday printing schedule. ''I don't exactly consider it the most momentous event in the history of the republic.''
 The conservative National Review has scorned Mr. Ford for 30 years as the wishy-washy establishment Republican who beat back Mr. Reagan's conservative 1976 primary challenge. Conservatives disdained Mr. Ford for what they considered his too tolerant approach to the Soviet Union and for naming Nelson Rockefeller as his vice president.
 But on the National Review's Web site last week several conservatives stretched to admire their former bete noire. Some praised Mr. Ford for at least trying to veto 66 Democratic bills, even though the Democratic majority in Congress usually overrode them. Paul Kengor, a professor at Grove City College in Pennsylvania, credited Mr. Ford with ''paving the way for Reagan'' by ''giving detente a chance, and thus an opportunity to show its true colors.'' And Lee Edwards, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, thanked Mr. Ford for nominating Mr. Rockefeller because it infuriated conservatives into forming the New Right.
 ''It's like congratulating the Soviets for the Marshall Plan,'' Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor at the National Review, said in an interview. ''In fairness to Ford,'' he added, looking for praise, ''I have never seen him on a list of the worst presidents.''
 Socially moderate Republicans, in contrast, have embraced President Ford in death as the champion of their vision of the party. ''Jerry believed this party was about a right to be left alone,'' said former Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a friend of Mr. Ford's, arguing that the Republicans' losses in the last election sent a message to return to smaller government and stop emphasizing social issues like abortion restrictions. 
 After Mr. Ford died, Charles Francis, a friend of President Bush who founded a group to welcome gay voters in the Republican Party, circulated a private letter from Mr. Ford supporting gay rights. Mr. Ford eventually decided to join the group and publicly supported legally recognizing gay unions. The Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay Republicans, called Mr. Ford ''a great man'' who will be remembered ''for acting as a force for tolerance.''
 There was a time, shortly after President Bush's election in 2000, when some of his critics murmured that he was bringing back the Ford White House, noting the return of three prominent veterans of the Ford administration: Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 
 Six years ago, David Frum, a former Bush speech writer, leapt to the president's defense, arguing in The Weekly Standard that the administration's philosophy and personnel drew more heavily from the Reagan White House. ''Ford was not a success in office,'' Mr. Frum wrote, repeating the columnist Nicholas von Hoffman's observation that Ford's destiny was ''to vex generations of schoolchildren yet unborn with the question whether it was he or Martin Van Buren who fought the French and Indian War.''
 In an interview last week, however, Mr. Frum offered a more sympathetic appraisal, describing Mr. Ford as essentially a Reaganite in fiscal matters and noting that he appointed Alan Greenspan to head his Council of Economic Advisers. ''It is very hard to be a great president when the opposition party has not only two-thirds of the votes in Congress but is on an ideological binge,'' Mr. Frum said.
 The liberal American Prospect chose to highlight another influential Ford decision -- his nomination of John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court -- when it posted an article on its Web site last week that its editor Harold Meyerson wrote last summer. Mr. Meyerson noted that it was Justice Stevens who wrote both the dissent in Bush v. Gore, the case that put Mr. Bush in the White House, and the majority opinion in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the case that rejected the Bush administration's use of military tribunals or torture to handle military detainees. 
 ''Ford is one lucky former president, that Stevens, in his mid-80s, has emerged as the leading voice and most effective force in defense of the American democratic system,'' Mr. Meyerson wrote. ''Instead of just having a forgettable presidency and bequeathing the nation two of the most dangerous thugs ever to hold high office,'' he continued, referring to Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Ford's legacy ''is at least self-negating.''
 Historians say it is misleading to judge President Ford by any of the standards of contemporary politics since he operated in a very different context, before the rise of supply-side arguments about tax cuts, social issues like abortion or gay rights, or the rise of radical Islamic terrorism. What is now called ''moderate'' was then called ''establishment'' in the Republic Party.
 Mr. Smith, the former director of the Ford library and now head of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said President Ford was an old school limited-government conservative: ''He didn't want government in the classroom, he didn't want it in the board room, and he didn't want it in the bedroom.'' 
 In some ways, Mr. Brookhiser of the National Review said, the efforts to memorialize the Ford presidency recall the challenges caricaturists once faced drawing his plain, handsome, even-featured face. ''He was the hardest president for cartoonists.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last week about different interpretations of the presidency of Gerald R. Ford from across the political spectrum misstated the frequency with which Congress overrode his vetoes. Mr. Ford used his veto power 66 times and his vetoes were overridden 12 times. His vetoes were not ''usually overriden.''

Iraq Riveted by Execution
After nearly three decades of living with the brutal repression of Saddam Hussein and the violent aftermath of his overthrow by American troops, Iraq responded with a mixture of rejoicing, violence and muted reflection to the news that their former dictator had been hanged in one of the grimmest of his own execution chambers. 1

Saddam Hussein never bowed his head, until his neck snapped, several of the witnesses present at his execution said. 
His last words were equally defiant: ''Down with the traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.'' 1

After the hanging of Saddam Hussein, Western politicians sought a cautious balance between revulsion at his record, support for his executioners and concern at the use of a death penalty they shun in their own countries. 12

Battle Looms in Somalia
A phalanx of Ethiopian tanks and armored personnel carriers chugged toward Kismayo, the last city occupied by Somalia's diminished Islamist movement, witnesses said, while the Islamists inside the city dug in and vowed never to surrender. 4

Starvation and Obesity in India
Presenting a confounding portrait of child health in India, new research finds that despite the recent economic advances, India's share of malnourished children remains among the worst in the world even as public health officials confront what they call alarming levels of childhood obesity. 8

Israel's Growing Economy
Israel, it seems, has figured out how to keep its economy charging forward, regardless of political turmoil and spasms of violence. This was Israel's third straight year of strong growth. The stock market has been hitting record highs, and unemployment is at a 10-year low. 3

HEADLINE: Amid Political Upheaval, Israeli Economy Stays Healthy

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
For Israel, it has been a typically tumultuous year: Ariel Sharon, then the prime minister, collapsed into a coma on Jan. 4, the radical Islamic group Hamas won Palestinian elections later that month, and Israel fought a monthlong war in Lebanon this summer.
 But despite the political turmoil and spasms of violence, Israel, it seems, has figured out how to keep its economy charging forward.
 It was the country's third straight year of strong growth, with the economy expanding nearly 5 percent. The stock market has been hitting record highs; unemployment is at a 10-year low. Israel's central bank is lowering interest rates to 4.5 percent on Jan. 1, putting them well below rates in the United States, an almost unprecedented development. The Israeli shekel is trading at 4.2 to the dollar, its strongest level in five years. 
 Further, Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, paid $4 billion for an Israeli company, and Donald Trump is developing a 70-story luxury residential tower on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. 
 ''Israelis look at the economy, and they've essentially been through these disturbances in the past, and they know the economy is pretty robust and it tends to come back,'' said Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel. ''Things that happen here have a smaller impact on markets than I think they would abroad.'' 
 While the Israeli economy has been thriving, the Palestinian economy has moved in the opposite direction, contracting by an estimated 10 to 15 percent this year, according to the Palestine Monetary Authority. 
 For Israel, the business that best illustrates the economy's resilience this year is the company Mr. Buffett bought, Iscar Metalworking Company, a global leader in the manufacture of precision metal-cutting tools.
 In May, Mr. Buffet bought 80 percent of the company, which has its headquarters on an isolated hilltop in northern Israel that offers a panoramic view of the nearby border with Lebanon. 
 Barely two months later, a cross-border raid by Hezbollah guerrillas ignited 34 days of fighting that pushed Israeli troops into Lebanon and drew heavy rocket barrages against northern Israel.
 One rocket slammed into the Tefen Industrial Park, where Iscar is situated, causing minor damage to a building belonging to another company. Many more rockets crashed nearby during the weeks of war.
 Many Iscar workers moved their families away from the border region, but the company maintained production, with only occasional slowdowns.
 ''It took us a brief time to adjust, but we didn't miss a single shipment,'' said Eitan Wertheimer, Iscar's chairman. ''For our customers around the world, there was no war.''
 The northern city of Haifa came under almost daily rocket attacks, and ships stopped entering Haifa's port, the country's largest. Some exporters shipped their goods by air at much higher expense in order to meet deadlines.
 The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which has been setting records throughout the year, seemingly shrugged off the war; it was slightly higher at the end of the conflict in August than before it started in July.
 At the beginning of the year, Israel's economy was forecast to grow at around 5.5 percent, and will come in at about 4.8 percent, according to Mr. Fischer, who attributed the dip to the war.
 The Palestinian economy, meanwhile, has been devastated. During the peace talks of the 1990s, the Israelis and Palestinians increased cooperation, and by 2000, both sides were growing rapidly and nearly 150,000 Palestinians entered Israel daily. Most were workers who accounted for a large slice of the Palestinian economy.
 When the Palestinian uprising began in September of that year, both sides took an immediate economic hit, but for the Palestinians, the downward spiral has yet to end. 
 Israeli security forces greatly increased the web of restrictions in the Palestinian areas to prevent attacks, and the measures have also imposed great hardships on Palestinian economic life. The Palestinians grew increasingly dependent on aid as their access to Israel's economy dwindled. The problems worsened into crisis this year after Hamas came to power, and Israel began withholding Palestinian tax revenues and Western countries cut off direct aid to the Palestinian government. 
 The Palestinian per capita gross domestic product, which was about $1,800 annually at the beginning of the uprising, plummeted to $1,200 last year and continues to fall. 
 For Israelis, per capita gross domestic product has risen over the last six years from a little over $15,000 a year to around $18,000, according to government figures. 
 Israel turned the corner on a two-year recession in 2003, and for the past three years the economy has expanded at 4.4 percent to 5.2 percent annually, with a similar forecast for next year. The growth comes from technology, service and other modern industries, and trade mostly with the United States, Europe and East Asia. 
 Plagued by hyperinflation in the 1980s, Israel has an inflation rate hovering around zero percent this year, and it has been averaging less than 1 percent annually for the past five years. 
 The economic tide is not lifting every Israeli boat, however. Despite the economic growth, the number of Israelis living below the poverty level has been edging up, from 18 percent in 2002 to more than 20 percent last year, according to the government's National Insurance Institute.
 Critics say this is because Israelis who are struggling economically have seen their benefits fall sharply, while they remain unemployed. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in a decade, but still relatively high at 8.4 percent.
 Benjamin Netanyahu, who as finance minister pushed aggressive open-market policies from 2003 to 2005, was also widely criticized for cutting social programs in a country where couples often have many children and depend heavily on such subsidies.
 ''The basic problem is that economic growth has been very uneven,'' said Shlomo Swirski, the academic director of Adva, a research institute that focuses on the poor.
 Job growth, he said, has been concentrated in sectors that require a high level of education. Economic growth has been greatest in Tel Aviv and surrounding areas, the economic hub of the country, while the less developed Galilee in the north and Negev Desert in the south have seen much less progress, Mr. Swirski added.
 ''We're looking at growth that is highly concentrated geographically, economically and socially,'' he said.
 Economists note that many of the poor come from two groups, Israeli Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews, that have large families and low participation rates in the work force. Among Israeli Arabs, few women have formal jobs. Among the ultra-Orthodox, many men do not work.
 ''We still see a strong debate over income distribution,'' said David Levhari, an economics professor at Hebrew University. ''But overall, I think we're looking at an economy that should continue to do pretty well.''

HEADLINE: Where Developers Are Gambling on Gambling

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
DON'T look now, Las Vegas -- Macao is trying to steal your limelight. This former Portuguese colony on China's southeastern coast is in the midst of a gambling-driven transformation. Once a haven for savoring a colonial culture that developed over half a millennium, Macao is now being flooded with the familiar trappings of money and modernity.
 Gambling is nothing new to Macao. In 1961, Stanley Ho, an entrepreneur from Hong Kong, linked up with a few other investors to buy the colony's gaming franchise from the Portuguese government. Mr. Ho's group held that franchise until 2002, three years after Macao became part of China, when gambling was opened up to competition.
Soon, that competition will include more than a dozen new casino-hotels with well over 15,000 rooms, according to news releases and a report by organizers of Expo Real Asia, an international property conference. 
 The bulk of the new properties are being built by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation -- which already runs a casino on Macao's northern island -- along a stretch of the southern island called the Cotai strip. The hotels will bear names you know: Four Seasons, St. Regis, Shangri-La, Conrad and Raffles for the high rollers; Sheraton, Hilton, Fairmont and Traders for the rest. InterContinental, Mandarin Oriental and others are also planning new properties, as are some of the biggest names in Las Vegas: Macao's own Venetian and MGM Grand are to open next year.
 The first two heavy hitters to challenge Mr. Ho's flagship, the Casino Lisboa, have already arrived. Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas gambling magnate, opened the Wynn Macau on Sept. 6 on the Avenida de Amizade. Right next door, on Oct. 19, the Galaxy Entertainment Group of Hong Kong inaugurated the StarWorld.
 In style, the two properties could not be more different. The Wynn adopts a restrained (for a casino) aesthetic, with mild lighting even on the gaming floor and decor in beige and brown with occasional splashes of red. The small lobbies lead to a shopping promenade dotted with names like Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and Prada.
 At 600 square feet, the Wynn's rooms are cavernous. There are motorized drapes, sensor-operated snack racks, ministereos with iPod docks and many more gizmos. Luxuries in the enormous bathrooms, putting aside a perplexingly weak shower, include dual-fiber robes, fancy shaving kits and a deep-soaking tub.
 But the service, except in the well-staffed spa, leaves something to be desired. No army of liveried personnel descends to open taxi doors or to help guests with luggage, and check-in can be a chaotic affair. Quite a few of the young employees speak little or no English, with ''sparkling water'' and ''open for lunch?'' proving incomprehensible.
 A few steps away from the Wynn, whose architecture is a smaller copy of the property's curvy-roofed namesake in Las Vegas, is the far more avant-garde StarWorld. It's a stack of colorfully lit blocks of different sizes and designs, the brainchild of Rocco S. K. Yim, whose firm has several notable buildings in Hong Kong and mainland China to its credit.
 The contrast extends to the festive atmosphere in the lobby. Musicians mingle with leggy greeters in a gaping, gaudy lobby splashed with copper and gold like a Catskill resort. The casino above jangles with a sensory overload of lights and sounds.
 Rooms are smaller and cheaper at the StarWorld but still luxurious. The minibar is stocked for partying: energy drinks, throat lozenges and condoms along with Chinese favorites like dried cuttlefish and rice wine. Service is almost instantaneous, with a high level of English fluency.
 Not to be outdone, or at least not without a fight, Mr. Ho has also been investing in the new, modern Macao. His Casino Lisboa now houses Robuchon a Galera, an outpost of Joel Robuchon, the globetrotting French chef. And a structure that looks much like a giant celery stalk, the Grand Lisboa, is reaching into the sky behind its famous predecessor for an opening in 2008.
 Mr. Ho's company is also behind Macao's Fisherman's Wharf, a new commercial complex between the Sands and the ferry terminal. It's an almost theme park, with shops built into a low-lying village that changes its geography and century on every block, from ancient Rome to New Orleans' Bourbon Street -- anything but Macao. The complex also has an excellent Portuguese restaurant, Camoes, where patrons can dine outside at a mock colonial villa.
 There's no doubt that the casino boom and the economic effects of sitting on mainland China's doorstep are changing Macao. Just ask Baloy Velasco as he serves up hot chocolate, cakes and muffins at caffechocola, one of many recently opened cafes near the Largo do Senado, the hub of a flashy, pedestrians-only shopping area.
 Tourists used to come primarily from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, he said, but the casinos are drawing Europeans and Americans. Is it a change for the better? ''Of course,'' he said, adding that tourists have more money now. ''We can support the economy.''
 A couple of blocks away, past a bevy of American, Chinese and Japanese brands like Starbucks, McDonalds, Samuel & Kevin (clothing) and Milktop (ice cream), Pinto Livros has just opened a new music shop. The all-white space is home to a fabulously esoteric collection of compact discs, including the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Yuichiro Fujimoto and Charlotte Gainsbourg.
 Even as the casino boom helps new businesses to open, it also makes their managers' lives more difficult. ''Most people like me, we want to expand our businesses, but we can't find the people,'' said Keyvin Bi, general manager of if, or Inspiring Fascination, a boutique that opened in 2003 with urban-chic fashion from Europe and Asia.
 The casinos are hiring away young workers, he said, paying dealers more than double the salary he can offer for a shop assistant. Now he has to hire staff directly from China; their work permits don't allow them to switch jobs.
 That problem is only going to get worse, to judge by the development on the Cotai strip. Take a bus or taxi down to Taipa Village on the southern island, and walk down the pedestrianized Rua do Cunha just after 6 p.m. on a weekday evening. Cross Rua Correia da Silva, walk up Escada do Coxo and you'll find yourself in the midst of a milelong river of hardhat-carrying laborers streaming from the building sites.
 Looming over them, out of all human proportion, will be the gargantuan hulk of the Venetian. It blots out the sky -- just try to take a photograph! -- with a menacing cement silhouette only faintly lit by fluorescent construction lights. As the darkness of evening descends, few sights come closer to the postapocalyptic nightmares of Orwell's novels, Pink Floyd's videos or Terry Gilliam's films.
 On the way back, you might want to visit Valentina Comidas to console yourself with a warm, flaky rendition of the Portuguese egg tart. It's one holdover from Macao's past that hasn't been overwhelmed yet. In fact, there may even be more Portuguese eating them in the near future.
 ''Right before the handover and in the first few years, the number of Portuguese dropped by a substantial number, but lately we are witnessing an increased number of Portuguese coming back or coming for the first time to Macao,'' said Pedro Moitinho de Almeida, Portugal's consul general. ''Quite a few Portuguese will be interested to see what Macao is and what the Portuguese left behind.''
